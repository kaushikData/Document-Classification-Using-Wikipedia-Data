The [[City of Chicago]] and Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) of Chicago pioneered the '''311 Foreclosure Prevention Program''' as a consumer counseling and information service which helps [[homeowner]]s at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure, credit counseling and advocacy services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.311foreclosure.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027235012/http://311foreclosure.com/ |date=2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the cities of [[Baltimore]], and [[Dallas]] started similar programs to assist at-risk homeowners and protect the integrity of their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''A612 road''' is an A-class road in the United Kingdom running between [[Nottingham]] and [[Averham]], on the A617 near Newark. 

It starts in central Nottingham at a junction with the [[A60 road|A60]]. Initially running east, as Pennyfoot Street, before a right turn sees it head southwards onto Manvers Street, a 4 lane single carriageway which was formerly a B road ([[B roads in Zone 6 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B685]]). The road then crosses the main railway line out of Nottingham to the east over an early 1990s bridge (which again is 4 lane) before meeting Meadow Lane (here unclassified for approximately 100 metres, but further on the [[A roads in Zone 6 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A6011]]) at a triangular roundabout.

After leaving the roundabout the road is two-lane dual carriageway with a {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} speed limit for approximately {{convert|1000|yd|m}}. A further roundabout with Trent Street by a call centre for [[Virgin Media]] sees a change to 2 lane single carriageway, as it is for the remainder of its length, retaining the {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} limit. After a further roundabout at Nottingham Racecourse, the limit changes to the national speed limit of {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} until Colwick is reached, when it changes to {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}} to pass through a built up stretch.

Leaving [[Colwick]] the road becomes the Colwick Loop Road, which bypasses [[Netherfield, Nottinghamshire|Netherfield]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]] and [[Gedling]]. This section was also built national speed limit, but in May 2007 was reduced to {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} concurrent with the opening of the Gedling bypass, or as it was described in the plans, "Gedling Integrated Transport Scheme". The former section of Colwick Loop Road bypassed by the scheme is now mapped as the [[A6211 road|A6211]], but is unsigned at ground level. 

Rejoining the former route at a signalled T-junction, we enter [[Burton Joyce]]. Initially a {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} limit, approaching the village centre the limit is reduced to {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}}. Here, a 1930s bypass would previously have bypassed the bulk of the village but now almost bisects it, as development has spread across the road. Bypassing [[Bulcote]], the road is then {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} again as it opens out towards a roundabout junction with the [[A6097 road|A6097]] at [[Lowdham]].

After leaving Lowdham the road is again open single carriageway with a {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} limit. [[Gonalston]] is bypassed, and then we pass through [[Thurgarton]], up a steep hill before the road becomes {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} again. The road between Thurgarton and Southwell is relatively undulating and bendy.

Entering [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] from the south-west, passing the leisure centre, we then meet the B6386 at a T-junction where you need to turn off the A612 to stay on the numbered route. After passing the West gate to [[Southwell Minster]], the road turns right at a mini roundabout by the [[Saracen's Head]] public house and passes the north side of the Minster. A further sharp bend to the left allows us to pass another racecourse, this time [[Southwell Racecourse]], before exiting Southwell past the former workhouse which is now a museum.

Heading east through [[Upton, Newark and Sherwood|Upton]], past a property owned by the [[British Horological Society]], we meet the [[A617 road|A617]] near [[Averham]] at a signalled T-junction, signalling the end of the route.

Plans have been drawn up by [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] to bypass Southwell. The plans have existed since before 1990. The County Council has acquired a number of parcels of land in the line of the plan. However, considerable opposition is building up to the plan. Southwell residents are arguing that the 'line' of the bypass will become a new edge of town, and allow considerable expansion of the urban edge of the town, into the sensitive southern aspect. This is the view which includes the historic town centre and views of the [[Southwell Minster]].

New traffic measures are suggested as an alternative to reduce through traffic, such as an HGV ban except for access, and downgrading this inappropriate route from Lowdham to Newark, to B road status. Through traffic should be directed at [[Lowdham]] and [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] to the newly dualled [[A46 road (England)|A46]].

== Former routes ==

*The 1922 designation of the A612 had the terminus on the A617 in Southwell, not Averham. The latter passed through [[Farnsfield]], [[Edingley]] and [[Halam, Nottinghamshire|Halam]], before meeting the A612 in Southwell and continuing through Upton to Newark.
*Through Nottingham, the A612 (until the Manvers Street bridge was opened in the early 1990s) passed through [[Sneinton]], Carlton and Gedling, along what is now the B686.
*In 2007, following the opening of the Gedling bypass, the bypassed section became A6211 then unclassified. The former route under the railway bridge, and a length of Stoke Lane, are closed to through traffic by using bus plugs. These are traffic signals permanently on a red light unless a bus is passing through it. The restriction has caused controversy amongst local residents especially in the ''[[Nottingham Evening Post]]''.
*In 2011 The 'Bus Plugs' were opened to normal traffic. The traffic signals are still present but change when any vehicle approaches them.

The reopening of the bus plug still causes controversy with many Councillors and locals questioning the validity

'''Athene Glacier''' ({{coord|68|56|S|64|0|W|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]], {{convert|10|mi}} long, flowing east and merging with the terminus of [[Casey Glacier]] where it discharges into [[Casey Inlet]], on the east coast of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. It was photographed from the air by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (FIDS) in August 1947, and by the [[Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition]] ([[Trimetrogon]] air photography) in December 1947. It was surveyed by FIDS in November 1960, and was named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] after '''Athene''' ([[Athena]]), the daughter of [[Zeus]] and goddess of the city of [[Athens]] in [[Greek mythology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4279">'''''Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space''''' ('''ACES''') is a project led by the [[European Space Agency]] which will place ultra-stable [[atomic clock]]s on the [[International Space Station]]. Operation in the [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]] environment of the ISS will provide a stable and accurate time base for different areas of research, including [[general relativity]] and [[string theory]] tests, time and frequency [[metrology]], and very long baseline [[interferometry]].

The payload actually contains two clocks: a [[Caesium standard|caesium]] laser cooled [[atomic clock]] (PHARAO) developed by [[CNES]], France for long-term stability and an active [[hydrogen maser]] (SHM) developed by Spectratime, Switzerland for short-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectratime.com/uploads/documents/ispace/ESA_CAS_Legacy_Appln.pdf|title=Swiss Space Atomic Clock Technologies and Applications in Space Science|publisher=SpectraTime|date=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The onboard frequency comparison between PHARAO and SHM will be a key element for the evaluation of the accuracy and the short/medium-term stability of the PHARAO clock. Further, it will allow to identify the optimal operating conditions for PHARAO and to select a compromise between frequency accuracy and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectratime.com/uploads/documents/ispace/ESA_CAS_Legacy_Appln.pdf|title=Swiss Space Atomic Clock Technologies and Applications in Space Science|publisher=SpectraTime|date=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mission will also be a test-bed for the space qualification of the active hydrogen maser SHM. After optimisation performances in the {{nowrap|2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}} range  for  both  frequency  instability  and  inaccuracy  are intended.

The '''Bactrian camel''' (''Camelus bactrianus'') is a large, [[even-toed ungulate]] native to the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]]. The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped [[dromedary]] camel.&lt;ref&gt;The [[mnemonic]] that allows one to remember the correct English word for each is: "Bactrian" begins with "B", and "Dromedary" begins with "D" – and "B" on its side has two humps, whilst "D" on its side has only one hump.&lt;/ref&gt; Its population of two million exists mainly in the [[Domestication|domesticated]] form.&lt;ref name=EDGE&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=8 |title= Bactrian Camel| website= EdgeofExistence.org| publisher= EDGE| year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their name comes from the ancient historical region of [[Bactria]].&lt;ref name="netindustries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1151/Camels-Old-world-camels.html|title=Camels – Old World Camels|publisher=Net Industries|work=Science Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domesticated Bactrian camel has served as a [[pack animal]] in inner Asia since ancient times.

The Bactrian camel shares the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Camelus]]'' with the [[dromedary]] (''C. dromedarius'') and the [[wild Bactrian camel]] (''C. ferus''). The Bactrian camel belongs to the family [[Camelidae]].&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Artiodactyla | id = 14200112 | page = 645–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groves|first1=C.|last2=Grubb|first2=P.|authorlink1=Colin Groves|authorlink2=Peter Grubb (zoologist)|title=Ungulate Taxonomy|year=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0093-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] was the first to [[species description|describe]] the species of ''Camelus'': in his 4th century BC ''[[History of Animals]]'' he identified the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Buffon|first1=C.|authorlink=Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|title=Natural History, General and Particular|date=1791|publisher=Alexander Strahan|page=121|location=London, UK|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/77169#page/135/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first1=W.|last2=Anthon|first2=C.|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|year=1870|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Brothers Publishers]]|location=New York, USA|edition=3rd|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bactrian camel was given its current binomial name ''Camelus bactrianus'' by Swedish zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1758 publication ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''.&lt;ref name=SN&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linnaeus|first1=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturæ Per Regna Tria Naturae|date=1758|publisher=Laurentius Salvius|location=Stockholm, Sweden|page=65|edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th]]|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Peng Cui (of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]) and colleagues carried out a [[phylogenetic]] study of the evolutionary relationships between the two [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]] of Camelidae: [[Camelini]] — consisting of the three ''Camelus'' species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a [[subspecies]] of the Bactrian camel) — and [[Lamini]] — consisting of the [[alpaca]] (''Vicugna pacos''), the [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), the [[llama]] (''L. glama'') and the [[vicuña]] (''V. vicugna''). The study revealed that the two tribes had [[genetic divergence|diverged]] 25 million years ago (early [[Miocene]]), notably earlier than what had been previously estimated from North American fossils. [[Speciation]] began first in Lamini as the alpaca came into existence 10 million years ago (late [[Pleistocene]]). Nearly two million years later, the Bactrian camel and the dromedary emerged as two independent species.&lt;ref name="cui2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cui|first1=P.|last2=Ji|first2=R.|last3=Ding|first3=F.|last4=Qi|first4=D.|last5=Gao|first5=H.|last6=Meng|first6=H.|last7=Yu|first7=J.|last8=Hu|first8=S.|last9=Zhang|first9=H.|title=A complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (''Camelus bactrianus ferus''): an evolutionary history of Camelidae|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2007|volume=8|issue=1|pages=241|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-8-241|url=http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-8-241|pmid=17640355|pmc=1939714}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bactrian camel and the dromedary often interbreed to produce [[fertility|fertile]] offspring. Where the ranges of the two species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Iran and Afghanistan, the [[phenotypic]] differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding between them. The fertility of their [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] has given rise to speculation that the Bactrian camel and the dromedary should be merged into a single species with two varieties.&lt;ref name="camel"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP013.pdf|title=The Camel (''Camelus dromedarius''): A Bibliographical Review|last=Mukasa-Mugerwa|first=E.|publisher=[[International Livestock Centre for Africa]]|year=1981|location=Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|pages=1–147}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1994 analysis of the [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome b]] [[gene]] revealed that the species display 10.3% divergence in their [[DNA sequencing|sequences]].&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kadwell|first2=M.|last3=Wheeler|first3=J.C.|date=1994|title=Molecular evolution of the family Camelidae: a mitochondrial DNA study|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=256|issue=1345|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0041|last1=Stanley|first1=H.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences from wild Bactrian camels ===
The [[wild Bactrian camel]] (''Camelus ferus'') was first described by [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]] in the late 19th century and has now been established as a distinct species from the Bactrian camel (''Camelus bactrianus)''.&lt;ref name= GStatus&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Burger| first1= P.| last2= Silbermayr| first2= K.| last3= Charruau| first3= P.| last4= Lipp| first4= L.| last5= Dulamtseren| first5= E.| last6= Yadmasuren| first6= A.| last7= Walzer| first7= C. |publisher= ''in press''| title= Genetic status of wild camels (''Camelus ferus'') in Mongolia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= GDiv2014&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Chuluunbat| first1= B.| last2= Charruau| first2= P.| last3= Silbermayr| first3= K.| last4= Khorloojav| first4= T. | last5= Burger| first5= P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zoological opinion nowadays tends to favour the idea that ''C. bactrianus'' and ''C. dromedarius'' are descendants of two different subspecies of ''C. ferus'' (Peters and von den Driesch 1997: 652) and there is no evidence to suggest that the original range of ''C. ferus'' included those parts of Central Asia and Iran where some of the earliest Bactrian remains have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Potts (2004), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In particular, a population of wild Bactrian camel has been discovered to live within a part of the Gashun Gobi region of the [[Gobi Desert]]. This population is distinct from domesticated herds both in [[Genome|genetic makeup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Wild camels 'genetically unique'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8151000/8151804.stm |date= &lt;!- – 11:09 GMT --&gt; 22 July 2009|work= Earth News|publisher= BBC |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in behavior.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

As many as three regions in the genetic makeup are distinctly different from Bactrian camels, with up to a 3% difference in the base genetic code. However, with so few wild camels, what the natural genetic diversity within a population would have been is not clear.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Another difference is the ability of these wild camels to drink saltwater slush, although whether the camel can extract useful water from it is not yet certain. Domesticated camels are unable to drink such salty water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Wild Camel Protection Foundation| title = Wild Camels| accessdate = 7 December 2012| url = http://www.wildcamels.com/bactrian-camels/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus).JPG|thumb|left|240px|Detail of feet]]
The Bactrian camel is the largest mammal in its native range and is the largest living camel. Shoulder height is from {{convert|180|to|230|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, head-and-body length is {{convert|225|-|350|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, and the tail length is {{convert|35|-|55|cm|in|abbr=on}}. At the top of the humps, the average height is {{convert|213|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Body mass can range from {{convert|300|to|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with males often being much larger and heavier than females.&lt;ref name= EDGE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/camelus_bactrianus.html |title= Bactrian Camel| website= UltimateUngulate.com| date= | publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its long, wooly coat varies in colour from dark brown to sandy beige. A mane and beard of long hair occurs on the neck and throat, with hairs measuring up to {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The shaggy winter coat is shed extremely rapidly, with huge sections peeling off at once, appearing as if sloppily shorn. The two humps on the back are composed of fat (not water as is sometimes thought). The face is typical of a camelid, being long and somewhat triangular, with a split upper lip. The long eyelashes, along with the sealable nostrils, help to keep out dust in the frequent sandstorms which occur in their natural range. The two broad toes on each foot have undivided soles and are able to spread widely as an adaptation to walking on sand. The feet are very tough, as befits an animal of extreme environments.

== Natural habitat ==
These camels are migratory, and their habitat ranges from rocky mountain massifs to flat arid desert, stony plains, and sand dunes. Conditions are extremely harsh – vegetation is sparse, water sources are limited and temperatures are extreme, ranging from as low as −40&amp;nbsp;°C in winter to 40&amp;nbsp;°C in summer. The camels’ distribution is linked to the availability of water, with large groups congregating near rivers after rain or at the foot of the mountains, where water can be obtained from springs in the summer months, and in the form of snow during the winter.

== Life history ==
Bactrian camels are exceptionally adept at withstanding wide variations in temperature, ranging from freezing cold to blistering heat. They have a remarkable ability to go without water for months at a time, but when water is available they may drink up to 57 liters at once. When well fed, the humps are plump and erect, but as resources decline, the humps shrink and lean to the side. When moving faster than a [[Horse gait#Walk|walking]] speed, they [[pacing (horse gait)|pace]], by stepping forwards with both legs on the same side (as opposed to [[trot]]ting, using alternate diagonals as done by most other quadrupeds). Speeds of up to {{Convert|65|kph}} have been recorded, but they rarely move this fast.  Bactrian camels are also said to be good swimmers. The sense of sight is well developed and the sense of smell is extremely good. The lifespan of Bactrian camels is estimated at up to 50 years, often 20 to 40 in captivity.

=== Diet ===
Bactrian camels are diurnal, sleeping in the open at night and foraging for food during the day. They are primarily herbivorous. With tough mouths that can withstand sharp objects such as thorns, they are able to eat plants that are dry, prickly, salty or bitter, and can ingest virtually any kind of vegetation. When other nutrient sources are not available, these camels may feed on carcasses, gnawing on bones, skin, or various different kinds of flesh. In more extreme conditions, they may eat any material they find, which has included rope, sandals, and even tents. Their ability to feed on a wide range of foods allows them to live in areas with sparse vegetation. The first time food is swallowed, it is not fully chewed. The partly masticated food (called cud) goes into the stomach and later is brought back up for further chewing.

Bactrian camels belong to a fairly small group of animals that regularly eat snow to provide their water needs. Any animals living above the snowline are obliged to do this, as snow and ice are the only forms of water during winter, and by doing so, their range is greatly enlarged. The [[latent heat]] of snow and ice is enormous compared with the [[heat capacity]] of water, demanding a large sacrifice in heat energy and forcing animals to eat only small amounts at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/beef/facts/09-065.pdf |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Replacing Water with Clean Snow for Ewes and Beef Cows |first1=C. |last1=Wand |first2=C. |last2=Richardson |number=09-065 AGDEX 424/433 |date=November 2009 |access-date=February 9, 2017 |website=OMAFRA.gov.on.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111550/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/beef/facts/09-065.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Bactrian camels are [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]]&amp;nbsp;— they [[Ovulation|ovulate]] after insemination (insertion of semen into the [[vagina]]); the seminal plasma, not the [[spermatozoa]], induces ovulation. Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 h and the rest by 48 h (the same as natural mating). The least amount of [[semen]] required to elicit ovulation is about 1.0 ml.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|year=1985|title=Semen-induced ovulation in the bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/74/2/335.full.pdf |journal=J. Reprod. Fertil.|volume=74|issue=2|pages=335–339|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0740335|author=Chen, B.X.|author2=Yuen, Z.X.|author3=Pan, G.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males during mating time are often quite violent and may bite, spit, or attempt to sit on other male camels. The age of [[sexual maturity]] varies, but is usually reached at 3 to 5 years. Gestation lasts around 13 months. One or occasionally two calves are produced, and the female can give birth to a new calf every other year. Young Bactrian camels are [[precocial]], being able to stand and run shortly after birth, and are fairly large at an average birth weight of {{convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They are nursed for about 1.5 years. The young calf stays with its mother for three to five years, until it reaches sexual maturity, and often serves to help raise subsequent generations for those years. Wild camels sometimes breed with domesticated or feral camels.

== Relationship to humans ==
[[File:Bactrian.camel.twice.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Two Bactrian camels]]
The Bactrian camel is thought to have been domesticated (independent of the dromedary) sometime before 2500 BC in Northeast [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9018795 "camel"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2007. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online. accessed 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or southwestern [[Turkestan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehatchreport.com/information/myths-about-camels.html Myths About Camels], ''The Hatch Report.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dromedary camel is believed to have been domesticated between 4000 BC and 2000 BC in [[Arabia]]. As pack animals, these ungulates are virtually unsurpassed, able to carry {{convert|170|-|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at a rate of 47&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles) per day, or 4&amp;nbsp;km/h (2&amp;nbsp;mph) over a period of four days. Furthermore, Bactrian camels are frequently ridden, especially in desertified areas. In ancient [[Sindh]], for example, Bactrian camels of two humps were initially used by the rich for riding. The camel was later brought to other areas such as Balochistan and Iran for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai; Janat ul Sindh 3rd edition 1993; Sindhi Adbi Board Jamshoro,page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Bactrian camels have been the focus of artwork throughout history. For example, western foreigners from the [[Tarim Basin]] and elsewhere were depicted in [[:File:Westerner on a camel.jpg|numerous ceramic figurines]] of the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).

=== United States imports ===
Bactrian camels were imported to the US several times in the mid- to late 1800s, both by the US military and by merchants and miners, looking for pack animals sturdier and hardier than horses and mules. Although the camels met these needs, the [[United States Camel Corps]] was never considered much of a success. Having brought two shipments of fewer than 100 camels to the US, plans were made to import another 1,000, but the [[US Civil War]] interrupted this. Most surviving camels of these endeavors, both military and private, were merely turned loose to survive in the wild. As a result, small feral herds of Bactrian camels existed during the late 19th century in the southwest deserts of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Zentner experiment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertusa.com/animals/desert-camel-experiment.html|title=The Desert Camel Experiment|last=Zentner|first=Joe|publisher=DesertUSA.com and Digital West Media, Inc.|access-date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
* ''[[The Story of the Weeping Camel]]'' is a [[2003 in film|2003]] [[Mongolia]]n documentary/story about a family of nomadic shepherds trying to get a white calf accepted by his mother, which rejected him after a difficult birth.

'''Bowers Piedmont Glacier''' is a [[piedmont glacier]] on the coast of [[Victoria Land]], covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}} and lying just south of [[New Harbour (Antarctica)|New Harbour]]. It merges at its south side with [[Blue Glacier (Antarctica)|Blue Glacier]]. 

It was discovered by the [[British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901–04]], but not named until the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13]], when [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] named it for Lieutenant [[Henry R. Bowers]], who perished with [[Robert F. Scott]] on the return journey from the [[South Pole]].

The Pacific Community's '''Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT)''', formerly known as the Regional Germplasm Centre (RGC), is a propagation material vault operated by the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]] (SPC)'s Land Resources Division. Its purpose is to preserve resources including crops, and other plants of the Pacific region. The vault is in [[Fiji]], and it replaced many local seed vaults of the Pacific that had trouble with maintenance.

This center is vested in using cutting edge plant [[cryopreservation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Normah|first1=M. N.|last2=Chin|first2=H.

'''''Confessions of an Eco-Warrior''''' is a book written in 1991 by [[Dave Foreman]].

Dave Foreman was the [[New Mexico]] lobbyist for [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]] in the 1970s.  Disillusioned by the lack of progress in safeguarding the environment in the United States, particularly after a wilderness inventory by the [[United States Forest Service]] known as [[RARE II]] (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation), he was a co-founder of the environmental organization known as [[Earth First!]] (EF) in the 1980s.  EF originally mixed innovative publicity, such as rolling a plastic "crack" down [[Glen Canyon Dam]], with far-reaching [[wilderness]] proposals that went far beyond what the mainstream environmental groups were willing to advocate, and with [[conservation biology]] research from a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] perspective.  Later however, after about 1987, EF became primarily associated with non-violent [[direct action]] activities.

Foreman took his inspiration for Earth First! from [[Edward Abbey]]'s book ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' which is a fictional account of a gang of four individuals who take on a pointless yet deeply symbolic effort to destroy and thus halt the machines of human expansion and putative "progress" in the American Southwest.

In 1989 Foreman was implicated in the FBI conspiracy known as [[THERMCON]] wherein four activists in [[Prescott, Arizona]], who were only peripherally connected with EF, were enticed by undercover FBI agent Michael Fain (alias Mike Tait) who talked them into the destruction of a power line in the State of Arizona.  Foreman himself wasn't involved.  However he was arrested and indicted along with the four.

His book ''Confessions of an Eco-Warrior'' is partly an autobiographical account of RARE II and his disillusionment with the mainstream environmental movement, the early years of Earth First!, the FBI entrapment, and his ultimate disillusionment with what Earth First! became.  It is also partly a statement of his views on wilderness and the state of the environmental movement.

In the book he expressed his view that Earth First!, by 1990, had largely run its course, and was starting to attract new members who took the group in a more [[Counterculture|countercultur]]al and left-wing direction than he was comfortable associating with.  The defining moments for Foreman, according to the book, were when some activists under the Earth First! banner held a "puke-in" at a shopping mall, when Edward Abbey was subjected to harsh criticism and heckling by some younger newcomers to EF when he attended the 1987 EF rendezvous (Foreman and the other old guard of EF, who revered Abbey, were horrified that he would receive that sort of treatment at an EF gathering), and when some Earth First! funds were diverted to launch a punk-style zine called "Live Wild or Die", which among other things espoused [[anarchism]] and attacked Foreman's and Abbey's views on some controversial issues then being debated within EF.

While Foreman and most of the rest of the old guard of EF severed their ties to the group in 1990, he remains an environmental activist.  At the time ''Confessions'' was published, he had just launched a new magazine, ''[[Wild Earth]]'' (intended as a replacement for the 1980s-era ''Earth First! Journal''), and was soon to launch a new environmental group, [[The Wildlands Project]].

'''Coolitude''' is a term coined by Mauritian poet [[Khal Torabully]] to describe the cultural interaction of the [[India]]n or [[Chinese people|Chinese]] "[[coolie]]" [[diaspora]], and by extension also similar migrations. It refers to a transcultural process, articulating imaginaries and [[cultures]] in non-[[essentialist]] ways.

The '''ecoDemonstrator Program''' is a [[flight test]] [[research and development|research]] program of aircraft company [[Boeing]], which has used a series of specially modified aircraft to develop and test aviation technologies designed to improve [[fuel economy in aircraft|fuel economy]] and reduce the [[noise]] and [[ecological footprint]] of airliners. {{As of|December 2015}}, over fifty technologies had been tested under the program.&lt;ref name="kowal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kowal|first1=Jessica|last2=Jensen|first2=Bret|title=Backgrounder: The Boeing ecoDemonstrator Program|url=http://www.boeing.com/resources/.../pdf/Backgrounder_ecoDemonstrator.PDF|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=16 June 2016|date=December 2015}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ecoDemonstrator Program followed Boeing's Quiet Technology Demonstrator program, which operated between 2001 and 2005 to develop a quieter engine using [[chevron (aeronautics)|chevron]]s on the rear of the [[nacelle]] and exhaust [[nozzle]]s. These chevrons were later adopted on the [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="kowal"/&gt;

The ecoDemonstrator Program was formally launched in 2011, in partnership with [[American Airlines]] and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. {{As of|December 2015}}, the ecoDemonstrator program has used three aircraft as [[testbed]]s. The first, a [[737-800]] owned by [[American Airlines]], was used in 2012 to test over 15 technologies. The second aircraft, a company-owned [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787-8 Dreamliner]], was used to test over 25 technologies. In 2015, a [[Boeing 757|757]] was used to test over 15 technologies, in cooperation with [[NASA]] and the [[TUI Group]].

===ecoDemonstrator 737 (2012)===
Using a [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Next Generation]] [[Boeing 737-800|737-800]], Boeing demonstrated [[laminar flow]] technology for [[Wingtip device|winglet]]s, improving fuel efficiency by 1.8 percent. The aircraft tested other technologies, including:&lt;ref name="kowal"/&gt;
* Active engine [[vibration control]]
* Blended [[biofuel]]
* [[Engineering optimization|Optimized]] flight [[trajectory|trajectories]]
* Regenerative hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s
* A variable-area [[turbofan|fan]] nozzle
* Carpeting made from recycled materials

===ecoDemonstrator 787 (2014)===
Boeing began testing in mid-2014 using a company-owned [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787-8 Dreamliner]] (variable number ZA004, [[aircraft registration|tail number]] N7874),&lt;ref name="uresh"&gt;{{citation|last1=Uresh|chapter=787 Production and Disposition|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FH3Y2-vRUgojntPkCSJI5Pd-15rsJ1a0SFCRaT-iqgo/pub|title=All Things 787|chapter-url=http://nyc787.blogspot.com/|accessdate=16 June 2016|chapter-format=Google Docs spreadsheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="planespotters2"&gt;{{cite web|title=N7874 Boeing Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner - cn 40693 / 4|url=https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/Boeing/787/40693/N7874-Boeing|website=Planespotters.net|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with the FAA's [[Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise]] (CLEEN) program, NASA's [[Environmentally Responsible Aviation]] (ERA) Project, and commercial partners including [[Japan Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]], [[Honeywell]], [[Rockwell Collins]], [[General Electric]], and [[Panasonic]]. Tested technologies included:&lt;ref name="kowal"/&gt;
*A [[ceramic matrix composite]] engine nozzle, allowing a higher engine temperature
*Fuel containing 15% [[green diesel]] and 85% petroleum-derived [[jet fuel]]
*Improvements to [[aerodynamics]] and [[flight control]]s
*[[Anti-icing]] wing coatings
*[[Touchscreen]] displays in the [[flight deck]]
*[[Carbon fiber]] outer wing access doors
*[[Wireless sensor network|Wireless sensors]] to reduce [[electrical wiring|wiring]] weight
*NASA's Airborne Spacing for Terminal Arrival Routes (ASTAR) system, intended to allow increased landing frequencies
*Other software and network technologies to optimize flight planning and fuel loading

===ecoDemonstrator 757 (2015)===
The third aircraft in the ecoDemonstrator Program, a [[Boeing 757|757-222]] (tail number N757ET)&lt;ref name="planespotters"&gt;{{cite web|title=N757ET Boeing Boeing 757-222 - cn 24627 / 263|url=https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/Boeing/757/24627/N757ET-Boeing|website=Planespotters.net|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by [[Stifel]]'s aircraft finance division, began flights in March 2015. The aircraft was painted in the [[aircraft livery|livery]] of the [[TUI Group]], which collaborated on the program. Tested technologies included:&lt;ref name="kowal"/&gt;

*Technologies to improve [[laminar flow]], including a "[[Krueger flap|Krueger shield]]" to protect the leading edges of the wings from insects
*[[Active flow control]] on the [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical tail]] (tested with NASA under contract for NASA's ERA Project). NASA [[wind tunnel]] testing suggest that active flow control could provide a 17% improvement in rudder efficiency, allowing for smaller tails.&lt;ref name="Barnstorff"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnstorff|first1=Kathy|title=NASA Tests Green Aviation Technology on Boeing ecoDemonstrator|url=http://www.nasa.gov/aero/nasa-tests-green-aviation-technology-on-boeing-ecodemonstrator.html|accessdate=16 June 2016|agency=NASA|date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Insect-resistant wing coatings to improve laminar flow (tested with NASA under contract for NASA's ERA Project). For this testing, the aircraft was operated from [[Shreveport Regional Airport]], which was selected for its high insect population, among other factors.&lt;ref name="Barnstorff"/&gt;
*[[Photovoltaics|Solar]] and thermal energy collecting systems, used to power dimmable cabin windows

Following the test campaign, the aircraft was demolished, and Boeing reported that 90% of its material was reused or recycled.&lt;ref name="kowal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gates|first1=Dominic|title=Boeing 757 chewed up, smashed for recycling|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/757-readied-for-recyling/|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Ernst Ludwig Krause''' also known under the pen-name '''Carus Sterne''' (22 November 1839 in
[[Zielenzig]], – 24 August 1903 in [[Eberswalde]]) was a [[Germany|German]] biologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wissenschaftspopularisierung im 19.

Initially a student of [[pharmacy]], he later studied [[natural sciences]] at the [[University of Berlin]]. After graduation, he devoted himself to independent scientific research. He was a prominent and successful champion of [[Darwinism]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKE7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA602 Google Books] Deutsche Apotheker-Zeitung, Volume 18&lt;/ref&gt; He also maintained an extensive correspondence with Germany's most outspoken popular Darwinist, [[Ernst Haeckel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daum|first=Andreas W|date=1995|title=Naturwissenschaftlicher Journalismus im Dienst der darwinistischen Weltanschauung: Ernst Krause alias Carus Sterne, Ernst Haeckel und die Zeitschrift Kosmos|url=|journal=Mauritiana (Altenburg)|volume=15|pages=227–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3831">{{distinguish|farad}}
The '''Faraday constant''', denoted by the symbol {{math|''F''}} and sometimes stylized as ℱ, is named after [[Michael Faraday]]. In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], this constant represents the magnitude of [[electric charge]] per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The term "magnitude" is used in the sense of "[[absolute value]]": The charge of an electron is negative, but ''F'' is always defined to be positive.&lt;/ref&gt; It has the currently accepted value 
:{{physconst|F|unit=no|after=&amp;nbsp;C mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.}} &lt;!--template produces incorrect unit "mol", hence override--&gt;

This constant has a simple relation to two other physical constants:
:&lt;math&gt;F\,=\,eN_{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:{{physconst|e|symbol=yes|round=auto|after=;}}
:{{physconst|NA|symbol=yes|round=auto|after=.}}
''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]] (the ratio of the number of particles, ''N'', which is unitless, to the amount of substance, ''n'', in units of moles), and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] or the magnitude of the charge of an electron.  This relation holds because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in ''one'' electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole.

One common use of the Faraday constant is [[electrolysis]]. One can divide the amount of charge in [[coulomb]]s by the Faraday constant in order to find the amount (in moles) of the element that has been [[Oxidation|oxidized]].

The value of ''F'' was first determined by weighing the amount of [[silver]] deposited in an electrochemical reaction in which a measured [[Current (electricity)|current]] was passed for a measured time, and using [[Faraday's law of electrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/historical1.html NIST Introduction to physical constants]&lt;/ref&gt; Research is continuing into more accurate ways of determining the interrelated constants ''F'', ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''e''.

==Other common units==
* 96,485 J (96.485 kJ) per volt gram equivalent
* 23.061 kcal per volt gram equivalent
* 26.801 A·h/mol

==Faraday unit of charge==

Related to Faraday's constant is the "faraday", a unit of [[electrical charge]]. It is much less common than the [[coulomb]], but sometimes used in electrochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r-Qpy0KQayIC&amp;pg=PA51 ''Foundations Of Physics, Volume 2'', by R. S. Gambhir, 1993, p. 51]&lt;/ref&gt; One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons, i.e. {{physconst|F|unit=no|after=&amp;nbsp;[[coulomb|C]].}}

Expressed in faradays, the Faraday constant ''F'' equals "1 faraday of charge per mole".

This faraday unit is not to be confused with the [[farad]], an unrelated unit of [[capacitance]] ({{nowrap|1=1 farad = 1 coulomb / 1 volt}}).

==Popular media==
''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Dark Knight Court]]" (RABF10) has [[Mr. Burns]] asking [[Comic Book Guy]] how much he wants for his entire comic book inventory.  He says "the speed of light expressed as dollars" and Mr. Burns tells Smithers to "just give him Faraday's Constant."  The check is written for $96,485.34.

The ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' episode "[[The Constant]]" featured the character [[Daniel Faraday]], and a concept introduced in the episode was finding an anchor to allow time travelers to stay oriented. This anchor was termed a "constant," and the episode prominently featured Daniel Faraday's constant.

'''HL23V''' was reputedly a type C [[RNA]] [[tumor virus]] first isolated in 1975 from [[cell culture|cultured]] human [[acute myelogenous leukaemia]] [[peripheral blood]] [[leukocytes]], which would have been the first cancer-causing retrovirus isolated from human sera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Nature|title = Characterisation of a virus (HL23V) isolated from cultured acute myelogenous leukaemic cells|last8 = Gallagher|last7 = Gallo|volume = 260|issue = 5548|pmid = 176596|year = 1976|pages = 266–268|doi = 10.1038/260266a0|last6 = Spiegelman|last2 = Peters|last1 = Chan|last3 = Sweet|last4 = Ohno|last5 = Kufe | first1 = E. | first2 = W. | first3 = R. | first4 = T. | first5 = D. | first6 = S. | first7 = R. | first8 = R.|bibcode = 1976Natur.260..266C }}; {{Cite journal | year = 1975 | pages = 350–3 | pmid = 46123 | doi = 10.1126/science.46123| format= PDF| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/187/4174/350.pdf | issue = 4174 | volume = 187 | last2 = Gallo | first1 = R. | first2 = R. | title = Type C RNA tumor virus isolated from cultured human acute myelogenous leukemia cells | journal = Science | last1 = Gallagher|bibcode = 1975Sci...187..350G }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later shown to be a laboratory contaminant of three monkey viruses.  The journal ''Nature'', which had published the original research, later retracted the article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">'''Harkhebi''' (ca. 300 BC) was an [[astronomy|astronomer]] who lived in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] during the rule of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. He was known as the priest of Selket (the stargazer). He specialized in the treatment of snake bites and scorpion stings. He also kept record of day and night, tracking the rising and setting of the sun. This then predicted he was evident in 1872 B.C. from the temple of Illahun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian Science: Volume 2: Calendars, clocks, and Astronomy|last=Clagett|first=Marshall|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87169-214-6|location=Philadelphia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He may have based many of his observations on earlier [[Babylonia]]n contributions to astronomy. A funereal [[statue]]&lt;ref&gt;Claget, op.cit. pp.489ff.&lt;/ref&gt; associated with him is known with an inscription in which he describes himself as an expert on observing [[star]]s.[http://egipto.com/personajes_del_antiguo_egipto/Astronomos/Harkhebi_219.html]. He referred to the planets as "the gods who foretell the future" and claimed to know everything Sirius predicted, but apparently  did not write personal horoscopes.&lt;ref&gt;Noegel et al., op.cit., pp.143f&lt;/ref&gt;

The lunar crater [[Harkhebi (crater)|Harkhebi]] is named after him. Half of the Lunar Crater is on top of the large walled plain Fabry. This is on the north-northeast side of Fabry. On the other half, the northwest half, Vashakidze, a smaller crater than Fabry, lies. And on the Southwest is Vestine, and Richardson on the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babylon-software.com/definition/Harkhebi%20%28crater%29/|title=Harkhebi (crater)|last=|first=|date=|website=babylon-software.com|publisher=Babylon|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harkhebi predicted the weather patterns of the heliacal risings of the fixed stars. He refers the winds and the omens' to is prediction of meteorology. While Harkhebi was observing the north and south motions of the sun and Venus, he concluded that the Babylonians has some affiliation with the weather phenomena in ''Enuma Anu Enil.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Astronomy, Weather, and Calendars in the Ancient World|last=Lehoux|first=Daryn|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-85181-7|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaSlwqwe4iEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A selection of instruments and artifacts from the collection is on permanent display in the Putnam Gallery on the first floor of the [[Harvard Science Center]], which is free and open to the public on weekdays. In addition, rotating temporary exhibitions drawn from the collection are shown in the Special Exhibitions Gallery on the second floor, and a more modest Foyer Gallery space on the third floor.&lt;ref name="CHSI" /&gt;

One of the larger items in the collection is the [[Harvard Mark I]], a historic room-sized [[electromechanical]] [[computer]] commissioned in 1944,  which is now permanently exhibited next to the central stairwell in the main lobby of the Science Center.

The collection continues to be expanded, under the supervision of a Director and several curators and technicians. Originally a part of the [[Harvard Library]] system, the CHSI is now affiliated with the Harvard Department of the History of Science, and is one of the four Harvard Museums of Science and Culture.&lt;ref name="Affiliations"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHSI Affiliations|url=http://chsi.harvard.edu/about/affiliations|website=Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1102">A '''hesternal tense''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''hest'''}}) is a [[past tense]] for the previous day. (''Hesterno die'' is [[Latin]] for 'yesterday'.)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''In Catilinam II''; Catullus, 50; Augustine, Sermon 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hesternal tense refers to an event which occurred yesterday (in an absolute tense system) or on the preceding day (in a [[relative tense]] system). A '''pre-hesternal''' tense refers to an event which occurred prior to yesterday or the previous day. Hesternal tense is reported, for example in the [[Fyam language|Fyam]] or Fyem language of northern Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nettle, ''The Fyem Language of Northern Nigeria'', LINCOM Europa 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Hesternal tense may also be used to denote a tense for any time prior to the current day – that is, to mean pre-[[hodiernal tense|hodiernal]].&lt;ref&gt;Earl W. Stevick, ''Adapting and writing language lessons'', U.S. Foreign Service Institute, 1971, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hexapod-Telescope''' (HPT) is a telescope located at [[Cerro Armazones Observatory]] in northern [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=HPT /&gt;  The {{convert|1.5|m|in}} [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope|Ritchey-Chrétien]] [[reflecting telescope]] is notable for the design of [[telescope mount]].  Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes, the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts, an arrangement known as a [[Stewart platform]].  This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity.&lt;ref name=2000CHIN /&gt;  As a result, the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high.  Furthermore, the six-leg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability.  The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapod-mounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts.

The mounting was designed by engineers of the company Vertex, in collaboration with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] (AIRUB) in Germany.&lt;ref name=2000CHIN /&gt;  Led by Prof. Rolf Chini, the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB. In 2006, it was moved to its new location on [[Cerro Armazones Observatory]] in the [[Atacama Desert]] in Chile. AIRUB, in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the [[Catholic University of the North]] (UCN), is developing an observatory there.  A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy, a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones.

Together with the [[Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl]], AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical (BESO) for the HPT.&lt;ref name=2006STEI /&gt;  It is a copy of the Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS) operated by the [[European Southern Observatory]].&lt;ref name=BESO /&gt;

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Hvplogo.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hvplogo.png for rationale --&gt;
The '''Human Variome Project''' ('''HVP''') is the global initiative to collect and curate all [[human]] [[genetic variation]] affecting human health.&lt;ref name="pmid17054407"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ring HZ, Kwok PY, Cotton RG |title=Human Variome Project: an international collaboration to catalogue human genetic variation |journal=Pharmacogenomics |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=969–72 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17054407 |doi=10.2217/14622416.7.7.969 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to improve health outcomes by facilitating the unification of data on human genetic variation and its impact on human health.

==Inception==
The HVP concept was conceived by [[Richard Cotton (geneticist)|Richard Cotton]], a leader in the field of [[human]] [[genetic variation]]. His group, the [[Genomic Disorders Research Centre]], based at the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne|St. Vincent's Hospital]], has established a consortium that covers genomic variation and its health implications in a comprehensive form. This consortium has encouraged the creation and supported many of the 571 gene specific [[variation database]]s currently available on the [[internet]]. However, these databases are of varying completeness and individualistic, so the Human Variome Project was born to establish a central project to encourage the collection and sourcing of this data, verifying it and ultimately using it for improved health outcomes.

Geneticists, Diagnosticians, Researchers and Bio-informatics scientists came together in June 2006 at the Human Variome Project Meeting, organized by Professor Cotton’s team, and agreed take on the task of organising data collection and unifying the systems of data access and storage. This initiative builds on substantial pilot work and achievements of the [[Human Genome Variation Society]]. The authority of those initiating this project is evidenced by the fact that major international bodies were present.  These included [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[OECD]], [[European Commission]], [[UNESCO]], [[March of Dimes]] (US), [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (US), [[Google]], representatives of two dozen international genetics bodies, numerous genetics journals, 20 countries and [[Australia]]n [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|State]] and [[Government of Australia|Federal Governments]].

This major international project, a natural partner to the [[Human Genome Project]], will require substantial funding to get it to a sustainable position. A five-year secure budget period of approximately US$12m per year has been proposed to initiate the project. This will enable the project to be organized and find operational funds for the tasks of [[system development]], [[health informatics|informatics]], [[database]] [[curator|curation]] and clinical access as well as collection systems that are open and accessible to all.

The Human Variome Project seeks to provide open access to the full realm of [[genetic variation]] for the benefit of everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vizzini|first1=Casimiro|title=The Human Variome Project: Global Coordination in Data Sharing|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=March 19, 2015|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2015/human-variome-project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centre for Arab Genomic Studies]] (CAGS) has initiated efforts to proceed with the Arab Human Variome Project under the Human Variome Project. CAGS was one of the participants of the HVP meeting in Melbourne. Since then, several meetings have been held between officials of HVP and CAGS members to discuss the nature of work involved.

'''Laboratory quality control''' is designed to detect, reduce, and correct deficiencies in a laboratory's internal analytical process prior to the release of patient results, in order to improve the quality of the results reported by the laboratory. Quality control is a measure of precision, or how well the measurement system reproduces the same result over time and under varying operating conditions. Laboratory quality control material is usually run at the beginning of each shift, after an instrument is serviced, when reagent lots are changed, after calibration, and whenever patient results seem inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Tietz, N.W. (1987). "Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry", Third Edition, W.B. Saunder Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Quality control material should approximate the same matrix as patient specimens, taking into account properties such as viscosity, turbidity, composition, and color. It should be simple to use, with minimal vial to vial variability, because variability could be misinterpreted as systematic error in the method or instrument. It should be stable for long periods of time, and available in large enough quantities for a single batch to last at least one year. Liquid controls are more convenient than lyophilized controls because they do not have to be reconstituted minimizing pipetting error.

==Interpretation==
Interpretation of quality control data involves both graphical and statistical methods. Quality control data is most easily visualized using a '''[[Levey-Jennings chart]]'''. The dates of analyses are plotted along the X-axis and control values are plotted on the Y-axis. The mean and one, two, and three standard deviation limits are also marked on the Y-axis. Inspecting the pattern of plotted points provides a simple way to detect increased random error and shifts or trends in calibration.&lt;ref&gt;.Grant, E.L. and R.S. Leavenworth (1988). "Statistical Quality Control", Sixth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The control charts==
The control charts: a statistical approach to the study of manufacturing process variation for the purpose of improving the economic effectiveness of the process. These methods are based on continuous monitoring of process variation. The control chart, also known as the ''''[[Shewhart chart]]' or '[[process-behavior chart]]'''' is a statistical tool intended to assess the nature of variation in a process and to facilitate forecasting and management. A control chart is a more specific kind of a run chart. The control chart is one of the seven basic tools of quality control which include the histogram, pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause and effect diagram, flowchart and scatter diagram. Control charts prevents unnecessary process adjustments; provides information about process capability; provides diagnostic information and it is a proven technique for improving productivity.

==Levey–Jennings chart==
[[File:Levy-Jennings SampleChart.png|thumb|right|300px|An example of a Levey–Jennings chart with upper and lower limits of one and two times the [[standard deviation]].]]
Levey-Jennings chart is a graph that [[quality control]] data is plotted on to give a visual indication whether a laboratory test is working well.The distance from the mean is measured in standard deviations (SD). It is named after S. Levey and E. R. Jennings who in 1950 suggested the use of [[Shewhart chart|Shewhart's individuals control chart]] in the clinical laboratory. On the x-axis the date and time, or more usually the number of the control run, are plotted. A mark is made indicating how far away the actual result was from the mean (which is the expected value for the control). Lines run across the graph at the mean, as well as one, two and three standard deviations to either side of the mean. This makes it easy to see how far off the result was.

Rules, such as the [[Westgard rules]] can be applied to see whether the results from the samples when the control was done can be released, or if they need to be rerun. The formulation of Westgard rules were based on statistical methods. Westgard rules are commonly used to analyse data in Shewhart control charts. Westgard rules are used to define specific performance limits for a particular assay and can be used to detect both random and systematic errors. Westgard rules are programmed in to automated analyzers to determine when an analytical run should be rejected. These rules need to be applied carefully so that true errors are detected while false rejections are minimized. The rules applied to high volume chemistry and hematology instruments should produce low false rejection rates.&lt;ref&gt;Westgard, J.O., P.L. Barry, and M.R. Hunt (1981). "A Multi-rule Shewhart Chart for Quality Control in Clinical Chemistry,"Clinical Chemistry, vol. 27, pp. 493-501.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Westgard, J.O., P.L. Barry (1986). "Cost-Effective Quality Control: Managing the Quality and Productivity of Analytical Processes"AACC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Levey-Jennings chart differs from the [[Shewhart individuals control chart]] in the way that sigma, the standard deviation,  is estimated. The Levey-Jennings chart uses the long-term (i.e., population) estimate of sigma whereas the Shewhart chart uses the short-term (i.e., within the rational subgroup) estimate.

[[File:Drazet, a black feral cat.jpg|225px|right|thumb|A [[black cat|black]] [[Domestic shorthair cat|domestic shorthair]]. The domestic shorthair is one of a number of landraces of the [[domestic cat]].]]
A '''landrace''' is a [[Domestication|domesticated]], locally adapted,&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO Reviewing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones 2008" /&gt; traditional variety&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt; of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through [[adaptation]] to its natural and cultural [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] of [[agriculture]] and [[pastoralism]], and due to isolation from other populations of the species.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt; Landraces are generally distinguished from [[cultivars]], and from [[breed]]s in the standardized sense, although the term '''landrace breed''' is sometimes used as distinguished from the term ''standardized breed'' when referring to cattle.&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary" /&gt;

Specimens of a landrace tend to be relatively genetically uniform, but are more diverse than members of a standardized or formal breed.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt; Some standardized animal breeds originate from attempts to make landraces more consistent through [[selective breeding]] and a landrace may become a more formal breed with the creation of a [[breed registry]] and/or publication of a [[breed standard]].  In such a case, the landrace may be thought of as a "stage" in breed development. However, in other cases, formalizing a landrace may result in the genetic resource of a landrace being lost through [[crossbreeding]].&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sponenberg |first=D. Phillip |chapter=Genetic Resources and Their Conservation |pages=392–393 |editor1-last=Bowling|editor1-first=Ann T. |editor2-last=Ruvinsky |editor2-first=Anatoly |title=The Genetics of the Horse |date=May 18, 2000 |publisher=CABI Publishing |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK |isbn=978-0-85199-429-1 |chapter-url= //Books.Google.com/books?id=ZL3A097IbjsC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392#v=onepage&amp;q=Landrace%20horses |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Landraces are distinct from ancestral wild [[species]] of modern stock, and from separate species or subspecies derived from the same ancestor as modern domestic stock. Landraces are not all derived from ancient stock largely unmodified by human breeding interests. In a number of cases, most commonly dogs and horses, domestic animals have escaped in sufficient numbers in an area to breed [[feral]] populations that, through [[evolutionary pressure]], can form new landraces in only a few centuries. In other cases, simple failure to maintain breeding regimens can do the same.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--source cited at end is only about plants--&gt;  For example, selectively bred cultivars can become new landraces when loosely selective reproduction is applied.&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt;

Ernesto|last3=Méndez |journal=Agricultural Systems |issue=111 |date=2012 |pages=63–74 |url= //UVM.edu/giee/pubpdfs/Olson_2012_Agricultural_Systems.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; has led to a reduction in [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  The majority of the [[genetic diversity]] of domesticated species lies in landraces and other traditionally used varieties,&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt; a "reservoir of [[Germplasm|genetic resources]]".&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
General features that characterize a landrace may include:&lt;!--Distinguish plant from animal here where there are distinctions in definition.--&gt;

* It is [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinctive and identifiable (i.e., has particular and recognizable characteristics or properties),&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; yet remains "dynamic".&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;
* It is genetically adapted to,&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt; and has a reputation for being able to withstand,&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; the conditions of the local environment, including [[climate]], [[disease]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]], even [[Culture|cultural]] practices.&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt;
* It is not the product of formal (governmental, organizational, or private) [[breeding program]]s,&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt; and may lack systematic selection, development and improvement by breeders.&lt;ref name="Jones 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;
* It is maintained and fostered less deliberately than a standardized breed, with its genetic isolation principally a matter of geography acting upon whatever animals that happened to be brought by humans to a given area.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;
* It has a historical origin in a specific geographic area,&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt; will usually have its own local name(s),&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; and will often be classified according to intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt;
* Where yield (e.g. of a grain or fruit crop) can be measured, a landrace will show high stability of yield, even under adverse conditions, but a moderate yield {{em|level}}, even under carefully managed conditions.&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt;
* At the level of [[genetic testing]], its heredity will show a degree of integrity,&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; but still some [[genetic heterogeneity]]&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt; (i.e. [[genetic diversity]]).&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlan 2" /&gt;

Not every source on the topic enumerates each of these criteria, and they may be weighted differently depending on a given source's focus (e.g., governmental [[regulation]], [[Biology|biological sciences]], [[agribusiness]], [[Cultural anthropology|anthropology]] and culture, environmental [[Conservation biology|conservation]], [[pet]] keeping and breeding, etc.).  Additionally, not all cultivars agreed to be landraces exhibit all possible landrace characteristics.&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;  Plant landraces have been the subject of more intensive study, and the majority of the academic literature about landraces is focused on [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[botany]], not [[animal husbandry]].  Most plant landraces are associated with traditional agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camacho Villa|first1=Taina Carolina |last2=Maxted|first2=Nigel |last3=Scholten|first3=Maria |last4=Ford-Lloyd|first4=Brian |title=Defining and Identifying Crop Landraces |date=December 2005 |journal=Plant Genetic Resources |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=373–384 |doi=10.1079/PGR200591 |url= //Journals.Cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=689208&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1479262105000420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many landrace animals are associated with farming, other domestic animals have been put to use as modes of transportation, as [[companion animal]]s, for sporting purposes, and for other non-farming uses, so their geographic distribution may differ. For example, horse landraces are less common because human use of them for transport has meant that they have moved with people more commonly and constantly than most other domestic animals, reducing the incidence of populations locally genetically isolated for extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;

==Terminology==
The word ''landrace'' literally means 'country-breed' (German: ''Landrasse'')&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{Cite web| url= //Dictionary.Reference.com/browse/landrace?s=t |title=Landrace |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged |publisher=Random House |accessdate=August 5, 2014}} Based on the ''Random House Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; and close [[cognates]] of it are found in various [[Germanic languages]].  The term was first defined (in German) by Kurt von Rümker in 1908,&lt;ref name="Zeven"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zeven |first=A. C. |title=Landraces: A Review of Definitions and classifciations |journal=Euphytica |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=127–139 |date=1998 |doi=10.1023/A:1018683119237}} Abstract and first two pages are available for [//link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018683119237#page-1 free access].&lt;/ref&gt; and more clearly described (in Dutch) in 1909 by U. J. Mansholt, who wrote that landraces have better "stability of their characteristics" and "resistance capacity to tolerate adverse influences" but lower production capacity than cultivars, and are apt to change genetically when moved to another environment.&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt; H. Kiessling added in 1912 that a landrace is a mixture of phenotypic forms despite relative outward uniformity, and a great adaptability to its natural and human environment.&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt;  The word entered non-academic English in the early 1930s, by way of the [[Danish Landrace pig]], a particular breed of lop-eared swine.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;

Aside from some standardized breeds having "Landrace" in their names, actual landraces and standardized breeds are sometimes further confused when the word "breed" is used very broadly.  As one example, a glossary in a [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) guideline defines ''landrace'' or ''landrace breed'' (treated synonymously) as "a breed that has largely developed through adaptation to the natural environment and traditional production system in which it has been raised".&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Glossary of Selected Terms |title=''In Vivo'' Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources |pages=xv–xx |author=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |series=FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines |issue=14 |issn=1810-0708 |chapter-url= http://FAO.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf |chapter-format=PDF}}&lt;!--Site does not support https.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also defines ''breed'' expansively and in multiple ways, with a focus on treating differing senses, landrace breed and standardized breed, as equivalent for "genetic management" purposes, the focus of the FAO guideline.&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary" /&gt;  It does clearly distinguish between the two concepts, however, both with a distinct definition of "standardized breed"&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary" /&gt; and in the main body of the guideline, referring to the "interaction between landraces and standardized breeds"),&lt;ref name="FAO Reviewing"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Reviewing the Roles of Animal Genetic Resources and Options for Their Conservation |title=''In Vivo'' Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources |pages=4–5 |author=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |series=FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines |issue=14 |issn=1810-0708 |chapter-url= http://FAO.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf |chapter-format=PDF}}&lt;!--Site does not support https.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and that FAO document uses "breed" to mean "the unit of conservation, i.e. the specific population of animals that is to be conserved".&lt;ref name="FAO Reviewing" /&gt;  Similarly, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''landrace'' as a "local cultivar or animal breed that has been improved by traditional agricultural methods",&lt;ref name="OED landrace"&gt;{{cite web |url= //OxfordDictionaries.com/definition/english/landrace |title=Definition of ''landrace'' in English |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; without specifying which definition of ''breed'' is cross-referenced.&lt;ref name="OED breed"&gt;{{cite web |url= //OxfordDictionaries.com/definition/english/breed |title=Definition of ''breed'' in English |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |date=2014 |publisher=&lt;!--ibid.: Oxford University Press--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The definition is also at odds with some peer-reviewed material, in which lack of formal, scientific breeding for genetic improvement (e.g. uniformity and stability) is characteristic of landraces;&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt; such sources&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt; clearly distinguish landraces from cultivars.)

A landrace native to, or produced for a long time (e.g. 100 years or longer)&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt; within the agricultural system in which it is found is referred to as an ''[[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] landrace'', while an introduced one is termed an '''allochthonous landrace'''.&lt;ref name="FAO B.1"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=//FAO.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/resource-book/en/ |chapter-format=PDF |title=Resource Book for the Preparation of National Plans for Conservation of Crop Wild Relatives and Landraces |chapter=Section B.

}}

Many languages do not use separate terms, like ''landrace'' and ''breed'' in English, but instead rely on extended description to convey such distinctions.{{efn|1=As an example of lack of distinction at the nomenclature level between breeds and landraces in other languages, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''{{lang|es|raza}}'' ('race') covers the concepts of both breed and landrace, as well as [[Race (biology)|biological race]], and [[Race (human classification)|race as a human classification]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}}} The FAO notes: "The distinction between breeds and ecotypes within breeds is not very objective, and generally involves cultural rather than genetic factors."&lt;ref name="FAO Vivo" /&gt;

The term '''landrace breed''' is sometimes encountered.&lt;ref name="FAO Vivo" /&gt; In various domestic species (including pigs, goats, sheep and geese) some standardized breeds include "Landrace" in their names, and "Landrace breeds" (with capital "L") is sometimes used to refer to them collectively.{{efn|1=The British Pig Association uses "Landrace breed", in reference to standardized breeds, e.g. "new lines ... making the British Landrace pig unique among other Landrace breeds throughout the world".&lt;ref name="BPA"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The British Landrace: Breed History |work=BritishPigs.org.uk |publisher=British Pig Association |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |location=Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, UK |date=2014&lt;!--last updated--&gt; |accessdate=30 September 2014 |url= http://BritishPigs.org.uk/breed_la.htm}}&lt;!--Site does not support https.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[British Landrace pig]] is a standardized breed, derived from earlier breeds with "Landrace" names.&lt;ref name="BPA" /&gt;  BPA's breed-specific usage is commonly found in various other publications.}} but may be used more ambiguously to include actual landraces.{{efn|1=One example of general and specific use in the same document, is an article in a UN FAO journal that refers to "landrace breeds" in its title, but distinguishes between formal breeds like [[Nguni cattle]], the [[Boer goat]] and "indigenous pig breeds" on the one hand, and "indigenous sheep landraces" on the other.&lt;ref name="Ramsay"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Adding Value to South African Landrace Breeds Conservation through Utilisation |first1=K. |last1=Ramsay |first2=M. |last2=Smuts |first3=H.

Similar ambiguity may be encountered in the use of terms such as '''ancient breed''', '''native breed''' (not to be confused with [[native species]]), '''old breed''', and '''[[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] breed'''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--The specific terms should be sourced.--&gt;  '''Farmers' variety''', usually applied to local cultivars, or seen as intermediate between a landrace and a cultivar,&lt;ref name="Ramanandan" /&gt; may also include landraces when referring to plant varieties not subjected to formal breeding programs.&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt;&lt;!--These two citations only source the sentence in which they appear.--&gt;

The term ''breed'' itself has multiple definitions and uses,{{efn|E.g.

For example, the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) guideline provides a definition of "breed", for "genetic management" purposes, that overlaps with many definitions of ''landrace'', and defines "landrace (or landrace breed)" as a type of "breed".&lt;ref name="FAO Vivo"&gt;''In Vivo'' Conservation, FAO glossary, pp. xv–xx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodiversity and conservation==
Due to their adaptation to the local environment, some farmers using scientifically "improved" domesticates also continue to raise landraces, because the latter often exhibit benefits,&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt; ranging from lower cost, and cultural (e.g. culinary) preference, to superior hardiness in a less-than-ideal climate, and better disease resistance.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  There may be more variety-specific pluses; a plant landrace may have, e.g., lower fertilizer requirements, or something about a plant or animal product's texture, color or ease of use might be a major factor.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;

Landraces are often free from many [[intellectual property]] and other regulatory encumbrances.  However, in some jurisdictions, a focus on their production may result in missing out on some benefits afforded to producers of genetically selected and homogenous organisms, including breeders' rights legislation, easier availability of loans and other business services, even the right to share seed or stock with others, depending on how favorable the laws in the area are to high-yield agribusiness interests.&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite web |url=//InWEnt.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |title=An Issue of Survival |first=Regine |last=Andersen |work=Development &amp; Cooperation |date=April 2010 |volume=51 |issue=4 |publisher=[[Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085330/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |archivedate=2011-09-27 |accessdate=August 6, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Regine Andersen of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute (Norway) and the Farmers' Rights Project puts it, "Agricultural biodiversity is being eroded. This trend is putting at risk the ability of future generations to feed themselves. In order to reverse the trend, new policies must be implemented worldwide. The irony of the matter is that the poorest farmers are the stewards of genetic diversity."&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  Protecting farmer interests and protecting biodiversity is at the heart of the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (the "Plant Treaty" for short), under the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), though its concerns are not exclusively limited to landraces.&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;

In 2005, a "working definition" of plant landraces was proposed: "a dynamic population(s) of a cultivated plant that has historical origin, distinct identity and lacks formal crop improvement, as well as often being genetically diverse, locally adapted and associated with traditional farming systems".&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt; Another definition, dating to 1975, of the term ''landrace'' as used in [[botany]] (and by extension in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], [[anthropology]], etc.) was provided by J. R. Harlan: {{bq
|1="Landrace populations are often highly variable in appearance, but they are each identifiable [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] and have a certain genetic integrity.  Farmers usually give them local names. A landrace has particular properties or characteristics. Some are considered early maturing and some late. Each has a reputation for adaptation to particular [[soil types]] according to the traditional peasant soil classifications, e.g. heavy or light, warm or cold, dry or wet, strong or weak. They also may be classified according to expected usage; among cereals, different landraces are used for flour, for porridge, for '[[bulgur]]', and for malt to make beer, etc. All components of the [plant] population are adapted to local climatic conditions, cultural practices, and disease and pests."&lt;ref name="Harlan 1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harlan |first=J.

===Development===
Landrace plants are grown from seeds which have not been systematically selected and marketed by seed companies, nor developed by plant breeders. &lt;!-- Participatory might source this?--&gt;The label ''landraces'' includes all those regional [[cultigen]]s that are highly [[heterogeneous]], but with enough characteristics in common to permit their recognition as a group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

This includes all cultigens cultivated without any specific [[nomenclature]] and value. A landrace identified with a unique feature, and selected for uniformity over a period of time for maintenance of the characteristic features of the population, can evolve into a "farmers' variety", or even a modern [[cultivar]] as in many crops (for example, ''Cajanus cajan'' 'Maruti' in the case of [[pigeon pea]]s).&lt;ref name="Ramanandan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramanandan |first=P. |chapter=Pigeonpea: Genetic Resources |pages=89–116 |title=The Pigeonpea |editor=Nene, Y.L. |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a modern cultivar grown over time can "evolve" into a landrace, especially when [[Self-pollination|self-seeded]] and some human selection is applied.&lt;ref name="Participatory"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friis-Hansen |first1=Esbern |last2=Sthapit |first2=Bhuwon (eds.) |title=Participatory Approaches to the Conservation and Use of Plant Genetic Resources |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute |location=Rome, Italy |date=2000 |page=199 |isbn=978-92-9043-444-3 |url= //Books.Google.com/books?id=5oSB_Dmwio4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using Europe as an example, data collected for an agricultural study published in 2008, showed that landrace [[cereal crop]]s began to decline in Europe in the 19th century with selective seed improvements, and continued with varietal improvement in the 20th century, such that cereal landraces "have largely fallen out of use" in Europe.&lt;ref name="Jones 2008" /&gt;  Landrace cultivation in central and northwest Europe was almost eradicated by the early 20th century, due to economic pressure to grow improved, modern cultivars.&lt;ref name="WWB"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bonjean |first1=Alain P. |last2=Angus |first2=William J.

Phillip Sponenberg described animal breeds as "consistent and predictable genetic entities" falling into several "classes": the landrace, the standardized breed, modern "type" breeds, industrial strains and feral populations. He describes landraces as an early stage of breed development, created by a combination of [[founder effect]], isolation and environmental pressures. Isolation prevents the further introduction of genetic material. Human selection for production goals is typical of most landraces.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg Bixby"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sponenberg|first1=D.

===Cats===
There are various distinctive landraces of [[domestic cat]] around the world, including the [[Aegean cat|Aegean]], [[Cyprus cat|Cyprus]], [[domestic long-haired]], [[domestic short-haired]], [[Kellas cat|Kellas]] and [[Sokoke]], among others. The [[Van cat]] of modern-day Turkey is a landrace of symbolic and (disputed) cultural value to Turks, Armenians and Kurds.&lt;!--See those main articles for sources for now, cite here too before GA review.--&gt;

Many standardized breeds have rather recently (within a century or less) been derived from landraces.  Examples, often called ''natural breeds'', include [[Arabian Mau]], [[Egyptian Mau]], [[Korat]], [[Kurilian Bobtail]], [[Maine Coon]], [[Manx cat|Manx]], [[Norwegian Forest Cat]], [[Siberian cat|Siberian]], and [[Thai cat|Thai]] (which is the landrace ancestor of modern Siamese cats), among many others.&lt;!--See those main articles for sources for now, cite here too before GA review.--&gt;

Landrace dogs have more variety in their appearance than do standardized dog breeds.&lt;ref name=Mother/&gt; An example of a dog landrace with a related standardized breed with a similar name is the [[collie]].  The [[Scotch Collie]] is a landrace, while the [[Rough Collie]] and the [[Border Collie]] are standardized breeds.

The [[Danish Landrace pig]] breed, pedigreed in 1896 from the actual local landrace, is the principal ancestor of the [[American Landrace pig|American Landrace]] (1930s). The [[Swedish Landrace pig|Swedish Landrace]] is derived from the Danish and from other Scandinavian breeds, as was the [[British Landrace pig|British Landrace]] breed, which was established as late as 1950.  The [[Baudin pig]] was once a feral landrace on [[Kangaroo Island]], South Australia.

===Poultry===

Landrace chicken varieties include:

* [[Danish hen]]. A true landrace native to Denmark.
* [[Icelandic chicken]]
* [[Jærhøns]]. A landrace breed native to Norway.
* [[Swedish flower hen]]

Landrace duck varieties include:

* [[Danish landrace duck]]. A true landrace native to Denmark (or perhaps a former one; the modern Danish landrace duck is somewhat interbred).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamle-husdyrracer.dk/index.php/dyrene/hons-aender-a-gaes/43-den-danske-landand|title=Den danske landand [The Danish landrace duck]|publisher=Foreningen gamle danske husdyrracer|language=Danish|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Swedish Blue duck]], a modern breed, is derived from a landrace of the same name.

Landrace goose varieties include:

* [[Pilgrim goose]]. A North American landrace, thought to descend from western European stock dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Nabhan"&gt;{{cite book |url= //Books.Google.com/books?id=pcmJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT297#v=onepage&amp;q=%22landrace%20of%22%20geese |first=Gary Paul |last=Nabhan |title=Renewing America's Food Traditions: Saving and Savoring the Continent's Most Endangered Foods |date=April 2008 |publisher=Chelsea Green |location=White River Junction, Vermont |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety is associated with the [[Mayflower Pilgrims]] of [[Plymouth Colony]], and has also been standardised as a formal breed since 1939.* [[Twente Landrace goose]]. May be derived from true landrace geese.
* [[Danish landrace goose]]. A true landrace.

Note: Many standardized breeds named "Landrace", e.g. the Twente Landrace goose, are not actually true landrace breeds, but may be&lt;!--probably "are", but need source for claim that specific.--&gt; derived from them.&lt;!--See those main articles for sources for now, cite here too before GA review.--&gt;

===Rabbits===
{{expand section|with=more examples|date=August 2014}}

* [[Gotland rabbit]], a rare landrace of Sweden (not entirely limited to Gotland), subject to conservation but not development efforts by breeders.
* [[Mellerud rabbit]], a very rare landrace of Sweden, subject to conservation but not development efforts by breeders

This is a list of artists who actively explored [[Mathematics and art|mathematics in their artworks]].&lt;ref name="Feature Column AMS"/&gt; [[Art]] forms practised by these artists include [[Mathematics and art|painting]], [[Mathematical sculpture|sculpture]], [[mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]] and [[origami]].

Some artists such as [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Luca Pacioli]] went so far as to write books on [[mathematics]] in art. Della Francesca wrote books on [[solid geometry]] and the emerging field of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d’Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids)'',&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', ed. G. Nicco Fasola, 2 vols., Florence (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''Trattato d'Abaco'', ed. G. Arrighi, Pisa (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''L'opera "De corporibus regularibus" di Pietro Franceschi detto della Francesca usurpata da Fra Luca Pacioli'', ed. G. Mancini, Rome, (1916).&lt;/ref&gt; while Pacioli wrote ''[[De divina proportione]] (On Divine Proportion)'', with illustrations by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], at the end of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swetz |first1=Frank J. |last2=Katz |first2=Victor J. |title=Mathematical Treasures - De Divina Proportione, by Luca Pacioli |url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-de-divina-proportione-by-luca-pacioli |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merely making accepted use of some aspect of mathematics such as [[perspective (geometry)|perspective]] does not qualify an artist for admission to this list.

The term "fine art" is used conventionally to cover the output of artists who produce a combination of paintings, drawings and sculptures.

A number of [[polity|polities]] have declared independence and sought [[diplomatic recognition]] from the [[international community]] as ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereign state]]s, but have not been universally recognised as such. These entities often have ''[[de facto]]'' control of their territory. [[List of historical unrecognized states|A number of such entities]] have existed in the past.

There are two traditional doctrines that provide indicia of how a ''de jure'' sovereign state comes into being. The [[Sovereign state#Declarative theory|declarative theory]] defines a state as a [[public international law|person in international law]] if it meets the following criteria:

# a defined territory
# a permanent population
# a government, and
# a capacity to enter into relations with other states.

According to the declarative theory, an entity's statehood is independent of its recognition by other states. By contrast, the [[Sovereign state#Constitutive theory|constitutive theory]] defines a state as a person of international law only if it is recognised as such by other states that are already a member of the international community.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Grant, ''The recognition of states: law and practice in debate and evolution'' (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1999), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proto-state]]s often reference either or both doctrines in order to legitimise their claims to statehood. There are, for example, entities which meet the declarative criteria (with ''[[de facto]]'' partial or complete control over their claimed territory, a government and a permanent population), but whose statehood is not recognised by any other states. Non-recognition is often a result of conflicts with other countries that claim those entities as integral parts of their territory. In other cases, two or more partially recognised states may claim the same territorial area, with each of them ''de facto'' in control of a portion of it (as have been the cases of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]], and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]). Entities that are recognised by only a minority of the world's states usually reference the declarative doctrine to legitimise their claims.

In many situations, international non-recognition is influenced by the presence of a foreign military force in the territory of the contested entity, making the description of the country's ''de facto'' status problematic. The international community can judge this military presence too intrusive, reducing the entity to a [[puppet state]] where effective [[sovereignty]] is retained by the foreign power. Historical cases in this sense can be seen in [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-led [[Manchukuo]] or the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-created [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]] and [[Independent State of Croatia]] before and during [[World War II]]. In the 1996 case ''[[Loizidou v. Turkey]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] judged Turkey for having exercised authority in the territory of [[Northern Cyprus]].

There are also entities which do not have control over any territory or do not unequivocally meet the declarative criteria for statehood but have been recognised to exist ''de jure'' as sovereign entities by at least one other state. Historically this has happened in the case of the [[Holy See]] (1870–1929), [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] (during Soviet annexation), and more recently the [[State of Palestine]] at the time of its declaration of independence in 1988. The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] is [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta#International status|currently in this position]]. See [[list of governments in exile]] for unrecognised governments without control over the territory claimed.

== Criteria for inclusion ==
[[File:Somaliland UCID elections rally.jpg|thumb|Women in [[Somaliland]], wearing the colors of the Somaliland flag.]]

The criteria for inclusion means a [[polity]] must claim [[sovereignty]], lack recognition from at least one [[member states of the United Nations|UN member state]], and either:

* satisfy the [[declarative theory of statehood]], ''or''
* be [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised]] as a state by at least one UN member state.

== Background ==
There are {{UNnum}} [[United Nations]] (UN) [[member states of the United Nations|member states]], while both the [[Holy See]] and the [[State of Palestine]] have [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer state status]] in the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/members/nonmembers.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209033633/http://www.un.org/members/nonmembers.shtml|archivedate=2007-02-09 |title=Non-member State |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some countries fulfill the declarative criteria, are recognised by the large majority of other states and are members of the United Nations, but are still included in the list here because one or more other states do not recognise their statehood, due to territorial claims or other conflicts.

Some states maintain informal (officially non-diplomatic) relations with states that do not officially recognise them. The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) is one such state, as it maintains unofficial relations with many other states through its [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|Economic and Cultural Offices]], which allow regular consular services. This allows the ROC to have economic relations even with states that do not formally recognise it. A total of 56 states, including Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/Laenderinformationen/LaenderReiseinformationenA-Z.jsp |title=Germany - Countries A to Z |publisher=Auswaertiges-amt.de |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/Templates/SediTemplate.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID=|title=Ambasciate Consolati e Uffici di promozione|publisher=Esteri.it |accessdate=29 April 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of State]] [http://www.usembassy.gov/#Taiwan Websites of U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions] Retrieved 2011-02-03&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/find-an-embassy/?l=T |title=Find an Embassy |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=14 March 2008 |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain some form of unofficial mission in the ROC.

| 1949
| The People's Republic of China (PRC), proclaimed in 1949, is the more widely recognised of the two claimant governments of "China", the other being the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, also known as Taiwan). The PRC does not accept diplomatic relations with states that recognise the ROC ({{Numrec|ROC|alt=UN members and the [[Holy See]] as of|asof=E}}). Most of these states do not officially recognise the PRC as a state, though some states have established relations with the ROC while stating they do not intend to stop recognising the PRC (Kiribati, Nauru).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Meifang [http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=21313&amp;CtNode=451 "Minister announces resumption of diplomatic ties with Nauru"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008044219/http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=21313&amp;CtNode=451 |date=8 October 2011 }} ''Taiwan Today'' 2005-05-20 Retrieved 2011-04-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/kiribati-president-upbeat-on-conference-taiwan "Kiribati president upbeat on conference, Taiwan"] ''Radio Australia'' 21 June 2010 Retrieved 2011-04-29&lt;/ref&gt; Some states which currently recognise only the PRC have attempted simultaneous recognition and relations with the ROC and the PRC in the past (Liberia, Vanuatu).&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe, Ron ''Asia in the Pacific Islands: Replacing the West'' University of the South Pacific.

| The Republic of China (ROC, usually called Taiwan), constitutionally formed in 1912, enjoyed majority recognition as the sole government of China until the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], after which a majority of UN member states have gradually switched recognition to the [[People's Republic of China]]. The ROC is currently recognised as a state by {{numrec|ROC}} UN members and the [[Holy See]]. The remaining UN member states either regard its controlled territory as ''de jure'' part of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) or have used careful diplomatic language to avoid taking a position as to whether the territory of the ROC is part of the PRC.{{efn|name=China|Both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China [[1992 Consensus|claim sovereignty over the whole of China]], stating [[Greater China|China]] is ''de jure'' a single sovereign entity encompassing both the area controlled by the PRC and the area controlled by the ROC. The position of individual states on this matter varies. Several states fully accept the PRC's position that there is only one China and that the PRC is the sole legitimate representative of China. Other states merely acknowledge this position, while recognising only the PRC as a state. Some states recognise only the ROC as a state, but have expressed an interest in recognition and relations with both the ROC and the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/world/asia/07iht-costa.1.6036203.html?_r=0|title=Taiwan cuts ties with Costa Rica over recognition for China|publisher=The New York Times|date=7 June 2007|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Throughout the years, the ROC has adopted differing positions towards simultaneous recognition of the ROC and the PRC by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bush III, Richard C.

'''Mass spectrometry''' ('''MS''') is an analytical technique that ionizes [[chemical species]] and sorts the [[ion]]s based on their [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. In simpler terms, a [[mass spectrum]] measures the masses within a sample. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.

A mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or [[isotopic signature]] of a sample, the masses of particles and of [[molecule]]s, and to elucidate the chemical structures of [[molecules]] and other [[chemical compound]]s.

In a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gas, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break into charged fragments. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection.&lt;ref name="isbn0-9660813-2-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sparkman, O.

Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.

{{Details|History of mass spectrometry}}
[[File:Early Mass Spectrometer (replica).jpg|thumb|Replica of [[J.J. Thomson]]'s third mass spectrometer]]

In 1886, [[Eugen Goldstein]] observed rays in [[gas discharge]]s under low pressure that traveled away from the [[anode]] and through channels in a perforated [[cathode]], opposite to the direction of negatively charged [[cathode rays]] (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged [[anode rays]] "Kanalstrahlen"; the standard translation of this term into English is "[[canal rays]]". [[Wilhelm Wien]] found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (''Q/m''). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist [[J.J. Thomson]] later improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the mass spectrograph.

==Parts of a mass spectrometer==
[[Image:Mass Spectrometer Schematic.svg|thumb|Schematics of a simple mass spectrometer with sector type mass analyzer. This one is for the measurement of carbon dioxide [[isotope]] ratios ([[Isotope ratio mass spectrometry|IRMS]]) as in the [[carbon-13]] [[urea breath test]]]]

A mass spectrometer consists of three components: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. The ''[[ion source|ionizer]]'' converts a portion of the sample into ions.  There is a wide variety of ionization techniques, depending on the phase (solid, liquid, gas) of the sample and the efficiency of various ionization mechanisms for the unknown species. An extraction system removes ions from the sample, which are then targeted through the mass analyzer and into the ''detector''.  The differences in masses of the fragments allows the mass analyzer to sort the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The detector measures the value of an indicator quantity and thus provides data for calculating the abundances of each ion present. Some detectors also give spatial information, e.g., a multichannel plate.

===Theoretical example===
The following example describes the operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer, which is of the [[sector instrument|sector]] type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider a sample of [[sodium chloride]] (table salt). In the ion source, the sample is [[vapor]]ized (turned into [[gas]]) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged particles) into [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[chloride]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions. Sodium atoms and ions are [[Monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]], with a mass of about 23 u. Chloride atoms and ions come in two isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about 75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25 percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion's trajectory depends on its mass-to-charge ratio. Lighter ions get deflected by the magnetic force more than heavier ions (based on [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]], ''F'' = ''ma''). The streams of sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative abundance of each ion type. This information is used to determine the chemical element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents (the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl to &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl).

==Creating ions==
[[File:CARIBU at ATLAS.jpg|thumb|[[Surface ionization]] source at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] linear accelerator]]

The [[ion source]] is the part of the mass spectrometer that ionizes the material under analysis (the analyte). The ions are then transported by [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]]s to the mass analyzer.

Techniques for ionization have been key to determining what types of samples can be analyzed by mass spectrometry.
[[Electron ionization]] and [[chemical ionization]] are used for [[gas]]es and [[vapor]]s. In chemical ionization sources, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used with [[liquid]] and [[solid]] biological samples include [[electrospray ionization]] (invented by [[John Bennett Fenn|John Fenn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenn JB, Mann M, Meng CK, Wong SF, Whitehouse CM | title = Electrospray ionization for mass spectrometry of large biomolecules | journal = Science | volume = 246 | issue = 4926 | pages = 64–71 | date = October 1989 | pmid = 2675315 | doi = 10.1126/science.2675315 | bibcode = 1989Sci...246...64F | citeseerx = 10.1.1.522.9458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique "Soft Laser Desorption (SLD)" by K.

&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Hard ionization and soft ionization===
[[File:Fenn ESI Instrument.jpg|thumb|Quadrupole mass spectrometer and electrospray ion source used for Fenn's early work]]

In mass spectrometry, ionization refers to the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the [[ion source]]. There are several [[ion source]]s available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, [[electron ionization]] (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to [[high performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]], i.e. [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]], since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with [[gas chromatography|GC]], i.e. [[GC-MS]], where the entire system is under high vacuum.

Hard ionization techniques are processes which impart high quantities of residual energy in the subject molecule invoking large degrees of fragmentation (i.e. the systematic rupturing of bonds acts to remove the excess energy, restoring stability to the resulting ion). Resultant ions tend to have ''m/z'' lower than the molecular mass (other than in the case of proton transfer and not including isotope peaks). The most common example of hard ionization is electron ionization (EI).

Soft ionization refers to the processes which impart little residual energy onto the subject molecule and as such result in little fragmentation. Examples include [[fast atom bombardment]] (FAB), [[chemical ionization]] (CI), [[atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI), [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI).

===Inductively coupled plasma===
[[File:ICPMS Thermo torch 1.JPG|thumb|Inductively coupled plasma ion source]]

[[ICP-MS|Inductively coupled plasma]] (ICP) sources are used primarily for cation analysis of a wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.

===Photoionization mass spectrometry===
[[Photoionization]] can be used in experiments which seek to use mass spectrometry as a means of resolving chemical kinetics mechanisms and isomeric product branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osborn DL, Zou P, Johnsen H, Hayden CC, Taatjes CA, Knyazev VD, North SW, Peterka DS, Ahmed M, Leone SR | title = The multiplexed chemical kinetic photoionization mass spectrometer: a new approach to isomer-resolved chemical kinetics | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 104103–104103–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 19044733 | doi = 10.1063/1.3000004 | bibcode = 2008RScI...79j4103O | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc930185/ | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances a high energy photon, either X-ray or uv, is used to dissociate stable gaseous molecules in a carrier gas of He or Ar. In instances where a [[synchrotron]] light source is utilzed, a tuneable photon energy can be utilized to acquire a photoionization efficiency curve which can be used in conjunction with the charge ratio m/z to fingerprint molecular and ionic species.

===Other ionization techniques===
Others include [[glow discharge]], [[field desorption]] (FD), [[fast atom bombardment]] (FAB), [[thermospray]], [[desorption/ionization on silicon]] (DIOS), [[DART ion source|Direct Analysis in Real Time]] (DART), [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI), [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS), [[spark ionization]] and [[thermal ionization]] (TIMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bruins, A. P. |title = Mass spectrometry with ion sources operating at atmospheric pressure|year = 1991|journal = [[Mass Spectrometry Reviews]]|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 53–77|doi = 10.1002/mas.1280100104|bibcode = 1991MSRv...10...53B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass selection==
&lt;!-- "Mass accuracy" redirects here --&gt;
Mass analyzers separate the ions according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. The following two laws govern the dynamics of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields in vacuum:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = Q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; ([[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]]);

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's second law]] of motion in non-relativistic case, i.e. valid only at ion velocity much lower than the speed of light).

Here '''F''' is the force applied to the ion, ''m'' is the mass of the ion, '''a''' is the acceleration, ''Q'' is the ion charge, '''E''' is the electric field, and '''v''' × '''B''' is the [[vector cross product]] of the ion velocity and the magnetic field

Equating the above expressions for the force applied to the ion yields:

: &lt;math&gt;(m/Q)\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{E}+ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[differential equation]] &lt;!-- It doesn't look like one, but I'm not an expert --&gt;is the classic equation of motion for [[charged particle]]s. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of ''m/Q''. Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as "mass-to-charge spectrometers". When presenting data, it is common to use the (officially) [[dimensionless]] ''m/z'', where z is the number of [[elementary charge]]s (''e'') on the ion (z=Q/e). This quantity, although it is informally called the mass-to-charge ratio, more accurately speaking represents the ratio of the mass number and the charge number, ''z''.

There are many types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields, and magnetic or electric fields, but all operate according to the above differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses. Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)]]. In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed below, there are others designed for special situations.

There are several important analyser characteristics. The [[mass resolving power]] is the measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different ''m/z''. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the ''m/z'' measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in [[Parts per million|ppm]] or [[milli mass unit]]s. The mass range is the range of ''m/z'' amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.

===Sector instruments===
[[File:FAB MS.jpg|thumb|ThermoQuest AvantGarde sector mass spectrometer]]
{{Details|Sector mass spectrometer}}
A sector field mass analyzer uses a static electric and/or magnetic field to affect the path and/or [[velocity]] of the [[electric charge|charged]] particles in some way.
As shown above, [[sector instrument]]s bend the trajectories of the ions as they pass through the mass analyzer, according to their mass-to-charge ratios, deflecting the more charged and faster-moving, lighter ions more. The analyzer can be used to select a narrow range of ''m/z'' or to scan through a range of ''m/z'' to catalog the ions present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year = 1986|title = Extending the Mass Range of a Sector Mass Spectrometer | vauthors = Cottrell JS, Greathead RJ |journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews|volume = 5|pages = 215–247|doi = 10.1002/mas.1280050302|issue = 3|bibcode=1986MSRv....5..215C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time-of-flight===
{{Details|time-of-flight mass spectrometry}}
The [[time-of-flight]] (TOF) analyzer uses an [[electric field]] to accelerate the ions through the same [[voltage|potential]], and then measures the time they take to reach the detector. If the particles all have the same [[electrical charge|charge]], the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] tends to be identical, and their [[velocity|velocities]], in this case, will depend only on their [[mass]]es. Ions with a lower mass will reach the detector first.&lt;ref&gt;In the event that the ions do not start at identical kinetic energies, some ions may lag behind higher kinetic energy ions decreasing resolution.  Reflectron geometries are commonly employed to correct this problem.
{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/mas.1280120202 | title = Time-of-flight mass analyzers | year = 1993 | author = Wollnik, H. | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = 89–114 | issue = 2 | bibcode = 1993MSRv...12...89W }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, even particles with the same m/z can arrive at different times at the detector, because they have different initial velocities. The initial velocity is not dependent on the mass of the ion what becomes a problem for the TOF-MS. The difference in initial velocity turns into difference in the final velocity. In this way, ions with the same m/z are going to arrive at different times in the detector. For fixing this problem, time-lag focusing/[[delayed extraction]] has been coupled with TOF-MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guilhaus|first=Michae|title=Principles and Instrumentation in Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f8b2/3adb80b33deadb9a1e521409e84b9fdae04d.pdf|journal=Journal of Mass Spectrometry|volume=30|pages=1519È1532|via=Google Scholar|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quadrupole mass filter===
{{Details|Quadrupole mass analyzer}}
[[Quadrupole mass analyzer]]s use oscillating electrical fields to selectively stabilize or destabilize the paths of ions passing through a [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[quadrupole]] field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow a wide range of m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the [[quadrupole ion trap]], particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.
A magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Syed SU, Maher S, Taylor S | title = Quadrupole mass filter operation under the influence of magnetic field | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 1325–39 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24338888 | doi = 10.1002/jms.3293 | bibcode = 2013JMSp...48.1325S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maher S, Syed SU, Hughes DM, Gibson JR, Taylor S | title = Mapping the stability diagram of a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a static transverse magnetic field applied | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1307–14 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23720050 | doi = 10.1007/s13361-013-0654-5 | bibcode = 2013JASMS..24.1307M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A common variation of the transmission quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The “triple quad” has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector. If a quadrupole is made to rapidly and repetitively cycle through a range of mass filter settings, full spectra can be reported.  Likewise, a triple quad can be made to perform various scan types characteristic of [[tandem mass spectrometry]].

===Ion traps===

====Three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap====
{{Details|quadrupole ion trap}}
The [[quadrupole ion trap]] works on the same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, in which case the ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.

There are many mass/charge separation and isolation methods but the most commonly used is the mass instability mode in which the RF potential is ramped so that the orbit of ions with a mass {{math|''a'' &amp;gt; ''b''}} are stable while ions with mass ''b'' become unstable and are ejected on the ''z''-axis onto a detector. There are also non-destructive analysis methods.

Ions may also be ejected by the resonance excitation method, whereby a supplemental oscillatory excitation voltage is applied to the endcap electrodes, and the trapping voltage amplitude and/or excitation voltage frequency is varied to bring ions into a resonance condition in order of their mass/charge ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul W, Steinwedel H |year = 1953|title = Ein neues Massenspektrometer ohne Magnetfeld|journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A|volume = 8|issue = 7|pages = 448–450|bibcode = 1953ZNatA...8..448P|doi=10.1515/zna-1953-0710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = March RE |title = Quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry: a view at the turn of the century|year = 2000|journal = [[International Journal of Mass Spectrometry]]|volume = 200|issue = 1–3|pages = 285–312|doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00345-6|bibcode = 2000IJMSp.200..285M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cylindrical ion trap====
The [[cylindrical ion trap mass spectrometer]] (CIT) is a derivative of the quadrupole ion trap where the electrodes are formed from flat rings rather than hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to miniaturization because as the size of a trap is reduced, the shape of the electric field near the center of the trap, the region where the ions are trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.

====Linear quadrupole ion trap====
A [[linear quadrupole ion trap]] is similar to a quadrupole ion trap, but it traps ions in a two dimensional quadrupole field, instead of a three-dimensional quadrupole field as in a 3D quadrupole ion trap. Thermo Fisher's LTQ ("linear trap quadrupole") is an example of the linear ion trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz JC, Senko MW, Syka JE | title = A two-dimensional quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 659–69 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12056566 | doi = 10.1016/S1044-0305(02)00384-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A toroidal ion trap can be visualized as a linear quadrupole curved around and connected at the ends or as a cross section of a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to form the toroid, donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion trap mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lammert SA, Rockwood AA, Wang M, Lee ML, Lee ED, Tolley SE, Oliphant JR, Jones JL, Waite RW | title = Miniature toroidal radio frequency ion trap mass analyzer | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 916–922 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16697659 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2006.02.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the toroidal trap, linear traps and 3D quadrupole ion traps are the most commonly miniaturized mass analyzers due to their high sensitivity, tolerance for mTorr pressure, and capabilities for single analyzer tandem mass spectrometry (e.g. product ion scans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyder DT, Pulliam CJ, Ouyang Z, Cooks RG | title = Miniature and Fieldable Mass Spectrometers: Recent Advances | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–29 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26422665 | pmc = 5364034 | doi = 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orbitrap====
[[File:Orbitrap mass analyzer - partial cross-section.JPG|thumb|Orbitrap mass analyzer]]
{{Details|Orbitrap}}
[[Orbitrap]] instruments are similar to [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are [[electrostatic]]ally trapped in an orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back and forth along the central electrode's long axis. This oscillation generates an [[image current]] in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument. The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by [[Fourier transformation]] of the recorded image currents.

Orbitraps have a high mass accuracy, high sensitivity and a good dynamic range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Q, Noll RJ, Li H, Makarov A, Hardman M, Graham Cooks R | title = The Orbitrap: a new mass spectrometer | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 430–43 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15838939 | doi = 10.1002/jms.856 | bibcode = 2005JMSp...40..430H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance===
[[File:IonSpec FT-ICR (Fourier transform Ion cyclotron resonance) Mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|left|Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer]]
{{Details|Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance}}
[[Fourier transform mass spectrometry]] (FTMS), or more precisely [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] MS, measures mass by detecting the [[image current]] produced by ions [[cyclotron]]ing in the presence of a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an [[electron multiplier]], the ions are injected into a [[Penning trap]] (a static electric/magnetic [[ion trap]]) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be [[deconvolution|deconvoluted]] by performing a [[Fourier transform]] on the signal. [[FTMS]] has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is "counted" more than once) and much higher [[resolution (mass spectrometry)|resolution]] and thus precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Comisarow MB, Marshall AG |title = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy|year = 1974|journal = [[Chemical Physics Letters]]|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 282–283|doi = 10.1016/0009-2614(74)89137-2|bibcode = 1974CPL....25..282C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall AG, Hendrickson CL, Jackson GS | title = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry: a primer | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–35 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9768511 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1998)17:1&lt;1::AID-MAS1&gt;3.0.CO;2-K | bibcode = 1998MSRv...17....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ion cyclotron resonance]] (ICR) is an older mass analysis technique similar to FTMS except that ions are detected with a traditional detector. Ions trapped in a [[Penning trap]] are excited by an RF electric field until they impact the wall of the trap, where the detector is located. Ions of different mass are resolved according to impact time.

==Detectors==
[[Image:Cont dynode detector.jpg|thumb|A continuous dynode particle multiplier detector]]

The final element of the mass spectrometer is the detector. The detector records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by or hits a surface. In a scanning instrument, the signal produced in the detector during the course of the scan versus where the instrument is in the scan (at what ''m/Q'') will produce a [[mass spectrum]], a record of ions as a function of ''m/Q''.

Typically, some type of [[electron multiplier]] is used, though other detectors including [[Faraday cup]]s and [[ion-to-photon detector]]s are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. [[Microchannel plate detector]]s are commonly used in modern commercial instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A comparison between ion-to-photon and microchannel plate detectors|year = 1999|journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]]|volume = 13|issue = 9|pages = 786–791|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(19990515)13:9&lt;786::AID-RCM566&gt;3.0.CO;2-3 | vauthors = Dubois F, Knochenmuss R, Zenobi R, Brunelle A, Deprun C, Le Beyec Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[FTMS]] and [[Orbitrap]]s, the detector consists of a pair of metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = An inductive detector for time-of-flight mass spectrometry|year = 1994|journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]]|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 317–322|doi = 10.1002/rcm.1290080407 | vauthors = Park MA, Callahan JH, Vertes A |bibcode = 1994RCMS....8..317P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tandem mass spectrometry==
[[File:TandemMS.svg|thumb|Tandem mass spectrometry for biological molecules using ESI or [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI]]]]
A [[tandem mass spectrometer]] is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry, usually separated by some form of molecule fragmentation. For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one [[peptide]] from many entering a mass spectrometer. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by [[collision-induced dissociation]] (CID). A third mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also be done in a single mass analyzer over time, as in a [[quadrupole ion trap]]. There are various methods for [[Fragmentation (chemistry)|fragmenting]] molecules for tandem MS, including [[collision-induced dissociation]] (CID), [[electron capture dissociation]] (ECD), [[electron transfer dissociation]] (ETD), [[infrared multiphoton dissociation]] (IRMPD), [[blackbody infrared radiative dissociation]] (BIRD), [[electron-detachment dissociation]] (EDD) and [[surface-induced dissociation]] (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is in [[Mass spectrometry#Protein identification|protein identification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Boyd, Robert K. |title = Linked-scan techniques for MS/MS using tandem-in-space instruments|year = 1994|journal = [[Mass Spectrometry Reviews]]|volume = 13|issue = 5–6|pages = 359–410|doi = 10.1002/mas.1280130502|bibcode = 1994MSRv...13..359B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tandem mass spectrometry enables a variety of experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as [[selected reaction monitoring|selected reaction monitoring (SRM)]] and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is [[duty cycle]] limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined ''m/z'' value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.

Another type of tandem mass spectrometry used for [[radiocarbon dating]] is [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS), which uses very high voltages, usually in the mega-volt range, to accelerate negative ions into a type of tandem mass spectrometer.

==Common mass spectrometer configurations and techniques==
When a specific combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes conventional in practice, a compound [[List of mass spectrometry acronyms|acronym]] may arise to designate it succinctly. One example is [[MALDI-TOF]], which refers to a combination of a [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] source with a [[time-of-flight]] mass analyzer. Other examples include [[ICP-MS|inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)]], [[accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)]], [[thermal ionization|thermal ionization-mass spectrometry (TIMS)]] and [[spark ionization|spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS)]].

Certain applications of mass spectrometry have developed monikers that although strictly speaking would seem to refer to a broad application, in practice have come instead to connote a specific or a limited number of instrument configurations. An example of this is [[isotope ratio mass spectrometry|isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)]], which refers in practice to the use of a limited number of sector based mass analyzers; this name is used to refer to both the application and the instrument used for the application.

==Separation techniques combined with mass spectrometry==
An important enhancement to the mass resolving and mass determining capabilities of mass spectrometry is using it in tandem with [[chromatography|chromatographic]] and other separation techniques.

===Gas chromatography===
{{main|Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry}}
[[Image:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|left|A gas chromatograph (right) directly coupled to a mass spectrometer (left)]]

A common combination is [[gas]] chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a [[gas chromatograph]] is used to separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the [[ion]] source, a [[metal]]lic [[Electrical filament|filament]] to which [[voltage]] is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.&lt;ref&gt;Eiceman, G.A. (2000). Gas Chromatography. In R.A. Meyers (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry: Applications, Theory, and Instrumentation'', pp. 10627. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-97670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquid chromatography===
{{main|Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry}}
[[File:IMA Conservation Science.jpg|thumb|[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] conservation scientist performing [[liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry]]]]

Similar to gas chromatography MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically before they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of [[water]] and organic [[solvent]]s, instead of gas. Most commonly, an [[electrospray ionization]] source is used in LC-MS. Other popular and commercially available LC-MS ion sources are [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] and [[atmospheric pressure photoionization]]. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like [[laser spray]].

===Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry===
{{main|Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry}}

Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a technique that combines the liquid separation process of [[capillary electrophoresis]] with mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name="pmid2774189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loo JA, Udseth HR, Smith RD | title = Peptide and protein analysis by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 179 | issue = 2 | pages = 404–12 | date = June 1989 | pmid = 2774189 | doi = 10.1016/0003-2697(89)90153-X  }}&lt;/ref&gt; CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.&lt;ref name="pmid18790125"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maxwell EJ, Chen DD | title = Twenty years of interface development for capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta | volume = 627 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18790125 | doi = 10.1016/j.aca.2008.06.034 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-2670(08)01244-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ion mobility===
{{main|Ion-mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry}}

Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is a technique where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer.&lt;ref name='GFVerbeck06012002'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verbeck GF, Ruotolo BT, Sawyer HA, Gillig KJ, Russell DH | title = A fundamental introduction to ion mobility mass spectrometry applied to the analysis of biomolecules | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Techniques | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–61 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 19498967 | pmc = 2279851 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drift time is a measure of the radius relative to the charge of the ion. The [[duty cycle]] of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is longer than most mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matz LM, Asbury GR, Hill HH | title = Two-dimensional separations with electrospray ionization ambient pressure high-resolution ion mobility spectrometry/quadrupole mass spectrometry | journal = Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 670–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11921245 | doi = 10.1002/rcm.623 | bibcode = 2002RCMS...16..670M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duty cycle of IMS is short relative to liquid chromatography or gas chromatography separations and can thus be coupled to such techniques, producing triple modalities such as LC/IMS/MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sowell RA, Koeniger SL, Valentine SJ, Moon MH, Clemmer DE | title = Nanoflow LC/IMS-MS and LC/IMS-CID/MS of protein mixtures | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1341–53 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15337515 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2004.06.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data and analysis==
[[Image:ObwiedniaPeptydu.gif|thumb|Mass spectrum of a peptide showing the isotopic distribution]]

===Data representations===
{{See also|Mass spectrometry data format}}
Mass spectrometry produces various types of data. The most common data representation is the [[mass spectrum]].

Certain types of mass spectrometry data are best represented as a [[mass chromatogram]]. Types of chromatograms include [[selected ion monitoring]] (SIM), [[total ion current]] (TIC), and [[selected reaction monitoring]] (SRM), among many others.

Other types of mass spectrometry data are well represented as a three-dimensional [[contour map]]. In this form, the mass-to-charge, ''m/z'' is on the ''x''-axis, intensity the ''y''-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the ''z''-axis.

===Data analysis===
Mass spectrometry data analysis is specific to the type of experiment producing the data. General subdivisions of data are fundamental to understanding any data.

Many mass spectrometers work in either ''negative ion mode'' or ''positive ion mode''. It is very important to know whether the observed ions are negatively or positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but it also indicates something about the nature of the molecules.

Different types of ion source result in different arrays of fragments produced from the original molecules. An electron ionization source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged. Tandem mass spectrometry purposely produces fragment ions post-source and can drastically change the sort of data achieved by an experiment.

Knowledge of the origin of a sample can provide insight into the component molecules of the sample and their fragmentations. A sample from a synthesis/manufacturing process will probably contain impurities chemically related to the target component. A crudely prepared biological sample will probably contain a certain amount of salt, which may form [[adduct]]s with the analyte molecules in certain analyses.

Results can also depend heavily on sample preparation and how it was run/introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.

Mass spectrometry can measure molar mass, molecular structure, and sample purity. Each of these questions requires a different experimental procedure; therefore, adequate definition of the experimental goal is a prerequisite for collecting the proper data and successfully interpreting it.

====Interpretation of mass spectra====
[[File:Toluene ei ms.PNG|thumb|[[Toluene]] electron ionization mass spectrum]]
{{Main|Mass spectrum analysis}}
Since the precise [[Chemical structure|structure]] or [[peptide sequence]] of a molecule is deciphered through the set of fragment masses, the interpretation of [[Mass spectrum|mass spectra]] requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound is to compare its experimental mass spectrum against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tureček | first1 = František | last2 = McLafferty | first2 = Fred W. | name-list-format = vanc |year=1993|title=Interpretation of mass spectra|publisher=University Science Books|place=Sausalito|isbn=978-0-935702-25-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xQWk5WQfMQAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mass spectrometry software|software assisted interpretation of mass spectra]] must be performed. Computer simulation of [[ionization]] and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' structural information is fragmented ''[[in silico]]'' and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library&lt;ref&gt;Mistrik, R. (2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151406/http://www.highchem.com/publications/a-new-concept-for-the-interpretation-of-mass-spectra.html A New Concept for the Interpretation of Mass Spectra Based on a Combination of a Fragmentation Mechanism Database and a Computer Expert System.] in Ashcroft, A.E., Brenton, G., Monaghan, J.J. (Eds.), ''Advances in Mass Spectrometry'', Elsevier, Amsterdam, vol. 16, pp. 821.{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. [[Mass spectrometry software|Software]] taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and [[Peptide mass fingerprinting|proteins]].

Analysis of mass spectra can also be  spectra with [[accurate mass]]. A mass-to-charge ratio value (''m/z'') with only integer precision can represent an immense number of theoretically possible ion structures; however, more precise mass figures significantly reduce the number of candidate [[Molecule#Molecular formula|molecular formulas]].  A computer algorithm called formula generator calculates all molecular formulas that theoretically fit a given [[Accurate mass|mass]] with specified tolerance.

A recent technique for structure elucidation in mass spectrometry, called [[precursor ion fingerprinting]], identifies individual pieces of structural information by conducting a search of the [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem spectra]] of the molecule under investigation against a library of the [[Tandem mass spectrometry#Tandem MS experiments|product-ion spectra]] of structurally characterized precursor ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheldon MT, Mistrik R, Croley TR | title = Determination of ion structures in structurally related compounds using precursor ion fingerprinting | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 370–6 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19041260 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2008.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:WB-57 PALMS Mount.jpg|thumb|[[NOAA]] Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry [[aerosol mass spectrometer]] aboard a [[NASA]] [[Martin B-57 Canberra|WB-57]] high-altitude research aircraft]]

Mass spectrometry has both [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] uses. These include identifying unknown compounds, determining the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of elements in a molecule, and determining the [[structure]] of a compound by observing its fragmentation. Other uses include quantifying the amount of a compound in a sample or studying the fundamentals of [[gas phase ion chemistry]] (the chemistry of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now commonly used in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds.

As an analytical technique it possesses distinct advantages such as: Increased sensitivity over most other analytical techniques because the analyzer, as a mass-charge filter, reduces background interference, Excellent specificity from characteristic fragmentation patterns to identify unknowns or confirm the presence of suspected compounds, Information about molecular weight, Information about the isotopic abundance of elements, Temporally resolved chemical data.

A few of the disadvantages of the method is that it often fails to distinguish between optical and geometrical isomers and the positions of substituent in o-, m- and p- positions in an aromatic ring. Also, its scope is limited in identifying hydrocarbons that produce similar fragmented ions.

===Isotope ratio MS: isotope dating and tracing===
[[Image:Mass-spectrometer awi hg.jpg|thumb|Mass spectrometer to determine the &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope ratio on biogenous carbonate]]
{{Main|Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry}}
Mass spectrometry is also used to determine the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of elements within a sample. Differences in mass among isotopes of an element are very small, and the less abundant isotopes of an element are typically very rare, so a very sensitive instrument is required. These instruments, sometimes referred to as isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IR-MS), usually use a single magnet to bend a beam of ionized particles towards a series of [[Faraday cup]]s which convert particle impacts to [[electric current]]. A fast on-line analysis of [[deuterium]] content of water can be done using [[flowing afterglow mass spectrometry]], FA-MS. Probably the most sensitive and accurate mass spectrometer for this purpose is the [[accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometer]] (AMS). This is because it provides ultimate sensitivity, capable of measuring individual atoms and measuring nuclides with a dynamic range of ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; relative to the major stable isotope.&lt;ref name="Maher S, Jjunju FPM, Taylor S 2015 113–135"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Maher S, Jjunju FP, Taylor S |title=100 years of mass spectrometry: Perspectives and future trends |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=113–135 |year=2015 |doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.87.113 |bibcode=2015RvMP...87..113M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotope ratios are important markers of a variety of processes. Some isotope ratios are used to determine the age of materials for example as in [[carbon dating]]. Labeling with stable isotopes is also used for protein quantification. (see [[Mass spectrometry#Protein characterization|protein characterization]] below)

==== Membrane-Inlet Mass Spectrometry: Measuring gasses in solution ====
[[Membrane inlet mass spectrometry|Membrane-inlet Mass Spectrometry]], combines the Isotope ratio MS with a reaction chamber/cell separated by a gas-permeable membrane. This method allows the study of gasses as they evolve in solution. This method has been extensively used for the study of the production of oxygen by [[Photosystem II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shevela D, Messinger J | title = Studying the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen in photosynthetic and artificial systems by time-resolved membrane-inlet mass spectrometry | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 4 | pages = 473 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24324477 | pmc = 3840314 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2013.00473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace gas analysis===
Several techniques use ions created in a dedicated ion source injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: [[SIFT-MS selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry|selected ion flow tube]] (SIFT-MS), and [[Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry|proton transfer reaction]] (PTR-MS), are variants of [[chemical ionization]] dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics without the need for internal standard or calibration.

===Atom probe===
An [[atom probe]] is an instrument that combines [[time-of-flight]] mass spectrometry and field-evaporation microscopy to map the location of individual atoms.

===Pharmacokinetics===
{{Main|Pharmacokinetics}}
Pharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] with a [[quadrupole mass analyzer|triple quadrupole mass spectrometer]]. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is not uncommon to use [[curve fitting]] with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsieh Y, Korfmacher WA | title = Increasing speed and throughput when using HPLC-MS/MS systems for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic screening | journal = Current Drug Metabolism | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–89 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16787157 | doi = 10.2174/138920006777697963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Lee ED, Henion JD | title = High-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of drugs in biological samples | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 2453–60 | date = October 1986 | pmid = 3789400 | doi = 10.1021/ac00125a022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Crowther JB, Dewey EA, Henion JD | title = Thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry determination of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 474–81 | date = February 1985 | pmid = 3977076 | doi = 10.1021/ac50001a036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for [[microdosing]] studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to [[animal experimentation]].

===Protein characterization===
{{Main|Protein mass spectrometry}}
Mass spectrometry is an important method for the characterization and [[protein sequencing|sequencing]] of proteins. The two primary methods for ionization of whole proteins are [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as "[[top-down proteomics|top-down]]" strategy of protein analysis.  The top-down approach however is largely limited to low-throughput single-protein studies. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller [[peptides]] using [[protease]]s such as [[trypsin]] or [[pepsin]], either in [[solution]] or [[in-gel digestion|in gel]] after [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation. Other proteolytic agents are also used. The collection of peptide products are then introduced to the mass analyzer. When the characteristic pattern of peptides is used for the identification of the protein the method is called [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] (PMF), if the identification is performed using the sequence data determined in [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem MS]] analysis it is called [[de novo peptide sequencing]]. These procedures of protein analysis are also referred to as the "[[Bottom-up proteomics|bottom-up]]" approach.  A third approach however is beginning to be used, this intermediate "middle-down" approach involves analyzing proteolytic peptide larger than the typical tryptic peptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chait BT | title = Mass spectrometry in the postgenomic era | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 80 | pages = 239–46 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21675917 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-110810-095744 }}{{subscription required|via=Annual Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycan analysis===
Mass spectrometry (MS), with its low sample requirement and high sensitivity, has been predominantly used in [[glycobiology]] for characterization and elucidation of [[glycan|glycan structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Apte A, Meitei NS | title = Bioinformatics in glycomics: glycan characterization with mass spectrometric data using SimGlycan | volume = 600 | pages = 269–81 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19882135 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60761-454-8_19 | isbn = 978-1-60761-453-1 | series = Methods in Molecular Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass spectrometry provides a complementary method to [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] for the analysis of glycans. Intact glycans may be detected directly as singly charged ions by [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry]] (MALDI-MS) or, following permethylation or peracetylation, by [[fast atom bombardment|fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry]] (FAB-MS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Harvey DJ, Dwek RA, Rudd PM | title = Determining the structure of glycan moieties by mass spectrometry | journal = Current Protocols in Protein Science | volume = Chapter 12 | pages = 12.7.1–12.7.18 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 18429296 | doi = 10.1002/0471140864.ps1207s43 | isbn = 978-0-471-14086-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]] (ESI-MS) also gives good signals for the smaller glycans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blow N | title = Glycobiology: A spoonful of sugar | journal = Nature | volume = 457 | issue = 7229 | pages = 617–20 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19177129 | doi = 10.1038/457617a | bibcode = 2009Natur.457..617B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Glycobiology#Software for MS Data Interpretation|free and commercial software]] are now available which interpret MS data and aid in Glycan structure characterization.

===Space exploration===
[[File:Rosy Red to TEGA.jpg|thumb|NASA's [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix Mars Lander]] analyzing a soil sample from the "Rosy Red" trench with the [[Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer|TEGA]] mass spectrometer]]

As a standard method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two were taken to [[Mars]] by the [[Viking program]]. In early 2005 the [[Cassini–Huygens]] mission delivered a specialized [[GC-MS]] instrument aboard the [[Huygens probe]] through the atmosphere of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of the planet [[Saturn]]. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory and was able to vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen, hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's natural abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petrie S, Bohme DK | title = Ions in space | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 258–80 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17111346 | doi = 10.1002/mas.20114 | lastauthoramp = yes | bibcode = 2007MSRv...26..258P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on board the [[Cassini–Huygens]] spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's atmospheric composition as well as the composition of [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]' plumes. A [[Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer]] mass spectrometer was carried by the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Mars Phoenix Lander]] launched in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffman JH, Chaney RC, Hammack H | title = Phoenix Mars Mission--the thermal evolved gas analyzer | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 1377–83 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18715800 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2008.07.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass spectrometers are also widely used in space missions to measure the composition of plasmas. For example, the Cassini spacecraft carried the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caps.space.swri.edu/ |title=Cassini Plasma Spectrometer |access-date=2008-01-04 |publisher=[[Southwest Research Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which measured the mass of ions in Saturn's [[magnetosphere]].

===Respired gas monitor===
Mass spectrometers were used in hospitals for respiratory gas analysis beginning around 1975 through the end of the century. Some are probably still in use but none are currently being manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riker JB, Haberman B | title = Expired gas monitoring by mass spectrometry in a respiratory intensive care unit | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 223–9 | year = 1976 | pmid = 975846 | doi = 10.1097/00003246-197609000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found mostly in the [[operating room]], they were a part of a complex system, in which respired gas samples from patients undergoing [[anesthesia]] were drawn into the instrument through a valve mechanism designed to sequentially connect up to 32 rooms to the mass spectrometer. A computer directed all operations of the system. The data collected from the mass spectrometer was delivered to the individual rooms for the anesthesiologist to use.

The uniqueness of this magnetic sector mass spectrometer may have been the fact that a plane of detectors, each purposely positioned to collect all of the ion species expected to be in the samples, allowed the instrument to simultaneously report all of the gases respired by the patient. Although the mass range was limited to slightly over 120 [[atomic mass unit|u]], fragmentation of some of the heavier molecules negated the need for a higher detection limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gothard JW, Busst CM, Branthwaite MA, Davies NJ, Denison DM | title = Applications of respiratory mass spectrometry to intensive care | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 890–5 | date = September 1980 | pmid = 6778243 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2044.1980.tb03950.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparative mass spectrometry===
The primary function of mass spectrometry is as a tool for chemical analyses based on detection and quantification of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. However, mass spectrometry also shows promise for material synthesis.&lt;ref name="Maher S, Jjunju FPM, Taylor S 2015 113–135"/&gt; Ion soft landing is characterized by deposition of intact species on surfaces at low kinetic energies which precludes the fragmentation of the incident species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verbeck G, Hoffmann W, Walton B | title = Soft-landing preparative mass spectrometry | journal = The Analyst | volume = 137 | issue = 19 | pages = 4393–407 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22900257 | doi = 10.1039/C2AN35550G | bibcode = 2012Ana...137.4393V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soft landing technique was first reported in 1977 for the reaction of low energy sulfur containing ions on a lead surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Franchetti V, Solka BH, Baitinger WE, Amy JW, Cooks RG |title=Soft landing of ions as a means of surface modification |journal=Mass Spectrom.

[[Image:MERCKS INDEX.png|thumb|First issue, titled ''Merck's Index'']]
'''''The Merck Index''''' is an encyclopedia of [[chemical substance|chemical]]s, [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]]s and [[biomolecule|biological]]s with over 10,000 monographs on single substances or groups of related [[chemical compound|compound]]s&lt;ref name=db-intro /&gt; published online by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acscinf.org/content/merck-index-encyclopedia-chemicals-and-natural-products|title=The Merck Index, an Encyclopedia of Chemicals and Natural Products {{!}} ACS Division of Chemical Information (CINF)|website=www.acscinf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the Merck's Index was published in 1889 by the German chemical company [[Merck Group| Emanuel Merck]] and was primarily used as a sales catalog for Merck's growing list of chemicals it sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acscinf.org/content/merck-index-encyclopedia-chemicals-and-natural-products|title=The Merck Index, an Encyclopedia of Chemicals and Natural Products {{!}} ACS Division of Chemical Information (CINF)|website=www.acscinf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American subsidiary was established two years later and continued to publish it. During World War I the US government seized Merck's US operations and made it a separate American "Merck" company that continued to publish the Merck Index. 

In 2012 the Merck Index was licensed to the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;ref name=RSC-acquires&gt;{{cite web|title=RSC acquires The Merck Index|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2012/RSC-acquires-Merck-Index.asp|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online version of The Merck Index, including historic records and new updates not in the print edition,&lt;ref name=db-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=Database Introduction|url=https://www.rsc.org/Merck-Index/info/rsc-database-introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly available through research libraries. It also includes an appendix with monographs on organic [[named reaction]]s. 

The current edition is the 15th, published in April 2013.

Monographs in ''The Merck Index'' typically contain:&lt;ref name=db-intro /&gt;
* a [[CAS registry number]]
* synonyms of the substance, such as [[trivial name]]s and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature]]
* a [[chemical formula]]
* [[molecular weight]]
* [[percent composition]]
* a [[structural formula]]
* a description of the substance's appearance
* [[melting point]] and [[boiling point]]
* [[solubility]] in [[solvent]]s commonly used in the laboratory
* citations to other literature regarding the compound's [[chemical synthesis]]
* a therapeutic category, if applicable
* caution and hazard information

==Editions==

'''''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World''''' is the sixth book written by American [[mycologist]] [[Paul Stamets]].

In ''Mycelium Running'' (Ten Speed Press 2005), Stamets explores the use and applications of [[fungi]] in [[bioremediation]]&amp;mdash;a practice called [[mycoremediation]]. Stamets details methods of [[termite]] and [[ant]] control using nontoxic [[mycelia]], and describes how certain fungi may be able to neutralize [[anthrax]], [[nerve gas]], and [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Starhawk |authorlink=Starhawk |year=2006 |title=Notes from Underground &amp;ndash; Book review: ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World'' |journal=[[Yes!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is this the largest organism in the world? This 2,400-acre (9.7 km2) site in eastern Oregon had a contiguous growth of mycelium before logging roads cut through it. Estimated at 1,665 football fields in size and 2,200 years old, this one fungus has killed the forest above it several times over, and in so doing has built deeper soil layers that allow the growth of ever-larger stands of trees. Mushroom-forming forest fungi are unique in that their mycelial mats can achieve such massive proportions.

'''NSVS 14256825''', also known as '''V1828 Aquilae''', is an [[eclipsing binary]] system (of the [[Algol variable|Algol type]]) in the [[constellation]] of [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]].

The two stars orbit each other every 2.648976 [[hour]]s.&lt;ref name=Almeida&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2012MNRAS.423..478A |title=A photometric and spectroscopic study of NSVS 14256825: the second sdOB+dM eclipsing binary |author1=

== Eclipse timing variations ==
Based on variations in the timing of the system's eclipses, in 2012 it was claimed that two giant planets were in orbit around the binary, with masses of 2.9 and 8.1 times the mass of [[Jupiter]] orbiting with periods of 3.5 and 6.9 years respectively.&lt;ref name=Almeida/&gt; The proposed system was later shown to be extremely unstable, lasting less than a thousand years (i.e., much shorter than the age of the system); more observations are needed.

 for determining what constitutes a war crime|Nuremberg Principles|the denaturalization of German Jews|Nuremberg Laws}}

The '''Nuremberg Code''' ({{lang-de|Nürnberger Kodex}}) is a set of [[research ethics]] principles for [[human experimentation]] created as a result of the [[subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg trials]] at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Background==
The origin of the Nuremberg Code began in pre–[[World War II]] German politics, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s. The pre-war [[German Medical Association]] was considered to be a progressive yet democratic association with great concerns for public health, one example being the legislation of compulsory health insurance for German workers. However, starting in the mid-1920s, German physicians, usually proponents of [[racial hygiene]], were accused by the public and the medical society of [[Unethical human experimentation|unethical]] medical practices. The use of racial hygiene was supported by the German government in order to create an Aryan "master race", and to exterminate those who did not fit into their criteria. Racial hygiene extremists merged with [[Nazism|National Socialism]] to promote the use of biology to accomplish their goals of racial purity, a core concept in the Nazi ideology. Physicians were attracted to the scientific ideology and aided in the establishment of National Socialist Physicians' League in 1929 to "purify the German medical community of 'Jewish [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]]'." Criticism was becoming prevalent; Alfons Stauder, member of the Reich Health Office, claimed that the "dubious experiments have no therapeutic purpose", and Fredrich von Muller, physician and the president of the Deutsche Akademie, joined the criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Grodin MA.  "Historical origins of the Nuremberg Code".  In: ''The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code: Human Rights in Human Experimentation''. Annas, GJ and Grodin, MA (eds.). Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the criticism of unethical human experimentation, the Reich government issued "Guidelines for New Therapy and Human Experimentation" in [[Weimar]], Germany. The guidelines were based on [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]], but also stressed legal doctrine of [[informed consent]]. The guidelines clearly distinguished the difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. For therapeutic purposes, the guidelines allowed administration without consent only in dire situations, but for non-therapeutic purposes any administration without consent was strictly forbidden. However, the guidelines from Weimar were negated by [[Adolf Hitler]]. By 1942, the Nazi party included  more than 38,000 German physicians, who helped carry out medical programs such as [[Nazi eugenics|the Sterilization Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Vollmann, Jochen, and Rolf Winau. "Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg code". ''BMJ: British Medical Journal'' 313.7070 (1996): 1445.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, a series of trials were held to hold members of the Nazi party responsible for a multitude of [[war crime]]s. The trials were approved by President Harry Truman in January 1946 and were led exclusively by the United States. They began on December 9, 1946 in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, in what became known as the [[Nuremberg trials]]. In one of the trials, which became known as the "[[Doctors' trial|Doctors' Trial]]", German physicians responsible for conducting unethical medical procedures on humans during the war were tried. They focused on physicians who conducted inhumane and unethical human experiments in [[concentration camps]], in addition to those who were involved in over 3,500,000 [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]s of German citizens.&lt;ref name="Credo Refernece"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry.do?ta=abcgeamrle&amp;uh=eugenics_euthanasia |title=Eugenics/Euthanasia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |access-date=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/psylawseminar/The%20Nuremburg%20Code.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the accused argued that their experiments differed little from those used before the war, and that there was no law that differentiated between legal and illegal experiments. On August 20, 1947, the judges delivered their verdict against [[Karl Brandt (physician)|Karl Brandt]] and 22 others.&lt;ref name="Annas, George J. 1992"&gt;Annas, George J., and Michael A. Grodin. ''The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1947, while the trials were being held, six points defining legitimate medical research were submitted to the Counsel for War Crimes. Three judges, in response to expert medical advisers for the prosecution, adopted these points and added four additional points. The 10 points constituted the "Nuremberg Code", which includes such principles as [[informed consent]] and absence of [[coercion]]; properly formulated [[scientific]] experimentation; and [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] towards experiment participants. It is thought to have been mainly based on the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which was interpreted as endorsing the experimental approach to medicine while protecting the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Weindling, Paul. "The origins of informed consent: The international scientific commission on medical war crimes, and the Nuremberg code". ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 75.1 (2001): 37–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ten points of the Nuremberg Code==
# Required is the voluntary, well-informed, understanding consent of the human subject in a full legal capacity.
# The experiment should aim at positive results for society that cannot be procured in some other way.
# It should be based on previous knowledge (e.g., an expectation derived from animal experiments) that justifies the experiment.
# The experiment should be set up in a way that avoids unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injuries, except, in experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.
# It should not be conducted when there is any reason to believe that it implies a risk of death or disabling injury.
# The risks of the experiment should be in proportion to (that is, not exceed) the expected humanitarian benefits.
# Preparations and facilities must be provided that adequately protect the subjects against the experiment's risks.
# The staff who conduct or take part in the experiment must be fully trained and scientifically qualified.
# The human subjects must be free to immediately quit the experiment at any point when they feel physically or mentally unable to go on.
# Likewise, the medical staff must stop the experiment at any point when they observe that continuation would be dangerous.

==Authorship==
The Nuremberg Code was initially ignored, but gained much greater significance about 20 years after it was written. As a result, there were substantial rival claims for the creation of the Code. Some claimed that [[Harold Sebring]], one of the three U.S. judges who presided over the [[Doctors' trial|Doctors' Trial]], was the author. [[Leo Alexander]], MD and [[Andrew Conway Ivy|Andrew Ivy]], MD, the prosecution's chief medical expert witnesses, were also each identified as authors. In his letter to [[Maurice Henry Pappworth|Maurice H. Pappworth]], an English physician and the author of the book ''[[Human Guinea Pigs]]'', Andrew Ivy claimed sole authorship of the Code. Leo Alexander, approximately 30 years after the trial, also claimed sole authorship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gaw, Allan. "Reality and revisionism: new evidence for Andrew C Ivy's claim to authorship of the Nuremberg Code." ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 107.4 (2014): 138-143.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after careful reading of the transcript of the Doctors' Trial, background documents, and the final judgements, it is more accepted that the authorship was shared and the Code grew out of the trial itself.&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, Evelyne. "Fifty years later: the significance of the Nuremberg Code." ''New England Journal of Medicine'' 337.20 (1997): 1436-1440.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The Nuremberg Code has not been officially accepted as law by any nation or as official ethics guidelines by any association. In fact, the Code's reference to [[Hippocratic Oath|Hippocratic duty]] to the individual patient and the need to provide information was not initially favored by the [[American Medical Association]]. The Western world initially dismissed the Nuremberg Code as a "code for barbarians" and not for civilized physicians and investigators. Additionally, the final judgement did not specify whether the Nuremberg Code should be applied to cases such as [[political prisoner]]s, convicted felons, and healthy volunteers. The lack of clarity, the brutality of the unethical medical experiments, and the uncompromising language of the Nuremberg Code created an image that the Code was designed for singularly egregious transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jay. "The Nuremberg code and the Nuremberg trial: A reappraisal." ''Jama'' 276.20 (1996): 1662-1666.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Code is considered to be the most important document in the history of [[clinical research ethics]], which had a massive influence on global human rights. The Nuremberg Code and the related [[Declaration of Helsinki]] are the basis for the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 45 Part 46,&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-03.html|title=Patients' rights: from Alder Hey to the Nuremberg Code|last=Hurren|first=Elizabeth|date=May 2002|publisher=History &amp; Policy|location=[[United Kingdom]]|work=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/45cfr46_00.html|title=Public Welfare|date=2000-10-01|publisher=Access.gpo.gov|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the regulations issued by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] for the ethical treatment of human subjects, and are used in [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] (IRBs). In addition, the idea of [[informed consent]] has been universally accepted and now constitutes Article 7 of the United Nations' [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. It also served as the basis for [[International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects]] proposed by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">The '''PAD emotional state model''' is a [[psychology|psychological]] model developed by [[Albert Mehrabian]]  and James A. Russell (1974 and after) to describe and measure [[Affect measures|emotional states]]. PAD uses three numerical dimensions, '''P'''leasure, '''A'''rousal and '''D'''ominance to represent all [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name=Mehrabian1&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic dimensions for a general psychological theory |first=Albert |last=Mehrabian |year=1980 |isbn=0-89946-004-6 |pages=39–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social interaction systems: theory and measurement |first=Robert Freed |last=Bales |year=2001 |isbn=0-7658-0872-2 |pages=139–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial use was in a theory of [[environmental psychology]], the core idea being that physical environments influence people through their emotional impact.&lt;ref name="Mehrabian Russell 1974"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=A. Mehrabian |author2=J. A. Russell|title= An approach to environmental psychology|edition= 1 |year= 1974|publisher= Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press. |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently used by Peter Lang and colleagues to propose a physiological theory of emotion.&lt;ref name="Lang et al 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lang| first1 = P. J. | year = 1990| title = Emotion, attention, and the startle reflex| url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 97| issue = | pages = 377–395 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.97.3.377 | pmid=2200076}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by James A. Russell to develop a theory of emotional episodes (relatively brief emotionally charged events).&lt;ref name="Russell 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russell| first1 = J. A. | year = 1980| title = A circumplex model of affect| url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39| issue = | pages = 1161–1178 | doi= 10.1037/h0077714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russell| first1 = J. A. | year = 2003| title = Core affect and the psychological construction of emotion| url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 110| issue = | pages = 145–172 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.1.145 | pmid=12529060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PA part of PAD was developed into a [[Emotion classification#Circumplex model|circumplex model of emotion experience]], and those two dimensions were termed "core affect".  The D part of PAD was re-conceptualized as part of the appraisal process in an emotional episode (a cold cognitive assessment of the situation eliciting the emotion).  A more fully developed version of this approach is termed the psychological construction theory of emotion.

The PAD (''Pleasure'', ''Arousal'', ''Dominance'') model has been used to study [[nonverbal communication]] such as [[body language]] in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nonverbal communication |first=Albert |last=Mehrabian |year=2007 |isbn=0-202-30966-5 |pages=10–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been applied to consumer marketing and the construction of [[animated character]]s that express emotions in [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name= Ratneshwar /&gt;&lt;ref name= Becker /&gt;

==The dimensional structure==
PAD uses three-dimensional scales which in theory could have any numerical values. The dimensional structure is reminiscent of the 19th century work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who also used a three-dimensional system and also the 20th century work of [[Charles E. Osgood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social interaction systems: theory and measurement |first=Robert Freed |last=Bales |year=2001 |isbn=0-7658-0872-2 |pages=137–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Measurement of Meaning|last2=Suci|first2=George J.|last3=Tannenbaum|first3=Percy H.|date=1957|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-74539-3|location=Urbana, Illinois, USA|last1=Osgood|first1=Charles Egerton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pleasure-Displeasure Scale'' measures how pleasant or unpleasant one feels about something. For instance both anger and fear are unpleasant emotions, and both score on the displeasure side. However joy is a pleasant emotion.&lt;ref name=Mehrabian1 /&gt;

The ''Arousal-Nonarousal Scale'' measures how energized or soporific one feels.  It is not the intensity of the emotion -- for grief and depression can be low arousal intense feelings. While both anger and rage are unpleasant emotions, rage has a higher intensity or a higher arousal state. However boredom, which is also an unpleasant state, has a low arousal value.&lt;ref name=Mehrabian1 /&gt;

The ''Dominance-Submissiveness Scale'' represents the controlling and dominant versus controlled or submissive one feels. For instance while both fear and anger are unpleasant emotions, anger is a dominant emotion, while fear is a submissive emotion.&lt;ref name=Mehrabian1 /&gt;

A more abbreviated version of the model uses just 4 values for each dimension, providing only 64 values for possible emotions. For instance, anger is a quite unpleasant, quite aroused, and moderately dominant emotion, while boredom is slightly unpleasant, quite unaroused, and mostly non-dominant.

==Applications==

===Marketing===
The abbreviated model has also been used in organizational studies where the emotions towards specific entities or products marketed by them are measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Research companion to emotion in organizations |first=Neal M. |last=Ashkanasy |first2=Cary L. |last2=Cooper |year=2008 |isbn=1-84542-637-1 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAD model has been used in studying consumer behavior in stores, to determine the effects of pleasure and arousal on issues such as extra time spent in the store and unplanned spending.&lt;ref name= Ratneshwar&gt;{{cite book |title=The why of consumption: contemporary perspectives on consumer motives |first=S. |last=Ratneshwar |first2=David |last2=Glen |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-31617-0 |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual emotional characters===
The PAD model, and the corresponding ''PAD Space'' have been used in the construction of animated agents that exhibit emotions.For instance, Becker et al. describe how primary and secondary emotions can be mapped via the PAD space to features in the faces of animated characters to reflect happiness, boredom, frustration or annoyance.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite book |first=Christian |last=Becker |first2=Stefan |last2=Kopp |chapter=Why Emotions should be Integrated into Conversational Agents |title=Conversational informatics: an engineering approach |editor-first=Toyoaki |editor-last=Nishida |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-4700-2699-1|pages=49–59, 61 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lance et al. discuss how the PAD model can be used to study gaze behavior in animated agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brent |last=Lance |chapter=Relation between Gaze Behavior and Attribution of Emotion |title=Intelligent virtual agents: 8th international conference |publisher=IVA |year=2008 |editor-first=Helmut |editor-last=Prendinger |isbn=3-540-85482-7 |pages=1–9 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang et al. describe how the PAD model can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of [[avatar (computing)|avatars]]. In this approach the PAD model is used as a high level emotional space, and the lower level space is the [[MPEG-4]] [[Face_Animation_Parameter|Facial Animation Parameters (FAP)]]. A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two level structure: the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Zhang |chapter=Facial Expression Synthesis using PAD Emotional Parameters for a Chinese Expressive Avatar |title=Affective computing and intelligent interaction |editor-first=Ana |editor-last=Paiva |editor2-first=Rui |editor2-last=Prada |editor3-first=Rosalind W. |editor3-last=Picard |year=2007 |isbn=3-540-74888-1 |pages=24–33 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6246">Most real databases contain data whose correctness is uncertain. In order to work with such data, there is a need to quantify the integrity of the data. This is achieved by using probabilistic databases.

A '''probabilistic database''' is an [[uncertain database]] in which the [[possible worlds]] have associated [[probability|probabilities]]. Probabilistic [[database management system]]s are currently an active area of research. "While there are currently no commercial probabilistic database systems, several research prototypes exist..."&lt;ref&gt;Vinod Muthusamy, Haifeng Liu, Hans-Arno Jacobsen: [http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jacobsen/ptopss.pdf Predictive Publish/Subscribe Matching.] University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probabilistic databases distinguish between the [[logical data model]] and the physical representation of the data much like [[relational database]]s do in the [[ANSI-SPARC Architecture]].
In probabilistic databases this is even more crucial since such databases have to represent very large numbers of possible worlds, often exponential in the size of one world (a classical [[database]]), [[succinct data structure|succinctly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nilesh N. Dalvi]], [[Dan Suciu]]: Efficient query evaluation on probabilistic databases. VLDB J. 16(4): 523-544 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyublena Antova]], [[Christoph Koch]], [[Dan Olteanu]]: 10^(10^6) Worlds and Beyond: Efficient Representation and Processing of Incomplete Information. ICDE 2007: 606-615&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

In a probabilistic database, each data item←relation, tuple and value that an attribute can take—is associated with a probability ∈ (0,1], with 0 representing that the data is certainly incorrect, and 1 representing that it is certainly correct.

===Possible Worlds===

A probabilistic database could exist in multiple states. For example, if we are uncertain about the existence of a tuple in the database, then the database could be in two different states with respect to that tuple—the first state contains the tuple, while the second one does not. Similarly, if an attribute can take one of the values ''x'', ''y'' or ''z'', then the database can be in three different states with respect to that attribute.

Each of these ''states'' is called a possible world.

Consider the following database:

{| border=1 align=center
 |+ An Incomplete Database
 |-
 !A!!B
 |-
 |a1||b1
 |-
 |a2||b2
 |-
 |a3||{b3,b3′,b3′′}
 |-
 |}

&lt;small&gt;(Here ''{b3,b3′,b3′′}'' denotes that the attribute can take any of the values ''b3'',''b3′'' or ''b3′′'')&lt;/small&gt;

*Let us assume that we are uncertain about the first tuple, certain about the second tuple and uncertain about the value of attribute '''B''' in the third tuple.

Then the actual state of the database may or may not contain the first tuple (depending on whether it is correct or not). Similarly, the value of the attribute '''B''' may be ''b3'',''b3′'' or ''b3′′''.

Consequently, the possible worlds corresponding to the database are as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100" align=center
|+ World 1
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 ||align=center| b1

|}

===Types of Uncertainties===

There are essentially two kinds of uncertainties that could exist in a probabilistic database, as described in the table below:

{| border=1 align=center
|+ Types of Uncertainties
|-
! Tuple-level uncertainty !! Attribute-level uncertainty
|-

By assigning values to random variables associated with the data items, we can represent different possible worlds.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Q'' value (nuclear science)}}
In [[nuclear physics]] and [[nuclear chemistry|chemistry]], the '''''Q'' value''' for a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] is the amount of energy absorbed or released during the nuclear reaction. The value relates to the [[enthalpy]] of a chemical reaction or the energy of radioactive decay products. It can be determined from the masses of reactants and products. Q values affect reaction rates. In general, the larger the positive Q value for the reaction, the faster the reaction proceeds, and the more likely the reaction is to "favor" the products.
Q value=(mp-mr)931Mev
where,mr=sum of the masses of reactants.
mp=sum of the masses of products.

== Definition ==
The conservation of energy, between the initial and final energy of a nuclear process (&lt;math&gt;E_\text{i} = E_\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;), enables the general definition of ''Q'' based on the [[mass-energy equivalence]]. For any radioactive particle decay, the kinetic energy difference will be given by:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = K_\text{f} - K_\text{i} = (m_\text{i}- m_\text{f})c^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' denotes the kinetic energy of the mass ''m''.
A reaction with a positive ''Q'' value is [[exothermic]], i.e. has a net release of energy, since the kinetic energy of the final state is greater than the kinetic energy of the initial state.
A reaction with a negative ''Q'' value is [[endothermic]], i.e. requires a net energy input, since the kinetic energy of the final state is less than the kinetic energy of the initial state.&lt;ref name="Krane"&gt;

 |year=1988
 |title=Introductory Nuclear Physics
 |page=381
 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]
 |isbn=978-0-471-80553-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observe that a chemical reaction is exothermic when it has a ''negative'' enthalpy of reaction, in contrast a positive Q value in a nuclear reaction.

The Q value can also be expressed in terms of the [[Binding energy|binding energies]] of the nuclear species as:

&lt;math&gt;Q=B_f-B_i&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Note that the count of nucleons is conserved in a nuclear reaction. Hence, total reactant protons = total product protons and total reactant neutrons = total product neutrons. Hence, the sum of binding energy and rest mass energy of nuclei of both reactant and products are same. In other words, &lt;math&gt;B_i+m_ic^2=B_f+m_fc^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Using the first relation (&lt;math&gt;Q = (m_\text{i}- m_\text{f})c^2  &lt;/math&gt;), this proof is complete.

== Applications ==
Chemical ''Q'' values are measurement in [[calorimetry]].  Exothermic chemical reactions tend to be more spontaneous and can emit light or heat, resulting in runaway feedback(i.e. explosions).

''Q'' values are also featured in [[particle physics]]. For example, Sargent's rule states that weak reaction rates are proportional to ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The ''Q'' value is the [[kinetic energy]] released in the decay at rest. For neutron decay, some mass disappears as neutrons convert to a proton, electron and antineutrino:&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book

 |isbn=978-0-471-97285-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Q = (m_\text{n} - m_\text{p} - m_\mathrm{\overline{\nu}} - m_\text{e})c^2 = K_\text{p} + K_\text{e} +K_{\overline{\nu}}= 0.782~\text{MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the [[neutron]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the [[proton]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|&amp;nu;}}&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the [[electron antineutrino]] and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the [[electron]]; and the ''K'' are the corresponding kinetic energies. The neutron has no initial kinetic energy since it is at rest. In beta decay, a typical ''Q'' is around 1 MeV.

The decay energy is divided among the products in a continuous distribution for more than 2 products.  Measuring this spectrum allows one to find the mass of a product. Experiments are studying emission spectrums to search for neutrinoless decay and neutrino mass; this is the principle of the ongoing [[KATRIN]] experiment.

'''''Race: The Reality of Human Differences''''' is an [[anthropology]] book, in which authors [[Vincent M. Sarich]], Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Frank Miele]], senior editor of [[Skeptic Magazine]], argue for the reality of [[race (human classification)|race]]. The book was published by [[Basic Books]] in 2004. It disputes the statements of the PBS documentary ''[[Race: The Power of an Illusion]]'' aired in 2003.

After arguing that human races exist, the authors put forth three different political systems that take race into account in the final chapter, "Learning to Live with Race."  These are "[[Meritocracy]] in the Global Marketplace", "[[Affirmative Action]] and Race Norming", and "Resegregation and the Emergence of Ethno-States."  Sarich and Miele list the advantages and disadvantages of each system and advocate Global Meritocracy as the best of the three options. The authors then discuss "the horrific prospect of [[ethnic bioweapon|ethnically targeted weapons]],"&lt;ref&gt;Page 248 of the paperback edition&lt;/ref&gt; which they view as technically feasible but not very likely to be used.

In [[classical mechanics]], a '''reactive centrifugal force''' forms part of an action–reaction pair with a [[centripetal force]].

In accordance with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law of motion]], an object moves in a straight line in the absence of any external forces acting on the object. A curved path may however ensue when a force acts on it; this force is often called a [[centripetal force]], as it is directed toward the center of curvature of the path. Then in accordance with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]], there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some other object,&lt;ref name=Roche&gt;

Unlike the [[inertial force]] or [[fictitious force]] known as [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]], which always exists in addition to the reactive force in the rotating frame of reference, the reactive force is a real Newtonian [[force]] that is observed in any reference frame.  The two forces will only have the same magnitude in the special cases where circular motion arises and where the axis of rotation is the origin of the rotating frame of reference. It is the reactive force that is the subject of this article.&lt;ref name=mook&gt;

[[File:Reactive centrifugal force in uniform circular motion.PNG|thumb|A ball in circular motion held by a string tied to a fixed post.]]

The figure at right shows a ball in [[uniform circular motion]] held to its path by a massless string tied to an immovable post. The figure is an example of a centrifugally-directed real force.  In this system a [[centripetal force]] upon the ball provided by the string maintains the circular motion, and the reaction to it, usually called the ''reactive centrifugal force'' acts upon the string. In this model, the string is assumed massless and the rotational motion frictionless, so no propelling force is needed to keep the ball in circular motion.

[[Newton's first law]] requires that any body not moving in a straight line is subject to a force, and the [[free body diagram]] shows the force upon the ball (center panel) exerted by the string to maintain the ball in its circular motion.

[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law]] of action and reaction states that if the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, the ball will exert an equal but outward reaction upon the string, shown in the free body diagram of the string (lower panel) as the ''reactive centrifugal force''.

The string transmits the reactive centrifugal force from the ball to the fixed post, pulling upon the post. Again according to Newton's third law, the post exerts a reaction upon the string, labeled the ''post reaction'', pulling upon the string. The two forces upon the string are equal and opposite, exerting no ''net'' force upon the string (assuming that the string is massless), but placing the string under tension.

The reason the post appears to be "immovable" is because it is fixed to the earth. If the rotating ball was tethered to the mast of a boat, for example, the boat mast and ball would both experience rotation about a central point.

==Applications==

Even though the reactive centrifugal is rarely used in analyses in the physics literature, the concept is applied within some mechanical engineering concepts. An example of this kind of engineering concept is an analysis of the stresses within a rapidly rotating turbine blade.&lt;ref name=Roche/&gt; The blade can be treated as a stack of layers going from the axis out to the edge of the blade. Each layer exerts an outward (centrifugal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially inward layer and an inward (centripetal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially outward layer. At the same time the inner layer exerts an elastic centripetal force on the middle layer, while and the outer layer exerts an elastic centrifugal force, which results in an internal stress. It is the stresses in the blade and their causes that mainly interest mechanical engineers in this situation.

[[File:Frizione centrifuga.jpg|thumb|left|250px |A two-shoe '''centrifugal clutch'''. The motor spins the input shaft that makes the shoes go around, and the outer drum (removed) turns the output power shaft.]]

Another example of a rotating device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified used to describe the system behavior is the [[centrifugal clutch]].  A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension.  At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces.  The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Anthony G. Atkins, Tony Atkins and Marcel Escudier | title = A Dictionary of Mechanical Engineering | date = 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 9780199587438 | page = 53 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0TjtKmSIL48C&amp;pg=PA53 | accessdate = 5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the [[centrifugal clutch]] illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.

== Difference from centrifugal pseudoforce ==
Any force directed away from a center can be called "centrifugal".  ''Centrifugal'' simply means "directed outward from the center".&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/centrifugal&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, ''centripetal'' means "directed toward the center".&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/centripetal&lt;/ref&gt;  The "reactive centrifugal force" discussed in this article is not the same thing as the [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal pseudoforce]], which is usually what's meant by the term "centrifugal force".

Reactive centrifugal force, being one-half of the reaction pair together with centripetal force, is a concept which applies in any reference frame. This distinguishes it from the inertial or fictitious centrifugal force, which appears only in rotating frames.

== Gravitational two-body case ==

In a two-body rotation, such as a planet and moon rotating about their common center of mass or [[barycentre]], the forces on both bodies are centripetal. In that case, the reaction to the centripetal force of the planet on the moon is the centripetal force of the moon on the planet.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;

==Plot==

After failing to be the first to reach the South pole by only 97 miles in 1909, Shackleton set out to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent via the pole. The expedition met disastrous results when its ship became trapped and ultimately crushed in the ice pack. Shackleton and his 28-man crew endured the long polar winter before ultimately finding rescue following an 800-mile open boat voyage on the Weddell sea. Against all odds, the entire crew of ''The Endurance'' survived.  [[Frank Hurley|Frank Hurley's]] original film footage was used by Butler along with interviews of surviving relatives to present the story of Shackleton's expedition.

==Reception==
The film was well received by critics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-endurance/ The Endurance entry] [[rottentomatoes.com]], accessed January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264578/awards Endurance awards page] [[IMDb.com]], accessed January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler followed it up the next year with another documentary about Shackleton's expedition entitled ''[[Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure]]''.

The '''WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children''' is a list, proposed by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), of the most effective and safe [[medicines]] for use in children up to 12 years of age needed to meet the most important needs in a basic [[health system|health-care system]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017Def&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential medicines|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/services/essmedicines_def/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is divided into core items and complementary items. The core items are deemed to be the most [[cost effective]] options for key health problems and are usable with little additional health care resources. The complementary items frequently require additional infrastructure such as specially trained [[health care providers]] or [[diagnostic equipment]]. The first list for children was created in 2007, and the list is now in its 5th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children 5th List|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EMLc_2015_FINAL_amended_AUG2015.pdf?ua=1|website=who.int|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: In the following article, an [[Alpha|α]] indicates the medicine is a complementary item, for which specialised diagnostic or monitoring and/or specialist training are needed. An item may also be listed as complementary on the basis of higher costs and/or a less attractive cost/benefit ratio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6013">The '''Zendian problem''' was an exercise in communication intelligence operations (mainly [[traffic analysis]] and [[cryptanalysis]]) devised by [[Lambros D. Callimahos]] as part of an advanced course, CA-400, that Callimahos taught to [[National Security Agency]] [[cryptanalysts]] starting in the 1950s.

==Content==
The scenario involves 375 radio messages said to have been intercepted on December 23 by the [[United States Army|US Army]] contingent of a [[United Nations]] force landed on the fictional island of Zendia in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

A typical intercept looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
XYR DE OWN 4235KCS 230620T USM-99/00091

9516 8123 0605 7932 8423 5095 8444 6831

JAAAJ EUEBD OETDN GXAWR SUTEU   EIWEN YUENN ODEUH RROMM EELGE
AEGID TESRR RASEB ENORS RNOMM   EAYTU NEONT ESFRS NTCRO QCEET
OCORE IITLP OHSRG SSELY TCCSV   SOTIU GNTIV EVOMN TMPAA CIRCS
ENREN OTSOI ENREI EKEIO PFRNT   CDOGE NYFPE TESNI EACEA ISTEM

SREEE USSDS DHOAH REEXI PROUT   NTTHD JAAAJ EUEBD
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

For each message, the first line is provided by the [[SIGINT|intercept]] operator, giving [[call sign]]s, [[frequency]], time, and reference number.  The rest of the message is a transcript of the [[Morse code]] transmission.

At the beginning of the intercepted message there is a header which consists of 8 four-digit groups. Initially, the meaning of the numeric header is not known; the meanings of various components of this header (such as a [[serial number]] assigned by the transmitting organization's message center) can be worked out through traffic analysis.

The rest of the message consists of "indicators" and [[encryption|ciphertext]]; the first group is evidently a "discriminant" indicating the cryptosystem used, and (depending on the cryptosystem) some or all of the second group may contain a message-specific [[key (cryptography)|keying]] element such as initial [[rotor machine|rotor]] settings.  The first two groups are repeated at the end of the message, which allows correction of garbled indicators.  The remaining characters are encrypted text.  Since the transmissions always use complete groups, "nulls" may have been used to [[Padding (cryptography)#Classical cryptography|pad out]] the text.

Cryptosystems employed include [[transposition cipher|transposition]], dinome, and [[Rotor machine|rotor]]-based [[cipher]]s and a [[one-part code]].  While these can be successfully tackled without use of a computer, solution is not easy.  The practical exercise reinforces many basic principles, including ways to exploit having a ''collection'' of message traffic.

A certain amount of [[cleartext]] inter-operator "chatter" is also provided, and may help with the analysis.

Headers and discriminants are also given for intercepts from the next three days; these may be used for traffic analysis and in determining daily operating procedures.

==Availability==
The Zendian problem has been [[classified information|declassified]] and is available either as part of ''[[Military Cryptanalytics]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Callimahos, Lambros D.  |author2=Friedman, William F  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Military Cryptanalytics, Part II, Volume II |publisher=Aegean Park Press | isbn=0-89412-076-X | location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a book in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Callimahos, Lambros D. | title=Traffic Analysis and the Zendian Problem |publisher=Aegean Park Press | isbn=0-89412-161-8 | year=1989 | location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were published as reprints by [[Aegean Park Press]], Walnut Creek, CA, USA.  There are a few small differences in the ciphertext between these sources, with neither being entirely error-free; indeed, some errors were intentional, and dealing with them is part of the learning process.

Karl Heinz-Everts' Web site provides a link to a downloadable archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.karlheinz-everts.de/messages.zip
| title=Problem of Zendia – Messages
| publisher=Karl Heinz-Everts
| year=2009
| accessdate=2015-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the "intercepts."  (The site also provides analysis and partial solutions, which should ''not'' be viewed by anyone wishing to learn from working on this exercise.)

==The Dundee Society==
{{Main|Dundee Society}}
Cryptanalists who successfully finished CA-400 became members of the [[Dundee Society]]. This society was founded by Lambros D. Callimahos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/hall-of-honor/2003/lcallimahos.shtml
| title=Lambros D. Callimahos, 1910–1977 (NSA Hall of Honor)
| publisher=National Security Agency
| year=2003
| accessdate=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was so named after the empty Dundee marmalade jar on his desk, as he couldn't disclose the society's real purpose.

==Map of Zendia==
[[File:Zendia lores.jpg|thumb|Low-resolution map of Zendia from textbook]]

A large print showing the fictional nation of Zendia hangs on the wall of the library at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]], which is operated by the NSA. Copies of this map, shrunken to such a degree that most feature labels are illegible, appear in the previously cited books.
