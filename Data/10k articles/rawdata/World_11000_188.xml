The '''Air Operations Control Station Nieuw-Milligen''' (AOCS NM) of the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] is located near [[Nieuw-Milligen]] (in the municipality of [[Apeldoorn]]).
[[File:Air Operations Control Station Nieuw-Milligen map.png|thumbnail|left|Open Street Map of the base.]]
It is home to:
*the 710th Sqn. Control &amp; Reporting Centre Squadron (CRC)
*the 711th Sqn. Air Traffic Control Squadron (MilATCC, i.e. Military Air Traffic Control Centre)
*the 970th Sqn. Support Squadron

It is the [[air traffic control]] centre for all military air traffic in the Netherlands, as well as the centre for Air Battle Management, Air Surveillance, Fighter and [[Surface-to-Air Missile|SAM]] Control, and Alerting. Air traffic control and information service is also provided to civilian traffic operating within its airspace. AOCS NM uses ''Dutch Mil'' as its callsign for air traffic control services, and ''Bandbox'' as a callsign for the military Control and Reporting Centre (CRC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensie.nl/english/organisation/air-force/contents/bases-and-units/air-operations-control-station-nieuw-milligen Defensie.nl - Air Operations Control Station Nieuw Milligen], official website of the Dutch military, Dutch only. Page retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The base started out as a [[remount]] facility in 1860 as '''Kamp Nieuw-Milligen.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cgpa-nm.nl/Post_Actieven_AOCS_Nieuw_Milligen/Die_goeie_ouwe_tijd.html|title=Post Actieven AOCS Nieuw Milligen|website=www.cgpa-nm.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small military airstrip was added to the base in 1913, primarily for diversions, and this remained in use as such until 1940, when it was destroyed by the Dutch military to prevent it from being used by the [[Germany|Germans]]. The [[runway]] was not rebuilt after the war, but there is a [[helipad]], located on the north side of the base. 

The ICAO codes refer to the ATC and CRC units, not the helipad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgottenairfields.com/netherlands/gelderland/nieuw-milligen-s451.html Abandoned and little known airfields - Gelderland], page retrieved July 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio I''' (25 January 1661 – 20 February 1731) was the sovereign [[Prince of Monaco]] from 1701 to 1731. He was the elder son of [[Louis I, Prince of Monaco|Louis I of Monaco]] and [[Catherine Charlotte de Gramont]].

In 1683 Antonio was named lieutenant in the [[Régiment du Roi|Régiment du Roi Infanterie]].  In 1684 he was named colonel of the regiment of Soissonois.

On 21 August 1702 Antonio took the oath to King [[Louis XIV of France]] in the [[Parlement]] on account of being [[Duke of Valentinois]] and a [[Peer of France]].  He was made a knight of the French royal orders in 1724.

==Marriage and children==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1884">''' Australian Antarctic Building System ''' or  '''AANBUS'''  is a [[modular building|modular construction system]] used by the [[Australian Antarctic Division|Australian Government Antarctica Division]] for buildings in [[Antarctica]].  The individual modules resemble [[Intermodal container|shipping container]]s.  Each module is approximately 3.6 metres by 6 metres by 4 metres high.

Buildings built using the AANBUS modules are placed on [[concrete]] [[Foundation (engineering)#Shallow foundations|footings]] anchored into the ground and do not need external [[guy wires]] to anchor and support them.  The modules are built of [[steel]] with attached [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[vapor barrier]]s.

The modular design provides improved shipping, speed of assembly in the short [[Antarctic]] summer and better testing before shipping.  The ability to test the assembled modules allows corrections to be made in the convenience of construction sites in [[temperate climates]] with easy access to parts and equipment, rather than at remote Antarctic locations where shipping in of replacement parts is an arduous undertaking.

'''B. A. D.''' was a former [[Taiwan]]ese [[boy band]] whose members are Ben Pai, Alex Tien, and Danny Huang. The group's name derives from the initials of the members' given name. Pai, Tien, and Huang met at a singing competition in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and began working together in the spring of 1998.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.ent.tom.com/Archive/1073/1283/2003/2/17-10405.html|title=B.A.D乐队组合介绍及大事记|accessdate=2008-07-30|date=2003-02-17|publisher=[[TOM Online]]|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio was recommended to Liu Wei-tz'u, a manager who eventually sent them to Taiwan to work with [[EMI]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Under EMI, the trio released their debut studio album, ''Not Quiet'', on 30 December 2000. Although B.A.D's début went under the radar, their second album, released in November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isrc.ncl.edu.tw/query/uaudiodata.asp?audiocode=0000002882 |script-title=zh:專輯詳細資料 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |publisher=[[International Standard Recording Code]] |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216114407/http://isrc.ncl.edu.tw/query/uaudiodata.asp?audiocode=0000002882 |archivedate=December 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; put the group into the spotlight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6143">The '''Beltsville Information Management Center''' ('''BIMC'''), formerly named the '''Beltsville Messaging Center''' ('''BMC''') and the '''Beltsville Communications Center''' (also known as the '''Beltsville Communications Annex'''), is a [[United States Department of State]] facility located in [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]], [[Maryland]], next door to the U.S. [[Special Collection Service]] (SCS).&lt;ref name=pike96&gt;{{cite web |last=Pike |first=John |title=State Department: Beltsville Communications Annex |date=April 28, 1996 |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/facility/odell.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010803054524/http://www.fas.org/irp/facility/odell.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2001 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the primary relay facility for the [[Diplomatic Telecommunications Service]] and services the communications needs of various U.S. government programs and agencies, including the SCS.

==History==
Prior to 1985, the Department of State's telecommunications system resided at the [[Harry S Truman Building|department's headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] State Department leaders worried that this left the department's communications infrastructure vulnerable to catastrophic disasters and emergencies, and thus in 1984 [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the construction of a backup communications facility, the Beltsville Communications Center, in Beltsville, Maryland, {{convert|14|mi}} north of the capital. The facility has since expanded to become a major communications network management center, serving as the primary hub of the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service.&lt;ref name=hedges&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hedges |first=John S., III |title=At Beltsville, They Get the Message |magazine=[[State Magazine]] |date=May 1998 |issue=414 |pages=16–17 |url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/83431.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=state1&gt;{{cite book |title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 5 Handbook 2: Telecommunications Handbook |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=June 6, 2012 |chapter=5-FAH 2 H-510: DTS Network |chapterurl=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/05FAH02/05FAH020510.html |accessdate=13 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility covers {{convert|142000|sqft}} and, as of 1998, was staffed by 32 [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] and [[United States Foreign Service|foreign service]] employees and 56 contract support personnel.&lt;ref name=hedges /&gt;

==Functions==
According to the Department of State, the BIMC is charged with "eliminating the potential for disruption or loss of telecommunications between the Department and its mission abroad". The Beltsville center must continue to operate when the communications center at the department's headquarters cannot. The '''Alternate Communications Center''', which is housed within the complex, allows messages to be relayed without being routed through the department's primary communications center. In 1998, the center was reported to relay more than 143,000 official records and 90,000 data messages to diplomatic posts and foreign affairs agencies each day. An onsite fuel storage facility can sustain the BIMC for 38 days, while a {{convert|150000|USgal|l|adj=on|abbr=off}} water tank can sustain the center for at least eight days—the site consumes between {{convert|8000|and|10000|USgal|l|abbr=off}} of water each day to maintain a stable temperature and cool mainframe computers. The BIMC also houses the '''Foreign Affairs Data Processing Center''', which moved into a {{convert|99000|sqft}} addition to the complex in 1991.&lt;ref name=hedges /&gt;

The [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) has moved several programs into the BIMC. In 1995, the facility began serving as the central delivery point for USAID's [[information technology]] services. In 1997, USAID moved its Emergency Operations Center to the BIMC.&lt;ref name=hedges /&gt;

===Special Collection Service===

The BIMC is located next door to the headquarters of the U.S. Special Collection Service, a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]]–[[National Security Agency]] eavesdropping program.&lt;ref name=fp12&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Aid |first=Matthew |authorlink=Matthew Aid |title=The Spies Next Door: The Top 10 Beltway Intel Centers Hiding in Plain Sight |magazine=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]] |date=September 21, 2012 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/21/the_spies_next_door |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=today01&gt;{{cite episode |credits=[[Ann Curry]] (anchor), John Pike (guest), [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]] (guest) and [[James Bamford]] (guest) |title=Congress to Hold Closed Hearings on Accused Spy Robert Hanssen Later This Week |series=Today |serieslink=Today (U.S. TV program) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=February 27, 2001 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/010227-spy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', satellite imagery from the 1990s shows fiber optic cable linking the SCS headquarters to the BIMC, which indicates that the BIMC services the communications needs of the SCS.&lt;ref name=fp12 /&gt; According to ''[[The Week]]'', when SCS personnel are deployed abroad, they often work ostensibly as members of the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Brown |first=David W. |title=Inside the secret world of America's top eavesdropping spies |magazine=[[The Week]] |date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/226723/inside-the-secret-world-of-americas-super-sophisticated-eavesdropping-spies |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23257">'''Democracy promotion''', which can also be referred to as '''democracy assistance''', '''democracy support''', or '''democracy building''', is a strand of foreign policy adopted by governments and international organizations that seek to support the spread of [[democracy]] as a [[political system]] around the world.  Among the reasons for supporting democracy include the belief that countries with a democratic system of governance are less likely to go to war, are likely to be economically better off and socially more harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;see Peter Burnell, From Evaluating Democracy Assistance to Appraising Democracy Promotion, Political Studies Association, Political Studies 2008 VOL 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Much experience has been gained in the last twenty years. After [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989]], there was a wave of democratic transitions in former [[communist]] states, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. According to [[Freedom House]], the number of democracies has increased from 41 of 150 in 1974 existing states to 123 of 192 states in 2006&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;Lise Rakner, Alina Rocha Menocal and Verena Fritz (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1344&amp;title=international-democracy-assistance-lessons-learned-can-donors-better-support-democratic-processes Assessing international democracy assistance: Key lessons and challenges] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; (for Freedom House's most recent [http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&amp;year=2007 data]). However, the pace of transition has slowed considerably since the beginning of the twenty-first century, which has encouraged some to ponder the question of whether democracy, far from advancing, may actually be under threat.&lt;ref&gt;Azar Gat, The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers, in Foreign Affairs, July–August 2007, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62644/azar-gat/the-return-of-authoritarian-great-powers]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, scholars have been pointing to a so-called [[democratic deficit]] in countries where democratic systems already exist, including Britain, the USA and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Saskia Sassen, Globalisation, the State and Democratic Deficit, Open Democracy, 18 July 2007, [http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/globalisation_liberal_state_democratic_deficit]; Patrice de Beer, France and Europe: the Democratic Deficit Exposed, Open Democracy, 4 June 2006, [http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-europe_constitution/democractic_deficit_3610.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived challenge currently facing democracy around the world, both in countries where it is already at the core of the system of governance and in those where it is not, is encouraging academics and practitioners alike to re-evaluate what it means to promote, support or assist democracy in the post-[[Cold War]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hobson &amp; Milja Kurki, Democracy and democracy-support: a new era, Open Democracy, 20 March 2009, [http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/idea/democracy-and-democracy-support-a-new-era]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The precise definition of democracy promotion has been debated for more than twenty-five years. The multiplicity of terms used is a manifestation of the plurality of opinions and approaches by international actors, be they governments, [[NGO]]s or other third parties. For example, the term 'promotion' itself can be seen by some as too intrusive, or implying outside interference, whilst 'support' can be seen by some as more benign but, by others, as insufficiently assertive. These days the differences tend to divide into two main camps: those who see it as a political process on one hand and those who see it as a developmental process on the other (see [[international relations]] and [[development aid]] for context).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Carothers, 'Democracy Assistance: Political vs. Developmental', in Journal of Democracy vol.20, no.1, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box
 |title =
 |quote = This basic division between the political and developmental approaches has existed inchoately in the field of democracy support for many years. It has come into sharper relief during this decade, as democracy-aid providers face a world increasingly populated by countries not conforming
to clear or coherent political transitional paths. [...] Some adherents of the developmental approach criticize the political approach as too easily turning confrontational vis-à-vis “host” governments and producing unhelpful counterreactions. Some adherents of the political approach, meanwhile, fault the developmental approach for being too vague and unassertive in a world where many leaders have learned to play a reform game with the international community, absorbing significant amounts of external political aid while avoiding genuine democratization.

At least part of the problem lies in the absence of a consensus on what [[democracy]] constitutes. Indeed, the late Professor W.B. Gallie pointed to the impossibility of finding a firm solution to such a question, by including democracy in a list of '[[essentially contested concepts]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), passim. Kekes (1977, p.71)&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the disagreement over definitions has seen some actors focus on supporting technical systems of democratic governance (elections, government structures and the like), while others take the bottom-up approach of promoting citizen participation and building strong civil and political society to prepare the ground on which systems of government can then be planted.

== Types ==
[[Democracy]] promotion has two main patterns that depend on the type of [[democratization]] a [[State (polity)|state]] is dealing with: external [[Peacekeeping|intervention]] and as a solution to [[civil war]], or supporting an internal push for reform. Democracy promotion advocates are divided on which pattern tends to be most successful for the resources that democracy promotion programs invest; they are similarly divided on which components and factors of the democratization process are most important to the success of [[democratic consolidation]].

=== Post-civil war democratization ===
Civil wars cause a number of problems for democratization. Laura Armey and Robert McNab found that the longer a civil war lasts, and the more casualties it produces, the more hostile the warring factions become to each other; this hostility in turn makes stabilization along terms of peaceful competition, required in a democratic [[Regime type|regime]], more difficult. Problematically for democracy promotion, the same study found that quick, decisive victories for one faction—even an ostensibly pro-democratic rebellion—similarly discourage peaceful, electoral competition for control of a government after the conflict is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armey|first=Laura E.|last2=McNab|first2=Robert M.|date=2015-01-01|title=Democratization and Civil War|url=|journal=Applied Economics|volume=47|issue=18|doi=|issn=1466-4283|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Wantchekon has suggested that one of the most reliable forces of democratization is a stalemated civil war, in which the original motivation for the conflict becomes irrelevant as the costs mount; this impels the factions to turn to a combination of internal and external arbitrators to forge a power-sharing agreement: elections and outside, neutral institutions to guarantee that every faction participates in the new democracy fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=Wantchekon|date=2004-02-01|title=The Paradox of Democracy: A Theoretical Investigation|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0003055404000978|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=null|issue=01|pages=17–33|doi=10.1017/S0003055404000978|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== External intervention ====
External interventions see different levels of democratization success depending on the type of intervener, type of intervention, and level of elite cooperation prior to the intervention. The level of neutrality and geopolitical disinterest the intervener possesses is important, as is the severity of the intervention's infringement on sovereignty. The differences can be highlighted with three examples: a neutral, mostly unobtrusive monitor missions like UN [[Election monitoring|election observers]] in Nicaragua in 1989; the [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] [[Implementation Force|NATO IFOR]] mission in Yugoslavia to enforce [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1031|UN Security Council Resolution 1031]] in 1995; and the [[Unilateralism|unilateral]], destabilizing intervention represented by the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|American invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. All three missions aimed on some level to promote democracy, with varying degrees of success. Michael Doyle and Nicholas Sambanis have found that the peacekeeping missions most successful at producing fledgling democracies have strong mandates backing them up, but tend not to revolve around military enforcement. Successful democratizing interventions consist of monitoring factions' adherence to their [[Settlement (litigation)|negotiated settlement]], while the most successful ones include extensive [[state-building]] (such as improving [[government efficiency]] and [[professionalism]], or classical [[Infrastructure|infrastructure assistance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Michael|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|date=2000-12-01|title=International peacebuilding: A theoretical and quantitative analysis|url=|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=94|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Problems with external intervention ====
Interventions that fail to expend resources on state-building can sometimes be counter-productive to democracy promotion because, as McBride, Milante, and Skaperdas have proposed, a negotiated settlement to a civil war is based on individual factions' faith in the [[State (polity)|state's]] unbiased distribution of the benefits of [[Failed state|stability]]; an external intervention shakes that faith by implying that such faith was misplaced to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=Michael|last2=Milante|first2=Gary|last3=Skaperdas|first3=Stergios|date=2011-06-01|title=Peace and war with endogenous state capacity|url=|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=55|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem raised by Marina Ottaway is that interventions too often rush to implement formal democratic institutions, such as elections, without allowing time for competing elites to separate responsibly; because of the short timeframe, they either unite into a new [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] arrangement or rely on overly divisive party platforms, such as identity, which precludes “permanent fragmentation” of the [[elite]] within a cooperative regime framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|last=Ottaway|first=Marina|publisher=L. Rienner Publishers|year=1995|isbn=1555875602|editor-last=Zartman|editor-first=I. William|location=Boulder, CO|pages=|chapter=Democratization in Collapsed States}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final concern raised with external interventions, particularly unilateral or narrowly multilateral ones, is the perception or actualization of [[imperialism]] or [[neo-imperialism]] in the name of human rights or democracy by an interested party, which, she theorizes, spawns counter-productive [[Nationalism|nationalist]] backlash; however, even neutral monitors must be careful that their reports do not invite a unilateral intervention, as the Council of Freely-Elected Heads of Government's 1989 report on [[Panama]]nian [[Electoral fraud|election fraud]] did for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chand|first=Vikram|date=1997-01-01|title=Democratisation from the outside in: Ngo and international efforts to promote open elections|url=|journal=Third World Quarterly|doi=10.1080/01436599714867|issn=1360-2241|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gradual reformism and the four-player game ===
Another school of thought on how democratization most successfully occurs involves an authoritarian regime transitioning to a democratic one as a result of gradual reforms over time. The basic mechanism for this is a four-player [[Game theory|game theoretical]] set-up in which moderate regime and opposition figures form a pro-democratic reform coalition to sideline their respective hardliners, whom they fear threaten the state's stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Issues in Democratic Consolidation: The New South American Democracies in Comparative Perspective|last=Mainwaring|first=Scott|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|year=1992|isbn=0268012105|location=|pages=|chapter=The Games of Transition}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alfred Stepan and Juan Linz raise a caveat to that picture: it requires both a highly [[institution]]alized regime and public sphere. The regime must not be [[Sultanism|sultanistic]] (based entirely around one central ruler's desires) in order that different members retain some degree of autonomy and have different interests; meanwhile, in the [[public sphere]], there must be a strong [[civil society]] that can both maintain pressure on the authoritarian regime while also providing support for the reform pact and the moderates who formulated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqRn1lAypsgC|title=Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation: Southern Europe, South America, and Post-Communist Europe|last=Linz|first=Juan J.|last2=Stepan|first2=Alfred|date=1996-08-08|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801851582|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ray Salvatore Jennings explains, over the past half century, the success of [[democratic transitions]] has depended substantially on the ability of [[civil society organizations]] (CSOs) to disseminate dissident information to counter authoritarian regimes' narratives, as well as their mobilizing high voter turnout and monitoring the first elections to prevent interference by hardliner members of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Ray Salvatore|date=2012-01-01|title=Democratic breakthroughs: the ingredients of successful revolts|url=|journal=Peaceworks|publisher=US Institute for Peace|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many scholars partial to the gradual reformism perspective on democratization agree with Francis Fukuyama, who asserts that the role of CSOs in directing the part of individuals' lives not under the [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] state's control makes CSOs critical to sustaining the social capital and self-advocacy important for liberal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|date=2001-01-01|title=Social capital, civil society and development|url=|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=22|issue=1|doi=10.1080/713701144 |pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflict over support for internal reform ====
Even beyond the question of what and whether external intervention is an effective democracy support strategy, a number of issues continue to divide the proponents of a democracy support-based international policy. [[Carles Boix]] and Susan Stokes advocate economic development aid, contending that the more advanced an economy, the less willing factions will be to break the peace; others, however, contend that this strategy is only useful at defending democratic consolidation, and not at encouraging democratization of regimes where one faction already dominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Boix|first1=Carles|authorlink1=Carles Boix|last2=Stokes|first2=Susan Carol|date=2003-01-01|title=Endogenous Democratization|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v055/55.4boix.html|journal=World Politics|volume=55|issue=4|pages=517–549|doi=10.1353/wp.2003.0019|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others fall in Freytag and Heckelman's camp, advocating the long-game, positing that although [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] programs have so far had little net effect on democratization, they have demonstrably improved basic democratic features, including civil society and the electoral process, in countries receiving aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freytag|first=Andreas|date=2012-12-01|title=Has Assistance from USAID been Successful for Democratization? Evidence from the Transition Economies of Eastern Europe and Eurasia|url=|journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics JITE|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that not all CSOs will be helpful in promoting democracy—if the organization is too large to inspire its members, or its constituents' identity is too narrowly defined, the organization will fail to support four-player democratic transition pacts, and may even encourage divisiveness and civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orjuela|first=Camilla|date=2005-07-01|title=Civil Society in Civil War: The Case of Sri Lanka.|url=|journal=Civil Wars|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some concern that the international community may be propping up NGOs to the point that they themselves become an unrepresentative elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bermeo|first=Nancy|date=2003-04-01|title=What the democratization literature says--or doesn't say--about postwar democratization|url=|journal=Global Governance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag''' of the '''[[Maakhir]]''' ''de facto'' autonomous region of Somalia was originally established with the declaration of the first Maakhir government, though with the emergency in Maakhir in early 2008, President [[Jibrell Ali Salad]] called for a new government to better address the needs of Maakhiris.  A new flag was then proposed for Maakhir, which is the current flag.

Her father is [[Tuoni]] and her mother [[Tuonetar]]. Kalma may also have several sisters, Kipu-Tyttö, Kivutar, [[Loviatar]], and [[Vammatar]], all of whom live in the Finnish [[underworld]] realm of [[Tuonela]]. Kalma is accompanied and protected by [[Surma (Finnish mythology)|Surma]], a dog-like creature whose name literally means ''death" (though the word "surma" is usually used to refer to someone being killed, as opposed to dying of natural causes)'.&lt;ref name=angel&gt;{{cite web|title=TUONI|url=http://www.angelfire.com/planet/mythguide/tuoni.html|publisher=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">A '''legényes''' (in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or '''feciorească''' (in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) is a men&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s solo dance done by Transylvanian people (both ethnic Hungarian and Romanian) living in the [[Kalotaszeg]]/Ţara Călatei, Szilágyság/Sălaj and [[Transylvanian Plain|Mezőség/Câmpia Transilvaniei]] regions of [[Transylvania]], roughly the region around [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eliznik.org.uk/RomaniaDance/transylvanian_group.htm Dance description. Seen June, 6, 2010] {{en icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is performed freestyle usually by one dancer at a time in front of the band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side and sing/shout verses while the men dance. Each lad does a number of points (dance phrases) typically 4 to 8 without repetition. Each point consists of 4 parts, each lasting 4 counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="863">'''Otto''' (died 643 or 644) was the [[mayor of the palace]] of [[Austrasia]] briefly in the mid-seventh century.

Otto was the son of a ''[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]'' named Uro who served in the court of [[Dagobert I]]. Otto was raised with Dagobert's son [[Sigebert III]] and subsequently acted as Sigebert III's ''baiolos'' ([[bailiff]]?). On the death of [[Pepin of Landen]] in 639 or 640, Otto challenged the succession of [[Grimoald I|Grimoald]] to the mayorship. Otto was eventually murdered by [[Leuthard II, Duke of Alemannia]], at the request of Grimoald.

'''Palazzo Constanzo''' is a palace in [[Mdina]], [[Malta]], situated on Villegaignon Street. It was formerly the residence of a noble Sicilian family, having been constructed in 1666 by Tomaso Costanzo.&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; The building was later converted into a restaurant.&lt;ref name="Latzke2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans E.

The building has two floors along with underground cellars. Its façade is symmetrical, and it includes a rectangular doorway, above which is a small oval window and an open balcony. Two windows flank the door and balcony on either side. The corbels and surrounds of the doors and windows are decorated with simple designs.&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt;

It is scheduled as a Grade 1 monument and it is listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name="nicpmi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palazzo Costanzo|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01191.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|date=28 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222105916/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01191.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossils of the [[Archaeoceti|early whale]] genus ''[[Saghacetus]]'' ("Sagha whale", originally named "''Zeuglodon osiris''") were first collected at Qasr al Sagha by German explorer [[Georg August Schweinfurth]] in January 1886 (a well-preserved dentary).''Saghacetus'' is common in the middle of Qasr el Sagha, but there are few other specimens of archaeocetes whales; the only exception being the enigmatic "''Prozeuglodon stromeri''", named in 1828 based on specimens from 1904, but never adequately described before their destruction during the [[Bombing of Munich in World War II|bombing of Munich]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gingerich|2007|pp=363–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63213">The '''resource curse''', also known as the '''paradox of plenty''', refers to the [[paradox]] that countries with an abundance of [[natural resource]]s (such as [[fossil fuel]]s and certain [[mineral]]s), tend to have less [[economic growth]], less [[democracy]], and worse [[economic development|development]] outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. There are many theories and much academic debate about the reasons for, and exceptions to, these adverse outcomes. Most experts believe the resource curse is not universal or inevitable, but affects certain types of countries or regions under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Venables 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Resource curse thesis ==
The idea that  resources might be more of an economic curse than a blessing began to emerge in debates in the 1950s and 1960s about the economic problems of low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name="Ross 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Michael L.|title=The Political Economy of the Resource Curse|journal=World Politics|date=January 1999|volume=51|issue=2|pages=297–322|doi=10.1017/S0043887100008200}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 1711 the Spectator wrote "It is generally observed, That in Countries of the greatest Plenty there is the poorest Living"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/spectator/outputdjvu.php?filepath=./specv01/INDEX.djvu&amp;pageno=p0680.djvu|title=The Spectator|last=Steele|first=|publisher=|year=1711|isbn=|location=|pages=Number 200, October 19th 1711}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so this was not a completely new observation. The term ''resource curse'' was first used by Richard Auty in 1993 to describe how countries rich in mineral resources were unable to use that wealth to boost their economies and how, counter-intuitively, these countries had lower economic growth than countries without an abundance of natural resources. An influential study by [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and Andrew Warner found a strong correlation between natural resource abundance and poor [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Warner|first2=Andrew|title=Natural Resource Abundance and Economic Growth|journal=NBER Working Paper|date=1995|issue=5398|doi=10.3386/w5398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have now evaluated the effects of resource wealth on a wide range of economic outcomes, and offered many explanations for how, why, and when a resource curse is likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Venables 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venables|first1=Anthony J.|title=Using Natural Resources for Development: Why Has It Proven So Difficult?|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=February 2016|volume=30|issue=1|pages=161–184|doi=10.1257/jep.30.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Natural Resource Curse: A Survey of Diagnoses and Some Prescriptions|journal=HKS Faculty Research Working Paper Series|date=2012|issue=RWP12{{hyphen}}014|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:8694932}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "the lottery analogy has value but also has shortcomings",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWJdAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT81 |title=Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend: Examining its Suitability as a Model |editor1-first=Karl |editor1-last=Widerquist |editor2-first=Michael W. |editor2-last=Howard |chapter=Politics, the Preservation of Natural Resource Wealth, and the Funding of a Basic Income Guarantee |first1=James B. |last1=Bryan |first2=Sarah Lamarche |last2=Castillo |publisher=Springer |date=2012 |isbn=978-1137015020 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; many observers have likened the resource curse to the difficulties that befall [[lottery]] winners who struggle to manage the complex side-effects of newfound wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.cgdev.org/article/turning-oil-cash-how-developing-countries-can-win-resource-lottery-and-avoid-curse |title=Turning Oil into Cash: How Developing Countries Can Win the Resource Lottery and Avoid the Curse |publisher=[[Center for Global Development]] |date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AipuCoT96yQC&amp;pg=PT107 |title=Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power |first=Steve |last=Coll |authorlink=Steve Coll |publisher=Penguin |date=2012 |isbn=978-1101572146 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqrglobal2011122000 |title=The Resource Curse |first=Jennifer |last=Weeks |journal=[[CQ Press|CQ Researcher]] |volume=5 |issue=24 |date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Donald-Marron/2010/0615/Afghanistan-and-the-natural-resource-curse |title=Afghanistan and the natural resource curse |first=Donald |last=Marron |authorlink=Donald B.

Scholarship on the resource curse has increasingly shifted towards explaining why some resource-rich countries succeed and why others do not, as opposed to just investigating the average economic effects of resources.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torvik|first=Ragnar|date=2009-07-01|title=Why do some resource-abundant countries succeed while others do not?|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|volume=25|issue=2|pages=241–256|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grp015|issn=0266-903X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the manner in which resource income is spent, system of government, institutional quality, type of resources, and early vs. late industrialization all have been used to explain successes and failures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Economic effects ==
The IMF classifies 51 countries as “resource-rich.”  These are countries which derive at least 20% of exports or 20% of fiscal revenue from nonrenewable natural resources. 29 of these countries are low- and lower-middle-income. Common characteristics of these 29 countries include (i) extreme dependence on resource wealth for fiscal revenues, export sales, or both; (ii) low saving rates; (iii) poor growth performance; and (iv) highly volatile resource revenues.&lt;ref name="Venables 2016"/&gt;

A 2016 meta-study finds weak support for the thesis that resource richness adversely affects long-term economic growth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havranek|first=Tomas|last2=Horvath|first2=Roman|last3=Zeynalov|first3=Ayaz|title=Natural Resources and Economic Growth: A Meta-Analysis|journal=World Development|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.07.016|volume=88|pages=134–151|year=2016|url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/125528/1/838169112.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors note that "approximately 40% of empirical papers finding a negative effect, 40% finding no effect, and 20% finding a positive effect" but "overall support for the resource curse hypothesis is weak when potential [[publication bias]] and method heterogeneity are taken into account."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2011 study in the journal ''[[Comparative Political Studies]]'' found that "natural resource wealth can be either a “curse” or a “blessing” and that the distinction is conditioned by domestic and international factors, both amenable to change through public policy, namely, human capital formation and economic openness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurtz|first=Marcus J.|last2=Brooks|first2=Sarah M.|date=2011-03-15|title=Conditioning the "Resource Curse": Globalization, Human Capital, and Growth in Oil-Rich Nations|journal=Comparative Political Studies|language=en|volume=44|issue=6|pages=747–770|doi=10.1177/0010414011401215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dutch disease ===
{{main|Dutch disease}}
Dutch disease first became apparent after the Dutch discovered a huge natural gas field in [[Groningen gas field|Groningen]] in 1959. The Netherlands sought to tap this resource in an attempt to export the gas for profit. However, when the gas began to flow out of the country, so too did its ability to compete against other countries' exports. With the Netherlands' focus primarily on the new gas exports, the Dutch currency began to appreciate, which harmed the country's ability to export other products. With the growing gas market and the shrinking export economy, the Netherlands began to experience a recession. This process has been witnessed in multiple countries around the world including but not limited to [[Venezuela]] ([[History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Dutch Disease|oil]]), [[Angola]] ([[Mining industry of Angola#Diamonds|diamonds]], [[Sonangol Group|oil]]), the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] ([[Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|diamonds]]), and various other nations. All of these countries are considered "resource-cursed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick|title=Essentials of Comparative Politics|year=2004|publisher=Norton|location=New York, London|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch disease makes tradable goods less [[Competitive#Economics and business competition|competitive]] in world markets. Absent [[currency manipulation]] or a [[currency peg]], appreciation of the currency can damage other sectors, leading to a compensating unfavorable [[balance of trade]]. As imports become cheaper in all sectors, internal employment suffers and with it the skill infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities of the nation. This problem has historically influenced the domestic economics of large empires including [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] during its transition from a Republic{{when|date=November 2016}}, and the [[United Kingdom]] during the height of its colonial empire. To compensate for the loss of local employment opportunities, government resources are used to artificially create employment. The increasing national revenue will often also result in higher government spending on health, welfare, military, and public infrastructure, and if this is done corruptly or inefficiently it can be a burden on the economy. While the decrease in the sectors exposed to international competition and consequently even greater dependence on natural resource revenue leaves the economy vulnerable to price changes in the natural resource, this can be managed by an active and effective use of hedge instruments such as [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Option (finance)|options]] and [[Swap (finance)|swaps]], however if it is managed inefficiently or corruptly this can lead to disastrous results. Also, since [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] generally increases faster in the manufacturing sector than in the government, so the economy will have lower productivity gains than before.

=== Revenue volatility ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Prices for some natural resources are subject to wide fluctuation: for example [[price of petroleum|crude oil prices]] rose from around $3 per [[barrel (unit)|barrel]] to $12/bbl in 1974 following the [[1973 oil crisis]] and fell from $27/bbl to below $10/bbl during the [[1980s oil glut|1986 glut]]. In the decade from 1998 to 2008, it rose from $10/bbl to $145/bbl, before [[World oil market chronology from 2003|falling by more than half]] to $60/bbl over a few months. When government revenues are dominated by inflows from natural resources (for example, 99.3% of [[Angola]]'s exports came from just oil and diamonds in 2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2007/cr07355.pdf |title=Angola: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=October 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; this volatility can play havoc with government planning and [[Government debt|debt service]]. Abrupt changes in economic realities that result from this often provoke widespread breaking of contracts or curtailment of social programs, eroding the rule of law and popular support. Responsible use of financial hedges can mitigate this risk to some extent.

Susceptibility to this volatility can be increased where governments choose to borrow heavily in foreign currency. Real exchange rate increases, through capital inflows or the "Dutch disease" can make this appear an attractive option by lowering the cost of interest payments on the foreign debt, and they may be considered more creditworthy due to the existence of natural resources. If the resource prices fall, however, the governments' capacity to meet debt repayments will be reduced. For example, many oil-rich countries like [[Nigeria]] and [[Venezuela]] saw rapid expansions of their debt burdens during the 1970s oil boom; however, when oil prices fell in the 1980s, bankers stopped lending to them and many of them fell into arrears, triggering penalty interest charges that made their debts grow even more. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo]] presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title='The Devil's Excrement' |last=Useem |first=Jerry |magazine=Fortune |date=3 February 2003 |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/02/03/336434/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study in ''[[The Review of Economics and Statistics]]'' found that commodities have historically always shown greater price volatility than manufactured goods and that globalization has reduced this volatility.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacks|first=David S.|last2=O'Rourke|first2=Kevin H.|last3=Williamson|first3=Jeffrey G.|date=2011-07-21|title=Commodity Price Volatility and World Market Integration since 1700|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|language=en|volume=93|issue=3|pages=800–813|doi=10.1162/rest_a_00091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodities are a key reason why poor countries are more volatile than rich countries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Enclave effects ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Economic [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] may be delayed or neglected by the authorities in the light of the temporarily high profits that can be obtained from limited natural resources. The attempts at diversification that do occur are often grand [[public works]] projects which may be misguided or mismanaged. However, even when the authorities attempt diversification in the economy, this is made difficult because resource extraction [[High-level equilibrium trap|is vastly more lucrative and out-competes]] other industries. Successful natural-resource-exporting countries often become increasingly dependent on extractive industries over time. The abundant revenue from natural resource extraction discourages the long-term investment in [[infrastructure]] that would support a more diverse economy. This lack of investment exacerbates the negative impact of sudden drops in the resource's [[price]]. While resource sectors tend to produce large financial revenues, they often add few jobs to the economy, and tend to operate as [[enclave]]s with few forward and backward connections to the rest of the economy.

=== Human resources ===
In many poor countries, natural resource industries tend to pay far higher salaries than would be available elsewhere in the economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This tends to attract the best talent from both private and government sectors, damaging these sectors by depriving them of their best skilled personnel. Another possible effect of the resource curse is the crowding out of [[human capital]]; countries that rely on natural resource exports may tend to neglect education because they see no immediate need for it. Resource-poor economies like [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]] or [[South Korea]], by contrast, spent enormous efforts on education, and this contributed in part to their economic success (see [[East Asian Tigers]]). Other researchers, however, dispute this conclusion; they argue that natural resources generate easily taxable rents that more often than not result in increased spending on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stijns, Jean-Philippe (2006). |title=Natural resource abundance and human capital accumulation |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.11.005 |date= |volume=34 |issue=6 |journal=World Development |pages=1060–1083 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incomes and employment ===
A study on coal mining in [[Appalachia]] "suggest that the presence of coal in the Appalachian region has played a significant part in its slow pace of economic development. Our best estimates indicate that an increase of 0.5 units in the ratio of coal revenues to personal income in a county is associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease in income growth rates. No doubt, coal mining provides opportunities for relatively high-wage employment in the region, but its effect on prosperity appears to be negative in the longer run."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://be.wvu.edu/phd_economics/pdf/14-01.pdf|title = Coal Mining and the Resource Curse in the Eastern United States|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example was the Spanish Empire which obtained enormous wealth from its resource-rich colonies in South America in the sixteenth century. The large cash inflows from silver reduced incentives for industrial development in Spain. Innovation and investment in education were therefore neglected, so that the prerequisites for successful future development were given up. Thus, Spain soon lost its economic strength in comparison to other Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=159|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of US oil booms finds positive effects on local employment and income during booms but that after the boom, incomes "per capita" decreased, while "unemployment compensation payments increased relative to what they would have been if the boom had not occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Economic Aftermath of Resource Booms: Evidence from Boomtowns in the American West|journal = The Economic Journal|volume = 126|issue = 593|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 1468-0297|pages = n/a–n/a|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12173|language = en|first = Grant D.|last = Jacobsen|first2 = Dominic P.|last2 = Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political effects ==
Natural resources are a source of [[economic rent]] which can generate large revenues for those controlling them even in the absence of political stability and wider economic growth. Their existence is a potential source of conflict between factions fighting for a share of the revenue, which may take the form of armed [[separatist]] conflicts in regions where the resources are produced or internal conflict between different government ministries or departments for access to budgetary allocations. This tends to erode governments' abilities to function effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Cheryl W. | last2 = Kaufmann | first2 = Daniel | year = 1998 | title = Corruption and development | url = | journal = Finance and Development | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Michael L.|title=The oil curse how petroleum wealth shapes the development of nations|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9781400841929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when politically stable, countries whose economies are dominated by resource extraction industries tend to be less democratic and more corrupt.&lt;ref name="Ross 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/198/40112.html |title=Lifting the Natural Resource Curse |first=Thomas I. |last=Palley |journal=Foreign Service Journal |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence and conflict ===
According to a 2017 review study, "while some studies support the link between resource scarcity/abundance and armed conflict, others find no or only weak links."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koubi|first=Vally|last2=Spilker|first2=Gabriele|date=2017-06-28|title=Natural Resources, Climate Change, and Conflict|volume=1|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one academic study, a country that is otherwise typical but has primary commodity exports around 5% of GDP has a 6% risk of conflict, but when exports are 25% of GDP the chance of conflict rises to 33%.&lt;ref name="collier1"&gt;Bannon, Ian; Collier, Paul (eds.), [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/15047/282450Natural0resources0violent0conflict.pdf ''Natural Resources and Violent Conflict: Options and Actions'']. World Bank (2003), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ethno-political groups are more likely to resort to rebellion rather than using nonviolent means or becoming terrorists when representing regions rich in oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreher|first=Axel|last2=Kreibaum|first2=Merle|date=2016-07-01|title=Weapons of choice: The effect of natural resources on terror and insurgencies |journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=53|issue=4|pages=539–553|doi=10.1177/0022343316634418|issn=0022-3433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several factors behind the relationship between natural resources and armed conflicts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Resource wealth may increase the vulnerability of countries to conflicts by undermining the quality of governance and economic performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norman |first=C. S. |title=Rule of Law and the Resource Curse |journal=Environmental and Resource Economics |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=183–207 |doi=10.1007/s10640-008-9231-y |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the "resource curse" argument). Secondly, conflicts can occur over the control and exploitation of resources and the allocation of their revenues (the "[[resource war]]" argument). Thirdly, access to resource revenues by belligerents can prolong conflicts (the "[[conflict resource]]" argument).&lt;ref&gt;Le Billon, Philippe (2006), "Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts", ''[[Adelphi Paper]]'' 373, [[IISS]] &amp; [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhvaryu|first=Achyuta|last2=Fenske|first2=James E.|last3=Khanna|first3=Gaurav|last4=Nyshadham|first4=Anant|date=February 2018|title=Resources, Conflict, and Economic Development in Africa |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 24309 |doi=10.3386/w24309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in the ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' found that rebels were particularly likely to be able to prolong their participation in civil wars when they had access to natural resources that they could smuggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=Rebel Natural Resource Exploitation and Conflict Duration |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=|pages=002200271875585|via=|doi=10.1177/0022002718755853|last1=Conrad|first1=Justin M|last2=Greene|first2=Kevin T|last3=Walsh|first3=James Igoe|last4=Whitaker|first4=Beth Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 literature review finds that oil makes the onset of war more likely and that lootable resources lengthen existing conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do We Know about Natural Resources and Civil War?|journal = Journal of Peace Research|pages = 337–356|volume = 41|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0022343304043773|first = Michael L.|last = Ross|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds the mere discovery (as opposed to just the exploitation) of petroleum resources increases the risk of conflict, as oil revenues have the potential to alter the balance of power between regimes and their opponents, rendering bargains in the present obsolete in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oil Discoveries, Shifting Power, and Civil Conflict |journal = International Studies Quarterly|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1468-2478|pages = 517–530|volume = 59|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/isqu.12150|first = Curtis|last = Bell|first2 = Scott|last2 = Wolford}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggests that the rise in mineral prices over the period 1997–2010 contributed to up to 21 percent of the average country-level violence in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = This Mine is Mine!

It is not clear whether the pattern of petro-aggression found in oil-rich countries also applies to other natural resources besides oil. A 2016 study finds that "oil production, oil reserves, oil dependence, and oil exports are associated with a higher risk of initiating conflict while countries enjoying large oil reserves are more frequently the target of military actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strüver|first=Georg|last2=Wegenast|first2=Tim|date=2016-04-01|title=The Hard Power of Natural Resources: Oil and the Outbreak of Militarized Interstate Disputes |journal=Foreign Policy Analysis|doi=10.1093/fpa/orw013|issn=1743-8586|page=orw013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the only six countries whose reported military expenditures exceeded 6 percent of GDP were significant oil producers: Oman, South Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Libya, Algeria.

There are two ways that oil wealth might negatively affect democratization. The first is that oil strengthens authoritarian regimes, making transitions to democracy less likely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second is that oil wealth weakens democracies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Research generally supports the first theory but is mixed on the second.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Both pathways might result from the ability of oil-rich states to provide citizens with a combination of generous benefits and low taxes.  In many economies that are not resource-dependent, governments tax citizens, who demand efficient and responsive [[Implied level of government service|government]] in return. This bargain establishes a political relationship between rulers and subjects. In countries whose economies are dominated by natural resources, however, rulers don't need to tax their citizens because they have a guaranteed source of income from natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Deborah |last=Bräutigam |url=http://www.aei.org/publication/taxation-and-governance-in-africa/ |title=Taxation and Governance in Africa |publisher=American Enterprise Institute |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=Kevin M.|title=Oil, Nontax Revenue, and the Redistributional Foundations of Regime Stability|journal=International Organization|date=9 January 2009|volume=63|issue=1|pages=107|doi=10.1017/S0020818309090043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the country's citizens aren't being taxed, they have less incentive to be watchful with how government spends its money.&lt;ref name="Ross 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Michael L.|title=Does Taxation Lead to Representation?|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=April 2004|volume=34|issue=2|pages=229–249|doi=10.1017/S0007123404000031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, those benefiting from mineral resource wealth may perceive an effective and watchful civil service and civil society as a threat to the benefits that they enjoy, and they may take steps to thwart them.&lt;ref name="Ross 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Michael L.|title=Does Oil Hinder Democracy?|journal=World Politics|date=13 June 2011|volume=53|issue=3|pages=325–361|doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, citizens are often poorly served by their rulers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/gdr/cfs/pdfs/PB34.pdf Moore, Mick; Unsworth, Sue (2007).

The [[Center for Global Development]] argues that governance in resource rich states would be improved by the government making universal, transparent, and regular payments of oil revenues to citizens, and then attempting to reclaim it through the tax system, which they argue will fuel public demand for the government to be transparent and accountable in its management of natural resource revenues and in the delivery of public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/revenues_distribution |title=Oil-to-Cash: Fighting the Resource Curse through Cash Transfers : Center for Global Development : Initiatives: Active |publisher=Cgdev.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study looking at oil wealth in Colombia found "that when the price of oil rises, legislators affiliated with right-wing paramilitary groups win office more in oil-producing municipalities. Consistent with the use of force to gain power, positive price shocks also induce an increase in paramilitary violence and reduce electoral competition: fewer candidates run for office, and winners are elected with a wider vote margin. Ultimately, fewer centrist legislators are elected to office, and there is diminished representation at the center."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carreri|first=Maria|last2=Dube|first2=Oeindrila|date=2017-01-10|title=Do Natural Resources Influence Who Comes to Power, and How?|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=79|issue=2|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/688443|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution ===
According to a 2017 study, "social forces condition the extent to which oil-rich nations provide vital public services to the population. Although it is often assumed that oil wealth leads to the formation of a distributive state that generously provides services in the areas of water, sanitation, education, health care, or infrastructure... quantitative tests reveal that oil-rich nations who experience demonstrations or riots provide better water and sanitation services than oil-rich nations who do not experience such dissent. Subsequent tests find that oil-rich nations who experience nonviolent, mass-based movements provide better water and sanitation services than those who experience violent, mass-based movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazaheri|first=Nimah|title=Oil, Dissent, and Distribution|journal=World Development|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.028|volume=99|year=2017|pages=186–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign aid ===
There is an argument in political economy that foreign aid could have the same negative effects on the long run towards development as in the case of the resource curse.

== Criticisms ==
A 2008 study argues that the curse vanishes when looking not at the relative importance of resource exports in the economy but rather at a different measure: the relative abundance of natural resources in the ground. Using that variable to compare countries, it reports that resource wealth in the ground correlates with slightly higher economic growth and slightly fewer armed conflicts. That a high dependency on resource exports correlates with bad policies and effects is not caused by the large degree of resource exportation. The causation goes in the opposite direction: conflicts and bad policies created the heavy dependence on exports of natural resources. When a country's chaos and economic policies scare off foreign investors and send local entrepreneurs abroad to look for better opportunities, the economy becomes skewed. Factories may close and businesses may flee, but petroleum and precious metals remain for the taking. Resource extraction becomes the "default sector" that still functions after other industries have come to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Linking Natural Resources to Slow Growth and More Conflict |first=C.

A 2011 article that examines the long-term relationship between natural resource reliance and regime type across the world from 1800 to 2006 reports that increases in natural resource reliance do not induce authoritarianism. With a focus on alleviating the methodological biases of earlier studies, the authors find evidence which suggests that increasing reliance on natural resources promotes democratization, the opposite of what the Resource curse theory suggests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haber | first1 = Stephen | last2 = Menaldo | first2 = Victor | year = 2011 | title = Do natural resources fuel authoritarianism?

The authors claim that the chances of this happening is larger when assuming random effects, an assumption that does not allow for what the authors call "unobserved country-specific heterogeneity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These criticisms have themselves been subject to criticism.  One study re-examined the Haber-Menaldo analysis, using Haber and Menaldo's own data and statistical models.  It reports that their conclusions are only valid for the period before the 1970s, but since about 1980, there has been a pronounced resource curse.  Authors Andersen and Ross suggest that oil wealth only became a hindrance to democratic transitions after the transformative events of the 1970s, which enabled developing country governments to capture the oil rents that were previously siphoned off by foreign-owned firms.

A 2008 article by Thad Dunning argues that while resource revenues can promote or strengthen authoritarian regimes, in certain circumstances they can also promote democracy. In countries where natural resource rents are a relatively small portion of the overall economy and the non-resource economy is unequal, resources rents can strengthen democracy by reducing economic elites’ fear of ceding power since social welfare policies can be funded with resource rents and not redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes|last=Dunning|first=Thad|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0521730754|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning proposes Venezuela’s democratic consolidation during the oil boom of the 1970s as a key example of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes|last=Dunning|first=Thad|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0521730754|location=New York|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study argues that previous assumptions that oil abundance is a curse were based on methodologies which failed to take into account cross-country differences and dependencies arising from global shocks, such as changes in technology and the price of oil. The researchers studied data from the World Bank over the period 1980–2006 for 53 countries, covering 85% of world GDP and 81% of world proven oil reserves. They found that oil abundance positively affected both short-term growth and long-term income levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does Oil Abundance Harm Growth? |first=Tiago |last=Cavalcanti |first2=Kamiar |last2=Mohaddes |first3=Mehdi |last3=Raissi |journal=Applied Economics Letters |year=2011 |doi=10.1080/13504851.2010.528356 |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=1181–1184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a companion paper, using data on 118 countries over the period 1970–2007, they show that it is the volatility in commodity prices, rather than abundance per se, that drives the resource curse paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Commodity Price Volatility and the Sources of Growth |first=Tiago |last=Cavalcanti |first2=Kamiar |last2=Mohaddes |first3=Mehdi |last3=Raissi |journal=Cambridge Working Papers in Economics 1112 |year=2011 |ssrn=1846429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Institutions and the Volatility Curse |first=Weishu |last=Leong |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Kamiar |last2=Mohaddes |journal=Cambridge Working Papers in Economics 1145 |year=2011 |url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/dae/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe1145.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105035/http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/dae/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe1145.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic Diocese of Kitui covers the COunty of Kitui, consisting of four former  Administrative Districts of Kyuso, Mwingi, Kitui and Mutomo, an  arid and semi arid area of approximately 30,142&amp;nbsp;km in Eastern Kenya. It has a population of around 1.09 million people with over 240,000 baptized Catholics (*Source: Central Statistics of the State; Secretariat of State; (2011)

The first Missionaries to evangelize Kitui were Holy Ghost fathers from Kabaa (Machakos diocese) in early 1930s. At the time the Holy Ghost Fathers were introducing Christianity in Kitui, the Consolata Missionaries from Meru were evangelizing in the northern side of Kitui bordering Tharaka, present day Kimangau. The first Mass was celebrated in Museve Hill by a Holy Ghost priest. The first Mission house was built in 1945 at Mutune. Kitui Apostolic Prefecture was curved out from the Archdiocese of Nairobi in 1956 and placed under care of St. Patricks Kiltegan Missionaries.  In 1964 it was erected as a Diocese on 16 November 1963, with His Lordship, the late Right Rev. William Dunne as the first Bishop (R.I.P) on 9 February 1964. Bishop Dunne retired on 2 November 1995. The first Diocesan Priests in the Diocese were Frs. Peter Muema Kyumbua and Boniface Lele Emeritus Archbishop of Mombasa (RIP), who were ordained in 1974.

Following the retirement of Bishop Dunne, the  Bishop Boniface Lele was appointed as Bishop of Kitui and ordained as bishop on 2 February 1996 succeeding him.  Archbishop Lele was  appointed Archbishop of Archdiocese of Mombasa on 1 April 2005. Rev. Fr. Paul Healy was the Diocesan Administrator until the appointment of  Rt. Rev. Bishop Martin Kivuva as the Apostolic Administrator. On 28 July 2008, Rt. Rev. Anthony Muheria was appointed bishop of Kitui taking possession on 10 August 2008.

'''General elections''' were held in [[Swaziland]] on 20 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://africajournalismtheworld.com/2013/06/05/swaziland-election-set-for-20-september/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The primary elections began on 24 August, 2013 with one candidate elected from each chiefdom. Those elected then go on to represent the chiefdom in the general election, where one candidate from each [[Inkhundla]] (constituency) is then elected to the House of Assembly.&lt;ref name=Board-Defeated&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland: Election Board Defeated in High Court|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308250246.html|work=www.allafrica.com|publisher=AllAfrica Global Media|accessdate=August 27, 2013|date=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political analysts have voiced concerns that women are being prevented from participating in the primary elections. In one case, a nominated candidate was disqualified because she was wearing trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phakathi|first=Mantoe|title=Swazi Chiefs Shut Women Out of Parliament|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/08/swazi-chiefs-shut-women-out-of-parliament/|work=www.ipsnews.net|publisher=IPS-Inter Press Service|accessdate=August 27, 2013|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court later ordered the Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC) to add her name back to the ballot.&lt;ref name=Board-Defeated /&gt; However, some residents from her chiefdom threatened to boycott the elections, complaining that she had not been properly nominated.&lt;ref name=Election-Shambles&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland: Swazi Primary Election Shambles|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308250241.html|work=www.allafrica.com|publisher=AllAfrica Global Media|accessdate=August 27, 2013|date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
About 415,000 were registered to vote for the 55 of 65 seats in the [[House of Assembly of Swaziland|House of Assembly]]. The other ten seats are to be filled by nominees from King [[Mswati III]] when he selects his cabinet and Prime Minister.&lt;Ref name="aljaz"/&gt;

==Campaign==
As a result of the presence of a number of reform candidates, there was speculation of a more inclusive government by the traditionalists. However, the banned opposition groups such as the [[Pudemo]] party and the South Africa-based [[Swaziland Solidarity Network]] called for a boycott.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/09/201392034529659842.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Ainu Tamasay Bead Necklace.jpg|tamasay|250px|thumb]]
A '''tamasay''' (or '''tamasai''') is a [[bead]] [[necklace]] worn by [[Ainu people|Ainu]] women for special occasions.

The necklace is called a '''shitoki''' if it has a [[medallion]].  They are made with large [[glass]] beads the Ainu obtained through trading with [[China|Chinese]] merchants.  The Ainu also obtained glass beads secretly made by the [[Matsumae Clan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng08.html Ainu History and Culture : Ornaments]&lt;/ref&gt; The shitoki medallion often represents the [[white-tailed sea eagle]]s that the Ainu hunt.  The more strands and beads a necklace has, the more valuable it is.  The necklaces are passed down through generations and are highly treasured by their owners.  This jewelry is especially important in ceremonies and rituals because it is believed to protect the wearer from evil spirits.

== Overview ==

Telephone numbers in [[Cape Verde]] are 7 digits long (except for special '''&lt;code&gt;1xx&lt;/code&gt;''' codes), and must always be dialed in their entirety (a [[Telephone numbering plan#Closed dialing plans|closed dialing plan]]). The first 3 digits of a fixed-line (non-mobile) number correspond to its geographic area. Calls within a given '''&lt;code&gt;2xx&lt;/code&gt;''' area, and between certain areas, are considered [[local call]]s and priced accordingly. Mobile numbers have no geographic area, and calls to or from national mobile numbers are treated the same regardless of location.

== History ==

On July 3 2004, '''&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;''' was prepended to all fixed-line numbers, and '''&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;''' to all mobile numbers, increasing the number length to 7 digits.&lt;ref name="itu"&gt;{{cite web |title = National Numbering Plan - Cape Verde |url = http://www.itu.int/oth/T0202000026/en |accessdate = 2012-01-29 |publisher = [[ITU]] |date = 2010-05-20 |author = Direction Générale des Communications-DGC-ICTI, Praia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calling format ==

* '''xxx xxxx''' - calling inside Cape Verde
* '''+238 xxx xxxx''' - calling from outside Cape Verde
The NSN length is seven digits.

== Numbering plan ==

=== Number ranges ===

In all cases listed, when a '''&lt;code&gt;2x&lt;/code&gt;''' range is split between two islands, one takes '''&lt;code&gt;2x0&lt;/code&gt;''' through '''&lt;code&gt;2x4&lt;/code&gt;''', while the other takes '''&lt;code&gt;2x5&lt;/code&gt;''' through '''&lt;code&gt;2x9&lt;/code&gt;'''.

[[Image:Xcor-ezrocket-N132EZ-040928-03-16.jpg|thumb|right|Cockpit. Engine on-off switches on left side panel are placarded "FWD - LOUD; BACK - QUIET"]]

The '''XCOR EZ-Rocket''' is a test platform for the [[XCOR]] rocket propulsion system. The airplane is a modified [[Rutan Long-EZ]], with the propeller replaced by first one, then later a pair of pressure-fed [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regeneratively cooled]] liquid-fuelled rocket engines and an underslung fuel tank. The engines are restartable in flight, and are contained within [[Kevlar]] armor shielding. The EZ-Rocket is registered as an [[experimental aircraft]].

==Development and history==
The first flight took place on July 21, 2001, flown by [[test pilot]] [[Dick Rutan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1746&amp;context=smallsat Flight Tests Of XCOR’s EZ-Rocket and Progress Toward a Microgravity and Microspacecraft Launcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

On a typical flight, the EZ-Rocket takes off on rockets, gains altitude for a minute or so, then switches off the rockets and glides to a [[deadstick landing]].

The vehicle actually flies better during deadstick glide landings than a Long-EZ due to lack of drag from a stationary [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] propeller &amp;mdash; the vehicle's aerodynamics are cleaner in spite of its belly tank. It is also lighter due to the lack of a piston engine (the rocket propulsion system is significantly lighter), so enjoys significantly lower [[wing loading]] than a stock Long-EZ.

When XCOR began flying its EZ-Rocket in 2001, the company decided to have it FAA certified as an [[Airworthiness certificate#Special Airworthiness Certificate|experimental aircraft]], avoiding the additional time required to seek a launch vehicle license from the [[Office of Commercial Space Transportation]] (AST). Jeff Greason, a co-founder of XCOR, said on February 10, 2003 if they were starting out at that time they probably would seek an AST license due to the progress made in developing a regulatory regime for suborbitals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/RLV/2003/RLVNews2003-02.html#Feb.11.03&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivatives==
The [[Rocket Racing League]] aircraft currently in development, the [[Mark-III X-racer]], is a design descendant of the EZ-Rocket aircraft.  Although XCOR is not the developer of the rocket engine for the Mark-III, XCOR did develop the rocket engine for the [[Mark-I X-Racer]], the first of the [[X-Racer]]s to use a single rocket engine on a [[Velocity SE]] basic airframe, and the first X-Racer to utilize [[RP-1|kerosene]] instead of [[isopropyl alcohol]] fuel.  XCOR used both design and operational experience from the EZ-Rocket in the Mark-I rocket aircraft design.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
