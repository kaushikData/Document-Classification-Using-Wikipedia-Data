The '''28th century''' of the [[anno Domini]] ([[common era|common]]) era will span from January 1, 2701–December 31, 2800 of the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Unlike most century years, the year 2800 will be a [[leap year]], and the next [[century leap year]] after [[2400]].

===List of the long total solar eclipses===
* July 21, 2707: [[Solar eclipse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2707-07-21.gif  Solar eclipse of July 21, 2707]&lt;/ref&gt; (5 min 48 s), of [[saros (astronomy)|saros]] 157.
* July 31, 2725: Solar eclipse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2725-07-31.gif  Solar eclipse of July 31, 2725]&lt;/ref&gt; (5 min 57 s), of [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros157.html  saros 157], "crowning" this series.
* August 12, 2743: Solar eclipse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2743-08-12.gif  Solar eclipse of August 12, 2743]&lt;/ref&gt; (5 min 56 s), of saros 157.
* July 31, 2744: Solar eclipse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2744-07-31.gif  Solar eclipse of July 31, 2744]&lt;/ref&gt; (5 min 59 s), of saros 167.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The saros 167 presents eclipses with very similar to those of the [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros145.html  saros 145]. For example, the [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2726-07-21.gif  Solar eclipse of July 21, 2726] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808011135/http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2726-07-21.gif |date=2007-08-08 }} (5 min 43 s), the previous one of the July 31, 2744 in this series of saros 167, would have a pathway very similar to the last one of the last millennium taken on [[Solar eclipse of August 11, 1999|August 11, 1999]], one of the series of saros 145. It would happen at a far anniversary of the first step on the Moon by [[Neil Armstrong]], in 1969. It would also be ''1 millennium, 2 years, 2 months, minus 1 day'' (calendar durations) after the historical [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/1701-1800/1724-05-22.gif  eclipse of May 22, 1724] (29th of saros 133), which was seen by [[Jacques Cassini]] and the king [[Louis XV]]. And obviously, this solar eclipse of July 31, 2744 in this series of saros 167, would have a pathway very similar to the one of the first "US Solar Eclipse of the 21st century" on [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|August 21, 2017]], the following one of the series of saros 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 12, 2762: Solar eclipse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2762-08-12.gif  Solar eclipse of August 12, 2762]&lt;/ref&gt; (6 min 11 s), of saros 167.
* August 22, 2780: Solar eclipse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2780-08-22.gif  Solar eclipse of August 22, 2780]&lt;/ref&gt; (6 min 16 s), of [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros167.html  saros 167], "crowning" this series.
* September 2, 2798: Solar eclipse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/2701-2800/2798-09-02.gif  Solar eclipse of September 2, 2798]&lt;/ref&gt; (6 min 14 s), of saros 167.

'''Alfred-Auguste Cuvillier-Fleury''' (18 March 1802, [[Paris]] – 18 October 1887, [[Paris]]) was a French historian and literary critic.

==Biography==
Préfet des études at the [[collège Sainte-Barbe]] in Paris and preceptor of [[Henri d'Orléans (1822-1897)|Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale]], from 1827 to 1839, he then became Henri's special secretary. He contributed to the  ''[[Journal des Débats]]''. He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1866.

In 1830 he published ''Documents historiques sur [[Antoine Marie Chamans de Lavalette|M. le comte Lavalette]]'' and edited the  ''Mémoires'' of Lavalette's daughter (and Cuvillier-Fleury's lover), Joséphine de Lavalette. Although none of the works he published was reissued in his lifetime, his ''Correspondance avec le duc d'Aumale'', as well as his ''Journal intime'', remain important sources on the history of [[Orléanism]].

He was born in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1951, where his parents had fled [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] and [[Aboriginal history of Western Australia|Western Australian native welfare policies]].&lt;ref name="NACCHO"/&gt;

Numerous Australian [[Scholarship|scholarships]] are named in his honour.

'''Arturo Jiménez Borja''' (1908–2000) was a [[Peru]]vian physician, ethnologist, painter and writer. He was born in [[Tacna, Peru|Tacna]] on July 21, 1908 and died in [[Lima]] on January 13, 2000. He was a first order descendant of the last indigenous [[curaca]] in Tacna, Toribio Ara.

==Biography==

Borja attained the title of doctor-surgeon in 1943 at the [[Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos]], heading the departments of Therapeutics and Endocrinology at the Faculty of Medicine, San Fernando.

He devoted his studies to indigenous clothing, masks and musical instruments. He achieved the restoration of ancient monuments in areas such as Puruchuco, [[Pachacamac]] and [[Paramonga]], building a museum in each of them. He was director of the museum site of Pachacamac (1956) and Director of the National Museum.

He donated his collection of musical instruments from [[Peru]] to the [[Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos]]. His collection of masks from all over [[Peru]], the most comprehensive and most valuable, admired by friends and strangers, can now be seen very well maintained, in the Museum of Arts and Traditions of the Riva Aguero Institute at the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Peru|Catholic Pontifical University]] in Peru.

He was murdered on January 13, 2000 in Lima.

'''Bo Yang''' ({{zh|t=柏楊|s=柏杨|p=Bóyáng}};&lt;ref&gt;The character [[wiktionary:柏|柏]] is traditionally pronounced "Bó," and Bo Yang himself pronounced it as Bó. In [[Modern Standard Chinese]] (mainland Chinese), some authorities favour the view that it is pronounced as "Bó" except when used to mean "[[cypress]] tree," when it is pronounced "Bǎi": see “柏”, 《实用汉字字典》，上海辞书出版社 (''Practical Chinese Character Dictionary'', Shanghai Literary Press); “柏”,《辞海》，上海辞书出版社 1999 (''[[Cihai]]'', Shanghai Literary Press), while other authorities favour the view that 柏 is pronounced as "Bǎi" when used as a surname, see, e.g., ''[[Xinhua Zidian]]'' 10th edition, p.11, [[Commercial Press]] 2004, {{ISBN|7-100-03931-2}}, and ''Modern Chinese Dictionary'' (现代汉语词典) 5th edition, p.30, Commercial Press 2005, {{ISBN|7-100-04385-9}} ). Bo Yang himself always pronounced it as "Bo".&lt;/ref&gt; 7 March 1920&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_7370000/newsid_7372400/7372486.stm 台灣著名作家柏楊因病逝世].

Accessed 30 April 2008. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 29 April 2008), sometimes also erroneously called '''Bai Yang''',&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22bai+yang%22+ugly+chinese&amp;btnG=Search+Books some books] by [[Google Book Search]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] poet, essayist and historian based in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang Xialu, “''Bo Yang'',” in:  Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, edited by Edward L. Davis. Abingdon UK (Routledge) 2005, p.62. – {{ISBN|0-415-24129-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also regarded as a social critic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas D. Kristof, "A Dictatorship That Grew Up", The New York Times, February 16, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own memoir, the exact date of his birthday was unknown even to himself. He later adopted 7 March, the date of his 1968 imprisonment, as his birthday.

==Biography==
Boyang was born as '''Guō Dìngshēng''' (郭定生) in [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]] Province, China, with family origins in [[Huixian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NATS1/4320316.shtml 作家柏楊病逝].  ''[[United Daily News|United Daily]]''.  April 29, 2008.  {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyang's father changed his son's name to '''Guō Lìbāng''' (郭立邦) to facilitate a transfer to another school. Bo Yang later changed his name to '''Guo Yìdòng''', also spelled '''Kuo I-tung''' (郭衣洞).  In high school, Boyang participated in youth organisations of the [[Kuomintang]], the then-ruling party of the [[Republic of China]], and joined the Kuomintang itself in 1938. He graduated from the [[Northeastern University (China)|National Northeastern University]], and moved to Taiwan after the Kuomintang lost the civil war in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.chinatimes.com/2007Cti/2007Cti-Focus/2007Cti-Focus-Content/0,4518,9704290231+0+0+140626+0,00.html  柏楊凌晨病逝 享壽八十九歲]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502223509/http://news.chinatimes.com/2007Cti/2007Cti-Focus/2007Cti-Focus-Content/0%2C4518%2C9704290231%2B0%2B0%2B140626%2B0%2C00.html |date=May 2, 2008  }}. ''[[China Times]]''. 29 April 2008. Accessed 30 April 2008. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, he was imprisoned for six months for listening to [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] radio broadcasts. He had various jobs during his life, including that of a teacher. During this time, he began to write novels. In 1960, he began using the pen name Boyang when he started to write a political commentary column in the ''Independent Evening News''. The name was derived from a place name in the mountains of Taiwan; he adopted it because he liked the sound of it.  In 1961, he achieved acclaim with his novel ''The Alien Realm'' (異域 ''Yìyù''), which told the story of a Kuomintang force which fought on in the borderlands of southwestern China long after the government had retreated to [[Taiwan]]. He became director of the Pingyuan Publishing House in 1966, and also edited the cartoon page of ''China Daily'' (中華日報).&lt;ref&gt;Wang Xiaolu, “''Bo Yang''”, ibidem, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyang was arrested again in 1967 because of his sarcastic "unwitting" criticism of Taiwan's dictator [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and in particular a translation of a comic strip of Popeye.&lt;ref&gt;June Teufel Dreyer. [http://formosafoundation.org/pdf/Taiwan's%20Identity%20(J_Dreyer).pdf "Taiwan's Evolving Identity."]  17 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the strip, [[Popeye]] and [[Swee'Pea]] have just landed on an uninhabited island. Popeye says: "You can be crown prince," to which Swee'Pea responds, "I want to be president." In the next panel, Popeye says, "Why, you little..." In the final panel, Popeye's words are too faint to be made out. Chiang was displeased because he saw this as a parody of his arrival (with a defeated army) in Taiwan, his brutal usurpation of the Presidency (a KMT competitor favored as head of government by the Truman administration was executed) and his strategy of slowly installing his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] as heir apparent. Boyang translated the word "fellows" as "my fellow soldiers and countrymen," a phrase used by Chiang Kai-shek.&lt;ref&gt;Daisy Hsieh.

July 1997.  Accessed 30 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Having detained Bo Yang, the KMT's “military interrogators told him that he could be beaten to death at any time the authorities desired” when the writer refused to swallow their trumped-up charges.&lt;ref&gt;Philip F. Williams and Yenna Wu, The Great Wall of Confinement. The Chinese Prison Camp through Contemporary Fiction and Reportage. Berkeley CA (University of California Press) 2004,  p.135. – {{ISBN|0-520-22779-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; “Several interrogators” including Liu Chan-hua and Kao Yi-rue “played cat and mouse with him, alternating promise of immediate release with threats” and torture.&lt;ref&gt;(Dongwu zhengzhi shehui xue bao  東吳 政治, 社會 學報  Soochow Journal of Political Science (published by Soochow University, Taipei), issue 23/2006, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make him confess, they broke his leg.&lt;ref&gt;”Taiwanese interrogators broke his leg to elicit a confession...”, the US journalist Kristof mentions; any sharp drop in the temperature still caused the writer pain many years later and made walking difficult for him. See Nicholas D. Kristof, “One Author is Rankling Two Chinas,” in: The New York Times, October 07, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Western allies of the regime were not unaware of this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chiang Wei-kuo]] 蔣緯國,  a son of the dictator in charge of the ''Military Garrison Command'', had been attending an equivalent of West Point in Germany during the ''Third Reich'' period and the BND, a West German secret service, commanded by a high-ranking former Nazi secret service man, Mr. Gehlen, always had close relations with its counterpart in Taiwan, according to a press notice by the West German newspaper ''Frankfurter Rundschau.'' The same was obviously true of the American counterpart. In the late 1940s, the US vice consul in Taipei, [[George H. Kerr]], who later expressed regrets, was also fully aware of the massacres carried out by the KMT regime, estimating that about 10,000 of the demonstrators protesting against corruption, harassment and unrestrained violence of the police  on Feb. 28, 1947 were killed on that day and in the next few days, and another 10,000 in the immediate aftermath of the ''crack-down''. See: George Kerr, [[Formosa Betrayed (1965 book)|Formosa Betrayed]]. Boston (Houghton Mifflin) 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shelley Rigger says that “Peng Ming-min, Bo Yang and Lei Chen” were “high -profile White Terror cases” in the 1960s but in fact, many “(t)housands of Taiwanese and Mainlanders were swept up by the White Terror, suffering imprisonment, torture, (…) execution.”&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Peng Ming-min, whose father had been executed by the regime in the context of the [[February 28 Incident]], became a victim in 1964  because he and his colleagues at Taida wrote a manifesto calling for reforms. Shelley Rigger, Why Taiwan Matters: Small Island, Global Powerhouse. Lanham MD (Rowman &amp; Littlefield)   2011, 2014, p.65.  –  {{ISBN|978-1-4422-0480-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The prosecutor initially sought the death sentence but due to US pressure this was reduced to twelve years in the Green Island concentration camp. From 1969 Bo Yang was incarcerated as a [[political prisoner]] (for "being a Communist agent and attacking national leaders") on [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]] for nine years.  The original 12-year sentence was commuted to eight years after the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975. However, the government refused to release Bo Yang after his sentence expired, and released him only in 1977, giving in to pressure from international organizations such as [[Amnesty International]]. After his release, Bo Yang continued to campaign for human rights and democracy in Taiwan.Towards the end of his life Bo Yang stated in his memoirs that he did not have the slightest intention to insult Chiang Kai-shek with his ''Popeye'' translation. This was due to the fact that in his view objective criticism mattered whereas personal insults were irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Bise周碧瑟,  with Bo Yang 柏楊, ''Bo Yang hui yi lu柏楊回憶錄'' (''Bo Yang, Memoirs''; Zhou's account, based on oral statements by Bo Yang). Taipei (Yuanliu chuban 遠流出版)  minguo 85 [=1996].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works===
Lin Zi-yao notes  that during his life “Bo Yang covered  a wide range of subjects from culture, literature, politics and education to love, marriage, family planning, fashion and women.”&lt;ref&gt;Lin Zi-yao, “''Preface'',” in: Lin Zi-yao (ed.), One Author Is Rankling Two Chinas. Taipei (Sinkuang Book Co.) 1989, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this is not fiction, although he also published a significant body of short stories, novels, and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;.Howard Goldblatt says  that “it is significant” that an anthology of his short stories  entitled ''Secrets'' in English was “published in Chinese under the author's true name Kuo I-tung, for 'Bo Yang'  is not essentially a writer of fiction.” Goldblatt adds, “Yet like 'Bo Yang' [the writer of essays], Kuo I-tung [the novelist and short story writer] is a social critic; his fiction is written with an eye to the recording of events and to the social inequities that gave rise to them.” See  Howard Goldblatt, “''Foreword'',” in: Bo Yang, Poems of A Period, Hong Kong (Joint Publishing Co.) 1986, p.XI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] novel '''''Yiyu''''', (異域, 1961), Boyang is best known for his non-fiction works on Chinese history (collated and translated into modern colloquial Chinese from historical records in the prison library on Green Island) and ''[[The Ugly Chinaman]]'' (醜陋的中國人 ''Chǒulòu de Zhōngguórén'', 1985; English translation, with the subtitle ''... and the Crisis of Chinese Culture'',  1992). In the introduction to excerpts from ''The Ugly Chinaman'', the editors of an anthology entitled ''Sources of Chinese Tradition from 1600  through the Twentieth Century'' state that “(t)he sharply negative tone of the (…) essay reflects a sense of (…) despair (…) as well as a feeling that age-old  weaknesses have persisted through revolutionary change.”&lt;ref&gt;Sources of Chinese Tradition from 1600 through the Twentieth Century, Vol. 2, compiled by Wm. Theodore Barry and Richard  Lufrano, with  the collaboration of  Wing-tsit Chan et al. New York NY (Columbia University Press) 2nd edition  2000, p. 565. –  {{ISBN|0-231-11270-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also referring to ''The Ugly Chinaman'', Rana Mitter says that Bo Yang's position as a critical observer and analyst of the world is similar to [[Lu Xun]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;Both were skeptical, yet committed writers and less naive than younger 'romanticists'. “Lu Xun regarded his mission as being to try and wake up  a few of the sleepers in an 'iron house' in which they were burning to death, and from which there was still no guarantee to escape. The message mixed bleakness with hope, with perhaps more emphasis on bleakness. In contrast, the impatience  of the romanticists was for a better world which they felt they could almost touch; they just had to motivate the nation and the people to reach it. A similar division can be seen in the treatment of modern China in (…) more contemporary works. Bo Yang's account of the Chinese people is dark and suggests that a long, painful process will be necessary before China will be saved. (…) Bo Yang (like Lu Xun) made his criticism while declining to join a political party. Again, like Lu Xun, Bo Yang was of an older generation when his essay [The Ugly Chinaman] was finally published (65 years old) (...)”  See: Rana Mitter, A Bitter Revolution: China's Struggle with the Modern World, Oxford UK; New York NY (Oxford University Press)  2004, 2005. p.270. – {{ISBN|0-19-280341-7}}; 978-0-19-280605-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Edward M. Gunn agrees, saying that “(t)he fact that Bo Yang is a prolific author of satirical essays (zawen) inevitably recalls the work of Lu Xun.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Gunn,  Rewriting Chinese: Style and Innovation in Twentieth-Century Chinese Prose. Stanford CA (Stanford University Press) 1991, p.156)&lt;/ref&gt; Gunn also emphasizes Bo Yang's “particular interest in history” and the “acerbic wit in defense of democracy and social welfare” (or social rights of the common people).&lt;ref&gt;“Bo Yang had indeed enjoyed playful irony in his use of wenyan wen and wordplay, as well as sport with complex syntax, all of which are key features of Lu Xun's writing.” Edward M. Gunn, ibidem, p.156. –   Considering the fact that Lu Xun's writing were described as subversive and remained inaccessible to almost every citizen in Taiwan due to the ban on printing or possessing them, it is obvious that Bo Yang's ''Lu Xun'esque'' wit had to cause trouble for him under dictators like Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bo Yang gained attention internationally when  a volume of poetry entitled ''Poems of a Period'' was published in Hong Kong in 1986. These poems recall his arrest and imprisonment.

===Later years===
Bo Yang lived in [[Taipei]] in his later years. He became the founding president of the Taiwan chapter of [[Amnesty International]]. In 1994, Boyang underwent heart surgery, and his health never fully recovered. He carried the honorary title of national policy advisor to the administration of President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. In 2006, Boyang retired from writing, and donated the bulk of his manuscripts to the Chinese Modern Literature Museum in [[Beijing]]. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[National University of Tainan|National Tainan University]], to which he also donated many memorabilia and some manuscripts.

Boyang died of [[pneumonia]] in a hospital near his [[Xindian District|Xindian]] residence on 29 April 2008.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  He was married five times, and is survived by his last wife, Chang Hsiang-hua, and five children born by his former wives. On 17 May 2008, his ashes were scattered along the seashore of Green Island, where he was once imprisoned.

'''Bonifaciu Florescu''' (first name also '''Boniface''', '''Bonifacio''', '''Bonifati''', last name also '''Floresco'''; born '''Bonifacius Florescu''';&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; May 1848 – December 18, 1899) was a [[Romania]]n [[Polygraph (author)|polygraph]], the illegitimate son of writer-revolutionary [[Nicolae Bălcescu]]. Born secretly outside his parents' native [[Wallachia]], at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], he was taken by his aristocratic mother in France, growing up as an erudite Francophone and [[Francophile]]. Florescu graduated from the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] and the [[University of Rennes]], returning home at age 25 to become a successful lecturer, polemicist, and historian of culture. Influenced by his father's politics, he was for a while a prominent figure on the far-left of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]] and [[Romanian nationalism|nationalism]], which pitted him against the conservative society ''[[Junimea]]'', and against his own conservative cousin, [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]]. The conflict led to his losing a professorship at [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iași University]] and being sidelined when applying for chairs at the [[University of Bucharest]]. His critique of ''Junimist'' literature, structured around a classical defense of [[Prosody (Latin)|prosody]], inspired a [[Libel (poetry)|libel]] by [[Mihai Eminescu]]—famously depicting Florescu as a "[[homunculus]]".

Florescu had significant success as a self-proclaimed [[Irredentism|irredentist]], agitating for Romanian causes in disputed [[Bukovina]] and [[Transylvania]]. Ultimately, however, he failed in his bid to rise through the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], as the latter moved to the center, and fell back on independent journalism, founding several periodicals of his own. He had a long but interrupted collaboration with another dissident liberal and poet, [[Alexandru Macedonski]], who co-opted him on his ''[[Literatorul]]'' editing team during the 1880s. A precursor, but not an affiliate, of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]], Florescu had steadier friendships with the younger Symbolists [[Mircea Demetriade]] and [[Iuliu Cezar Săvescu]]. His main contribution to pre-Symbolist ''[[belles-lettres]]'' is [[prose poetry]] in the manner of [[Catulle Mendès]].

A committed bohemian, whose lifestyle interfered with his literary output and his teaching job at [[Saint Sava National College|Saint Sava]], Florescu is sometimes read as a herald of [[Decadent movement|decadent writing]]. He was important to the Macedonskian Symbolists for his familiarity with French culture, but was primarily an expert in [[18th-century French literature|18th-century literature]]. His criticism, modeled on [[Abel-François Villemain|Villemain]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] and [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]], was perceived as refined in its context, but later enlisted objections for its pedantry and amateurism. He was a prolific translator passionate about exotic topics, authoring some of the first Romanian versions of stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==Biography==
===Origins===
Born a [[Wallachia]]n subject, Bonifaciu Florescu descended from the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]]: the Bălcescus recognized him as a family member; the Florescus, however, refused to accept that Nicolae Bălcescu was the father.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 130, 135, 145&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family, of lesser rank and prestige, had been founded by Father Necula, a [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Wallachian Orthodox]] parson, who purchased the [[Nicolae Bălcescu, Vâlcea|Bălcești estate]] in 1766. Unusually rich for his social position, he bought for his sons small boyar offices.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea ''et al.'', pp. 11–15; Potra, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; Despite taking the same name, Nicolae and his two brothers descended from the clan through their mother Zinca; she married ''[[Pitar (rank)|Pitar]]'' Barbu sin Petre Căpitanul—a gentleman farmer of [[Prahova County|Prahova]], who also owned townhouses in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodea ''et al.'', pp. 16–21; Potra, pp. 114–118&lt;/ref&gt; Barbu's financial troubles and quick death contributed to the family's marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea ''et al.'', pp. 19–25; Potra, pp. 113–122&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet's mother, Alexandrina "Luxița" Florescu, claimed direct descent from [[Prince of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]], and was the daughter of ''[[Logothete]]'' Iordache Florescu, as well as aunt of [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]], the [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian militia]] chief.&lt;ref name="gc530"&gt;Călinescu, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; The family also had [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] and [[Albanians of Romania|Albanian]] ancestors. Iordache, a [[Ghica family|Ghica]] on his mother's side, ran in the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|1842 election for the Wallachian throne]], under the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime; his wife, Anica, was a [[Soutzos family|Soutzos]].&lt;ref name="ghl270"&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; At age 17, Luxița was married off to a [[Polish minority in Russia|Russian Pole]], but divorced him in 1836, alleging that he was hypersexual;&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt; he was probably also an alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; She may have then met Bălcescu at the Florescu home in Șerban-Vodă, Bucharest, which functioned as a club for progressive intellectuals; however, Bonifaciu was most likely conceived while the couple reunited in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 185, 530; Potra, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Bălcescu, ill with [[tuberculosis]] and absorbed by his conspiratorial work, informed Luxița that they could never be married, which she accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Youth from both families were deeply involved in the [[Wallachian revolution of 1848]], which occurred some weeks after Bonifaciu's birth. Luxița was shielded by her brothers in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], without informing Nicolae of her whereabouts or her pregnancy, until after she delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 132–134&lt;/ref&gt; Bonifaciu was thus born in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]; his date of birth is variously given as May 14,&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;[[Alexandru Piru]], "Florescu Bonifaciu", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. I, p. 593. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004.  {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; May 17, or May 27.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530. "May 27" also in Potra, pp. 133–134, while Crutzescu has "April 27" (p. 490)&lt;/ref&gt; In July, he was baptized into Orthodoxy at a Pest chapel shared by the [[Church of Greece|Greek]] and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] churches. The baptismal record omits mention of his father's family name, but indicates his godfather as [[Inochentie Chițulescu]] (future [[Archdiocese of Buzău and Vrancea|Bishop of Buzău]]).&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 132, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

By July, Bălcescu had been appointed foreign minister of revolutionary Wallachia, but then a reshuffle pushed him into the background.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman empires]] intervened militarily, and the revolutionaries were pushed into exile or imprisoned. Brothers Nicolae and Costache Bălcescu escaped to Paris, passing through [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|insurgent Hungary]]; the third Bălcescu brother, Barbu, was taken to Istanbul as a hostage.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea ''et al.'', pp. 25–26; Călinescu, pp. 184, 185–188; Potra, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; Three of Luxița's brothers—Iancu, Dumitrache, and Costache Florescu—participated in the events, and played a part in the shootout with the loyalist Colonel [[Grigore Lăcusteanu]], whom they eventually arrested. Unusually, Costache Florescu's daughter married Lăcusteanu's brother Iancu while the colonel was still in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 34–35, 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; All three brothers were repressed during the foreign intervention: Iancu Florescu was arrested by the Russians and spent some eight years in [[Siberia]], returning after the [[Crimean War]] removed Wallachia from the Russian sphere of influence; Costache and Dumitrache were taken into Ottoman custody, returning after nine years of exile in [[Bursa]].&lt;ref name="ghl270"/&gt; While Iancu took up law practice,&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Dumitrache is best known for setting to music the poetry of [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

With material support from Chițulescu, Luxița and her son returned to Wallachia in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 133, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Although she only formally adopted Bonifaciu in 1858, to solidify his claim to the Florescu estate, he grew up knowing that the exiled Bălcescu was his father.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 133, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; Prevented from returning home (with a brief exception in August 1852, when he only met Zinca at [[Turnu Măgurele]]),&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolae died in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Siciles]] (November 1852). His grave is presumed lost.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 188; Potra, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===French studies and 1873 return===
Luxița and Bonifaciu were also largely absent from Wallachia as the country merged with [[Moldavia]] into the [[United Principalities]] (the basis for modern Romania). Bonifaciu attended [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, living with his mother on [[Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris|Rue Saint-Jacques]], and possibly obtaining a scholarship from the Romanian government.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up speaking French at home, and only later perfected his Romanian, which he always spoke with an accent and a [[guttural R]].&lt;ref name="gp136"&gt;Potra, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; His impromptu versions of [[Romanian orthography]] reflected [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic spelling]] with unusual consistency for his day, and they unwittingly recorded his own difficulties in pronouncing Romanian words. This trait was ridiculed by philologist Hanes Suchianu as the very "apex of phoneticism".&lt;ref&gt;Longinescu, pp. 6, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Familiarized with Bălcescu's works by age 17, Bonifaciu declared his father to have been a "genius", "Romania's only prose writer".&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; He followed Nicolae's radical orientation, declaring the [[French Revolution]] as the "triumph of justice, liberty and equality, and a great step toward fraternity"; he also took up the cause of [[Pan-Europeanism]], arguing for "[[United States of Europe|one great European republic]], as in America."&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Reading up on the events at home, Florescu was indignant about the 1866 coup against ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. In his view, Cuza, albeit ruling with an "authoritarian hand", was preferable to the foreign-born replacement [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Passionate about literature, Florescu and his colleague [[Frédéric Damé]] set up their own newspaper, ''L'Avenir'' ("The Future"), which only put out a few issues.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 134, 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Florescu was described by teachers and relatives as a charming but inattentive student, and was once moved to a remedial class, ultimately obtaining his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in August 1868.&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt; In October 1872, he graduated from the literature faculty of the [[University of Rennes]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Nastasă (2007), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; From mid 1873, he returned with his mother to Bucharest, where she became the curator of a [[retirement home]] maintained by the [[Sisters of Charity]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Her son debuted in the Romanian press with an overview of history as reflected in [[Romanian folklore]]; it was hosted in ''[[Românul]]'', published by [[C. A. Rosetti]] (July–August 1873).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, Florescu married Rose-Henriette Le Roho d'Alcobia (born 1849), the orphaned scion of an Anglo-French-Portuguese family.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 140. See also Nastasă (2010), pp. 51, 83, 237&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, they did not have any children of their own, but later adopted a boy named Ion.&lt;ref name="gp140"&gt;Potra, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, literary historian [[George Călinescu]] suggests that Ion was the couple's natural son, "a direct descendant of Nicolae Bălcescu".&lt;ref name="gc1004"&gt;Călinescu, p. 1004&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, following an examination performed by historian [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]],&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 136. See also Nastasă (2007), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu had obtained a "provisional"&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 430; (2010), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; professorate at the department of world literature within the literature faculty of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iași University]]. He thus replaced [[Nicolae Ionescu]], who preferred to keep his seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]].&lt;ref name="gc530;gp136"&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher George Porta suggests that Florescu never actually took hold of his chair, being snubbed by two successive [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Ministers]]: [[Christian Tell]] and [[Vasile Boerescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 136, 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; However, his introductory lesson was published in Hasdeu's newspaper, ''Columna lui Traian'',&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 530, 1003; Perpessicius (1943), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; which also hosted Florescu's homage to the retiring poet [[Grigore Alexandrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre V. Haneș]], "Îndreptări și întregiri la biografia lui Gr. Alexandrescu", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Nr. 5/1936, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in [[Iași]], Florescu, supported by physician [[Anastasie Fătu]], also founded and operated an [[adult high school]].&lt;ref name="Perpessicius 1943, p. 239"&gt;Perpessicius (1943), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clash with ''Junimea''===
In April 1874, a conservative coalition that included ''[[Junimea]]'' society of [[Iași]] formed the national government, with [[Lascăr Catargiu]] as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. The cabinet had Bonifaciu's cousin, [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]], for a [[Ministry of National Defence (Romania)|Defense Minister]]—described by critics as authoritarian in his handling of political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), pp. 84–85; (1935), pp. 163, 192; Theodorian-Carada, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Bonifaciu himself was dismissed immediately by the new Education Minister, ''Junimist'' ideologue [[Titu Maiorescu]], who "could not stand him."&lt;ref name="gp136"/&gt; In his official report, Maiorescu noted that, although Florescu was an erudite, his peculiar teaching style was driving students away.&lt;ref name="gc530;gp136"/&gt;

This dispute doubled as an cultural conflict between liberals such as Florescu and ''Junimea''. Florescu spent much of his time in polemics with the minister, and also with the ''Junimist'' poet [[Mihail Eminescu]]. The latter scandal began in January 1876 with Florescu's derisive note in ''Românul''. Here, Florescu attacked ''Junimism'' (and implicitly Eminescu's work) as a "torrent of little poets"—although, in the same text, he praised Eminescu's lover [[Veronica Micle]] for her own "beautiful" verse.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 241–242; Pop, pp. 59–62&lt;/ref&gt; Declaring himself dissatisfied with the [[assonance]] of ''Junimist'' poetry, Florescu demanded a more thorough [[literary consonance]]. As noted later by the critic [[Perpessicius]], this request was "bizarre" and "drunk on [[Prosody (Latin)|prosody]]", although Florescu had "his indisputable merits."&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 62–63, 146&lt;/ref&gt; Perpessicius also proposes that it formed part of a press campaign "in bad taste", "as vociferous as it was impotent", seeking to undermine ''Junimea''{{'}}s steady rise,&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; with Florescu "in so very many ways, from the pestering to the inept, ready to censor Eminescu's budding oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu's review was immediately challenged by [[Nicolae Scurtescu]], who sent ''Românul'' a letter in which he expressed solidarity with Eminescu, and asked to be struck out from Florescu's list of "good poets", suggesting that Florescu had no qualification to compile such lists.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 242–243; Pop, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminescu would also respond later in 1876 with the [[Libel (poetry)|libel]] ''Epistolă deschisă homunculului Bonifaciu'' ("An Open Letter to Bonifaciu the [[Homunculus]]"). Its reference to a mysterious newspaper, ''Pruncul'' ("The Babe"), was later identified as a jibe at ''Românul'', whose predecessor was an 1848 sheet, ''[[Pruncul Român]]'' ("The Romanian Infant").&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; The "letter", written in tones of "rising anger",&lt;ref name="gc470"&gt;Călinescu, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; reads:
{{Verse translation|lang=ro|
Azi venind din întâmplare și sub ochii noștri ''Pruncul'',
Am citit critic-adâncă renumitului homuncul,
El cu mintea sa câlțoasă și cu stil greoi, bombastic —
Cearcă să ne-arate ''nouă'' ce-i frumos și ce e plastic,
Întinzând pe-a noastre versuri groasa minții sale labă,
El ni spune cum se cade să rimeze un om de treabă.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530. Earlier versions in Pop, pp. 58–59, 62&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Just today, as we were handed that one sheet they call the ''Pruncul'',
It so happened that we read some big critique from ''the'' homuncule.
His mind fuzzy, filled with oakum, his style laden and bombastic,
Planning nonetheless to teach us words of beauty, art that's plastic;
Dragging his stiff paws of wisdom into verse that ''we'' had made,
He expects that decent people will take note, like he's obeyed.}}
[[File:Banchetul noueĭ direcţiĭ la borta rece patronat de Muerilă, Ghimpele, 16 nov 1875.JPG|thumb|260px|Cartoon in ''[[Ghimpele]]'', the liberal magazine, depicting [[Titu Maiorescu]] and the "new direction" at ''[[Junimea]]'' (November 1875). The barrel ridden by Maiorescu is marked ''Instrucțiunea publică'' ("Public Instruction"), in reference to his job as [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]]]]
Călinescu finds the poem to be a "vigorous satire", its reference to "B. Florescu's 'oakum' brain [...] describing quite well a fibrous arrhythmic state".&lt;ref name="gc470"/&gt; By 1880, the "homunculus" imagery was rehashed for the early draft of an ample poem, ''[[Scrisoarea II]]'', part of which is specifically dedicated to ridiculing Eminescu's detractors.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 232–233; (2001), p. 146; Pop, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Perpessicius, Florescu, unlike Rosetti, was never mentioned in the more definitive satire, ''[[Scrisoarea III]]''. This, he suggests, may be a sign of his relative insignificance among Eminescu's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (2001), pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Potra notes, Florescu was largely unemployed, and pushed to make his living by giving private lessons in French—his students included the two daughters of physician [[Constantin Istrati]] and the future dramatist [[Ioan Bacalbașa]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 138–139, 144&lt;/ref&gt; "Turned proletarian",&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt; he and Rose-Henriette lived in rented rooms at Pasajul Roman.&lt;ref name="gp140"/&gt; Maiorescu only allowed Florescu to teach an optional "free" course at the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Letters. The lessons were a corpus of "critical modern history" (published as a textbook in 1875), discussing such topics as progressivism, the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutionalism]], and [[German nationalism]], as well as the genesis of Wallachian boyardom. They were also indirectly supervised from Paris by professor Henri Pigeonneau, who sent Florescu a bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 136, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Although Florescu expressed his frustration over lacking oratorical skills, the lectures made him very popular with Bucharesters.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 136–137, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Florescu's radicalism also brought him into contact with [[Hristo Botev]], instigator of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]], whom Florescu met in Bucharest and perhaps acquainted with the works of Bălcescu.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Hurezeanu, Constantin N. Velichi, "Date noi privind pătrunderea ideilor Internaționalei I in România și în rîndurile emigrației bulgare din țara noastră", in ''Romanoslavica'', Vol. XI, 1965, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Some controversy did occur locally when Florescu expressed his democratic beliefs in his university lectures, describing boyardom as a bane and congratulating his own family for giving up on privilege.&lt;ref name="gp137"&gt;Potra, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; His early work as a polemicist includes two volumes of ''Etiam contra omnes'' ("Even against All"), published alongside the brochure ''Una suta de adevĕrurĭ'' ("A Hundred Truths").&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1003; Perpessicius (1943), pp. 239–241, 244; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 330. See also Seișanu, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; The latter comprised [[aphorism]]s tinged by anti-''Junimism'', originally appearing in the daily ''Telegraphul de Bucurescĭ'', where he also published essays discussing [[Étienne de La Boétie]]'s ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt;

He kept a grudge against Maiorescu, and, in 1875 letters for ''Apărătorul Legeĭ'' newspaper, accused others, notably [[Cezar Bolliac]], of behaving "like Maiorescu".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 241, 243&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in 1877 Florescu was theater chronicler at the ''Junimea'' daily, ''[[România Liberă]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 I) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; His journalism was by then prolific, with articles also taken up in ''Columna lui Traian'' and ''Românul'', and also in liberal papers such as ''Albine și Viespi'', ''Alegătorul'', and ''Revista Contimporană''. Some were encyclopedic overviews, with topics such as [[Pre-Columbian Mexico]] (1875) and the [[settlement of Iceland]] (1877);&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; others were the first in a series of ''Studiĭ literare'' ("Studies in Literature") where he carried on with critiques of prosody.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 530, 986&lt;/ref&gt; Another contribution was as a translator, where he made local literary history with [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart|Tell-Tale Heart]]" in 1875, followed in 1876 by "[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]".&lt;ref&gt;Liviu Cotrău, "Edgar Allan Poe in Romanian Translation", in Emron Esplin, Margarida Vale de Gato (eds.), ''Translated Poe'', p. 77. Lanham: [[Lehigh University Press]] &amp; [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2014.  {{ISBN|978-1-61146-171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1875, Florescu involved himself in the dispute between Romania and [[Austria-Hungary]], concerning the [[Duchy of Bukovina]]—Romanian-inhabited, but taken by the [[Austrian Empire]] following the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca|rearrangement of 1775]]. His work, published as a brochure co-authored by [[Vasile Maniu]], accused the Austrians of double-dealing and fraud perpetrated against Moldavia and the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 141. See also Perpessicius (1943), p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas endeared him to the [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalists]] in [[Transylvania]], which was also under Austro-Hungarian rule. In that region, Florescu's work was displayed as an important contribution in ''Orientul Latin'', the nationalist, [[Pan-Latinism|Pan-Latinist]], anti-''Junimist'' review of [[Ioan Alexandru Lapedatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 I), pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu also involved himself in the dispute over [[Jewish emancipation]]: with his school friend Damé, he translated into French Hasdeu's ''Histoire de la tolérance religieuse en Roumanie'' ("History of Religious Tolerance in Romania").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Octavian Onea, [http://www.romlit.ro/hasdeu_la_o_sut_de_ani_de_la_moarte "Hasdeu la o sută de ani de la moarte"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 38/2007; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1875, with help from liberal agitators, Florescu seized the opportunity to lecture on Bukovina at the [[Romanian Atheneum]]. The Catargiu government forbade it and threatened him with arrest, though he eventually found an open venue at Suhr Circus, between [[Calea Victoriei]] and [[Lipscani]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1935), pp. 153–155; Perpessicius (1943), p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his attested incompetence in public speaking, this event attracted a crowd comprising, in some reports, as many as 6,000 nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1935), pp. 140, 155; Potra, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Suhr Circus incident, Romanian liberal groups formed the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], which became focused on regaining power. For three weeks in April 1876, Florescu's cousin was the conservative Prime Minister of a mainly soldiers' cabinet. Outmaneuvered by the opposition, it fell and was replaced with a National Liberal government, headed by [[Manolache Costache Epureanu]]—himself replaced after the [[Romanian general election, 1876|June election]] with [[Ion Brătianu]], supported by the party's radical, or "Red", majority.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1935), pp. 181–190, 281&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Literatorul''===
[[File:Literatorul 1 iuniu 1880.png|thumb|240px|''[[Literatorul]]'' of June 1, 1880, featuring Floescu's essay on the [[Greek chorus]] and translations from [[Henri Murger]], alongside poetry by Macedonski, [[Th. M. Stoenescu]], and [[Carol Scrob]]]]
During this episode of liberal triumph an intrigue, Florescu befriended the liberal poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]], who sympathized with him in his conflict with Maiorescu. Macedonski wrote a poem denouncing Maiorescu's "scholarly tribe" and Florescu's 1874 sacking.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; Between March and June, Florescu published his own newspaper, the republican and anti-conservative ''Stindardul'' ("The Flag"), alongside Macedonski and dramatist [[Pantazi Ghica]]; however, Macedonski soon quit the enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 239, 243–244; Potra, pp. 141, 142–143; [[Tudor Vianu]], "Alexandru Macedonski", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 455. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; As a "Red", Florescu tried but failed to present himself as a candidate in [[Ilfov County]]: in primaries, his colleagues preferred [[Eugeniu Stătescu]] over him;&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1935), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; in June 1876, he withdrew from ''Stindardul'', declaring himself exhausted by the elections and by his regular work, the "five hours of daily tutoring".&lt;ref name="Perpessicius 1943, p. 244"&gt;Perpessicius (1943), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by memoirist [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], both Florescu and Macedonski had political ambitions and were very popular in liberal circles, but they were also "transient heroes, the sort that go down with their ephemeral wave."&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1935), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1876, minister [[Gheorghe Chițu]] ruled Florescu's 1873 appointment valid, but only assigned him to a history-and-French teacher's position at [[Saint Sava National College|Saint Sava High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 137, 138&lt;/ref&gt; According to the satirical gazette ''[[Ghimpele]]'', Florescu, "erstwhile a communist, yesterday a liberal", taught his pupils extravagant and inaccurate lessons in history. It also alleged that he skipped classes in order to promote the magazine ''Nuvelistul'', on which he also worked as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Rococo, "Douĕ celebritățĭ necelebrate de celebritățile academice", in ''[[Ghimpele]]'', Nr. 24/1877, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877–1878, the [[Romanian War of Independence]] (or more specifically, Romania's contribution to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]]) opened the way for the country's evolution into a [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1880). Although independence occurred under a National Liberal mandate, Bonifaciu's cousin is widely credited with having helped modernize the [[Romanian Land Forces]] and getting them battle-ready.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), pp. 100, 154; (1935), pp. 134–136, 173; [[Șerban Cioculescu]], "Ion Ghica", in Șerban Cioculescu, [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', pp. 432–433. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973. See also Theodorian-Carada, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Bonifaciu also contributed, on the humanitarian side, publishing the collection ''Quelques vers'', which specified that it collected money ''au profit des blessés'' ("to help the wounded").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1003; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Florescu saw himself as fit to occupy the vacated French-language chair at Bucharest University. However, this was converted into a [[Romance studies]] chair by government order, then assigned to Gian Luigi Frollo—the enduring perception was that Brătianu was clamping down on French influence, for fear of upsetting [[German Empire|Germany]].&lt;ref name="jalett412"&gt;[[Juliette Adam]], "Lettres sur la politique extérieure", in ''[[La Nouvelle Revue]]'', Vol. 72, 1891, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu tried but failed to obtain a professorship in psychology and aesthetics at Bucharest University, and narrowly lost the race for the Romance chair.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 408, 430&lt;/ref&gt; From January 1880, with Macedonski and [[Th. M. Stoenescu]], Florescu edited a cultural review, ''[[Literatorul]]'', where he published notes on the [[Franco-Prussian War]]&lt;ref name="gp142"&gt;Potra, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; and his new [[prose poetry]], the "watercolors" and "sanguines".&lt;ref name="amar521"&gt;Marino, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; The embryo of a [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist movement]], ''Literatorul'' soon became noted for its prolonged polemic with Eminescu, which was carried by both Macedonski and Florescu.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 I), p. 200; Pop, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; The latter also censured Macedonski's estranged friend, [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], who defected to ''Junimea''. When he later alleged that this was for material gain, Zamfirescu simply dismissed him as a ''zevzec'' ("nitwit").&lt;ref&gt;[[Emanoil Bucuța]], "Scrisorile trimise de Duiliu Zamfirescu lui Titu Maiorescu", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 6/1935, pp. 580&lt;/ref&gt;

Florescu himself eventually withdrew from the enterprise after a mysterious quarrel with Macedonski, who then accused him, also in ''Literatorul'', of having squandered public money with his teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to scholar [[Șerban Cioculescu]], Florescu and Stonescu, together with poet-actor [[Mircea Demetriade]]—all three "faint and subdued figures"—, remained the last Macedonski loyalists as the latter fell into disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Cioculescu]], "Introducere generală", in Șerban Cioculescu, [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', pp. 10–11. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critic [[Adrian Marino]] notes that, while Macedonski's program was "constructive, evolved and receptive of the most fecund modern orientations", its main adherents, Florescu included, were "insignificant [and] obscure".&lt;ref&gt;Marino, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

His own monthly, ''Portofoliul Român'' ("The Romanian Portfolio"), appeared between March 1881 and June 1882,&lt;ref name="gp140"/&gt; hosting poetry by Demetriade and Florescu's "watercolors",&lt;ref name="xbbgf286"&gt;X., "Bibliografie. ''Portofoliul''", in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', Nr. 6/1881, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his various historical essays—much praised by the Romanophile Frenchman [[Abdolonyme Ubicini]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 140, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; In a note published therein, he revealed that ''Portofoliul'' only existed because of [[Petru Grădișteanu]], whose recent law on [[debt relief]] had spared Florescu from his creditors.&lt;ref name="xbbgf286"/&gt; This news was reviewed with amusement in ''Junimea''{{'}}s ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', which remarked that literature "owes so much to Mr. Grădișteanu". The same magazine derided Florescu's attempt to summarize philosophically the [[history of Austria]] on five pages: "The bigger the country, the shorter its philosophy."&lt;ref name="xbbgf286"/&gt; Additionally, Florescu announced that he was working on a fragmentary treatise on the [[historiosophy]] of the [[Balkans]], seen by him as a single cultural and racial space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dumitru Popovici]], "Difuzarea ideilor 'Luminării' în țările române", in ''Studii Literare'', Vol. III, 1944, pp. 83, 134&lt;/ref&gt; His other contributions included a rhyming obituary to painter [[Ion Andreescu]], taken up in ''Binele Public'' newspaper and then carved on Andreescu's tombstone.&lt;ref name="gp141"&gt;Potra, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bohemian===
In 1884, the Florescus moved out of Pasajul Roman and to a small house on Calea Victoriei, with Bonifaciu founding a literary [[Serial (publishing)|serial]], ''Biblioteca Omuluĭ de Gust'' ("The Library of Tasteful Men"),&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 140. See also Bucur, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; where he issued the collected poems of [[Alexandru Depărățeanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 995&lt;/ref&gt; The year also witnessed a release of his collected historical essays, as ''Memento de istorie universală sau Istoria în tablourĭ'' ("World History Memento or, History in Scenes"); his translation of Musset's play "Never Swear That You Be Not Forsworn"; and his critical edition of [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Count Buffon]]'s ''Discours sur le style''.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331. See also Bucur, p. 89; Călinescu, pp. 530, 1003&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the following year, ''Românul'' had a row with the National Liberal Party, causing Florescu to side with the former. The core issue was again nationalism: Prime Minister Brătianu gave in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and expelled a group of Transylvanians, including [[Nicolae Ciurcu]], publisher of ''[[L'Indépendance Roumaine]]''. When ''Românul'' protested and was raided by police, Florescu showed up to express solidarity, one of several National Liberals to do so—the others were Grădișteanu, [[Dimitrie Gianni]], and [[George D. Pallade]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, his essay on the 1848 revolution was taken up by the same ''L'Indépendance Roumaine''.&lt;ref name="gp142"/&gt;

By then, the historian lived a bohemian life, and was a regular at Fialcovsky Coffeehouse, where he appeared "jocular and always absent minded".&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; According to the recollections of Mariu Theodorian-Carada, although "Boniface Florescu" and Demetriade made efforts to keep it alive, by 1886 "Fialkovsky was dwindling".&lt;ref&gt;Theodorian-Carada, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Potra notes that Florescu was memorable as a Bucharest "type", "with his quite disheveled appearance, his paddling, slow and measured stride, and above all with his way of life".&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he always wore just one [[galosh]],&lt;ref name="vișa"&gt;[[Maica Smara|Baba Vișa]], "Răvașe Intime. Un salon literar în 1883. — Veronica Micle și Mihail Eminescu", in ''Cultura Poporului'', Nr. 323/1930, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes one of his wife's boots,&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; and his suits were covered in ink blots.&lt;ref name="gp139"&gt;Potra, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gheorghe Gh. Longinescu]], who was schooled at Saint Sava, recalls that his teacher had an unusual, crooked, stride, which matched his handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Longinescu, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed Saint Sava alumnus recalled in 1926: "Just about every day, he would walk the streets reading from a newspaper or a book, and, since he was shortsighted, he kept [it] very close to his eyes, and so he bumped into streetlights or street corners, after which he would present his excuses."&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 139. See also Iorga (1939), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Maica Smara]], who shared a home with Bonifaciu, Henriette-Rose, and sculptor [[Ion Georgescu]] in the 1880s, recalls that they "never once opened a window", and notes: "[[hoopoe]]s did better housecleaning than them."&lt;ref name="vișa"/&gt; Physician [[Constantin Dimitrescu-Severeanu]], who visited his home, records that Bonifaciu and wife slept on a pile of hay, and that Florescu looked like "he never washed his face more than thrice a year."&lt;ref name="ctz179"&gt;Crutzescu, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu was a heavy drinker and smoker, and, according to another one-time student, [[Constantin Kirițescu]], only seemed at ease in coffeehouses and bars; he despised Saint Sava and, with time, only showed up for that work because it paid a salary.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 237–238, 439&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Severeanu, he borrowed money from both friends and students, promising that they were for him to write a new book.&lt;ref name="ctz179"/&gt; Longinescu additionally claims that Florescu was "unusually cultured, but lacked common sense", and so the victim of "countless student pranks".&lt;ref&gt;Longinescu, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Among the students who remained loyal to Florescu was the poet [[Iuliu Cezar Săvescu]], who, in 1886, also became a member of Macedonski's circle.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 II), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

While his picturesque demeanor was laughed at, Florescu's erudition was acclaimed, in particular concerning his passionate Saint Sava lessons about [[18th-century French literature]], which was regarded as his main field of expertise.&lt;ref name="gp139"/&gt; The courses were published in several installments, from 1887 to 1893, followed by the book edition of ''Studiĭ literare''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 1003–1004; Potra, p. 141; Teodorescu ''et al.'', pp. 330–331. See also Bucur, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1888, Macedonski and Florescu took over management of ''[[România Literară]]'' review from [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu|D. Teleor]]; it survived until 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Marino, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1889, Florescu translated [[Catulle Mendès]]' ''Imagerie parisienne'', adding his own "Romanian Sanguines",&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 1003–1004; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to the University of Bucharest with another "free" course, this time on French literature.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he had joined several members of the ''Literatorul'' school who were migrating toward ''Revista Nouă'', put out by Hasdeu and featuring authors disliked by Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Octavian Oncea, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/89_via-a-romaneasca-1-2-2014/57_restituiri/1743_i-l-caragiale-patru-clase-primare-si-gimnasiale-sau-studii-superioare.html "I. L. Caragiale... Patru clase primare (și gimnaziale), sau studii superioare?!"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 1–2/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in [[spiritism]], from about 1890 Florescu also attended Hasdeu's ''[[séance]]s'', alongside [[Ghenadie Petrescu|Bishop Ghenadie]], [[George Ionescu-Gion]], and [[Ioan S.

In 1892, he produced a volume of his collected poetry, as ''Ritmurĭ și rime'' ("Rhythms and Rhymes"). Its theoretical notes on prosody relaunched the attack on Eminescu, depicting him and the younger [[Alexandru Vlahuță]] as "enemies of rhythm and rhyme"; of the latter two, he favored rhythm, and translated a fragment from [[Victor Hugo]] in [[blank verse]], to prove his point.&lt;ref name="Perpessicius 1943, p. 244"/&gt; The book also featured his renditions of poems by: [[Henri Auguste Barbier]], [[Mellin de Saint-Gelais]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Clément Marot]], [[François Rabelais]], [[Isaac de Benserade]], [[Paul Scarron]], [[Alexandre Soutzo]], [[Ponce Denis Écouchard Lebrun|Ponce Lebrun]], and [[Charles Rivière Dufresny]].&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al331"&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; His work of the period also covered selections from other classics and moderns of French literature: [[Molière]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rodolphe Töpffer]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Edgar Quinet]], [[George Sand]], [[Henri Murger]], [[Paul Armand Silvestre]], [[Théodore de Banville]], and [[José-Maria de Heredia]]; more exotically, he also rendered into Romanian works by [[Walter Scott]] and [[Fernán Caballero]], as well as samples of [[Literature of Madagascar|Malagasy]] and [[Indian poetry]].&lt;ref name="gp141"/&gt; Also publishing in [[Giurgiu]] an anthology of [[17th-century French literature|17th-century poetry in French]],&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al331"/&gt; he moved house closer to Saint Sava in 1891, at a new address on Soarelui Street, which also became the editorial offices of his new gazette.&lt;ref name="gp140"/&gt; Called ''Dumineca'' ("The Sunday"), and published to February 1891, it was co-edited by Demetriade and Săvescu, and possibly managed by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 II), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===1890s irredentism===
[[File:Manifestaţia studenţilor universitari, Bucureşti, 1892.jpg|thumb|340px|[[University of Bucharest]] students rallying in support of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'', 1892 photograph]]
A while after, Florescu's cousin, a prominent figure in the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Liberal Conservative Party]], briefly served as Prime Minister. Reportedly, Bonifaciu had hopes that Ion Emanuel would reestablish the Bucharest French-language chair and assign him to it, but the relevant minister, [[G. Dem. Teodorescu]], vetoed any such move.&lt;ref name="jalett412"/&gt; The premier was eventually sidelined from within the party by Catargiu, and lost a [[vote of no confidence]], ushering in the [[Romanian general election, 1892|February 1892 elections]]; he died in Paris in May 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), pp. 126–133, 138–142, 154. See also Theodorian-Carada, pp. 11–12, 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Bonifaciu had begun writing a biography of his father, in French; unpublished, it was later preserved by the Bălcescu Memorial Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea ''et al.'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; With Demetriade, he became a regular contributor to Săvescu's own literary magazine, launched in 1893 as ''Liga Literară''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 II), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu was also a regular at [[Grigore Tocilescu]]'s scientific journal, ''Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie''. Tocilescu, his cousin thrice removed, allowed him to publish his notes on Bălcescu's complex mediation between the Hungarians and Romanians of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 141, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

His own hard-line stance on the Transylvanian issue, expressed during the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'' incident of 1892, alienated him further from both dominant parties. By November 1893, he was editing a newspaper called ''Irredenta Română'' ("The Romanian Irredenta"), his contribution there derided by the National Liberal [[Dimitrie Sturdza]]. Sturdza argued that Florescu's goal of annexing Transylvania to the Romanian kingdom was unrealistic; he also declared that such radicalism was only serving Romania's enemies, with Florescu and his colleagues "either sold out or very incompetent and stupid."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Brote]], ''Cestiunea română în Transilvania și Ungaria. Un memoriŭ politic'', pp. 282, 286. Bucharest: [[Voința Națională|Tipografia Voința Națională]], 1895&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the nonpartisan [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]], Florescu was a direct contributor to its irredentist propaganda, working alongside the Italian sympathizer [[Roberto Fava]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrie Braharu, ''Chestiunea română în Italia în timpul Memorandului'', pp. 105, 128. Cluj: [[Cartea Românească]], 1942&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped the young nationalist liberal, [[Take Ionescu]], polishing his letters of protest against Austria-Hungary, written in French. As Ionescu recalled decades later: "Bonifaciu was a veritable savant, but had endured the unrepentant bohemian. He only worked when we pressed him to, with us looking over his shoulder."&lt;ref&gt;Seișanu, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

During this stage of his life, Florescu became close friends with Georges Bibesco, French-speaking son of [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] (whom his father and uncles had deposed in 1848). He translated Bibesco's defensive biography of his father, which ran at over 1200 pages in the printed edition of 1893–1894.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 142, 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; As he noted in a dedication to Bibesco, he considered him a friend through their shared [[Francophilia]], but nonetheless a political adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Bibesco then enlisted Florescu's services in clearing Prince Gheorghe of the allegations that he intended to concede all of Wallachia's mining industry to Russian venture capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu also worked with Theodor Assan and A. Dobrovici on a history of the United Principalities, published as ''Unirea Română'' ("The Romanian Unification"), and translated Bibesco's tract on the history of Wallachia and Moldavia under ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al331"/&gt;

Also in 1894, Florescu was an unsuccessful candidate for the vacated chair of medieval and modern history at Bucharest University—a position ultimately taken up by [[Nicolae Iorga]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 243–245, 430&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Lucian Nastasă, his "permanent failure" to obtain academic credentials had an explanation "as plain as they get: his attitude was openly and actively anti-''Junimist''."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on the period in 1939, Iorga himself noted: "Shame that in this literary world of ours, guided by groups and interests, that poor man never heard a good word for that consuming labor of his and for his true talent, inherited from his father."&lt;ref name="ni(39)339"&gt;Iorga (1939), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Florescu gathered his ''Literatorul'' pieces as ''Aquarele și poeziĭ în proză'' ("Watercolors and Prose Poems"), with contributions by Demetriade and a C. Drăgulinescu, and with samples from Murger.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; His work for 1894 additionally included the first volume of a French–Romanian dictionary (comprising 6 volumes in all), followed in 1895 by an overview of [[French poetry|French lyrical poetry]] "between the 10th and 20th {{sic}} centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1004; Potra, pp. 141, 143; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years, Florescu made one more attempt at founding a review—the 1894 weekly ''Dacia Viitoare'' ("Future [[Dacia]]")—and contributed an overview of the [[Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan|Horea–Cloșca rebellion]] to the Symbolist journal ''Revista Orientală''.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 140, 141, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years and death===
Florescu eventually resigned from Saint Sava,&lt;ref name="gp137"/&gt; but continued to teach history and French at [[Mihai Viteazul National College (Bucharest)|Mihai Viteazul High School]], at the military high school, and at the Saint Nephon seminary.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 331. See also Iorga (1939), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; His late experiments in [[wisdom poetry]] appeared in the Transylvanian ''[[Vatra (Romanian magazine)|Vatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Th. Vîrgolici, "Alte reviste", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 654. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; For a while director of a new magazine, ''Țara Literară'' ("The Literary Country"),&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; he was also a contributor to [[Ion Livescu]]'s ''Revista Theatrelor'', aimed at the community of actors and theater aficionados.&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Livescu saw him as one of the great critics in the field, equal to Ionescu-Gion and [[Grigore Ventura]].&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, with Săvescu, Florescu began translating from a history of [[Albanian literature]] (in Italian, by [[Alberto Straticò]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Albania și România'', p. 8. Vălenii de Munte: [[Neamul Românesc]], 1915&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Florescu had published over 200 books, comprising his own works alongside translations,&lt;ref name="gp141"/&gt; and had had his own verse anthologized by poet [[Radu D. Rosetti]] (in ''Cartea Dragosteĭ'', 1896).&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al331"/&gt;

Before August 1899, Florescu's work was hampered by an illness, later diagnosed as [[ventricular hypertrophy]]; he was living with his family in a small house on Speranței Street, north of [[Colțea Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 144–145. See also Călinescu, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; Luxița Florescu died in October of that year, aged 83,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 135, 144&lt;/ref&gt; and Bonifaciu only two months later, on December 18. Demetriade unexpectedly dropped by on a visit just after his friend's death, recalling: "he had woken up more joyful than ever. Always one to enjoy a pun, he asked his wife, whose name was Rose, to hand him a rose that had been left in some glass. Just after Madam Florescu handed him that flower, the soul of this man, always a poet, went out with the perfume of the rose."&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; A brief obituary in ''Literatorul'' credited him as someone "illustrious but unhappy", who "stood up to the intellectual degeneracy into which our country was continuously pushed."&lt;ref&gt;"Bonifaciu Florescu — A încetat din viață" in ''[[Literatorul]]'', Nr. 1/1900, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the family crypt at [[Țigănești Monastery]], next to his mother, with a funeral ceremony attended by the Bucharest aristocracy and the Saint Sava students.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 135, 145. See also Călinescu, p. 530; Crutzescu, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; The grave has since been lost during extensive repair work on the monastery grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Florescu was survived by both his wife and his son. In 1900, Henriette-Rose took a small pension from the state, awarded to her by a review committee which included Costache Bălcescu.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; She lived for 28 more years, to January 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Ion, an officer in the [[Romanian Land Forces]], married in February 1910 Elena Kalinderu, a relative of agriculturist and art collector [[Ioan Kalinderu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1004; Potra, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; He had two children of his own: Mircea Ioan (born 1912, killed in a car accident in 1929), and judge Ion "Nelu" Florescu, who emigrated to Brazil and was still alive in 1941.&lt;ref name="gc1004"/&gt;

Bonifaciu Florescu's work and family history gained more exposure after the [[King Michael's Coup|August 1944 coup]] and during early [[Communist Romania|Romanian communism]], when left-wing ideologies turned Bălcescu into their hero. At the time, Potra notes, the Florescus came to accept Bonifaciu's paternity, published secret notes and rare photographs, and even helped [[Camil Petrescu]] write his romanticized biography of the revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historiography]] proposed that Florescu was secretly a [[Communards|Communard]], and that he supported [[Sergey Nechayev]], the Russian revolutionist, providing him with his own passport. The claim was reviewed with skepticism by the Romanian scholar [[Georges Haupt]], who noted that "Florescu" was actually a certain N. F. Melediu.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Haupt|Haupt Gheorghe]], "Influența în România a revistei ''Colocol'' (Clopotul) editată la Londra de revoluționarul democrat rus A. I. Herzen (1860–1870)", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie și Filosofie'', Nr. 4/1950, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in the 1980s by Potra, the real Florescu had been causally forgotten, despite being both Bălcescu's heir and, on his own, "a distinguished scholar, a true ''[[Encyclopédistes|encyclopédiste]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work==
[[George Călinescu]] saw Florescu as a characteristic product of the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]], his [[didactic art]] "decent" but "convoluted and timid, overwhelmed by ideas of classicism".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; His [[lyrical poetry]] respects all the criteria that he wanted to impose on Eminescu; nonetheless, critics argue, it is not ungraceful, nor devoid of sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 530–531; Perpessicius (1943), pp. 244–245; Potra, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Potra, his 1883 epitaph for [[Ion Andreescu]] is "very dull, in pointless verses which tell us nothing about the value of our great painter."&lt;ref name="gp141"/&gt; As seen by comparatist Marin Bucur, Florescu's work in verse was already culturally irrelevant by 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

As a literary innovator directly inspired by [[Catulle Mendès]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 531; Potra, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu tied to popularize a genre [[prose poetry]] "from life", the so-called "watercolors" or "sanguines". According to [[Adrian Marino]], these were among the more adequate and modern samples of ''[[Literatorul]]'' prose—alongside those by Săvescu, [[Constantin Cantilli]], and [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu|D. Teleor]]; the rest were "tendentious, abstract", and "dependent" on Macedonski's verdicts.&lt;ref name="amar521"/&gt; Received with sarcasm by other critics, they include fragments about blind and insane children,&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt; or about children sleeping in each other's arms,&lt;ref name="xbbgf286"/&gt; and, as comparatist [[Mihai Zamfir]] argues, were "experiments [...] pushed into oblivion" by the more mature Symbolist prose poetry of [[Ștefan Petică]] (ca. 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/tefan_petic__suavul_vistor "Ștefan Petică – suavul visător"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2009&lt;/ref&gt; His [[epistolary novel]], ''Etiam contra omnes'', depicts the worldview of "Recaredo", a Peruvian [[Spiritism|spiritist]] and [[Pan-Latinism|Pan-Latinist]] intellectual. It impressed a young [[Take Ionescu]], who found Recaredo to be the perfect human, and his racial ideology a symbol of Romania's own discords with her various neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius (1943), pp. 223, 239; Seișanu, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; As Florescu informed his readers, these were "pages written at a time when only literature was my comfort"—words expressing, again, his enmity for ''Junimea''.&lt;ref name="Perpessicius 1943, p. 239"/&gt; The novel, Ionescu believed, had a mission to "instill Romanianism", and also to cultivate [[Greece–Romania relations|solidarity between Romanians and Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;Seișanu, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Florescu also earned some attention as a literary essayist, popularizer, and critic—much inspired by four scholars, whom he deemed the elite of French literature: [[Abel-François Villemain]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], [[Hippolyte Taine]], and [[Emile Hennequin]].&lt;ref name="mrb88"&gt;Bucur, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu stresses that Florescu's opening lesson of 1873 was "a lamentable rigmarole that addressed the issue of historical objectivity". Later tracts were "wordy, without proper ranking of values".&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt; According to Bucur, Florescu was an "amateur", "textbook cultivated", "a cultural journalist enthusiastic about beauty and culture, taking pains not to fatigue a public that cannot sustain the effort."&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iorga, his exposition was "always lively, not without fortunate characterizations"—such as when Florescu depicted [[Georges Danton|Danton]] as a "poor man's [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]]".&lt;ref name="ni(39)339"/&gt; Overall, however, Iorga referred to Florescu as a "bizarre" or "weird" author.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934 I), pp. 117, 252; Perpessicius (1943), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the anti-Symbolist [[Ilarie Chendi]] viewed Florescu as "cultured, but ill-regulated".&lt;ref name="ichdcdnt1"&gt;[[Ilarie Chendi]], "Viața literară. Iarăș despre decadenții noștri.—Pe cine prețuesc ei.—Pe cine prețuim noi?—Un decadent simpatic.—Cei mărunți", in ''Tribuna'', Nr. 261/1909, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although marginally supportive of Symbolism, Florescu was noticeably unimpressed by its herald Baudelaire,&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt; and, Bucur writes, "understood nothing from [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]] and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]".&lt;ref name="mrb88"/&gt; Chendi saw Florescu as the instigator of Romania's [[Decadent movement]], which revolved around a cult for Baudelaire; however, he believed that Florescu's particular contribution was reviving another cult, that of romantic poets: [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], and [[Alexandru Depărățeanu]], whom Florescu rated "above Eminescu".&lt;ref name="ichdcdnt1"/&gt; In 1878, he also described a non-Symbolist poet, [[Ronetti Roman]], as a master, Romania's answer to Musset and [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Diverse. Unu poetu teneru de mare viitoriu", in ''Biseric'a si Scol'a. Fóia Bisericésca, Scolastica, Literaria si Economica'', Nr. 13/1878, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers attribute Macedonski's affection for Florescu to the latter's "attachment to French culture"&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; or, more precisely, to Macedonski's snobbery: "A writer turned proletarian and with relations all across the world, who descended from [[Michael the Brave]], from N. Bălcescu, and from some of the leading princely families, with relatives in Portugal, England and India—that catered to Macedonski's preferences."&lt;ref name="gc530"/&gt;

'''Bullionism''' is an [[economic]] [[theory]] that defines [[wealth]] by the amount of [[precious metal]]s owned. Bullionism is an early or primitive form of [[mercantilism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} It was derived, in the 16th century, from the observation that [[England|the English state]], because of its large [[balance of trade|trade surplus]], possessed large amounts of [[gold]] and [[silver]]—[[bullion]]—despite the fact that there was no mining of precious metals in England.

==Examples of bullionists==
[[Thomas Milles (bailiff)|Thomas Milles]] (1550–1627) and others recommended that England increase exports to create a trade surplus, convert the surplus into precious metals, and hinder the drain of money and precious metal to other countries. England did restrict exportation of money or precious metals around 1600, but Milles wanted to return to using [[staple port]]s to force merchants from abroad to use their assets to buy English goods and prevent them from transferring gold or silver from England homewards. Milles's opinions, however, were not widely valued. One of his contemporaries wrote, "Milles was so much out of step with the time that his pamphlets had little influence."

[[Gerard de Malynes]] (1586–1641), another bullionist, published a book called ''A Treatise of the Canker of England's Common Wealth'', that asserted that the exchange of foreign currency had been a trade of value rather than exchanging the weight of metals. Therefore, the unfair exchanging of precious metals by [[banker]]s and money changers would cause a deficit in the English [[balance of trade]]. To ban the flow of [[exchange rate]]s, he demanded the strict fixing of exchange rates for [[coin]]s, only by the concentration of precious metals and weights, and for strict regulation and monitoring of foreign trade. He failed, however, to convince his contemporaries “...that the cambists were responsible for gold outflow or to elicit enthusiasm for a [[monopoly]] sale of exchange, par pro pari, by the royal exchanger." He did succeed in stirring up one of the first economic controversies, and [[Edward Misselden]] opposed him in 1623 in his book ''The Circle of Commerce: Or, the Balance of Trade''.

The '''Burning of the Burning Embers pub''' was an early military operation carried out by the [[Provisional IRA]]'s [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]] (PIRA). The Burning Embers was used as a base by the [[Official IRA]] (OIRA), the Provisional IRA also hoped to burn down the Cracked Cup which was another pub owned by the OIRA along the [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]] on Leeson Street but the OIRA got information that the PIRA was coming and a gun battle broke out.

==Background==

Tensions had been high between the OIRA and PIRA after the two factions split in December 1969. This was the third major split in the IRA since it became the legitimate army of the [[Irish Republic]] state in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm#281269|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1969|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1970 the PIRA tried to kill OIRA Belfast Brigade [[Commanding Officer]] [[Billy McMillen]] but he survived his injuries.
After the [[Falls Curfew]] relations turned even more sour. The Officials accused the Provisionals of tricking them into a fight they could not win and then leaving them to fight alone, resulting in the loss of much of their weaponry and several of their men being captured &amp; wounded. Over the following months each organization carried out beatings of each other's members, the majority of these beatings were carried out by the OIRA as they were still the larger group at the time. 
The OIRA was also angry that the PIRA had started raiding OIRA arms dumps for weapons.

The OIRA had the focused nearly all of their Volunteers inside the Lower Falls area of Belfast as in that area as both the OIRA and PIRA knew it was a key location. Most of those had been there before the outbreak of the [[Battle of the Bogside]] &amp; [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|Northern Ireland riots]] in 1969 which started [[The troubles|the conflict]]. The Provisional IRA was small in the area but was young and very determined to make a name for themselves, especially D-Company headed by [[Brendan Hughes]]'s cousin Charlie Hughes, a well respected and liked Voluteer. The mindset was who ever controlled the Lower Falls controlled Belfast and the PIRA was determined to wrestle power away from the OIRA or "Sticks" as the PIRA called them.

Tensions increased even more when the OIRA "arrested" and beat Paddy McDermott the QM ([[Quartermaster]]) of the PIRA Belfast Brigade D-Company for looking through their [[Ammunition|arms dumps]] and then badly beat him. But the PIRA now had controlled the arms dump that McDermott was beaten for.
In retaliation for the PIRA controlling the arms dumps, in late 1970, they shot the brother of [[Joe Cahill]], Tom Cahill. They shot him six times but he survived the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republican-news.org/archive/2001/February08/08obit.html|title=AN PHOBLACHT/REPUBLICAN NEWS|website=republican-news.org|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and Counter-Attack==

The final straw came in early 1971 when PIRA Volunteer Alec Crowe had been "arrested" by the OIRA and taken to their drinking den the Cracked Cup on Balkan Street. [[Brendan Hughes]] was in a house opposite the Cracked Cup and seen Alec Crowe being forced out of the car and dragged into the pub. Brendan then immediately ran around to his cousin and O/C Charlie Hughes and told him what he saw. Charlie told Brendan to mobilise the rest of the Volunteers in the PIRA Belfast Brigade, open the arms dump &amp; to be on standby. Charlie mobilised the Volunteers into one group sent a squad to burn down two OIRA clubs, the Cracked Cup and the Burning Embers. The squad arrived at the Burning Embers first &amp; when they got inside they saw people were having a celebration for Paddy Devlin MP and OIRA Comnmander [[Jim Sullivan (Irish Republican)|Jim Sullivan]] was also there at the same time. Brendan Hughes ordered them to move first but they wouldn't budge, so Charlie ordered them to pour petrol around the club and put a match to it, people then started to move once they the flames in the clubs &amp; soon the whole building was ablaze.

Their next target was the Cracked Cup on Leeson street which is where the PIRA Volunteers headed to next, but the Official IRA got information passed on to them that a PIRA unit was coming to Leeson street to burn another club but as soon as the PIRA Volunteers got to McDonnell Street (near Leeson Street) they were ambushed by OIRA Volunteers and two of the PIRA's  men Frank Gillen and Dipper Dempsey were shot and injured. A gun battle ensued around McDonnell and Leeson street which lasted for about twenty-five minutes. According to Brendan Hughes the [[British Army]] drove past the gun battle at the bottom of Leeson Street and did not bother intervening in the gun battle between the PIRA &amp; OIRA Volunteers.  Out numbered &amp; out gunned orders came for the PIRA Volunteers to pull back. This ended hostilities for the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neotericdevelopmentsinc.com/books/voices-from-the-grave-two-mens-war-in-ireland |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222031/http://neotericdevelopmentsinc.com/books/voices-from-the-grave-two-mens-war-in-ireland |archivedate=4 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OIRA took revenge for the burning of their main HQ when they shot PIRA Commander Chalie Hughes. He was shot coming out of a house in Leeson Street along with [[Billy McKee]] and [[Proinsias MacAirt]], a OIRA Volunteer opened up with a [[Thompson submachine gun]] killing Hughes instantly. It's been speculated [[Joe McCann]] was the shooter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch71.htm#8371|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1971|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash against the OIRA from the Nationalist community was to do large damage to the OIRA,  Hughes was a well liked, respected &amp; a devout Catholic, who helped many local people during the Falls Curfew &amp; at other times the Lower Falls was attacked. Many new young recruits started joining the PIRA in the wake of Huges's killing and before long the [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade]] was in charge of the Lower Falls &amp; most of Nationalist Belfast. A ceasefire was soon arranged between the OIRA and PIRA after the death of Charlie Hughes and Brendan Hughes, Charlie's cousin took over command of D-Company.

==Boston College Tape interview==
When interviewed for [[Boston College]] for research on the conflict Brendan Hughes had the following to say on the conflict with the Official IRA.

"[The Officials] arrested a man called Alec Crowe from the Ballymurphyarea and they brought him to the drinking club in Leeson Street. He was brought to the Cracked Cup and I was in a house directly facing, in Eileen Hickey’s house, and saw Alec being taken out of a car and trailed in. I left the house, went round to Charlie’s
house, my cousin, told him what I’d seen. Charlie ordered me then to mobilise the rest of the Volunteers, open up the dump and be on standby in his house.  I got them together, got the weapons out, a couple of .303s, two m1 carbines, three revolvers, and a few hand grenades. Charlie went up to Kane Street, up to Frank Card’s house, MacAirt as we called him, and I sat awaiting instructions . . . an hour, hour and a half later, Charlie came back and we were mobilised into one group. A squad was sent down from Andersons - town. They moved into a house in Balkan Street and we were under orders to burn down the two clubs. By this stage, Alec Crowe had
been released by the Sticks* [but he] had been badly beaten, pistolwhipped, and thrown out. After that – a silly, silly, silly operation it was – we moved out of Charlie’s house, straight across the street, no more than thirty yards and took over the Burning Embers. Charlie sent me upstairs to empty the room. I went up and produced my weapon, a .45, and told them to get out but they wouldn’t move, so I fired a couple of shots into the air. At the time there was a party in the bar for Paddy Devlin who was an MP at Stormont.† They were celebrating and he was sitting at the bar with Jimmy Sullivan. So I went down and told Charlie that they wouldn’t move. We had cans of petrol and Charlie gave the order ‘burn it’. So the petrol was laid and the match put to it. And only then did they start moving out. Paddy Devlin was one of the first out; his car was sitting outside, and he drove off. He arrived back in Leeson Street later, I believe, with weapons. So, the Burning Embers was burning. We then assembled outside and moved round along Balkan Street to the
Cracked Cup to burn that as well. A group of us went up Cyprus Street, through Varna Gap, heading down into Leeson Street. Another group came along McDonnell Street in a pincer movement

As soon as we got to McDonnell Street we were opened up on. Two men [were] shot: Frank Gillen and Dipper Dempsey. A gun battle ensued [and] went on for twenty, twenty-five minutes, us firing at the Cracked Cup. We never got burning the Cracked Cup, but I remember lying at the corner of McDonnell Street firing up at the
Cracked Cup and . . . the British Army driving past the bottom of Leeson Street. They never came into the area; they let us just shoot it out. Eventually we were ordered to pull back."

==Aftermath==
The Official IRA who were already being criticised for the killing of Charlie Hughes seen their support drop even more after the [[1972 Aldershot Bombing]] which killed seven civilians, they also seen their support fade in Derry as well after they shot dead a popular local off duty Catholic British soldier William Best (19) who was home on leave in Williams Street in May 1972. Shortly after the death of Best the group called a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch72.htm#21572|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1972|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=22&amp;month=02&amp;year=1972|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch72.htm#29572|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1972|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feud broke out again between the two Republican groups which began on Wednesday 29 October 1975 in a bid by the [[Provisional IRA]] to wipe the [[Official IRA]] out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm#291075|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven people were to die in this feud which was to last until November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=29&amp;month=10&amp;year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=31&amp;month=10&amp;year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=3&amp;month=11&amp;year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=9&amp;month=11&amp;year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=11&amp;month=11&amp;year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=12&amp;month=11&amp;year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm#Oct|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm#Nov|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carl Burckhardt.jpg|thumb|Carl J. Burckhardt (Red Cross photo)]]
[[File:Gdansk Nowy Ratusz z frontu.jpg|thumb|200px|Seat of League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig]]
'''Carl Jacob Burckhardt''' (September 10, 1891 – March 3, 1974) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[diplomat]] and [[historian]]. His career alternated between periods of academic historical research and diplomatic postings; the most prominent of the latter were [[League of Nations]] High Commissioner for the [[Free City of Danzig]] (1937–39) and President of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (1945–48).

Burckhardt was born in [[Basel]] to Carl Christoph Burckhardt, a member of the patrician [[Burckhardt]] family, and attended [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Basel and [[Glarisegg]] (in [[Steckborn]]). He subsequently studied at the universities of Basel, [[Zürich]], [[Munich]], and [[Göttingen]], being particularly influenced by professors [[Ernst Gagliardi]] and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]].

He gained his first diplomatic experience in the Swiss legation in [[Austria]] from 1918 to 1922, a chaotic period following the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]]. While there, he became acquainted with [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Burckhardt earned his doctorate in 1922, and then accepted an appointment with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which posted him to [[Asia Minor]], where he assisted in the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|resettlement of Greeks expelled from Turkey]] following Greece's [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|1922 defeat]].

He subsequently returned to Switzerland, where he married Elisabeth de Reynold (a daughter of [[Gonzague de Reynold]]) and pursued an academic career. He was appointed [[Privatdozent]] at the [[University of Zurich]] in 1927, and in 1929 was appointed [[extraordinary professor]] of contemporary history. From 1932 to 1937 he was [[ordinary professor]] at the recently created [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]]. While there, he published in 1935 the first volume of his comprehensive biography of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], which would eventually be completed by the publication of the 4th volume in 1967.

He returned to a diplomatic career in 1937, serving as the final League of Nations High Commissioner for the [[Free City of Danzig]] from 1937 to 1939. In that position, he aimed to maintain the international status of Danzig guaranteed by the League of Nations, which brought him into contact with a number of prominent [[Nazis]] as he attempted to stave off increasing German demands. The mission eventually ended unsuccessfully with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] and German annexation of Danzig.

Following this period as High Commissioner, he returned to his professorship in Geneva for the rest of [[World War II]] (1939–1945). While in that position, he was also active in a leading role in the ICRC, traveling to Germany several times to negotiate for better treatment of civilians and prisoners, in part using the contacts gained during his two years as High Commissioner in Danzig.

After the war, he became President of the ICRC, serving from 1945 to 1948. Organizationally, he increased the integration of the international Red Cross institutions and the national [[Red Cross Society|Red Cross Societies]]. Politically, his term was controversial as he maintained the ICRC's existing policy of strict neutrality in international disputes, which led to the ICRC refusing to officially condemn the Nazis as their atrocities came to light. His strong [[anti-Communism]] even led to him considering Nazism the lesser evil. During this period, he simultaneously served from 1945 to 1949 as the Swiss envoy in [[Paris]].

Burckhardt was "a close friend and admirer of Hitler" and was kept informed of the [[Final Solution]] as early as 1941. Under his leadership, the ICRC "served as a tool of Nazi extermination policy", according to Israeli historian [[Livia Rothkirchen]]. The Red Cross' stance during the war did not fully come to light until it opened its archives from the period in 1994.{{sfn|Rothkirchen|2006|p=303}}

After 1949, he returned to his academic career, publishing a number of books on history over the next several decades. In 1954 he was awarded the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]]. He died in 1974 in [[Vinzel]]. His wife died in 1989.

==Work==
Duncan's work examines the critical role that museums play in defining cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farber|first1=Dr. Allen|title=How museums shape meaning|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history-basics/tools-understanding-art/a/tissot-london-visitors|website=Khan Academy|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s Duncan and fellow feminist art historians, [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Lise Vogel]], first questioned formerly hallowed principals such as the idea of quality in art, the cannon of great artists and art and artistic genius.&lt;ref name="The expanding discourse"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broude ed.|first1=Norma|last2=Garrard ed.|first2=Mary D.|title=The expanding discourse : feminism and art history|date=1992|publisher=IconEditions|location=New York|isbn=0064303918|pages=2, 12, 127, 305, 363, 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1975 essay titled "When Greatness is a Box of Wheaties" is considered a key text of [[Feminist history|feminist art history]], articulating the feminist critique of genius in art.&lt;ref name="n.paradoxa’s 12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deepwell|first1=Katy|title=n.paradoxa’s 12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=n.paradoxa|date=September 2010|issue=12|pages=6, 8|url=https://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She can only view a version of woman that is defined by the male creator, but is denied the role of creator and thus denied entry to "the central arena of high culture".&lt;ref name="Performing the Body/Performing the Text"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Amelia ed.|last2=Stephenson|first2=Andres ed.|title=Performing the Body/Performing the Text|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Google Books|isbn=1134655932|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkLnd-jP99gC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=carol+duncan+The+MoMA's+hot+mamas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2pbd753XAhUW92MKHTzfAO8Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20duncan%20The%20MoMA's%20hot%20mamas&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crateology.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Soviet ship carrying crates holding Komar guided-missile patrol boats on their way to Cuba, September 1962]]
'''Crateology''' was the 'science' of identifying the contents of Soviet shipments to the Island of [[Cuba]] carried out by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, R. (1994). Inside the CIA. Pocket Books. {{ISBN|978-0-671-73458-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crateology has declined as a discipline in recent years due to globalisation and the decline in the usage of custom made wooden crates in favour of standard metal [[Intermodal container|shipping container]]s. As well as making the world 'flatter' and smaller', globalisation has resulted in the loss of not merely a science, but a 'beautiful art form'.&lt;ref&gt;D. Salisbury (2009).

'''David H. Kranzler''' (May 19, 1930 – November 29, 2007)&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"/&gt; was an American professor of [[library science]] at [[Queensborough Community College]], New York, who specialized in the study of the [[Rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust|rescue of Jews]] during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

Kranzler was the author of several books on the topic, including ''Thy Brothers' Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust'' (1987) and ''The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador, and Switzerland's Finest Hour'' (2000).

==Early life and education==
Kranzler was born in Germany, one of seven children, to Yerachmiel and Chana Kranzler of [[Wurzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kranzler|first=David|title=The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador, and Switzerland's Finest Hour|location=Syracuse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Cx3yenDCQC|year=2000|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2873-6|page=xv|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Wurzburg, see {{cite book|last=Kranzler|first=David|title=Holocaust Hero: The Untold Story of Solomon Schonfeld, an Orthodox British Rabbi|location=Brooklyn|year=2003|publisher=Ktav Publishing House|page=xv|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family emigrated to the United States in 1937 to avoid Nazi persecution, and he was raised in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref name=yadvashem.org/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Brooklyn, see {{harvp|Kranzler|2003|p=xv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he obtained his BA from [[Brooklyn College]], followed by an MA in 1958, also from Brooklyn, and an [[Master of Library and Information Science|MLS]] degree in 1957 from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=yadvashem.org/&gt;

In 1971 Kranzler was awarded a doctorate by [[Yeshiva University]],&lt;ref name=yadvashem.org/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Kranzler". ''Contemporary Authors Online''. Detroit: Gale, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; for a thesis entitled ''The History of the Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai: 1938–1945'',&lt;ref&gt;Kanzler, David H. (1971). ''The History of the Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai: 1938–1945''. New York: Yeshiva University. {{oclc|247255963}}&lt;/ref&gt; the result of a seven-year study of the 17,000 Jews who fled to [[Shanghai]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. The manuscript was published by Yeshiva University Press in 1976 as ''Japanese, Nazis &amp; Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai, 1938–1945''.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanzler, David (1976). ''Japanese, Nazis &amp; Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai, 1938–1945''. New York: Yeshiva University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book for the ''The American Historical Review'', Leona S. Forman called it a "painstaking documentation of a vignette in Jewish history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forman |first1=Leona S. |title=Reviewed Work: Japanese, Nazis and Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai, 1938-1945 by David Kranzler |journal=The American Historical Review |date=June 1977 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=714–715|jstor=1851058|doi=10.2307/1851058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Positions held===
After working as a school librarian, Kranzler joined the faculty of [[Queensborough Community College]] (QCC) of the [[City University of New York]] in 1969, and was a professor in the library department until his retirement in 1988. He was one of the founders and the first director of QCC's Holocaust Resource Center and Archives.&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research Fellow Remembered |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/pdf/news11_december2007.pdf |website=Institute News |publisher=The International Institute for Holocaust Research, Yad Vashem |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312201951/http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/pdf/news11_december2007.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2016 |issue=11|page=42 |date=December 2007|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as scholar-in-residence in numerous congregations, college campuses, and centers, including the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue (under Rabbi [[Marc D. Angel]]) in Manhattan; Kodima Synagogue in Springfield, Massachusetts (under his brother-in-law Rabbi Alex Weisfogel);&lt;ref&gt;For brother-in-law, see {{harvp|Kranzler|2003|p=xv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ohio State University Holocaust Center (under Professor Saul S. Friedman).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} From October 2002 to January 2003, Kranzler was a Baron Friedrich Carl von Oppenheim Research Fellow for the Study of Racism, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust at [[Yad Vashem]]'s International Institute for Holocaust Research; the title of his research project was "A Comparative Study on the Worldwide Rescue Effort by Orthodox Jewry During the Holocaust Within the Context of Rescue in General".&lt;ref name=yadvashem.org/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yadvashem.org/research/fellowships/postdoctoral-fellowships/past-research-fellows.html "Past Research Fellows"]. Yad Vashem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Kranzler became a leading historian on the subject of aiding the Jews during [[the Holocaust]], and was among the first to document the efforts of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] organizations, such as the [[Vaad Hatzalah|Vaad Ha-hatzala]] and [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]]. Historian [[Alex Grobman]] referred to him as "the pioneer of research on Orthodox Jewry during the war."&lt;ref&gt;Grobman, Alex (2003). ''Battling for Souls: The Vaad Hatzala Rescue Committee in Post-Holocaust Europe''. Brooklyn: Ktav Publishing House, p.&amp;nbsp;iii.&lt;/ref&gt; Kranzler's book ''Solomon Schonfeld: His Page in History'', co-authored with Gertrude Hirschler, and his later ''Thy Brother's Blood'' (1987) were the first to focus on this area. He wrote a paper, "Orthodox Ends, UnOrthodox Means", for ''American Jewry during the Holocaust'' (1983), a report organized by the American Jewish Commission, led by [[Arthur J. Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomlin, Chanan (2006). ''Protest and Prayer''. Bern: Peter Lang, pp.&amp;nbsp;40, 41, n.&amp;nbsp;71.{{pb}}

Kranzler lectured on the subject in America, Israel, Europe and the Far East. He interviewed and recorded over a thousand people, including some of the major Jewish rescuers, such as [[Hillel Kook]] (also known as [[Peter Bergson]]), [[George Mantello]], Rabbi [[Solomon Schonfeld]], and close family and associates of rescuers no longer alive, including Rabbi [[Michael Ber Weissmandl]] and [[Recha Sternbuch]]. He established a research archive of about a million pages and interviews (mostly audio) at his Brooklyn home, later housed at Yad Vashem.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} By 1978 the archive held over 10,000 documents on Jewish residents of Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Herbert Albert (1978). ''Jewish immigrants of the Nazi period in the USA''. K.G. Saur, p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Thy Brother's Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust'' (1987), Kranzler argued that more lives could have been saved if American-Jewish leaders had lent more support to efforts in Europe to halt the deportations, including the attempts, in Slovakia and Hungary, to bribe the SS. Criticizing the book's factual accuracy, [[Efraim Zuroff]] described it as "an extremely one-sided polemic" and "a popular invective of limited scholarly value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zuroff |first1=Efraim |title=Review of Thy Brother's Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust |journal=American Jewish History |date=1988 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=132–136 |jstor=23883292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of historian Robert Moses Shapiro, the book's defects, particularly its bitter tone and poor editing, undermined its "important and gripping story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Robert Moses|title=Reviewed Work: ''Thy Brother's Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust'' by David Kranzler|journal=Shofar |date=Summer 1989 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=86–89 |jstor=42941357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-1944 grassroots protests in Switzerland to publicize the [[Vrba–Wetzler report]], including the [[Swiss press campaign]] led by George Mantello, was the subject of Kranzler's book ''The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz'' (2000), which had a foreword by [[Joe Lieberman]]. The Vrba–Wetzler report, written by two Auschwitz escapees, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfred Wetzler]], and distributed by, among others, the [[Bratislava Working Group]], provided a detailed account of the mass murder taking place inside the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Kranzler was convinced that Mantello's campaign to publicize the report led to the stopping of the mass transports of Jews from Hungary to Auschwitz in July 1944, and enabled the [[Raoul Wallenberg]] mission and other important initiatives in Hungary and elsewhere.{{sfnp|Kranzler|2000|p=87}} The manuscript won the 1998 Egit Prize from the [[Histadrut]] for the best manuscript on the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kranzler|2000|p=xv}}; [https://www.holocaust-trc.org/the-man-who-stopped-the-trains/ "''The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador, and Switzerland's Finest Hour''"]. Holocaust Teacher Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his fellowship with [[Yad Vashem]]'s International Institute for Holocaust Research in 2002–2003, Kranzler engaged in a research project entitled "A Comparative Study on the Worldwide Rescue Effort by Orthodox Jewry During the Holocaust Within the Context of Rescue in General."&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"/&gt;

'''Delilah Leontium Beasley''' (September 9, 1867 – August 18, 1934), was an American historian, and newspaper columnist for the ''[[The Oakland Tribune|Oakland Tribune]]'', [[Oakland, California]], US.&lt;ref&gt;Batker, Carol J. ''Reforming Fictions: Native, African, and Jewish American Women's Literature and Journalism in the Progressive Era'', Columbia University Press, p. 147 (2002) – {{ISBN|0-231-11850-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beasley becomes the first African-American woman to be published regularly in a major metropolitan newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Traeger, James. ''The Women's Chronology'', Henry Holt &amp;  Company, Inc, p. 345 (1994) – {{ISBN|1-85410-390-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Sam G. ''Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists'', Greenwood Press, p. 24 (1995) – {{ISBN|0-313-29192-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a writer, Beasley has the distinction of being the first person to have presented written proof of the existence of California black pioneers, in her writings, ''Slavery in California'' (1918) and her classic, ''The Negro Trail-Blazers of California'' (1919), a pioneering work in the field of California black history. Her journalists career spanned more than fifty years, including detailing the racial problems in California and the heroic achievements by Blacks to overcome them, during the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==Biography==
Beasley was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the oldest of five children in the family of Daniel Beasley, an engineer, and Margaret Harris, a homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Raising Her Voice: African-American Women Journalists who Changed History'', University Press of Kentucky, p. 74, (1994) – {{ISBN|0-8131-0830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her parents' death while she was still a teenager, Beasley had to find a full-time job to support herself, she pursued a career as a trained masseuse.&lt;ref&gt;Appiah, Kwame Anthony &amp; Gates, Henry Louis. ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'', Basic Civitas Books, p. 207 (1999) – {{ISBN|0-465-00071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her newspaper career in 1883 writing for a black newspaper the ''Cleveland Gazette'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Darlene Clark Hine]]. ''Black Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia'', Carlson Pub., p. 664 (1993) – {{ISBN|0-926019-61-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Harry C. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbs.ohiohistory.org/africanam/nwspaper/gazette.cfm The Gazette (1883–1945)]&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote briefly about church and social activities. Three years later, she published her first column in the Sunday [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], ''Enquirer'' under the headline "Mosaics". Beasley studied journalism under Dan Rudd, a well-known newspaper publisher of the ''Colored Catholic Tribune'' in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;Oakland Tribune, February 6, 1972, ''Museum Will Mark Black History Week''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, at age 39, Beasley moved to [[Oakland, California]],&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Mulroy, Quintard Taylor, Lawrence Brooks De Graaf. ''Seeking El Dorado: African Americans in California'', University of Washington Press, p. 221 (2001) – {{ISBN|0-295-98082-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; attending lectures and researching at [[University of California, Berkeley]] and writing essays for presentations at local churches. In 1910 the African American population in Oakland was 3,055.&lt;ref&gt;Rhomberg, Chris. ''No There There: Race, Class, and Political Community in Oakland'', University of California Press, p. 82, {{ISBN|0-520-23618-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The small black population supported a flowering of indigenous institutions and community formation in the 10s and 20s. Among these institutions were various black-owned small businesses, churches, and private social-welfare organizations. In addition, several black newspapers were published in Oakland, including the ''Oakland Sunshine'', which began publication in 1902, publisher William Prince, and the ''Western Outlook'', established in 1894, publishers J. S. Francis and J. L. Derrick.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Douglas Henry. ''Pioneer Urbanites: A Social and Cultural History of Black San Francisco'', University of California Press, p. 116 (1991) – {{ISBN|0-520-07399-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oakland Sunshine'' and ''Western Outlook'' on microfilm at [[University of California, Berkeley]], Library&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, she wrote for a black audience in the ''Oakland Sunshine''.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, ''Colored Race at the Exposition'', Oakland Sunshine, June 26, 1915, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Trail-Blazers'' book===
Delilah Beasley chronicled African American "firsts", and notable achievements in early California in her book ''The Negro Trail-Blazers of California'' (1919). A compilation of records from the California Archives in the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], searching newspapers from 1848 to the 1890s, all the black newspapers from the first in 1855 through 1919. Beasley ''Trail-Blazers'' book included diaries, biographical sketches, poetry commemorating black sacrifices, photographs, old papers, conversations of old pioneers, a comprehensive history of early legislation and court cases. Beasley's informative compilation of records is full of success stories. It gives many hundreds of names of blacks in California from the pioneer period to the late 19th century.

Beasley writes about the black gold miners of the late 1840s:

:"A history of the Negro people of California would be incomplete without mention of the mining men who came in 1849. There were at one time several hundred Negro miners working claims on Mormon and Mokelumn Hill, at Placerville, Grass Valley and elsewhere in California mountains. One such man was [[Moses Rodgers]] a mining expert and was considered one of the best mining engineers in the state. He was also a [[metallurgist]] and owned a group of mines at Hornitus. The colored miners rarely took a chance in buying mining stock. He had more sacred duties to perform with his money. He either used it to pay for the freedom or liberty of himself, his family or other loved ones in faraway "[[Southern United States|Dixie-Land]]". If not that, then he contributed largely from his diggings to assisting the "Executive Committee of the Colored Convention" in their struggles to secure legislative enactments in the interest of the Negro race in California".&lt;ref&gt;''The Negro Trail-Blazers of California'' (1919), pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beasley spent nine years writing her book, the book is important to historians of California and the West, and of African American western history. She knew many people who had been in California from the beginning of statehood and before. So much of what we know of California black pioneers grows out of her book.&lt;ref&gt;Scanion, Jennifer. ''American Women Historians, 1700s–1990s: A Biographical Dictionary'', Greenwood Press, p. 15–16(1996) – {{ISBN|0-313-29664-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her possible heroes in the book was Lt. Col. [[Allen Allensworth]], in 1908 founder of an all African American town in [[Allensworth, California]], now a state park, [[Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park]]. Beasley wrote, "The late Colonel Allensworth was born a slave, and yet there are few, if any, who have made more out of life and done more for their fellow man".&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, ''The Negro Trail-Blazers'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delilah Beasley placed women prominently in her book. Over the next four decades, no other major works followed Beasley's volume. One might expect a plethora of articles and books concerning various aspects of black women's history during and immediately following the civil rights movements of the 1910s. Yet western black women received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Quintard. ''African American Women Confront the West: 1600–2000'', pp. 22–23, (2003) – {{ISBN|0-8061-3524-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper columnist===
Her work on the book ''The Negro Trail-Blazers'' paved the way for Beasley to become the first Black woman in California to write regularly for a major metropolitan newspaper. By 1925 Delilah was writing regularly for the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''. Her Sunday ''Tribune'' column was ''Activities Among Negroes'' and her name was also published with the articles. She often spent far over forty hours a week collecting material for her column. She wrote about churches, social events, women's clubs, literary societies, and local as well as national politics. Beasley's motivation was to give the white readers of the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' a positive picture of the black community. She documented the achievements of successful black men and women, in Oakland and elsewhere. By highlighting such items, she served her larger goal of demonstrating the capabilities of African-Americans while building a strong constituency for her column and a network of sources from whom she could count on receiving information. There is no doubt that in performing this service she laid an important part of the groundwork for the expanded inter-racial cooperation that developed during the Depression era of the 1930s. Richard Dillon, whose book on California Pioneers who had special qualities of their unusual and stimulating lives, wrote that Beasley was "born 50 years before her time".&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Richard H. ''Humbugs and Heroes: A Gallery of California Pioneers'', James Stevenson Pub. (1983) – {{ISBN|1-885852-36-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beasley wrote for the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' from 1925–1934.&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', Thursday, February 21, 1974, ''Noted Writers Worked for Tribune, 100 years Centennial Issue'', "In 1926 one of the early champions for Negro rights joined The ''Tribune'' writing staff. Delilah L. Beasley was already a noted figure with the Bay Area black community."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community service and social activist===
Beasley, who never married, belonged to many civic organizations, including The Delilah L. Beasley Literary and Improvement Club, [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), northern California branch founded in 1915, headquarters in Oakland. She was a member of the Alameda County League of Women Voters, the Public Welfare League of Alameda County, and the League of Nations Association of the California Federated Women's Club, which hosted the biennial convention in the Oakland Auditorium, attracting delegates from across the country.&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', February 6, 1972, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Oakland's black club women, including Delilah Beasley and others, organized the Linden Center Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) to combat the cold reception extended to them by the all-white branches in the city. The Linden Center YWCA provided an array of services, including "religious and vocational training, adult education, counseling services, and a full calendar of recreational and cultural programs".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Mulroy, Quintard Taylor, Lawrence Brooks De Graaf. ''Seeking El Dorado: African Americans in California'', University of Washington Press, p. 216 (2001) – {{ISBN|0-295-98082-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1920s, Beasley was a national historian of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW),&lt;ref&gt;Delilah L. Beasley, ''Proceedings of the Fifteenth Biennial Convention, National Association of Colored Women Held in Municipal Auditorium Oakland, California, July 29 to August 6, 1926'' (reprinted from articles published in the ''Oakland Tribune'')&lt;/ref&gt; and the Alameda County League of Colored Women Voters, devoted press coverage to both in her column, ''Activities Among Negroes'', which ran in the white daily, the ''Oakland Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Carol DuBois, Vicki Ruíz. ''Unequal Sisters: A Multicultural Reader in U.S. Women's History'', Routledge, p. 301, (2000) – {{ISBN|0-415-92516-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Headline1933.jpg|left|''Oakland Tribune'', February 12, 1933]] 
In 1929, Beasley also used her professional skills and prominence in international groups to rebut white fears about the consequences of creating an International House at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Many [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] landlords protested the construction of the House, fearing an influx of foreigners. International House at UC Berkeley is a multi-cultural residence and program center serving students, the local community and alumni worldwide. Its mission is to foster intercultural respect, understanding, lifelong friendships and leadership skills for the promotion of a more tolerant and peaceful world. The university wrote: "More than 800 people gathered in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to protest racial integration in the proposed International House. At that meeting, Delilah Beasley, a black reporter for the ''Oakland Tribune'', passionately defended the concept to a disgruntled and stunned audience. And it was Beasley who stood up to the protests of property owners who feared that I-House would cause [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to be overrun with Blacks and Asians".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ihouse.berkeley.edu/a/publications/HistoryBook.pdf ''International House: Informal History'', at the University of California, Berkeley] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609105945/http://ihouse.berkeley.edu/a/publications/HistoryBook.pdf |date=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable I-House alumni and residents are, [[Delbert E. Wong]], [[Jerry Brown]], [[Oona King]], [[Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni]], [[Rose Bird]], [[F. Drew Gaffney]], [[Eric E. Schmidt]], and [[Sadako Ogata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ihouse.berkeley.edu/ International House, UC Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

The weekly column she wrote for the newspaper, ''Activities Among Negroes'', enhanced her standing in the community because of her ability to generate favorable publicity for black political struggles. Recognition of her ability to influence the white community strengthened her status within both white and black communities. She confronted misconceptions and contradictions as a newspaper journalist, and campaign against the use in the press of explicitly derogatory words when writing about African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Streitmatter, Roger. ''Delilah, Beasley: A Black Woman Journalist Who Lifted As She Climbed'', American Journalism Historians Association, October 1991, Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Beasley organized the donation of a painting by a Black artist to the Oakland Museum. Due to her efforts as president of the “Far Western Inter-Racial Committee,” a painting by Eugene Burk, titled "The Slave Mother" was unveiled and presented to gallery director William Clapp, with Beasley expressing hope that "the presentation of this picture to the permanent collection of the Oakland Municipal Art may be the means of opening many doors to young aspiring Negroes, not only of Oakland but of the United States." Clapp responded,

:"We feel a very great appreciation of the thought and effort. Even under normal conditions the gift would be remarkable, since it is the first presented in this gallery as a formal expression of racial culture. It is also noteworthy because it is the first work of art that has been presented to the gallery by an organized group of citizens".&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', August 7, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, it was at Beasley's urging that [[California State Assemblyman]] [[William F. Knowland]], then assistant publisher of the ''Oakland Tribune'', and [[California State Assemblyman|Assemblyman]] Frederick M. Roberts of Los Angeles County, introduced an anti-lynching bill, that passed unanimously in both branches of the [[California Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Gayle B. ''One Step from the White House: The Rise and Fall of Senator William F. Knowland'', University of California Press, p. 22 (1998) – {{ISBN|0-520-21194-4}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/403-420.1.html Penal Code 405a and 405b]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the state's first mob violence law.&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', February 12, 1933, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', February 21, 1974, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of lynching in California between 1850 and 1935 were perpetrated against Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales-Day, Ken. ''Lynching in the West, 1850–1935'', Duke University Press, (2006) – {{ISBN|0-8223-3794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Delilah Leontium Beasley died on August 18, 1934, at Fairmont Hospital in [[San Leandro, California]]. According to her death certificate, the cause of death was arterio-sclerotic heart disease with hypertension. Her home at that time was listed as being in [[Oakland, California]]. She was laid to rest at [[Saint Mary Cemetery (Oakland, California)|Saint Mary Cemetery]] in Oakland. Twenty years later, a monument was erected, and a perpetual care endowed. Carved on the old tombstone is a simple epitaph: "Author and columnist, a native of Ohio and for 25 years a resident of Oakland."&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine J. Crouchett. ''Delilah Leontium, Oakland's Crusading Journalist'' (1990), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Veteran and student journalists are honored with the Hall of Fame &amp; Scholarship Awards of the Cincinnati chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists, with the "Delilah Leontium Beasley Scholar" awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/10/20/loc_awards20.html Black journalists' group honors veterans and students]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14617">{{distinguish|text=[[gift (law)#intention|donative intent]] of a gift in law}}
In [[philanthropy]], '''donor intent''' is the purpose, sometimes publicly expressed, for which a philanthropist intends a [[grant (money)|charitable gift]] or [[bequest]]. Donor intent is most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, but it may also be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor intent is protected in American law regarding [[charitable trust]]s, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.&lt;ref name=Madoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Madoff|first=Ray D.|title=Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-12184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fidelity to donor intent is sometimes distinguished from grant compliance, and "donor intent" refers to the actions of a grantmaking entity and grant compliance refers to the actions of a grant recipient, but the term donor intent is commonly used to refer to both the guiding principles of a grantmaking entity and the purposes of a specific gift.&lt;ref name=Cain&gt;{{cite book|last=Cain|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Protecting Donor Intent: How to Define and Safeguard Your Philanthropic Principles|year=2012|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-9851265-0-6|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/guidebook/protecting_donor_intent/foundation_management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many controversies, including litigation, over donor intent at [[private foundation (United States)|private foundations]], [[higher education|universities]], and arts organizations.&lt;ref name=Wooster&gt;{{cite book|last=Wooster|first=Martin Morse|title=The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of "Donor Intent"|year=2007|publisher=Capital Research Center|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-892934-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEHE&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources on Donor Intent|url=http://www.cehe.org/resources/|publisher=Center for Excellence in Higher Education|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414113720/http://www.cehe.org/resources/|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DI Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donor Intent Resource Library|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/donor_intent_resource_library|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==
Donor intent has been defended as a moral obligation between giver and recipient. Defenders of donor intent argue that on a basic ethical level, trustees and gift recipients must do what they have agreed with the original donor to do, explicitly or implicitly: "When donor intent is violated, and particularly when it is egregiously violated, it undermines the bedrock trust on which all charitable giving rests."&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

Donor intent is thus also defended as necessary to ensure future charitable giving.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frumkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frumkin|first=Peter|title=Strategic Giving: The Art and Science of Philanthropy|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=978-0-226-26626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future donors might not be inclined to leave money to charitable causes if they see that trustees, grant recipients, or policymakers do not respect the stated intent. [[Peter Frumkin]] has written that "as s a policy tool for encouraging future giving, protection of a donor's intent is needed to give future philanthropists the confidence they need to pass their wealth on to others to administer."[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv9ejrvJf7AC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=%22the+confidence+they+need+to+pass+their+wealth+on+to+others+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7M4KJDe55&amp;sig=4pK8KZcH4GnZQSUCnzoc4Pk7uLM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4n1CU5KqLoGy7Ab_zYD4Bw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20confidence%20they%20need%20to%20pass%20their%20wealth%20on%20to%20others%20%22&amp;f=false] [[Carl Schramm]], former president of the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]], has said on donor intent, "If we dont recognize it, we discourage wealthy people from creating foundations in the future."&lt;ref name=Schramm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schramm|first=Carl|title=Examining the Role of Foundations in a Free Society|journal=Philanthropy|date=November–December 2007|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/examining_the_role_of_foundations_in_a_free_society|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey data of Americans indicates that donor intent and grant compliance are valued by the public. When asked by [[Zogby International|Zogby]] if they would stop giving money to a charity that ignored a request to use a previous donation for a specific purpose, 53% said they would "definitely stop giving" and an additional 25.7% would "probably stop giving." When pollsters asked, "How important do you think showing respect for a donor's wishes is to the ethical governance of nonprofit charitable organizations?," 82.9% considered it "very important," 14.6% "somewhat important."&lt;ref name=Zogby&gt;{{cite web|title=Zogby America Adults 11/20/05 to 11/22/05|url=http://www.cehe.org/resources/ZogbyResults.pdf|publisher=Zogby International|accessdate=7 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, respect for donor intent is defended as necessary to preserve pluralism in [[civil society]]: "Those who take the idea of donor intent seriously believe that only by protecting the idiosyncratic and at times outlandish ideas of donors will it be possible for philanthropy to innovate and pursue ideas that are either ahead of or behind their time," Frumkin has said.&lt;ref name=Frumkin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyerson-2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyerson|first=Adam|title=How Foundations Should and Should Not Be Held Accountable|journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2009|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/how_foundations_should_and_should_not_be_held_accountable|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against==
Many arguments against donor intent are made against honoring it in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=Madoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenwald|first=Julius|title=Principles of Public Giving|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=May 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments date back at least to the 18th century and French economist [[Jacques Turgot]]: "No work of man is made for immortality; and since foundations, always multiplied by vanity, would in the long run, if uninterfered with, absorb all funds and private properties, it would be absolutely necessary at last to destroy them."&lt;ref name=Turgot&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving Well, Doing Good|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0-253-21955-8|pages=333–338|author=Turgot, Jacques|editor=Amy Kass|chapter=Endowments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not arguing against donor intent ''per se'', [[Julius Rosenwald]] criticized philanthropic funds that are established in perpetuity, arguing that narrowly defined statements of donor intent can be superseded as situations change: " I have heard of a fund which provides a baked potato at each meal for each young woman at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], and of another, dating from one of the great families, which pays for half a loaf of bread deposited each day at the door of each student in one of the colleges of [[Oxford University|Oxford]].... The list of these precisely focused gifts which have lost their usefulness could be extended into volumes."&lt;ref name=Rosenwald /&gt;

Another argument against donor intent relates to whether limitations may be placed on donors' purposes, either prudential or legal. In [[Augustus Octavius Bacon#Legacy|''Evans v. Abney'']], the Supreme Court held that [[Augustus Octavius Bacon]]'s clearly defined gift of a park to [[Macon, Georgia]], for whites only was illegal under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and so the gift reverted to Bacon’s heirs. In cases that donor intent can be modified, courts have latitude to do that under ''[[cy pres]]'' doctrine. Finally, some critics of donor intent argue that it cements [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogden|first=Tim|title=The Thorny Problem of Donor Intent|url=http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/the_thorny_problem_of_donor_intent/|publisher=Philanthropy Action|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuating donor intent ==
Donor intent is considered virtually impossible to be maintained in perpetuity because of changing situations, erosion of capital, and the distance of successor trustees from a donor. In some instances, however, donor intent has been lost only a short time after a donor's death. Waldemar Nielsen has argued that the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] swiftly lost the "democratic, hopeful, and constructive" spirit of [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s giving: "That within five years of his death his Corporation should have turned into a racist and reactionary machine to defend the privileges of the old [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] elite and block the advancement of immigrants and the underprivileged deformed his spirit and intent."&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics of Giving and Receiving: Am I My Foolish Brother's Keeper?|year=2000|publisher=SMU Press|location=Dallas|pages=96–107|author=Nielsen, Waldemar|editor=William F. May and A. Lewis Soens Jr.|chapter=The Ethics of Philanthropy and Trusteeship; The Carnegie Foundation: A Case Study}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the [[Daniels Fund]], established by [[Bill Daniels]], drifted away from what Daniels' trustees considered to be his principles, and the drift was arrested by board action.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Daniels&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=Back to Bill|journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2011|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/back_to_bill|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gose&gt;{{cite news|last=Gose|first=Ben|title=Changes at Denver's Daniels Fund: Politics or Prudence?|newspaper=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Some donors have adopted strategies to prevent philanthropies that they create from drifting from donor intent.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Sunsetting versus perpetuity ===
Rosenwald cautioned donors against perpetuity: "I am opposed to gifts in perpetuity for any purpose."&lt;ref name=Rosenwald /&gt; Some donors have attempted to preserve their intent either by "giving while living"&lt;ref name=Feeney&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning Passion into Action: Giving While Living|url=http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/sites/default/files/uploads/GWL_050510_1723%20%282%29.pdf|work=Atlantic Reports|publisher=Atlantic Philanthropies|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by establishing a date or timeframe in the future by which a foundation must disburse its assets, or "sunset." [[Chuck Feeney]] founded the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], which is scheduled to spend down its assets by 2017. In 1975, inspired by the controversy over donor intent at the Ford Foundation, [[John M. Olin]] adopted plans for the [[John M. Olin Foundation]] to disburse its assets by 2005. Olin believed that capitalism was the basis of prosperity and sought to promote [[conservative]] political and legal thinking.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John J.|title=A Gift of Freedom: How the John M. Olin Foundation Changed America|year=2006|publisher=Encounter Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-59403-117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spend-down plan gave the Olin Foundation the spending profile of a foundation with three times as many assets, Jeffrey Cain has written: "The Olin Foundation made a deliberate decision to have a profound impact on its time, rather than a lighter one that spanned years into the future."&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Mission statements ===
Carnegie left the Carnegie Corporation's mission vague and open-ended by instructing his successors to "promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding" but also granting "full authority to change policies or causes hitherto aided, from time to time, when this, in their opinion, has become necessary or desirable. They shall best conform to my wishes by using their own judgment."&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and Vision|url=http://carnegie.org/about-us/mission-and-vision/|publisher=Carnegie Corporation of New York|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], [[John D. MacArthur]] reportedly told his lawyer, "I'll make [the money]. But you people, after I'm dead, will have to learn how to spend it."&lt;ref name=Wooster /&gt;

Other donors are much narrower. [[James B. Duke]] specified percentages of the annual payout that would go to various categories of giving by the [[Duke Endowment]], including even a formula for reimbursing charity [[hospital]]s.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Duke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=Duke of Carolina|journal=Philanthropy|date=Winter 2011|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/duke_of_carolina|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some donors leave detailed documents to supplement official [[mission statement]]s, including reflections on their principles, video statements, and records of their personal giving.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Trustees and staff ===
Often, donors select family members, personal business associates, lawyers, or nonprofit leaders to serve on their boards.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt; The Daniels Fund requires trustees to sign a statement affirming that they understand Bill Daniels' donor intent and will honor it in their decision-making on behalf of the foundation.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Daniels /&gt; The foundation that was created by [[Lloyd Noble]] recruits [[apprentice]] trustees to shadow the actual board; some are elected to the board in the future.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt; At meetings of the Duke Endowment's board, James B. Duke's original [[tust instrument|indenture of trust]] is read aloud to reinforce his intentions.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Duke /&gt; The [[John Templeton Foundation]] has a provision for periodic "donor intent audits" to ensure its officers uphold [[John Templeton]]'s purposes.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

{{cleanup|reason=After several splits from the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]/[[Health consequences of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] articles, this article may contain information which is duplicated in the different sections. It also needs a proper restructuring.|date=February 2013}}
{{Deepwater Horizon oil spill series}}
This article covers the effect of the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|''Deepwater Horizon'' disaster]] and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|resulting oil spill]] on global and national economies and the energy industry.

Weeks after the event, and while it was still in progress, the 2010 ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill was being discussed as a disaster with far reaching consequences sufficient to impact global economies, marketplaces and policies. It took place on April 20, 2010. These potentially included structural shifts to [[energy policy]], insurance marketplaces and [[risk assessment]], and potential liabilities of the order of tens of billions of US dollars for one or more large and well known companies - principally [[BP]].

==Impact to the global industry==

===Oil industry impact===
{{Main|United States offshore drilling debate|2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium}}
{{See also|Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar}}
As a response to the disaster, on 30 April President [[Barack Obama]] ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a review determined whether more safety systems were needed&lt;ref name="bloomberg010510"/&gt; and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.&lt;ref name="CBS/AP"/&gt;  Later a six-month offshore drilling (below {{convert|500|ft}} of water) moratorium was enforced by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt;  Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf.&lt;ref name="CITEREFupstream2010a"/&gt;  The moratorium suspended work on 33&amp;nbsp;rigs.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt;  It was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. On 22 June, a [[United States federal judge]] on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman]] when ruling in the case [[Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar]], lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt; The Department of Justice appealed to the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which granted the request for an expedited hearing. A three judge panel is scheduled to hear oral arguments on 8 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-240"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-241"/&gt;

[[File:US Crude Oil Production and Imports.svg|thumb|250px|U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1920 to 2012]]
On 30 June, Salazar said that "he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium".&lt;ref name=upstream300610a/&gt; [[Michael Bromwich]], the head of the newly created [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], said that a record of "bad performance, deadly performance" by an oil company should be considered "a relevant factor" for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases.&lt;ref name=upstream300610a/&gt; Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of "extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations".&lt;ref name=upstream300610b/&gt;

On 28 April, the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the [[Canadian Arctic]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast]], issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells.&lt;ref name="canadian regulator response"/&gt;  Five days later, the Canadian [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Jim Prentice]] said the government would not approve a decision to relax safety or environment regulations for large energy projects.&lt;ref name="prentice"/&gt;  On 3 May California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded [[Offshore oil and gas in California|offshore drilling projects in California]].&lt;ref name="CSM20100503"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20100503"/&gt;  On 8 July, Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-243"/&gt;

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that in 2010, 23.5% of [[Oil producing countries|U.S. oil production]] came from offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico&lt;ref name="AutoBB-244"/&gt;  The chief argument in the U.S. offshore drilling debate has been to make the United States less dependent on [[List of countries by oil imports|imported oil]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-245"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-246"/&gt;  American dependence on imports grew from 24% in 1970&lt;ref name="AutoBB-247"/&gt; to 66% in 2008.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-248"/&gt;

Local officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.&lt;ref name="CSM Sasser"/&gt;

===Global insurance and reinsurance market impact===

At the time of the disaster it was said that there were only 4 companies able to insure risks of such size.&lt;ref name="portfolio.com1"/&gt;  The impact of ''Deepwater Horizon'' on [[insurance]], [[reinsurance]] and other global markets due to the shift in [[systemic risk]] is as yet unknown. Until this incident loss of an entire semi-submersible rig in this way was considered "an unprecedented tragedy" &lt;ref name="portfolio.com1" /&gt; with an underwriter at Pritchard Capital commenting "It's never happened that a semi could burn into the sea and completely sink. Now underwriters have to include that as a risk. That’s probably $10,000 to $15,000 more per day in rig insurance. They’ll make it up by charging more on a per-rig basis." &lt;ref name="portfolio.com1" /&gt;

==Impact on the UK economy==

The [[Organization for International Investment]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based advocate for overseas investment into the U.S., warned in early July that the political rhetoric surrounding the disaster is potentially damaging the reputation of all British companies with operations in the U.S.&lt;ref name=guardian140710/&gt; and sparked a wave of U.S. protectionism that has restricted British firms from; winning government contracts, making political donations, and lobbying.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-286"/&gt;

==Impact on the US economy==

===Fisheries===
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-21.png|thumb|As of 21 June 2010, the area closed to fishing encompassed {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or about 36% of Gulf of Mexico federal waters.|alt=21 June 2010 NOAA map of the Gulf of Mexico showing the areas closed to fishing.]]
In BP's Initial Exploration Plan, dated 10 March 2009, it said that "it is unlikely that an accidental spill would occur" and "no adverse activities are anticipated" to fisheries or fish habitat.&lt;ref name="Initial Exploration Plan Mississippi Canyon"/&gt;  On 29 April 2010, [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in the state after weather forecasts predicted the oil slick would reach the Louisiana coast.&lt;ref name="state of emergency"/&gt;  An emergency shrimping season was opened on 29 April so that a catch could be brought in before the oil advanced too far.&lt;ref name=CITEREFbbc2010a/&gt;  By 30 April, the USCG received reports that oil had begun washing up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref name=fishing1/&gt;  On 22 May 2010, the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board stated said 60 to 70% of [[oyster]] and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] harvesting areas and 70 to 80% of fin-fisheries remained open.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-198"/&gt;  The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals closed an additional ten oyster beds on 23 May, just south of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], citing confirmed reports of oil along the state's western coast.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-199"/&gt;

On 2 May 2010, NOAA closed commercial and recreational fishing in affected federal waters between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Pensacola Bay. The closure initially incorporated {{convert|6814|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-201"/&gt;  By 21 June, NOAA had increased the area under closure over a dozen times, encompassing by that date {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and extending along the coast from [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya Bay]], Louisiana to [[Panama City, Florida]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-203"/&gt;  On 24 May, the federal government declared a fisheries disaster for the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-204"/&gt;  Initial cost estimates to the fishing industry were $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="fishing1" /&gt;

On 23 June, NOAA ended its fishing ban in {{convert|8000|sqmi}}, leaving {{convert|78597|sqmi}} with no fishing allowed,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-205"/&gt; or about one-third of the Gulf. The continued fishing ban was meant to assure the safety of seafood, and NOAA inspectors announced that as of 9 July, Kevin Griffis of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] said, only one seafood sample out of 400 tested did not pass, and even that one did not include "concerning levels of contaminants".&lt;ref name=Skoloff/&gt;  On 10 August, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said no one had seen oil in a {{convert|8000|sqmi}} area east of Pensacola since 3 July, so the fishing ban in that area was being lifted.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-206"/&gt;

On 31 August, a Boston lab hired by the United Commercial Fishermen's Association to analyze coastal fishing waters said it found dispersant in a seafood sample taken near Biloxi, Miss., almost a month after BP said it had stopped using the chemical.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-207"/&gt;

According to the [[European Space Agency]], the agency's satellite data was used by the Ocean Foundation to conclude that 20% of the juvenile [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] were killed by oil in the gulf's most important spawning area. The foundation combined satellite data showing the oil spill extent each week with data on weekly tuna spawning to make their conclusion. The agency also said that the loss of juvenile tuna was significant due to the 82% decline of the tuna's spawning stock in the western Atlantic during the 30 years before the oil spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-208"/&gt;

The waters had been reopened to fishing on 15 November 2010,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-209"/&gt; but on 24 November NOAA re-closed {{convert|4200|sqmi}} area to shrimping.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-210"/&gt;  A Florida TV station sent frozen Gulf shrimp to be tested for petroleum by-products after recent reports showed scientists disagreed on whether it is safe to eat after the oil spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-211"&gt;[http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/local_news/gulf-seafood-safe%3F-experts-disagree-wptv1290203315314 Gulf seafood safe?

In July 2011 BP released a report&lt;ref name="AutoBB-216"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515155758/http://gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the economy had recovered and there was no reason to believe that anyone would suffer future losses from the spill, with the limited exception of oyster harvesters. However, Bruce Guerra, a crab fisherman in Louisiana for 25 years, said that since the BP oil spill crabbers are trapping 75 percent fewer crabs and that "crabs have been coming up dead, discolored, or riddled with holes since last year's spill".  Others in the fishing industry say it could take years to fully realize the spill's effects. "The problem is right when they used the dispersants, that's when the tuna came to the Gulf to spawn," said Cheril Carey, a national sales representative for a Louisiana company specializing in yellow fin tuna. "It takes a tuna five to 15 years to mature. So although we may have fish now, we may not have them in five to 15 years."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-217"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |title=Fishermen angry as BP pushes to end payments for future losses &amp;#124; wwltv.com New Orleans |publisher=Wwltv.com |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920150119/http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012 local fishermen report that crab, shrimp, and oyster fishing operations have not yet recovered from the oil spill and many fear that the Gulf seafood industry will never recover.  One Mississippi shrimper who was interviewed said he used to get 8,000 pounds of shrimp in four days, but this year he got only 800 pounds a week.  Mississippi's oyster reefs have been closed since the spill started. A Louisiana fisherman said the local oyster industry might do 35 per cent this year, "If we're very lucky."  Dr Ed Cake, a biological oceanographer and a marine and oyster biologist, said that many of the Gulf fisheries have collapsed and "If it takes too long for them to come back, the fishing industry won't survive".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-218"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/20123571723894800.html Gulf fisheries in decline after oil disaster - Features - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, [[SBP (nonprofit organization)]] began to provide assistance to fishermen affected by what came to be known as the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref name="climatechange"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandberg|first1=L.

===Tourism===
[[File:Orange Beach Do Not Swim sign walkway.JPG|thumb|right|Sign in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]] advising against swimming due to the oil spill]]
Although many people cancelled their vacations due to the spill, hotels close to the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported dramatic increases in business during the first half of May 2010. However, the increase was likely due to the influx of people who had come to work with oil removal efforts. Jim Hutchinson, assistant secretary for the Louisiana Office of Tourism, called the occupancy numbers misleading, but not surprising. "Because of the oil slick, the hotels are completely full of people dealing with that problem," he said. "They're certainly not coming here as tourists. People aren't sport fishing, they aren't buying fuel at the marinas, they aren't staying at the little hotels on the coast and eating at the restaurants."&lt;ref name="thesunnews1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/05/27/1497705/spill-hasnt-yet-emptied-hotels.html|title=Spill hasn't yet emptied hotels on Gulf Coast|last=Reed|first=Travis|work=The Sun News|agency=Associated Press|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=2010-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530120501/http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/05/27/1497705/spill-hasnt-yet-emptied-hotels.html|archivedate=30 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May, BP gave Florida $25&amp;nbsp;million to promote the beaches where the oil had not reached, and the company planned $15&amp;nbsp;million each for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Bay Area Tourist Development Council bought [[digital billboard]]s showing recent photos from the gulf coast beaches as far north as [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Atlanta]]. Along with assurances that the beaches were so far unaffected, hotels cut rates and offered deals such as free golf. Also, cancellation policies were changed, and refunds were promised to those where oil may have arrived. However, revenues remained below 2009 levels.&lt;ref name="thesunnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/06/04/1511778/oil-could-hit-strand-by-july.html|title=Oil could hit Myrtle Beach area by July|last=Anderson|first=Lorena|work=The Sun News |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23 billion, in a region that supports over 400,000 travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-219"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |title=Big price tag for recovery of Gulf Coast |last=Proctor |first=Carleton |work=Pensacola News Journal |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427044922/http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |archivedate=27 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-220"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |title=Potential Impact of the Gulf Oil Spill on Tourism |author=Oxford Economics |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507030043/http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real estate prices===
The real estate prices and a number of transactions in the Gulf of Mexico area decreased significantly during the period of the oil spill. As a result, area officials wanted the state legislature to allow [[property tax]] to be paid based on current market value, which according to Florida [[Florida Legislature|State Rep.]] [[Dave Murzin]] could mean millions of dollars in losses for each county affected.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-225"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |title=Gulf property sales slide further on oil fears |last=Farrington |first=Brendan |work=The Sun News |agency=Associated Press |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702154922/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |archivedate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BP's expenditures on the oil spill===
On 5 July 2010, BP reported that its own expenditures on the oil spill had reached $3.12&amp;nbsp;billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid, and federal costs.&lt;ref name="BP costs for oil spill response pass $3 billion"&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Associated Press| title= BP costs for oil spill response pass $3&amp;nbsp;billion|last= Breen|first= Tom|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=2010-07-05| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/5/bp-costs-oil-spill-response-pass-3-billion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1 October 2010, BP has spent $11.2 billion.&lt;ref name="newsobserver.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc011010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100101380.html |title=BP says oil spill costs rise to $11.2 billion |last=Wardell|first=Jane|agency= The Associated Press| newspaper = The Washington Post |date=1 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2012, BP estimated the company's total spill-related expenses do not exceed $37.2 billion.&lt;ref name=settleAP&gt;{{cite news|title=BP begins to put spill behind it with settlement|first1=Jonathan|last1=Fahey|first2=Chris|last2=Kahn|date=3 March 2012|work=[[CBN News]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/46613428|accessdate=20 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market value===
BP's stock fell by 51% in 40 days on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], going from $60.57 on 20 April 2010, to $29.20 on 9 June, its lowest level since August 1996. On 25 June, BP's market value reached a 1-year low. The company's total value lost since 20 April was $105&amp;nbsp;billion.

At that time, BP reported a second-quarter loss of $17 billion, its first loss in 18 years. This included a one-time $32.2 billion charge, including $20 billion for the [[#Spill response fund|fund]] created for reparations and $2.9 billion in actual costs.&lt;ref name=Wardell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/7126429.html |title=BP replaces CEO Hayward, reports $17 billion loss |last=Wardell |first=Jane |agency=Associated Press |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930003010/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/7126429.html |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October, BP's [[London Stock Exchange]] price reached 439.75 pence, the highest point since 28 May.&lt;ref name="abc011010"/&gt;

On 4 September 2014, when BP was found guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which could see it liable for up to $18 billion in additional fines, the company's shares lost 6 percent of their value.&lt;ref name="BPverdict"&gt;{{cite news|title=BP found "grossly negligent' in Gulf of Mexico oil sp|url=http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/225407625|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=''New Orleans Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drop in sale===
BP gas stations in the United States, the majority of which the company does not own, reported sales off between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Some BP station owners that lost sales said the name should change back to [[Amoco]], while others said after all the effort that went into promoting BP, such a move would be a gamble, and the company should work to restore its image.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-224"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38493212/ns/business-us_business/|title=Time to scrap BP brand?

'''Federico Britto Figueroa''' ([[La Victoria (Venezuela)|La Victoria]], 2 November 1921 - [[Caracas]], 28 April 2000) was a renowned [[Venezuela]]n [[Marxist]] [[historian]] and [[anthropologist]]. Brito's ideas and writings played an important role in the ideological formation of [[Hugo Chavez]], former president of Venezuela.

Born in [[La Victoria, Venezuela|La Victoria]] in Venezuela, Brito was a member of Venezuela's National Democratic Party (''[[Partido Democrático Nacional]]'' &amp;mdash; PDN, which later renamed [[Acción Democrática]]) in 1936. Britto, after profound schisms appeared in the Venezuelan left, joined the Venezuelan Communist Party ([[Partido Comunista de Venezuela]] &amp;mdash; PCV), together with [[Domingo Maza Zavala]] and [[Luis Miquilena]].

In 1946, Britto entered the Instituto Pedagógico Nacional (National Teaching Institute) to obtain the title of professor of social sciences. Britto later travelled to [[México]]. There, he studied in the Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National School of Anthropology and History). Along with [[Wenceslao Roces]] and François Chavalier, Brito graduated with a degree in [[ethnology]] and [[anthropology]]. Britto returned to Venezuela in 1959, after [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]]'s toppling, and began studies at the Universidad Central de Venezuela and was licensed as a historian and obtained his doctorate in anthropology. Britto's doctoral thesis was the renowned and influential work ''La estructura económica de Venezuela colonial'' (The Economic Structure of Colonial Venezuela), which he wrote in 1963 and published in 1978.

Key points of his works included the elucidation of [[slavery]], the study of Venezuelan "Federal War" general [[Ezequiel Zamora]], and a critical and probing analysis of the socioeconomic underpinnings of both [[colonialism]] and [[neocolonialism]]..

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20465">The man's '''[[suit (clothing)|suit]]''' of clothes, in the sense of a lounge or business or office suit, is a set of garments which are crafted from the same cloth. This article discusses the history of the lounge suit, often called a '''business suit''' when made in dark colors and of conservative cut.

==Men's suits==
[[Image:GAINSBOROUGH, Thomas - Johann Christian Fischer (1780).jpg|right|thumb|[[Johann Christian Fischer]], composer, in matching coat, waistcoat, and breeches, by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], ca. 1780.]]

The suit is a traditional form of men's [[formal clothes]] in the Western world. For some four hundred years, suits of matching coat, trousers, and waistcoat have been in and out of fashion. The modern lounge suit's derivation is visible in the outline of the brightly coloured, elaborately crafted [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|royal court dress]] of the 17th century (suit, wig, knee breeches), which was shed because of the [[French Revolution]].  This evolution is seen more recently in British tailoring's use of steam and padding in moulding [[wool]]en cloth, the rise and fall in popularity of the [[necktie]], and the gradual disuse of waistcoats and hats in the last fifty years.

The modern lounge suit appeared in the late 19th century, but traces its origins to the simplified, sartorial standard of dress established by the English king [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century. In 1666, the restored monarch, Charles II, per the example of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s court at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], decreed that in the English Court men would wear a long coat, a waistcoat (then called a "[[petticoat]]"), a [[cravat]] (a precursor of the necktie), a [[Wig (hair)|wig]], knee [[breeches]] (trousers), and a hat. However, the paintings of [[Jan Steen]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], and other painters of the Dutch Golden Era reveal that such an arrangement was already used informally in Holland, if not Western Europe as a whole. Many of Steen's genre paintings include men dressed in hip-length or frock coats with shirt and trousers, which in fact more closely resemble modern suit designs than the contemporary British standard.

===Regency===
In the early 19th century, British [[dandy]] [[Beau Brummell]] redefined, adapted, and popularized the style of the British court, leading [[Europe]]an men to wearing well-cut, tailored clothes, adorned with carefully knotted neckties. The simplicity of the new clothes and their somber colors contrasted strongly with the extravagant, [[fop]]pish styles just before. Brummell's influence introduced the modern era of men's clothing which now includes the modern suit and necktie. Moreover, he introduced a whole new era of grooming and style, including regular (daily) bathing as part of a man's toilette. However, paintings of French men from 1794 onwards reveal that Brummel might only have adopted and popularized post-revolutionary French suits, which included tail coat, double-breasted waistcoat and full-length trousers with either [[Hessian (boot)|Hessian boots]] or regular-size shoes. There is no 18th-century painting of Brummel to establish his innovation. The modern suit design seems to be inspired by the utilitarian dressing of hunters and military offiicers. Paintings of the decade 1760 reveal how the modern coat design with lapels emerged. It can be seen in the hunting scene with Count Carl Emil Ulrich von Donop as subject by an unknown artist and Frederick William Ernest, Count von Schaumburg-Lippe in Hanoverian Field Marshall uniform painted by Joshua Reynolds. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Birth of the Modern''&lt;/ref&gt;

In this [[British Regency|regency]] period, the predominant upper-class clothing introduced by Brummell for day wear was a tightly fitting, dark coloured tailcoat with non-matching (usually pale) trousers, pale waistcoat, white shirt and cravat and tall boots.

===Victorian===
Towards the start of the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], the [[frock coat]], initially not just black, became popular, and quickly became the standard daily clothing for gentlemen.  From the middle of the 19th century, a new (then informal) coat, the [[morning coat]], became acceptable.  It was a less formal garment, with a cut away front, making it suitable for wearing while riding. Morning dress and the frock coat garments were not suits, because they were worn with trousers that didn't match in color or fabric; a matching waistcoat and trousers were considered informal and could be described using the short-lived term '''ditto suit'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ditto Suits|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-19th-Century/Ditto-Suits.html|publisher=fashionencyclopaedia.com|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The frock coat was still the standard garment for all formal or business occasions, and a tailcoat was worn in the evenings.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the modern lounge suit was born as a very informal garment meant only to be worn for sports, in the country, or at the seaside.

[[Image:Men in black tie.jpg|right|thumb|Three men in 2006 wearing black tie variations.]]
Parallel to this, the dinner jacket was invented and came to be worn for informal evening events. It was descended from [[white tie]] (the dress code associated with the evening tailcoat) but quickly became a full new garment, the dinner jacket, with a new dress code, initially known as 'dress lounge' and later [[black tie]]. When it was imported to the [[United States]], it became known as the [[tuxedo]]. The 'dress lounge' was originally worn only for small private gatherings and [[white tie]] ('White tie and tails') was still worn for large formal events. The 'dress lounge' slowly became more popular for larger events as an alternative to full evening dress in white tie.

===Edwardian===
[[Image:Morning dress 1901.jpg|thumb|left|1901, a man in a morning coat.]]
The beginning of the [[Edwardian era]] in the early 20th century brought a steady decline in the wearing of [[frock coat]]s as the morning coat rose in relative formality, first becoming acceptable for businessmen, then becoming standard dress even in town.  The lounge suit was slowly accepted as being correct outside its original settings, and during Edwardian times gradually began to be seen in town.  While still reserved for private gatherings, usually with no ladies, black tie became more common.

In [[North America]], the "sack suit", a cut of lounge suit, saw a large rise in popularity, and, except for the shoulders, it is unfitted, loose, and informal, as it has no darts.

===Inter-war===
[[File:Big Four 29038u original.jpg|thumb|right|At the Treaty of Versailles signing in 1919, the heads of state wore [[morning dress]] and lounge suits for informal meetings (as seen here), but [[frock coat]]s for formal daytime meetings.]]
After the end of the first World War, most men adopted the short lounge coated suit. Long coats quickly went out of fashion for everyday wear and business, and the morning coat gained its current classification of "formal". During the 1920s, short suits were always worn except on formal occasions in the daytime, when a morning coat would be worn. Older, more conservative men continued to wear a frock coat, or "Prince Albert coat" as it was known. 

In North America, for evening occasions, the short dinner jacket virtually replaced the long "full dress" tails, which was perceived as "old hat" and was only worn by old conservative men.  In Britain, black tie became acceptable as a general informal alternative to white tie, though at the time the style and accessories of black tie were still very fluid.

In the 1920s men began wearing wide, straight-legged trousers with their suits. These trousers normally measured 23&amp;nbsp;inches around the cuff. Younger men often wore even wider-legged trousers which were known as "[[Oxford bags]]." Trousers also began to be worn cuffed shortly after World War I and this style persisted until World War II. Trousers first began to be worn creased in the 1920s. Trousers were  worn very highly waisted throughout the 1920s and this fashion remained in vogue until the 1940s. Single-breasted suits were in style throughout the 1920s and the [[double-breasted]] suit was mainly worn by older more conservative men. In the 1920s, very fashionable men would often wear double-breasted waistcoats (with four buttons on each side) with single-breasted coats. Lapels on single-breasted suits were fashionably worn peaked and were often wide.  In the early 1930s these styles continued and were often even further exaggerated.

Before 1935 (and again in the 1970s) men preferred snugly tailored coats and waistcoats. In 1935, a complete change in style occurred. Loose fitting coats were introduced, trousers began to be tapered at the bottom and suit coats began to have tapered arms. These new trends were only reluctantly accepted by men at first. At first the waistcoat continued to be made in the traditional fitted and snug style. By 1940, the waistcoat began to be made in a loose style which made it uncomfortable to wear. In fashion magazines of the day, men complained how these new vests continually rode up when they happen to sit down or bend over. Fashionable men changed their preference to the double-breasted suit coat at this time and it would remain in fashion for the next two decades.

By this time, morning dress was being replaced by day time semi-formal, known in North America as the [[Stroller (style)|stroller]].  This was quite popular, but has actually been outlived by the morning coat. Since the 1950s it has been used as a black version of the lounge suit as an informal look to the dinner jacket.  In modern times the black lounge suit has become popular to wear during the day.

===Post-war===
Reflecting the democratization of wealth and larger trend toward simplification in the decades following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the suit was standardized and streamlined. Suit coats were cut as straight as possible without any indication of a waistline, and by the 1960s the lapel had become narrower than at any time prior. Cloth rationing during the war had forced significant changes in style, contributing to a large reduction in the popularity of cuts such as the double-breasted suit.

The ''New York Times Style Magazine'' explains one iconic suit of the era, the gray flannel suit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Back in 1955, when denim was the height of rebelliousness, Sloan Wilson's novel ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (novel)|The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' turned a men's classic into a synonym for drab, middle-class conformity . . . Flannel had humble beginnings — the name is reputedly derived from "gwlanen," Welsh for woolen cloth — and was used for underwear in the 19th century. In the 1880s white flannel was worn for summer sports; by the 1920s the more seasonless gray had become a favorite. When the Prince of Wales wore gray flannel trousers on his 1924 trip to America, they were aped by collegiates on both sides of the Atlantic. Cary Grant and Fred Astaire then carried the trend through to the 1940s. The archetypal square of the postwar era was later described by Esquire's style encyclopedia as ''a neat, circumspect, conservative man who carried an attaché case and regarded a pink button-down shirt as his one sartorial fling.''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times Style Magazine'', Bryan, Robert E. "Gray Matters," &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2009/09/13/style/t/index.html#pageName=13return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the [[Nehru jacket]], an Indian style featuring a mandarin collar, was introduced by entertainers such as [[Johnny Carson]] and [[The Beatles]], and saw a brief surge in popularity across Western Europe and the United States.

In the 1970s, a snug-fitting suit coat became popular once again, also encouraging the return of the waistcoat. This new three-piece style became closely associated with [[Nightclub#1970s: Disco|disco]] culture, and was specifically popularized by the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. Fashion brands such Haggar meanwhile started to introduce the concept of "suit separates", a production innovation that reduced the need for excessive customization.

The 1980s saw a trend towards the simplification of the suit once again. The jacket became looser and the waistcoat was completely dispensed with. A few suit makers continued to make waistcoats, but these tended to be cut low and often had only four buttons. The waistline on the suit coat moved down again in the 1980s to a position well below the waist. By 1985-1986, three-piece suits were on the way out and making way for cut [[double-breasted]] and two-piece [[single-breasted]] suits.

The late 1990s saw the return to popularity of the three-button two-piece suit, which then went back out of fashion some time in the first decade of the twenty-first century.

==Women's suits==
[[Image:Walking suites 1894 Delineator.jpg|thumb|right|Women's walking suits, 1894, from the [[Ebenezer Butterick|Butterick]] pattern company's ''Delineator'']] 	
The earliest women's suits were [[riding habit]]s, which consisted of a tailored coat or jacket and matching [[skirt]] from the 1660s. Practical and sturdy, riding habits were worn not only on horseback, but also for travel and other daytime pursuits. Jacket-and-skirt ensembles not intended for riding appeared in the later 19th century. Both riding habits and walking suits reflected the skirt and [[sleeve]] styles of the day. Until the 1910s, coat and skirt ensembles were usually described as "costumes" rather than suits, and the term "suit", as applied to such sets, was not usual until after the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Costume by John Redfern|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O154069/costume-redfern/|work=Search the Collections|publisher=V&amp;A Museum|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the twentieth century, the skirted suit became the common daytime city costume for women, in the workplace and out; [[dressmaker]] suits featured softer fabrics and "feminine" details, and [[cocktail suits]] were worn for semi-formal occasions in mid-century. 	

Under the influence of ''[[Dress for Success (book)|Dress for Success]]'', a working woman's uniform of skirted suit, tailored shirt, and floppy tie evolved in the 1970s and 1980s. [[Pantsuit]]s (women's suits with Eastern style trousers) were introduced by designer [[André Courrèges]] in 1964 but were only gradually accepted as formal business attire.

==Recent influence of casual dress==
Over the past half-century, the wearing of suits has become far less common than it once was and is now usually reserved for formal and business activities. During the 1990s, many businesses in North America adopted casual dress codes, beginning with "[[Casual Friday]]s" and then extending to the entire business week. The abandonment of a uniform dress code has led to considerable confusion over what is considered appropriate business wear. More recently, some organizations have reinforced formal dress codes, although they may never again be as common as they once were.

==Contemporary trends==

Although the man's European tailored suit is commonly perceived as the ultimate conservative costume of [[Western culture]], Eastern influences or extravagant variations on the tailored suit have been adopted by many subcultures over the last century as a matter of fashion or social identity. As early as 1922, [[Emily Post]] addressed what she termed the "freak American suit" in her influential guide ''Etiquette'':

:You will see it everywhere, on Broadway of every city and Main Street of every town, on the boardwalks and beaches of coast resorts, and even in remote farming villages. It comes up to hit you in the face year after year in all its amazing variations: waist-line under the arm pits, "trick" little belts, what-nots in the cuffs; trousers so narrow you fear they will burst before your eyes, pockets placed in every position, buttons clustered together in a tight little row or reduced to one.  Such progressive styles may not reflect the international tastes or etiquette.

Some of the non-traditional tailored suit styles of the past century include:
* The [[Jazz suit]] of the early 1920s were extremely high-waisted and snug-fitting and were worn with trousers which were quite high-waisted and trouser legs were short and revealed the wearer's socks.
* The [[Zoot suit]] of the late 1930s and 1940s.
* The Western suit, a form of [[western wear]] featuring a tailored jacket with "western" details such as pointed yokes or arrowhead pockets.
* The [[Nudie Cohn|Nudie suit]], a highly decorated form of western wear.
* The [[The Beatles|Beatle]] suit, inspired by [[Pierre Cardin]]'s collarless jackets, derived from [[1900s in fashion|Edwardian suits]] and the Indian [[Nehru jacket]].
* The [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] suit, a fashion of the 1960s, and again in the [[2010s fashion|early 2010s]]. Characteristics include a very slim cut, narrow lapels, three or four buttons and a strongly tapered waist. Usually single-breasted and grey. The cloth generally consists in part of [[mohair]], tonic, [[houndstooth]], or two-tone fabric.
* The [[Safari suit]], a fashion of the 1970s.  Patterned after military dress uniforms worn in hot climates, it consisted of (long, but sometimes short) trousers and short-sleeved jacket with [[patch pocket]]s of a light suiting fabric, typically of beige or pastel shades of blue and green. It was worn with a short-sleeved shirt, mostly of open neck design, but occasionally with a tie. Another style associated with this was the [[leisure suit]], which had a long-sleeved shirt-like jacket.
* The [[Disco]] suit, a fashion of the 1970s with exaggerated lapels and flared trousers and usually necktie omitting, often in white or brightly coloured [[polyester]] fabric, the jacket was based on the jackets popular in the 1930s.
* The Power suit of the mid-1980s and early 1990s: a double-breasted suit characterized by sharp cuts, wide shoulder pads and a rigid build.

'''John T. Arundel''' (1 September 1841 – 30 November 1919) was an English entrepreneur who was instrumental in the development of the mining of [[phosphate rock]] on the Pacific islands of [[Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] (Ocean Island). Williams &amp; Macdonald (1985) described J.T. Arundel as "a remarkable example of that mid-Victorian phenomenon, the upright, pious and adventurous Christian English businessman."&lt;ref&gt;Maslyn Williams &amp; Barrie Macdonald (1985) ''The Phosphateers'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
His father owned a gentleman's outfitter in the [[City of London]] and a warehouse business on the Thames estuary, with the family living at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]].&lt;ref name="WM1985"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Maslyn Williams &amp; Barrie Macdonald |first1= |authorlink1= |title= The Phosphateers |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1985 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Melbourne University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-522-84302-6|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family were active in the [[Congregational]] Church, and through a church connection he joined [[Houlder Line|Houlder Brothers &amp; Co.]], a firm that provided ships for [[immigration to New Zealand|migration to New Zealand]] and Australia.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;

==Early career==
In 1860, J.T. Arundel travelled on a Houlder Brothers &amp; Co ship into the Pacific, calling at the [[Chincha Islands]], on which [[guano]] was mined for refining into [[superphosphate]]. J.T. Arundel took an interest in the potential of the fertiliser business and in 1868 the company sent him on a second voyage into the Pacific to pursue opportunities.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;

When J.T. Arundel set off in 1871 to develop a business in the Pacific he left his fiancée Eliza Eleanor (Lillie) Whibley in England, as he wanted to secure their financial security by achieving success with his business ventures. J .T. Arundel and Lillie Whibley were not to marry until 1881. Following their marriage Lillie Arundel would travel into the central Pacific with J.T. Arundel when he would visit the various islands on which his company has operations. Lillie Arundel gave birth in 1884 to their second daughter while on [[Manra]], then known as Sydney Island, giving her the name of that island.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;

In 1898 [[Fred Whibley]], Lillie's younger brother, arrived in Sydney, after 10 years in the United States and Canada.  J .T. Arundel offered Fred Whibley a position with John T. Arundel &amp; Co.  [[Fred Whibley]] declined and chose to become an island trader on [[Niutao]] in what is now [[Tuvalu]].  A harmonious working relationship would have been unlikely given the pious Christian attitudes of J.T. Arundel and [[Fred Whibley]]'s reputation as the '[[black sheep]]' of the family.&lt;ref&gt;S. Aris, ''Fred Whibley and his Family'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

==John T. Arundel &amp; Co.==

In 1871 with financial support from [[Houlder Line|Houlder Brothers and Co.]], he established John T. Arundel &amp; Co. The initial activities were carried out by the two companies. Houlder Brothers and Co leased [[Flint Island]] from the [[United Kingdom|British government]] and Arundel managed the [[guano]] digging in the central part of the island from 1875 to 1880.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt; In 1872, [[Caroline Island]] was leased by the Houlder Brothers. In 1881, the lease was later taken over by Arundel (for whom one of the islets is named).&lt;ref name="Resture"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bryan | first = E.H. | authorlink = | year = 1942 | title = American Polynesia and the Hawaiian Chain | publisher = Tongg Publishing Company | location = Honolulu | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

John T. Arundel &amp; Co went on to engage in mining [[guano]] on other Pacific islands and also established coconut plantations and traded in [[copra]] and other commodities.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt; The company operated from Sydney, Australia with business interests in the Pacific that included:
* Mining [[guano]] on:
**  [[Caroline Island]] from 1872 (with the support of Houlder Brothers and Co) then under John T. Arundel &amp; Co from 1881.&lt;ref name="Resture"/&gt; The guano mining, which began in 1874, supplied a total of about 10,000 tons of [[phosphate]] until supplies were exhausted around 1895.&lt;ref name="ARB"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Angela K. | last = Kepler | authorlink = |author2=Cameron B.

** [[Manra]] or Sydney Island in 1884, which is geographically part of the [[Phoenix Islands]] and is part of [[Kiribati]].
** [[Raine Island]] in the [[Torres Strait]], [[Rocky Island (Queensland)|Rocky Island]], in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], [[Lady Elliot Island]] off [[Bundaberg]], [[Queensland]] and several islands in the [[Capricorn and Bunker Group]] in the waters off Northern Australia.&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt;
* Establishing coconut plantations on:
** [[Flint Island]] in 1881 in what is now [[Kiribati]], with the plantation operated by the firm until 1891.
** [[Caroline Island]] in 1885, however the coconut palms suffered from disease and the plantation failed.&lt;ref name="ARB"/&gt; 
** [[Nikumaroro]], or Gardner Island, which is geographically part of the [[Phoenix Islands]] and is part of [[Kiribati]].  The plantation was started in 1892 but as a consequence of severe drought the plantation was abandoned within 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, E.H. Jr., (1942) ''American Polynesia and the Hawaiian Chain''. Honolulu, Hawaii: Tongg Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Fuller Ellis|Albert Ellis]] who worked for John T. Arundel &amp; Co., later acknowledged that the company was not making money although the company was gaining experience in the mining and shipping of [[guano]] and [[phosphate rock]] in what were sometimes difficult conditions, with many of these islands having no safe anchorage for shipping.&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt;

== Pacific Islands Company Ltd ==
In 1897 John T. Arundel &amp; Co., merged its business with that of the trading and plantation firm of [[Thomas Henderson (New Zealand politician)|Henderson and Macfarlane]] to form the Pacific Islands Company Ltd ('PIC').  The company was based in London with its trading activities in the Pacific. The Chairman of the PIC was [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Lord Stanmore]], formerly Sir Arthur Gordon, Governor of [[Fiji]] and first [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific]].  John T. Arundel was the vice-chairman.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;

The PIC continued to expand its plantation interests and in 1899, acquired a license to develop coconut plantations on [[Birnie Island]], which is geographically part of the [[Phoenix Islands]] and is part of [[Kiribati]], with the PIC acquiring licenses to develop coconut plantations in the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name="hookey"&gt;Hookey, J. F. [http://www.comofinquiry.gov.sb/Articles/History%20of%20Melanesia.htm  "The Establishment Of A Plantation Economy in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate",] [http://www.comofinquiry.gov.sb/Articles/Articles.htm  Commission of Inquiry into the Land Dealings &amp; Abandoned Properties on Guadalcanal]; retrieved 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this attempt to broaden the operations of the company the company remained chronically short of capital throughout its existence and was lent money from time to time by its directors.&lt;ref name="hookey"/&gt;

== Pacific Phosphate Company Ltd ==
[[File:Banaba door stop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Phosphate rock used as door stop|Phosphate rock used as door stop]]
In 1899 [[Albert Fuller Ellis|Albert Ellis]] made what he later described as "''a good 'find'''", when he had laboratory analysis carried out on a rock that was used to prop open the Sydney office door, as it appeared similar to the hard [[phosphate rock]] that he had seen on [[Baker Island]]&lt;ref name="Albert F. Ellis 1935"&gt;Albert F. Ellis, (1935) ''Ocean Island and Nauru: Their Story'', Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;  The laboratory analysis confirmed that the rock was high grade [[phosphate]]. [[Albert Fuller Ellis|Albert Ellis]] and other company employees travelled to [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] to confirm that the soil of that island was largely phosphate rock. A. F. Ellis went on to [[Nauru]], at that time a German territory, and confirmed it also consisted of large deposits of phosphate rock.&lt;ref name="Albert F. Ellis 1935"/&gt;

J. T. Arundel and Lord Stanmore were responsible for financing the new opportunities and negotiating with the German company that controlled the licences to mine in Nauru.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt; In 1902 the interests of PIC were merged with Jaluit Gesellschaft of Hamburg, to form the Pacific Phosphate Company, ('PPC') to engage in [[phosphate mining in Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]], then known as Ocean Island.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt; The company's engineers had to find solutions for transferring the [[phosphate rock]] from the island to ships that had to anchor off the island. As [[high islands]] both [[Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] did not have lagoons or anchorages that protected ships from the Pacific storms.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt;  Solutions were found and despite losing some 5 ships on the reef at Ocean Island, the PPC became a very profitable company. The profitability of the company directed attention to the original agreements made with the land owners of [[Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]].&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt; The agreement with the Banabans was for the exclusive right to mine for 999 years for £50 a year. The terms of the licenses were changed to provide for the payment of royalties and compensation for mining damage.&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt;

In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal criticised the operation of the PPC under the title "Modern buccaneers in the West Pacific".&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|last= Correspondent |title = Modern buccaneers in the West Pacific |url= http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1140814207532014.pdf |date= 5 June 1913|volume=  |issue=|journal= New Age |pages=136–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPC investigated phosphate deposits on [[Makatea]] in the [[Tuamotus]] in [[French Polynesia]] and formed a company, the Compagnie des Phosphates de l'Océanie, with a [[Tahiti]]an syndicate that was also investigating the potential of [[Makatea]].  This gave the PPC a virtual monopoly on the sources of high grade phosphate in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Maslyn Williams &amp; Barrie Macdonald (1985) ''The Phosphateers'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 the business of the PPC in [[Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] was acquired by Board of the [[British Phosphate Commission]].&lt;ref name="WM1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"/&gt;  From 1919 the responsibility for the welfare of the people of [[Nauru]] and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]], the restoring of land and water resources lost by mining operations and compensation for environmental damage to the islands was under the control of the governments of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;ICJ Pleadings, Oral Arguments, Documents, ''Case Concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) Application: Memorial of Nauru'' (January 2004) {{ISBN|978-92-1-070936-1}} (United Nations, International Court of Justice)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4399">'''Kleine und fragmentarische Historiker der Spätantike'''  (abbreviated '''KFHist'''), or ‘Minor and Fragmentary Historians of Late Antiquity’, is an edition of Greek and Latin historiographical texts from [[Late Antiquity]].

The fifteen-year project based at the [[University of Düsseldorf]] is directed by [[Bruno Bleckmann]] (professor of ancient history) and [[Markus Stein]] (professor of classics), and funded by the [[North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts]].

The aim is to publish the minor and/or fragmentary texts of nearly 90 authors ranging from the 3rd through the 6th centuries, together with a German translation and a commentary covering both philological and historical matters. The series includes pagan and Christian works, chronicles, annotated consul lists, and larger works that are only transmitted as fragments or excerpts. It also includes works that are not directly attested, but whose content can be reconstructed (like the ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]''). The volumes are published by [[Verlag Ferdinand Schöningh|Ferdinand Schöningh]].

The first installment, the fragmentary ''Church History'' of [[Philostorgius|Philostorgios]], appeared in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Review: Raphael Brendel, [http://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-25594 H-Soz-Kult, 25.07.2016] (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kōō'''|康応|}}, also romanized as '''Kō-ō,''' was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) of the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Court]] during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Kakei]] and before [[Meitoku]]. This period spanned the years from February 1389 to March 1390.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kō-ō''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA560&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 560;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor in Kyoto was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Komatsu]]|後小松天皇|''Go-Komatsu-tennō''}}&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP317&amp;dq= ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 317-318.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Court]] rival in Yoshino during this time-frame was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Kameyama]]|後亀山天皇|''Go-Kameyama-tennō}}.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[File:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]   
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Re4djF3oaTMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA199&amp;dq=1911+texbook+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology'', p. 199 n57], citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1389''', also called {{nihongo|''Kōō gannen''|康応元年}}: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Kakei'' 3.

In this time frame, [[Genchū]] (1384–1393) was the Southern Court equivalent ''nengō.''&lt;ref name="titsingh317"&gt;Titsingh, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the Kōō era==
* '''1389''' (''Kōō 1''): Dissension continues in Toki family in [[Mino Province|Mino]].&lt;ref name="a329"&gt;Ackroyd, Joyce. 1982) ''Lessons from History: The "Tokushi Yoron"'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western half of the [[Ijebu Kingdom]] in Nigeria is known as [[Remo]]. It was initially settled roughly around the second half of the 15th century and was consolidated into a major sector of the kingdom with its own dominant [[ruling family]] around the early 16th century. This is a '''list of the Akarigbo's of Remo''', who in many present day sources can also be referred to as the [[Oba (king)|Oba]] or King of Sagamu (pronounced shagamu
).

'''Louis Braille''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Louis braille.ogg|b|r|eɪ|l}}; {{IPA-fr|lwi bʁaj|lang}}; 4 January 1809 – 6 January 1852) was a [[French people|French]] educator and inventor of a system of reading and writing for use by the [[Blindness|blind]] or [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]]. His system remains virtually unchanged to this day, and is known worldwide simply as [[braille]].

Blinded in both eyes as a result of an early childhood accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles|Royal Institute for Blind Youth]]. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of [[Charles Barbier]], Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.

In adulthood, Braille served as a professor at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system. It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.

Louis Braille was born in [[Coupvray]], a small town about twenty miles east of Paris, on 4 January 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Louis Braille|url=https://www.royalblind.org/national-braille-week/about-braille/who-was-louis-braille|website=Royal Blind|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his three elder siblings – Monique Catherine (b. 1793), Louis-Simon (b. 1795), and Marie Céline (b. 1797)&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; – lived with their parents, Simon-René and Monique, on three hectares of land and vineyards in the countryside. Simon-René maintained a successful enterprise as a [[leatherer]] and maker of [[horse tack]].&lt;ref name="Weygand282"&gt;Weygand, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kugelmass13ff"&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as he could walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an [[Stitching awl|awl]]. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local physician bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to [[sympathetic ophthalmia]].&lt;ref name="Kugelmass13ff"/&gt;{{Ref|fn_a|a}}

Louis Braille survived the torment of the infection but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes.&lt;ref name="Marsan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubriques/infos_braille/actes/Louis%20Braille%20-%20a%20brief%20overview.htm |title=Louis Braille: A Brief Overview |author=Marsan, Colette |year=2009 |publisher=Association Valentin Haüy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807133757/http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubriques/infos_braille/actes/Louis%20Braille%20-%20a%20brief%20overview.htm |archivedate=7 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Magaret (1971): Louis Braille, the boy who invented books for the blind&lt;/ref&gt; His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability.&lt;ref name="Kugelmass13ff"/&gt; Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.&lt;ref name="Weygand282"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 24–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Education==
Braille studied in Coupvray until the age of ten. Because of his combination of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth,&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Book Student Discovery Encyclopedia, Vol. B2|year=2000|publisher=World Book Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-7166-7400-9|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; since renamed to the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles|National Institute for Blind Youth]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Farrell98&gt;Farrell, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haüy system===
The children were taught how to read by a system devised by the school's founder, [[Valentin Haüy]]. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who devoted his life to helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of [[Paper embossing|embossing]] heavy paper with the raised imprints of [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]]. Readers would trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.&lt;ref name=Kugelmass3738&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Braille house07.JPG|thumb|right|Bust and awl exhibit at the Braille birthplace museum in Coupvray|alt=A bust of Braille next to items in a display case]]
Braille was helped by the Haüy books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of information kept in such books was necessarily small. Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to "write" by themselves. So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather. It was a slow and cumbersome process, but the boy could at least trace the letters' outlines and write his first sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The handcrafted Haüy books all came in uncomfortable sizes and weights for children. They were laboriously constructed, very fragile, and expensive to obtain: when Haüy's school first opened, it had a total of three books.&lt;ref name=Kugelmass3738/&gt; Nonetheless, Haüy promoted their use with zeal. To him, the books presented a system which would be readily approved by educators and indeed they seemed – to the sighted – to offer the best achievable results. Braille and his schoolmates, however, could detect all too well the books' crushing limitations.&lt;ref name=Kugelmass3738/&gt; Nonetheless, Haüy's efforts still provided a breakthrough achievement – the recognition of the [[sense of touch]] as a workable strategy for sightless reading. Haüy's only personal limitation was that he was "talking to the fingers with the language of the eye."&lt;ref name=Farrell96&gt;Farrell, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher and musician===
Braille read the Haüy books repeatedly, and he was equally attentive to the oral instruction offered by the school. He proved to be a highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher's aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For much of the rest of his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.&lt;ref name=Farrell98/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olmstrom&gt;Olmstrom, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braille's ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and [[Organ (music)|organist]] in classes taught by [[Jean-Nicolas Marrigues]]. Later in life, his musical talents led him to play the organ for churches all over France. A devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]],&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the [[Church of Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs, Paris|Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uquebec.ca/musique/orgues/france/snicolascp.html |title=Église Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs |author= |language=French, English |year=2011 |publisher=Universite du Quebec |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224132503/http://www.uquebec.ca/musique/orgues/france/snicolascp.html |archivedate=24 February 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1834 to 1839, and later at the [[Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris|Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Braille system==
[[File:First version French braille code c1824.jpg|thumb|right|The first version of braille, composed for the [[French alphabet]]|alt=Letters of the alphabet printed in braille]]
Braille was determined to invent a system of reading and writing that could bridge the gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about."&lt;ref name=Olmstrom/&gt;
[[File:Comparative Lettering Hauy-Barbier-Braille.tif|thumb|right|Three forms of the letters "A" and "Z"|alt=The same two letters printed in different formats]]

===Origins===
In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain [[Charles Barbier]] of the French Army. Some sources depict Braille learning about it from a newspaper account read to him by a friend,&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt; while others say the officer, aware of its potential, made a special visit to the school.&lt;ref name=Marsan/&gt;&lt;ref name=RNIB&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/braille-and-other-tactile-codes-portal-braille-past-present-and-future/invention-braille |title=Invention of braille |year=2017 |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908083302/http://www.rnib.org.uk/braille-and-other-tactile-codes-portal-braille-past-present-and-future/invention-braille |archivedate=8 September 2017 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, Barbier willingly shared his invention called "[[night writing]]" which was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers, letting soldiers share information on the battlefield without having light or needing to speak.&lt;ref name=Farrell96/&gt; The captain's code turned out to be too complex to use in its original military form, but it inspired Braille to develop a system of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and his system was largely completed by 1824, when he was fifteen years old.&lt;ref name=Farrell98/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olmstrom/&gt; From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system [[1829 braille|in 1829]], and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.&lt;ref name=Farrell98/&gt;

Braille created his own raised-dot system by using an [[Stitching awl|awl]], the same kind of implement which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own [[slate and stylus]] tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and readable.&lt;ref name=Farrell98/&gt;

By these modest means, Braille constructed a robust communication system. "It bears the stamp of genius" wrote Dr. Richard Slating French, former director of the [[California School for the Blind]], "like the Roman alphabet itself."&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical adaptation===
The system was soon extended to include [[braille music|braille musical notation]]. Passionate about his own music, Braille took meticulous care in its planning to ensure that the musical code would be "flexible enough to meet the unique requirements of any instrument."&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, he published the first book about his system, ''Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them''. Ironically this book was first printed by the raised letter method of the Haüy system.&lt;ref name=Farrell99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubriques/actualites/actualites.php?var=titre&amp;infos=432 |title=Louis Braille 1809–1852 : un génie français |language=French |author= |year=2011 |publisher=Valentin Haüy Association |accessdate=15 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
Braille produced several written works about braille and as general education for the blind. ''Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs...'' (1829) was revised and republished in 1837;&lt;ref name=AFBbooks&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afb.org/louisbraillemuseum/braillegallery.asp?FrameID=185 |title=Books in Braille |year=2013 |publisher=American Foundation for the Blind |website=Afb.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035512/http://www.afb.org/louisbraillemuseum/braillegallery.asp?FrameID=185 |archivedate=1 December 2017 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; his mathematics guide, ''Little Synopsis of Arithmetic for Beginners'', entered use in 1838;&lt;ref name=AFBbooks/&gt; and his monograph ''New Method for Representing by Dots the Form of Letters, Maps, Geometric Figures, Musical Symbols, etc., for Use by the Blind'' was first published in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EarDmAEACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Louis+Braille%22 |title=''Nouveau procede pour representer des points la forme meme des letters, les cartes de geographie, les figures de geometrie, les caracteres de musiques, etc., a l'usage des aveugles'' |author=Braille, Louis |year=1839 |publisher=Institution royale des jeunes aveugles |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Braille's original printed works remain available at the Braille birthplace museum in Coupvray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/museo_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=M0373 |title=Maison Natale de Louis Braille |year=2013 |publisher=Culture-Acte 2 |website=Culturecommunication.gouv.fr |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630160325/http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/museo_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=M0373 |archivedate=30 June 2017 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decapoint===
''New Method for Representing by Dots...'' (1839) put forth Braille's plan for a new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people.&lt;ref name=AFBdeca&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afb.org/louisbraillemuseum/braillemediaviewer.asp?FrameID=186#main |title=Braille Invents His Code: Louis Invents Decapoint |year=2013 |publisher=American Foundation for the Blind |website=Afb.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803001017/http://www.afb.org/louisbraillemuseum/braillemediaviewer.asp?FrameID=186 |archivedate=3 August 2017 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called [[decapoint]], the system combined his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Weygand, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of decapoint, Braille gave assistance to his friend [[Pierre-François-Victor Foucault]], who was working on the development of his Raphigraphe, a device that could emboss letters in the manner of a typewriter. Foucault's machine was hailed as a great success and was exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|World's Fair]] in Paris in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Although Braille was admired and respected by his pupils, his writing system was not taught at the Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, who had died in 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school,&lt;ref name=Farrell99/&gt; and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wace|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Wace|title=Louis Braille|author2=John Peaty |page=128}} in {{cite book|title=Girl Annual No. 9|year=1961|publisher=Longacre Press|editor=Clifford Makins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braille had always been a sickly child, and his condition worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be [[tuberculosis]], dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.&lt;ref name="Marsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weygand289&gt;Weygand, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Louis Braille, Panthéon de Paris 2012-10-11.jpg|thumb|Braille's memorial in [[Panthéon, Paris|the Panthéon]]|alt=A stone bust of Braille with an audiotronic memorial plaque]]
Through the overwhelming insistence of the blind pupils, Braille's system was finally adopted by the Institute in 1854, two years after his death.&lt;ref name=Farrell99&gt;Farrell, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, pp. 26ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The system spread throughout the French-speaking world, but was slower to expand in other places. However, by the time of the first all-European conference of teachers of the blind in 1873, the cause of braille was championed by Dr. [[Thomas Rhodes Armitage]] and thereafter its international use increased rapidly. By 1882, Dr. Armitage was able to report that "There is now probably no institution in the civilized world where braille is not used except in some of those in North America."&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually even these holdouts relented: braille was officially adopted by schools for the blind in the United States in 1916, and a universal braille code for English was formalized in 1932.&lt;ref name=Reynolds318&gt;Reynolds, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

New variations in [[braille technology]] continue to grow, including such innovations as [[Refreshable Braille display|braille computer terminals]]; [[RoboBraille]] email delivery service; and [[Nemeth Braille]], a comprehensive system for mathematical and scientific notation. Almost two centuries after its invention, braille remains a system of powerful and enduring utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brailleauthority.org/article/evolution_of_braille-part1.pdf |title=The Evolution of Braille |author= |year=2011 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Braille Authority of North America]] |website=Braillauthority.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630085707/http://www.brailleauthority.org/article/evolution_of_braille-part1.pdf |archivedate=30 June 2017 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors and tributes===
The immense personal legacy of Louis Braille was described in a 1952 essay by [[T.S. Eliot]]: {{cquote|"Perhaps the most enduring honor to the memory of Louis Braille is the half-conscious honor we pay him by applying his name to the script he invented – and, in this country [England], adapting the pronunciation of his name to our own language. We honor Braille when we speak of ''braille''. His memory has in this way a security greater than that of the memories of many men more famous in their day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eliot |first=T.S. |authorlink=T.S.

Because of his accomplishments as a young boy, Braille holds a special place as a hero for children, and he has been the subject of a large number of works of juvenile literature.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=kw%3ALouis+Braille&amp;fq=mt%3Ajuv&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 ''Worldcat.org''] for a complete list of Braille-related literature for children and young adults.&lt;/ref&gt; Other appearances in the arts include the American TV special ''Young Heroes: Louis Braille'' (2010);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://deaftvchannel.com/blog/interesting-films/young-heroes-louis-braille/ |title=Young Heroes: Louis Braille |author= |year=2010 |publisher=Deaftvchannel.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222035202/http://deaftvchannel.com/blog/interesting-films/young-heroes-louis-braille/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the French TV movie ''Une lumière dans la nuit'' (2008) (released in English as ''The Secret of Braille'');&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1342341/ |title=''Une lumière dans la nuit'' (TV 2008) |author= |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=15 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dramatic play ''Braille: The Early Life of Louis Braille'' (1989) by Lola and Coleman Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Jennings |first1=Lola H. |last2=Jennings |first2=Coleman A. |title=Braille: the early life of Louis Braille|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_O3x1E2Xe8C |year=1989|publisher=Dramatic Publishing|isbn=978-1-58342-426-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In music, Braille's life was subject of the song called "''Merci, Louis''", composed by the Halifax singer-songwriter Terry Kelly, chair of the Canadian Braille Literacy Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://terry-kelly.com/special-projects/merci-louis/ |title=Terry Kelly: Merci, Louis |author= |year= |publisher=Deaftvchannel.com |accessdate=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The Braille Legacy', a musical which tells the story of Louis Braille, written by Sébastien Lancrenon and translated into English by Ranjit Bolt, debuted in the Charing Cross Theatre in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://charingcrosstheatre.co.uk/theatre/the-braille-legacy |title=The Braille Legacy |website=Charing Cross Theatre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=24em}}
* {{note|fn_a| a:}} It remains uncertain which eye was actually struck first. Most accounts of Braille's accident omit reference to left or right. Braille's American biographer J. Alvin Kugelmass wrote that it was the left eye, but C. Michael Mellor and Lennard Bickel state definitively that it was the right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Military [[globalization]]''' is defined by [[David Held]] as “the process which embodies the growing extensity and intensity of military relations among the political units of the [[world system]]. Understood as such, it reflects both the expanding network of worldwide military ties and relations, as well as the impact of [[history of military technology|key military technological innovations]] (from [[steamship]]s to [[satellite]]s), which over time, have reconstituted the world into a single [[geostrategic]] space."&lt;ref name=held&gt;David Held, Anthony McGrew, David Goldblatt &amp; Jonathan Perraton. (1999). ''Global Transformations; Politics, Economics and Culture'', Cambridge Polity Press, p 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Military globalization implies firmer integration of [[armed forces]] around the world into the global military system. For [[Robert Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye]] military globalization entails “long-distance networks of interdependence in which force, and the threat or promise of force, are employed.”&lt;ref&gt;Robert Keohane &amp; Joseph Nye. (2002). ''Power and Interdependence'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co, p 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Held&lt;ref&gt;''Global Transformations'', p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; divides the military globalization into three distinct phenomena: 

#The globalization of the war system. This refers to the “[[geopolitical]] order, [[great power]] rivalry, conflict and security relations.”
#The global system of [[arms industry|arms production]] and transfers, reflected in the global arms dynamics.
#The geo-governance of violence, “embracing the formal and informal international regulation of the acquisition, deployment and use of military force.”

All three processes above “are connected to technological development, which made them possible in the first place. The result is increasing global interdependence and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;Armin Krishnan. (2008). ''Wars as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting'', London &amp; New York: Routledge, p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of military globalization starts with the [[Age of Discovery]], when the [[European colonial empires]] began military operations on the global scale. Their "[[imperial rivalry]] led to the [[First World War]], which was the first [[global conflict]] in world history."&lt;ref&gt;''Wars as Business'', p 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Keohane dates military globalization at least from the time of the [[conquests of Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Keohane. (2002). ''Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World'', London &amp; New York: Routledge, p 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miriam Anna Leonard''' is Professor of Greek Literature and its Reception at [[University College London|University College, London]]. She is known in particular for her work on the reception of [[Greek tragedy]] in modern intellectual thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/people/full-time-staff/miriam-leonard|title=Miriam Leonard|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Leonard gained her BA, MPhil, and PhD from the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/early-modern/people/miriam-leonard|title=miriam-leonard|last=UCL|website=Early Modern Exchanges|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her PhD, ''Appropriations of antiquity in contemporary French thought'', was awarded in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anna|first=Leonard, Miriam|date=2002|title=Appropriations of antiquity in contemporary French thought|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&amp;uin=uk.bl.ethos.620479}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2007, Leonard worked in the Classics Department of [[University of Bristol]] as a lecturer in Classics and Ancient History,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Laughing_with_Medusa.html?id=oKqWQgAACAAJ|title=Laughing with Medusa: Classical Myth and Feminist Thought|last=Zajko|first=Vanda|last2=Leonard|first2=Miriam|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199274383|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she moved to [[University College London]] as a lecturer in Greek literature and its reception in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Leonard delivered her inaugural lecture on ''Tragedy and Modernity'' on 1st May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/events/2012/miriam-inaugural|title=Professor Miriam Leonard's inaugural lecture|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard's work focuses on the intellectual history of classics from the 18th century to the modern day. Her doctoral work was published as ''Athens in Paris: Ancient Greece and the Political in Post-War French Thought'' in 2005 in which she examined the Paris school of classical scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prince|first=Cashman Kerr|date=2008|title=Review of: Athens in Paris: Ancient Greece and the Political in Post-War French Thought.

Leonard has worked on the use of [[Greek tragedy]] by 19th-20th century writers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Sigmund Freud]], as a key reference for their work. Reference to Greek tragedy underpinned their use of terminology and the intellectual frameworks they constructed, for example, Nietzsche's use of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] concept in ''The Birth of Tragedy'' or Freud's introduction of the [[Oedipus complex]] in ''The Interpretation of Dreams''. Leonard contends that the continued use of Greek tragedy in modern intellectual concepts has both shaped contemporary culture and has affected modern views of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674743939|title=Tragic Modernities — Miriam Leonard {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard was awarded a [[Leverhulme Trust]] grant in 2011 for her work on ''Tragedy and modernity: from Hegel to Heidegger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/sites/default/files/imported_pdfs/awards_2011.pdf|title=Leverhulme Grants 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Leonard was awarded a [[Philip Leverhulme Prize]] in the field of Classics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/sites/default/files/imported_pdfs/2012%20prize%20winners%20+%20citations.pdf|title=Philip Leverhulme Prize 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolas Mahudel''' (1673, in [[Langres]] – 1747, in [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] [[Antiquarian|antiquary]] interested in prehistoric research. He proposed the chronological prehistoric sequence [[stone age]] - [[Bronze Age]] - [[Iron Age]]. Mahudel was for a time a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] and later in his life a [[Trappist order|Trappist]]. 

With his work ''Three Successive Ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron'' (1734), he influenced fellow antiquaries, notably [[William Borlase]] who further developed this idea.

During the 18th century still, controversy was vivid as to whether thunder-stones had been made by men or were actually [[fossil]]s. Mahudel, member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]] [http://www.aibl.fr/us/sommaire/som.html], presented several of those stones and showed that they have evidently been cut by the hand of man. "An examination of them," he said, "affords a proof of the efforts of our earliest ancestors to provide for their wants, and to obtain the necessaries of life." 

He established the stone - bronze - iron sequence after he had compared several burial sites. He noticed that graves with decayed [[urn]]s largely featured [[bronze]] items, whereas [[iron]] was found in more recent ones.

'''Oleksandr Maksymovych Sych''' (born July 16, 1964 Dert, [[Rivne oblast]]) is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] politician. He is a member of the [[Svoboda (political party)|Svoboda]] party. On 27 February 2014 he became one of two "Vice Prime Ministers" to the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine]] following the [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1986 Sych graduated from the [[Vasyl Stefanyk Subcarpathian National University]] as a history teacher and in 1999 as a lawyer. Sych is a candidate of historic sciences (2009) and a [[docent]] of the [[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nung.edu.ua/acad/ftpd/du/staff.html Професорсько-викладацький склад] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 to 1999, he was a member of the far-right [[Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]].&lt;ref name="ALEXANDER MAKSIMOVIC SYCH"&gt;{{cite web| title = ALEXANDER MAKSIMOVIC SYCH| url = http://bp.ubr.ua/profile/--95| website = UBR| date = | access-date = 31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[7th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada]] during the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]] as a member of the [[VO Svoboda]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dovidka.com.ua/user/?code=236044 Profile] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sych is a member of the [[National Organization of Scouts of Ukraine|National Scout Organization of Ukraine]] "[[Plast]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlHJKi4hWKs&amp;list=UUTvqewGx35p9FVKPKOQiTog Oleksandr Sych addressing Plast Organization with the honour of 102 years.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euromaidan and post-Ukrainian revolution===
Following [[Euromaidan]] and the removal of former Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yanukovych]], Sych was appointed to the position of Vice Prime Minister in the new Ukrainian government. He and other Svoboda cabinet ministers resigned on  12 November 2014 due to the results of the early parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name="Svoboda party members in Ukrainian government resign"/&gt;

In October 2015, the [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] police conducted a house search of Sych's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Police search apartment of former Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Oleksandr Sych| url =http://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-politics/1896604-police-search-apartment-of-former-deputy-prime-minister-of-ukraine-oleksandr-sych.html| website = Ukrinform| date = 12 October 2015| access-date = 31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Sych holds right-wing, [[nationalism|nationalist]] views, which he maintains are distinct from fascism and Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.svoboda.org.ua/news/comments/00010224/ Oleksandr Sych: The dictatorship-type fascism is the dominant way of governance of the current criminal regime] Retrieved on March 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, three Svoboda officials, including Sych registered a bill that would ban abortions in Ukraine with the only exceptions being if the pregnancy threatened a woman's life, if the pregnancy occurred through rape or if the fetus developed defects in its pathology. One of the major reasons behind the bill appears to be the demographics of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ukrainian Lawmakers Propose to Ban Abortions| url = https://globalvoices.org/2013/04/29/ukrainian-lawmakers-propose-to-ban-abortions/| website = Global Voices| date = 29 April 2013| access-date = 31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sych publicly stated that women should "lead the kind of lifestyle to avoid the risk of [[rape]], including refraining from drinking alcohol and being in controversial company", comments which, according to ''The Guardian'', attracted criticism from women's and human rights organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/who-governing-ukraine-olexander-turchynov Who exactly is governing Ukraine?] ''[[The Guardian]]'', Retrieved on March 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Private jurisdiction''' is the right of an individual or a [[Legal person|legal entity]] to establish [[Court|courts of law]]. It was prevalent during [[feudalism]].

A [[Exclusive right|franchise]], such as a [[corporation]], a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an "[[incorporeal hereditament]]". Under [[English law]] incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in [[charter]]s. 

Franchise jurisdictions included those of [[manorial court]]s, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over [[family law]]), [[borough courts]] of [[municipal corporation]]s, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.

In medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]" and [[county|counties]]. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the [[East India Company]]). 

In medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for [[trespass]] ([[tort]]) against the franchise court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12374">'''Queen Henrietta's Men''' was an important [[playing company]] or troupe of actors in [[Caroline era]] in London. At their peak of popularity, Queen Henrietta's Men were the second leading troupe of the day, after only the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]].

{{TOC right}}

==Beginnings==
The company was formed in 1625, at the start of the reign of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by theatrical impresario [[Christopher Beeston]] under royal patronage of the new queen, [[Henrietta Maria of France]]. They were sometimes called the Queen's Majesty's Comedians or other variations on their name. The company was founded after an eight-month closure of the London theatres due to [[bubonic plague]] (March to October, 1625). The [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]], then called the Queen of Bohemia's Men, had been resident at Beeston's [[Cockpit Theatre]] up to the plague closing, and provided the foundation of the new organization.

==Success==
Theatre manager Beeston had had several different companies acting in his Cockpit Theatre since he started it in 1617; it was with Queen Henrietta's Men that he achieved the level of success he desired. [[James Shirley]] became something like the house dramatist of the group; plays by [[Philip Massinger]], [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], and [[Thomas Heywood]] were also important in their repertory. The company staged revivals along with new plays; their [[1633 in literature|1633]] production of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe's]] ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' was a major success. They played ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' early in 1636.

In their 1625&amp;ndash;36 heyday, the company gave 66 performances at Court, for which they were paid £900.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
At its start, the actors of the new company came from several different troupes then active. [[Richard Perkins (17th-century actor)|Richard Perkins]] had been with [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]] and briefly (1623&amp;ndash;25) with the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. His success as Barabas in ''The Jew of Malta'' cemented his reputation as a great tragic actor. [[William Robbins (actor)|William Robbins]] also came from what had been Queen Anne's Men (it was generally called the Revels company, or simply the Red Bull company, after the 1619 death of [[Anne of Denmark]]).  Robbins was the company's leading comic actor through the first phase of its existence.

William Shearlock and [[Anthony Turner (actor)|Anthony Turner]] were other prominent members; they were holdovers from the Lady Elizabeth's company. (The new company inherited that troupe's plays as well as its actors, works like [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[The Tragedy of Chabot, Admiral of France|Chabot]]'', Massinger's ''[[The Renegado]]'', and Shirley's ''[[Love Tricks]].'') Shearlock must have been a man of girth, since he performed the fat-man role of Lodam in Shirley's ''[[The Wedding (1629 play)|The Wedding]]''.  Apart from his other roles, Turner played a kitchen maid in Part 1 of [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', one of the few cases in which a mature actor, rather than a [[boy player]] or a young man, is known to have played a female role.

In addition, the company included [[William Allen (actor)|William Allen]], [[Theophilus Bird]] (or Bourne), [[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]], [[John Sumner (17th-century actor)|John Sumner]], and [[Michael Bowyer]]. Bowyer handled leading-man roles; Hugh Clark was a boy player taking female roles, who later switched to adult male parts. Bird also played female roles for the company; he later married Beeston's daughter and was a successful actor both before and after the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]]. Allen and Sumner took significant supporting parts.

Six cast lists survive from five of the company's plays: from ''The Renegado,'' ''The Wedding'', [[Robert Davenport (dramatist)|Robert Davenport]]'s ''[[King John and Matilda]]'', [[Thomas Nabbes]]'s ''[[Hannibal and Scipio]]'', and from both parts of Heywood's two-part ''Fair Maid of the West''.  Two actors, Allen and Bowyer, appear on all six lists, and five more, Clark, Perkins, Shearlock, Sumner, and Turner, appear on five &amp;mdash; arguably a good indication of their durability and importance to the troupe.

Additional personnel included:&lt;ref&gt;Nunzeger, pp. 25, 46-7, 50-1, and ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Robert Axell played roles in ''Hannibal and Scipio'', both parts of ''Fair Maid'', and perhaps ''King John'' too.
* John Blaney was a boy player in the [[Children of the Chapel]] when he appeared in [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicene]]'' in 1609. After a stint with [[Queen Anne's Men]], he played Asambeg in ''The Renegado''.
* Ezekiel Fenn played Sophonisba in ''Hannibal'' in 1635. In 1639 [[Henry Glapthorne]] published a poem, "For Ezekiel Fenn at his First Acting a Man's Part."
* Christopher Goad played with the company before moving to the [[King's Revels Men]] around 1635.
* John Page, like Bird, Clark, and Fenn, moved from female roles (as in ''The Wedding'') to male (''Hannibal and Scipio'').
* [[Timothy Read]] was as early member (he was in ''The Wedding''); after a period with the King's Revels Men, he returned for ''[[The English Moor]]'' c. 1637.
* Edward Rogers played women's roles in ''The Wedding'' and ''The Renegado'', but then disappeared from the surviving records.
* George Stutfield pursued his career with several companies in the 1620s and '30s, including Queen Anne's Men and [[Prince Charles's Men]].
* William Wilbraham played in ''The Wedding'' and ''Fair Maid''. Like Goad, he later moved on to the King's Revels troupe. Surprisingly for a rather obscure actor, Wilbraham appears to have prospered: in 1640 he was able to lend £150 to Elizabeth Beeston, widow of Christopher &amp;mdash; a loan secured by a mortgage on the Cockpit Theatre.
* [[Michael Mohun]] and [[Andrew Pennycuicke]] also served with the troupe as boy actors; [[William Cartwright (actor)|William Cartwright]] and [[William Wintershall]] may have been  members too.

==Change==
In 1636 the company had a falling-out of some nature with their founder and manager, and moved to the rival [[Salisbury Court Theatre]]. Beeston had a reputation for breaking up theatre companies when it was in his interest to do so, as a way of maintaining control over recalcitrant and unruly actors; [[Philip Henslowe]] was accused of similar tactics in the previous generation. The mid-1630s was another difficult period for the theatrical profession, with a long theatre closure due to plague (May 1636 to October 1637). The Queen Henrietta's company split apart during this time; but it was reconstituted in October 1637, with veterans Perkins, Sherlock, Turner, and Sumner, at the Salisbury Court. According to his own testimony, Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], was actively involved in rebuilding the Queen Henrietta's company; he apparently had a financial interest in the Salisbury Court Theatre.

(As for other troupe members: Axell, Bird, Fenn, Page, and Stutfield stayed at the Cockpit to join [[Beeston's Boys]], the new group founded by Beeston. Four other members disappear from the scanty records of the later 1630s: Allen, Bowyer, Clark, and Robbins may have travelled with James Shirley to [[Dublin]], and worked at the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]] there.)&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, pp. 149-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebuilt company retained the queen's name and patronage. On 6 March 1640, Turner collected £80 in the company's name for seven Court performances in 1638 and 1639. The company lasted until [[London theatre closure 1642|the theatres closed in September 1642]] at the start of the [[English Civil War]].

Nineteen of the fifty-one works on the list are the work of James Shirley, the company's house dramatist through much of its existence.

==Aftermath==
The company ended when the London theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the [[English Civil War]]. Some of its personnel (Anthony Turner, Michael Mohun, and Theophilus Bird are examples) resurfaced as members of the newly formed [[King's Company]] when the theatres re-opened in 1660. The King's Company also inherited a good portion of the repertory of Queen Henrietta's Men, including plays by Shirley, Brome, and Heywood.

'''Sandra Lorraine Coney''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO}} (born 22 October 1944) is a New Zealand local body politician, writer, [[feminist]], [[historian]], and women's health campaigner.

==Activist career==
She is best known for her co-authorship (with [[Phillida Bunkle]]) of a ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]'' magazine article that alleged that women had been experimented on, without their consent, at [[National Women's Hospital]] in [[Auckland]]. The article, titled 'The Unfortunate Experiment', led to the controversial [[Cartwright Inquiry]], which confirmed the article's allegations. The article and the subsequent inquiry are seen as a turning point in healthcare ethics in New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Coney has been involved in other women's health causes, and in 1984 co-founded with Bunkle [[Women's Health Action]] to co-ordinate claims by women who had been injured by the [[Dalkon Shield]] [[IUD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everybody.co.nz/page-9b60454c-4546-432a-8003-827ca58ec4b2.aspx Women's Health Action – Everybody – Health Information for New Zealanders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408055716/http://www.everybody.co.nz/page-9b60454c-4546-432a-8003-827ca58ec4b2.aspx |date=8 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coney was the co-founder of the feminist magazine ''[[Broadsheet (magazine)|Broadsheet]]'', which she co-edited for 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Jeremy |title=Influential Kiwis talk about their Influences |url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ideas/20091206 |accessdate=7 May 2014 |newspaper=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the author or editor of 14 books, including the major Suffrage Centennial publication ''Standing in the Sunshine'' (1993), which was also a television series. She wrote a regular column of political and social comment for the Sunday-Times for 16 years from 1986.

She is also involved in the local politics of the [[Piha]] area such as the unsuccessful campaign against the Piha cafe. She has also written an history of Piha, and is currently researching [[Anzac]] soldiers from the Piha area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/arc/about-arc/meet-the-councillors/sandra-coney.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202165318/http://arc.govt.nz/arc/about-arc/meet-the-councillors/sandra-coney.cfm |archivedate=2 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=0000D672-5BE3-1628-96FF83027AF1010E | work=The New Zealand Herald | title=NZ Herald: New Zealand's Latest News, Business, Sport, Weather, Travel, Technology, Entertainment, Politics, Finance, Health, Environment and Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also professor in Faculty of Political Science of University of Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Writings on Islam==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2012}}
Trifković is the author of ''Sword of the Prophet: The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam'', a book about the history and tenets of Islam which identifies the rise of Islamic fundamentalism as the greatest danger to Western values since the end of the Cold War. According to [[James Bissett]], former Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia and a close associate of Trifković, Trifković sees the source of this threat in the absence of separation of church and state under Islam -  because Islam is a way of life, Muslims are required to subordinate themselves to the teachings of Allah and live as members of the total Islamic community, calling into question their ability to give their political loyalty to a non-Muslim state. Trifković considers this to be a particularly important issue for the countries of Western Europe, with a population of over 50 million Muslims, and the United States (approx. 3.3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/06/a-new-estimate-of-the-u-s-muslim-population/|title=A new estimate of the US Muslim population}}&lt;/ref&gt; million).

==Refusal of admission to Canada==
In February 2011, Canadian authorities refused to allow Trifković entry into Canada to address a meeting at the [[University of British Columbia]] at Vancouver.&lt;ref name="Chronicles 25.2.2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New American 1.3.2011"&gt;[http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/10630-canada-ejects-serbian-american-scholar-stops-speech-at-university "Canada Ejects Serbian-American Scholar, Stops Speech At University"] by R. Cort Kirkwood, ''[[The New American]]'', 1 March 2011, accessed 3 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Trifković reported in the journal ''[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]]'' that he was refused entry to Canada on 24 February 2011 on the "transparently spurious" grounds that he was "inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for being a [[Prescribed senior official|proscribed senior official]] in the service of a government that, in the opinion of the minister, engages or has engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations, or genocide, a war crime or a crime against humanity within the meaning of subsections 6 (3) to (5) of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act."&lt;ref name="Chronicles 25.2.2011"&gt;[http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/2011/02/25/banned-from-canadistan "Banned from Canadistan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310103912/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/2011/02/25/banned-from-canadistan/ |date=10 March 2011 }}, ''Chronicles Magazine'', 25 February 2011], accessed 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed his "inadmissibility" was due to contacts with the [[Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb]] leaders in the early 1990s but claimed that the Canadian authorities' grounds for refusing him admission were "transparently spurious" and they had in fact yielded to a Bosniak-inspired campaign against him.&lt;ref name="Chronicles 25.2.2011"/&gt; The Canadian Institute for the Research of Genocide alleged that Trifković was promoting hatred, [[antisemitism]] and [[Islamophobia]] and accused him of publicly denying what ''New American'' termed the "alleged" massacre of Bosniaks at [[Srebrenica genocide|Srebrenica]] in July 1995, found by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] to be a crime of genocide.&lt;ref name="New American 1.3.2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|FhKkv0Ezd6w|CTV News clip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Army of One'') starring [[Dolph Lundgren]] and [[George Segal]]. ''Joshua Tree'' was directed by [[Academy Award]] and [[Bafta]] winning [[stunt double|stuntman]] [[Vic Armstrong]].

His novel ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'' was made into a 2000 [[film]] starring [[Matt Damon]] as the golf pro and [[Will Smith]] as his spiritual [[guide]].

Pressfield also appeared as one of the historians in [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s 2007 documentary ''[[Last Stand of the 300]]'' and a commentator on an episode of the History Channel’s ''Decisive Battles'' series featuring Alexander the Great on July 30, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeknewsonline.com/steven-pressfield-exploring-ancient-greece-through-fiction/|title=Steven Pressfield: Exploring Ancient Greece through Fiction|work=greeknewsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tarbelli''' were an [[Aquitani]] pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tribe settled in what today is southwestern [[France]], in the region between the river [[Adour]] and the [[Pyrenees]]. The capital of the Tarbelli people was ''Aquae Tarbellicae'', present-day [[Dax, Landes|Dax]]. They were the ancient inhabitants of [[Labourd]], in the [[Northern Basque Country]], in the present-day [[France|French]] [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]].

Their historical territory today corresponds very well with the extension of the [[Lapurdian dialect]] of the [[Basque language]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Tarbelli, like all other Aquitanians, spoke an archaic form of the Basque language, known as [[Aquitanian language]], whose dialects are unknown.

== History ==

The Tarbelli are mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors; [[Julius Caesar]] names them ''Tarbelli quatuorsignani'', "Tarbelli of the four banners", which means the Tarbelli were actually a confederacy of four different tribes. They lived in small territory in what today is the southwest of [[France]], between the river [[Adour]] and the [[Pyrenees]], this region being the traditional province of [[Labourd]], of the [[Northern Basque Country]].

Their capital city was ''Aquae Tarbellicae'', present-day [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], with [[Orthez]] being also an important Tarbelli city. They are presumably related to other Aquitani tribes, as the [[Vascones]], among others. During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, the Tarbelli territory was part of a greater region called ''[[Novempopulania]]''.

'''Woolstenhulmes &amp; Rye''' was a company that manufactured [[stationary steam engine]]s.  It was based in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]].  The company produced large steam-driven engines for [[Cotton mill|textile mills]] in Oldham and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=GH15&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Abraham Seville &amp; Co''' started business in 1821 in [[Mumps, Oldham]] as roller makers for textile machinery. By 1828, William Woolstenhulme had enterered the business, they had moved to the Lower Moor Ironworks and were spindle makers, iron and brass founders. The name was changed to '''Seville and Woolstenhulme'''. The business expanded and by 1846 they were employing 250 workers and were manufacturing [[Spinning mule#Roberts' self-acting mule|self-acting mules]] and [[power loom]]s. In 1854 they exhibited a 12&amp;nbsp;hp steam engine.&lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;

William Rye, an engineer from Manchester, entered the business in 1840 and married the senior partner's daughter in 1842. When Seville retired in 1855, Rye took the partnership. The firm became '''Woolstenhulme &amp; Rye'''. About this time they closed the machine-making side of the business and concentrated on producing steam engines for the mills. Rye was [[mayor]] of Oldham in 1868. He was responsible for construction of Albert's Mount housing in [[Derker]]. The company was incorporated in 1873.&lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;

Woolstenhulme &amp; Rye engines are said to be conservative in design, and although Gurr &amp; Hunt claim that there was no evidence that the company had ever used [[Corliss engine|Corliss valves]], in his Black Book engine list, Arthur Roberts documents their use in Parkfield Mill. This engine was a 1,200-hp [[cross-compound engine]]. It had a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} HP (high pressure) cylinder, {{convert|40|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} LP (low pressure) cylinder, with a {{convert|6|ft|adj=on}} stroke. It was steamed at 140&amp;nbsp;psi. The {{convert|18|ft|adj=on}} flywheel ran at 52&amp;nbsp;rpm. Transmission was by a geared drive. There were Corliss valves on the HP cylinder and [[slide valve]]s on the LP, in fact a classic Lancashire configuration. The air pump was driven by a [[bell crank]] from the LP tail rod.&lt;ref name=AR&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--'air pump' and 'tail rod' need links to a glossary -- see Talk:Steam engine--&gt;

==Mills driven by their engines==
Woolstenhulme &amp; Rye produced mill engines in the 1860s, but their principal period of production was in the 1870s, when they produced 17 engines giving a total of 10,970&amp;nbsp;[[ihp]], and in the 1880s, when they made 22 engines giving 11,000&amp;nbsp;ihp, before they fell into financial difficulties and were liquidated in 1888.&lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;

{{History of Israel}}

The term '''Yinon Plan''' refers to an article published in February 1982 in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] journal ''Kivunim'' ("Directions") entitled 'A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yinon|1982b|pp=49–59}}: ''Estrategiah le-Yisrael bi-Shnot ha-Shmonim.''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kivunim'' was a quarterly periodical{{sfn|Karmi|2007|p=27}} dedicated to the study of [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]] which appeared between 1978 and 1987,{{sfn|Bernstein|2012|p=13}} and was published by the [[World Zionist Organization]]'s department of Information in [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Chomsky|1999|p=471 n.19}} The article was penned by Oded Yinon, reputedly a former advisor to [[Ariel Sharon]],{{sfn|Talal|1984|p=118}} a former senior official with the [[Israeli Foreign Ministry]]{{sfn|Primakov|2009|p=201}}{{sfn|Legrain|2013|p=266, n.19}}{{sfn|Masalha|2000|p=94}}{{sfn|Feeley|2010|p=79}} and journalist for ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.{{sfn|Sleiman|2014|p=94}}

It is cited as an early example of characterizing political projects in the [[Middle East]] in terms of a logic of [[Sectarianism|sectarian divisions]].{{sfn|Legrain|2013|p=266 n.19}} It has played a role in both conflict resolution analysis by scholars who regard it as having influenced the formulation of policies adopted by the American administration under [[George W. Bush]],{{sfn|Becker|Polkinghorn|2017|p=148}} and also in conspiracy theories according to which the article either predicted or planned major political events in the Middle East since the 1980s, including the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the overthrowing of [[Saddam Hussein]], the [[Syrian Civil War]] and the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]. The claim has been made that Yinon's article was adopted by members of the [[Institute for Zionist Strategies]] in the American administration until it was putatively taken up as a way to further American interests in the Middle East, as well as achieving the Jewish dream of a [[Greater Israel|state "from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates"]], encompassing the majority of the Middle East, as written in the [[Hebrew Bible]].{{sfn|Cohen Tzemach|2016}}

==Argument of the paper==
Yinon argues that the world was witnessing a new epoch in history without precedent, which required both the development of a fresh perspective and an operational strategy to implement it. The [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist foundations]] of [[Western civilization]] were in a state of collapse.{{sfn|Yinon|1982b|pp=49–59}} The West was disintegrating before the combined onslaught of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Third World]], a phenomenon he believed was accompanied by an upsurge in [[anti-Semitism]], all of which meant that Israel would become the last safe haven for [[Jewish diaspora|Jews]] to seek refuge in.{{sfn|Chomsky|1999|p=456}} The Muslim Arab world circling Israel had been arbitrarily sliced up into 19 ethnically heterogeneous states by imperial powers, France and Great Britain,{{sfn|Labévière|2000|p=206}} and was just a 'temporary house of cards put together by foreigners' - the notion that [[pan-Arabism]] was a house of cards doomed to collapse had been already argued by [[Fouad Ajami]] some years earlier{{sfn|Ali|1990|p=29}} - composed of mutually hostile ethnic minorities and majorities, that, once disintegrated into, in Ahmad's interpretation, [[Feudalism|feudal]] tribal [[fiefdom]]s, would no longer challenge Israel.{{sfn|Ahmad|2014|p=83}} Centrifugal factors would give rise to a dynamic of fragmentation that, while highly perilous, would offer Israel opportunities it had failed to exploit in 1967.{{sfn|Labévière|2000|p=206}}

He then proceeds to analyze the weaknesses of Arab countries, by citing what he perceives to be flaws in their national and social structures, concluding that Israel should aim to bring about the fragmentation of the Arab world into a mosaic of ethnic and [[Confession (religion)|confessional]] groupings.{{sfn|Masalha|2000|p=94}} 'Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation,' he argued, would prove to be advantageous to Israel in the short term.{{sfn|Heard|2006}} He saw contemporary events in Lebanon as a foreshadowing of future developments overall throughout the Arab world. The upheavals would create a precedent for guiding Israeli short-term and long-term strategies. Specifically, he asserted that the immediate aim of policy should be the dissolution of the military capabilities of Arab states east of Israel, while the primary long-term goal should work towards the formation of unique areas defined in terms of [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnonational]] and [[Religious identity|religious identities]].{{sfn|Tilley|2010|pp=107–108}}

==Blueprint for the Middle East==
===Egypt===
Yinon thought the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]], the peace agreement signed by [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Anwar Sadat]], to be mistaken. One of Israel's aims for the 1980s would be, Yinon claimed, the dismemberment of Egypt, a country he described as a "corpse", in order to reestablish the [[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]], when Israel had controlled the [[Sinai Peninsula]].{{sfn|Chomsky|1999|p=456}} Yinon hoped to see the formation of a [[Copts|Christian Coptic state]] on Egypt's northern borders. Yinon pinned the expectations on a rapid Israeli re-invasion of the Sinai triggered by a future rupture by Egypt of the American-brokered terms of peace, something which, under [[Hosni Mubarak]], failed to eventuate.{{sfn|Heard|2006}}

===Jordan and the West Bank===
In his account of Russian foreign policy and the Arabs, [[Yevgeny Primakov]] contextualizes Yinon's paper in terms of the content of what former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], stated in testimony in August before the U.S. Senate's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs Committee]]. Ball, discussing the [[1982 Lebanon War|second Israeli invasion of Lebanon]]{{sfn|Sleiman|2014|p=94}} earlier in June, referred to conversations with [[Ariel Sharon]], in which Sharon reportedly stated that his long-term strategy consisted of "squeezing the Palestinians out of the West Bank..allowing only enough of them to remain for work."{{sfn|Primakov|2009|p=201}} Yinon's paper suggested that Israeli policy, both in war and peace, should aim for one objective: 'the liquidation of Jordan' as ruled by the [[Hashemites|Hashemite Kingdom]], together with increased Palestinian migration from the [[West Bank]] into eastern Jordan.{{sfn|Primakov|2009|p=201}}{{sfn|Heard|2006}} The dissolution of Jordan, Yinon thought, would bring an end to the problem of the existence of dense concentrations of [[Palestinians]] in the [[Palestinian territories]] Israel had conquered in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, allowing them to be spirited away into that former kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Ahmad|2014|p=82}}

===Lebanon===
Yinon's paper fed an old Lebanese [[conspiracy theory]] against its territorial integrity going back to 1943, according to which the country was to be [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantonized]] along [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist lines]]. In particular during the 1970s{{sfn|Sleiman|2014|pp=76–77}} the idea took wing and, especially after [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war broke out in Lebanon in 1975]], came to be associated with the figure of [[Henry Kissinger]] whose Middle East diplomacy was thought to be greatly detrimental to Lebanese interests, and who was rumoured to be planning the partition of Lebanon into two states.{{sfn|Sleiman|2014|p=77}}

===Iraq===
Yinon considered Iraq, with its oil wealth, to be Israel's greatest threat. He believed that the [[Iran–Iraq War]] would split up Iraq, whose dissolution should be a strategic Israeli aim, and he envisaged the emergence of three ethnic centres, of [[Shiites]] governing from [[Basra]], the [[Sunni]] from [[Baghdad]], and the [[Kurds]] with a capital in [[Mosul]], each area run along the lines of [[Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire|the administrative divisions]] of the former [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Heard|2006}}

==Reactions==
===Contemporary reception===
An English translation by [[Israel Shahak]] soon appeared in the [[Journal of Palestine Studies]].{{sfn|Haddad|1985|p=116 n.18}}{{sfn|Yinon|1982a|pp=209–214}} [[Israel Shahak]] in the foreword to his translation interpreted the plan as both a fantasy and a faithful reflection of the strategy being developed by [[Ariel Sharon]] and [[Rafael Eitan]], and drew parallels with both the [[Lebensraum|geopolitical ideas]] that flourished in Germany from 1890 to 1933, later adopted by Hitler and applied to [[Eastern Europe]],{{sfn|Shahak|Yinon|1982|p=v}} and modern [[Conservatism in the United States|American neoconservative thinking]], which influenced Yinon, to gather from the sources cited in his notes.{{sfn|Shahak|Yinon|1982|pp=iii, v}} It was, it has been argued, Shahak's English translation which catapulted Yinon into the public limelight.{{sfn|Becker|Polkinghorn|2017|p=148}}

According to William Haddad, the publication of the article caused a sensation at the time.{{sfn|Haddad|1985|p=104}} Haddad notes that the American syndicated columnist [[Joseph Kraft]], a month later, echoed Yinon's ideas in an article that Syria would implode into confessional fragments composed of [[Alawite]], [[Druze]] and Sunni communities were the country to be occupied after an Israeli invasion, and that such an event should cause reverberations throughout the Arab world, resulting in a reconfiguration of ethnic microstates guaranteed to introduce an era of peace. The idea was dismissed at the time.{{sfn|Haddad|1985|p=104}} Yinon's article drew several other responses, and was reviewed in [[Newsweek]] (26 July 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;32) and [[the Wall Street Journal]] (8 December 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;34).{{sfn|Helms|1990|p=48}}{{sfn|Peleg|2012|p=310 n.56}} [[Amos Elon]] reviewed the essay for [[Haaretz]] and worried that American commentators on Israel were turning a blind eye to the kind of irrational attitudes evinced by Yinon's article. Those who did point out such tendencies within Israeli politics were subjected to defamation.{{sfn|Chomsky|1999|p=456}} David Waines, reviewing the essay for the [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], contextualized it in terms of two other works appearing in the same year as Yinon's essay, a collection edited by [[Ibrahim Abu-Lughod]] and a book by Michael J. Cohen on American, British and Zionist long-term regional policies, both arguing such policies were dictated solely by a [[realpolitik]] insouciant of Palestinian grievances. In the light of the immediate instance of [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel's invasion of Lebanon]] in that same year, Waines concluded that all three pieces created a 'grave apprehension about present and future developpments in the Middle East.'{{sfn|Waines|1984|pp=418–420}}

An article published in 1983 on the monthly publication of the [[Matzpen|Socialist Organisation in Israel]], ''Matzpen'', claimed the article exposes the minds behind Israel's foreign polcy. To such claims, Yinon responded in an interview to the anti-establishment, weekly newspaper "''[[HaOlam HaZeh]]''", claiming he is not a fan or a friend of Israel's leaders at the time, including Ariel Sharon and [[Menachem Begin]], nor does he supports them. Yinon also claimed that an article, similar to his, was published in a left-wing newspaper of the [[Kibbutz Movement]] ''Mi'Befnim''.{{sfn|Matzpen|1983}}

The French philosopher, convert to Islam, and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], [[Roger Garaudy]], who was married to a Palestinian woman, used the text the following year in the English version of his book, ''L'Affaire Israël: le sionisme politique'', to support his argument that a mechanism was in place to drive Arabs out of what was defined as [[Eretz Israel]] and disintegrate Arab countries.{{sfn|Garaudy|1983|p=133}} Jordan's [[Prince Hassan bin Talal]] outlined its contents in a book on peace prospects,{{sfn|Talal|1984|p=118}} in 1984, as did Christine Moss Helms in a [[Brookings Institution]] study.{{sfn|Helms|1984|p=54}}

===Later interpretations===
[[Yehoshafat Harkabi]] appraised Yinon's analysis of the weakness of Arab states as generally correct while expressing doubts about the suggestion Israel should actively work towards their dissolution.  If their fragmentation is inevitable, he asked, why would it be necessary for Israel to interfere?{{sfn|Harkabi|1989|p=58}} [[Ralph Schoenman]] argued that its [[Divide and rule|divide et īmpera]] principle followed 'the time-honoured imperial pattern'.{{sfn|Schoenman|1988|pp=103,112–113}}

[[Mordechai Nisan]], like Haddad, notes that it made waves, stirring both curiosity and wrath, the latter since it fed into regional suspicions that Israel was intent on [[Balkanization|"balkanizing"]] the neighbourhood. Nisan thought the regional outcry both exaggerated and incredulous: Yinon's apparent suggestion that Israel adopt an interventionist role to abet the fragmentation of Arab states the author thought inevitable, he added, served to create an impression that Israel was engaged in a sinister plot, when the views expressed were Yinon's alone, and did not represent Israeli government policy.{{sfn|Nisan|2002|pp=275–276,332 notes 14,15}}

Ilan Peleg described it as 'an authentic mirror of the thinking mode of the Israeli Right at the height of Begin's rule.'{{sfn|Peleg|2012|p=43}} [[Noam Chomsky]] made a more nuanced analysis of the historical context: the views espoused by Yinon were to be dissociated from the official Zionist mainstream outlook of that time, in embodying 'ideological and geopolitical fantasies' that could be identified with the line developed by the ultranationalist [[Tehiya|Tehiya political party]], created in 1979. Nonetheless, an argument could be made, he continues, that part of the mainstream of [[Labour Zionism]] in his view had entertained similar ideas. Chomsky cites in support of this [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s strategy when the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|State of Israel was founded]] of crushing Syria and the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], annexing southern Lebanon while leaving its northern residue to [[Maronites|Maronite Christians]], and bombing Egypt if it were to put up resistance. Chomsky warned against complacency about these fringe ideas since, he argued: '(t)he entire [[history of Zionism]] and later that of Israel, particularly since 1967, is one of gradual shift towards the positions of those formerly regarded as right-wing extremists.'{{sfn|Chomsky|1999|p=456-457}}

[[Virginia Tilley]] argues that there was a strong tension between the US as a global hegemon relying on strong regional state systems, and Israel's interests in a weak state system in the Middle East beyond its borders on the other hand. In this context she cites Yinon's views as spelling out the latter logic, but specifies that they were not quite unique at that time, since [[Ze'ev Schiff]] writing in Haaretz in the same month, 5 February 1982, had asserted that Israel's geostrategic interests would be best served by the fragmentation of Iraq, for example, into a tripartite entity consisting of Shiite and Sunni states hived off from a northern Kurdish reality.{{sfn|Tilley|2010|pp=107–111; 250 note 19}}

[http://gulfnews.com/opinion/thinkers/linda-s-heard Linda S. Heard], writing for [[CounterPunch]] in 2006, reviewed recent policies under [[George W. Bush]] such as the [[war on terror]], and events in the Middle East from the [[Iran–Iraq War]] to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Invasion of Iraq in 2003]], and concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one thing that we do know. Oded Yinon's 1982 "Zionist Plan for the Middle East" is in large part taking shape. Is this pure coincidence? Was Yinon a gifted psychic? Perhaps! Alternatively, we in the West are victims of a long-held agenda not of our making and without doubt not in our interests.{{sfn|Heard|2006}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Canadian economist [[Michel Chossudovsky]] on his website Global Research reproduced Shahak's translation in April 2013, arguing that it threw light for the concept of a [[Greater Israel]] in the policies of the [[Likud]]-led government coalition led by [[Binjamin Netanyahu]] and circles within the Israeli military and intelligence establishment.{{sfn|Chossudovsky|2015}}

In 2017, Ted Becker, former Walter Meyer Professor of Law at [[New York University]] and Brian Polkinghorn, distinguished professor of [[Conflict Analysis]] and [[Dispute Resolution]] at [[Salisbury University]], argued that Yinon's plan was adopted and refined in a 1996 policy document entitled ''[[A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm]]'', written by a research group at the Israeli-affiliated [[Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies]] in Washington. The group was directed by [[Richard Perle]], who, some years later, became one of the key figures in the formulation of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War strategy]] adopted during the administration of [[George W. Bush]] in 2003.{{sfn|Becker|Polkinghorn|2017|p=148}}

Both Becker and Polkinhorn admit that avowed enemies of Israel in the Middle East take the sequence of events—Israel's occupation of the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], its [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|encirclement of Gaza]], the invasion of Lebanon, [[Operation Opera|its bombing of Iraq]], [[Israeli involvement in the Syrian Civil War|airstrikes in Syria]] and [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict|its attempts at containing Iran's nuclear capacities]]—when read in the light of the Yinon Plan and the ''Clean break'' analysis, to be proof that Israel is engaged in a modern version of [[The Great Game]], with the backing of Zionist currents in the American [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] movements. They also conclude that [[Likud|Likud Party]] appears to have implemented both plans.{{sfn|Becker|Polkinghorn|2017|pp=148–149}}

'''Yuri Vsevolodovich Doykov'''  ({{lang-ru|Юрий Всеволодович Дойков}}) (born 1955) is a Russian historian.

==Biography==
Yuri Doykov was born on July 20, 1955 in [[Arkhangelsk]], at that time in the [[USSR]]. In 1988 he took a [[Ph.D.]] in Science in Russian History at [[Leningrad University]]. Since 1991, he has worked as an independent scholar in Arkhangelsk, specializing in Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. He publishes a newsletter, ''Yuri Doykov's Daily'', which started in 2011.

2. “This is the odyssey of the Russian narodnik-syndicalist and popularizer of cooperatives, Andrei Andreevich Evdokimov. The author does a good job of bringing to light little-known information about his subject.
