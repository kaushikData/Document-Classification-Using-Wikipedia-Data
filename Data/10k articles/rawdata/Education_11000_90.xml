      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">The '''100 Classrooms program''' was a joint project by [[Deutsche Welle]] and [[Cap Anamur]] to build and restore classrooms in [[Afghanistan]] after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of 2001]]. Beginning June 13, 2003, the program helped to build nearly 300 classrooms and 32 schools.

Schools were built in [[Novobad]], [[Jamchi]], [[Yanqiqala]], [[Laclacond]], [[Sardcomar]] and Baharak. Classrooms were approximately 40 square meters, meant to accommodate 30 to 40 students. Local leaders were required to agree that the schools be open to both boys and girls, that recreation areas would be co-ed, and that teachers would be paid by the local communities.

The project was funded by donations from around the world, totaling more than €380,000.

'''AUSL''' ('''Academy for Urban School Leadership''') is a Chicago nonprofit school management organization founded in 2001. Today, it manages 31 [[Chicago Public Schools]] serving more than 16,000 students. Over 1,045 teachers have graduated from the AUSL Chicago Teacher Residency.&lt;ref&gt;"About AUSL" http://auslchicago.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Former Chicago Public Schools (CPS) President [[Arne Duncan]] met with financier Martin Koldyke and CPS educator Dr. Donald Feinstein and developed the idea of creating a specialized training program for teachers in urban schools. That led to the development of the Chicago Teacher Residency.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of AUSL" http://auslchicago.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago Teacher Residency Program==
[[File:Chicago Teacher Residency Class of 2012.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|The Chicago Teacher Residency Class of 2012]]
The centerpiece of AUSL's efforts is the '''Chicago Teacher Residency''' program, a year-long urban teacher training program in Chicago's Public Schools. The 12-month, full-time, paid training program combines teacher preparation, licensure, and a master's degree.

After the training year, graduates commit to teach in an AUSL-managed [[Chicago Public School]] for at least four years.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Teacher Residency" http://auslchicago.org/residency&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network of Schools==
[[File:AUSL Network of Schools Map.png|alt=AUSL Network of Schools Map|thumb|330x330px|AUSL Network of Schools Map]]
AUSL manages 31 [[Chicago Public Schools]] serving over 16,000 students. AUSL schools operate within the CPS system.&lt;ref&gt;"AUSL Schools" http://auslchicago.org/schools&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Chicago Academy Building.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|The Chicago Academy, housed in the former [[Wilbur Wright College]] building, is AUSL’s first teacher training site.]]

==Results==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
* U.S. News &amp; World Report Education ranked Chicago Academy High School in the top ten best public high schools in the city of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;"Illinois High Schools" https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/illinois/rankings?name=&amp;schooltypepublic=y&amp;schooltypemagnet=y&amp;state=il&amp;county=Chicago&amp;schooltypecharter=y&lt;/ref&gt;
* Morton School of Excellence has maintained Level 1 status since school year 2010-11.  In 2012, Morton School of Excellence surpassed the district ISAT average, the first school to achieve this milestone.&lt;ref&gt;"2013 Elementary School Performance Policy Report" http://schoolreports.cps.edu/PerformancePolicyReport/Performance_Policy_2013_schlid_ES_610257.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2013, Phillips Academy High School achieved Level 1 status for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;"2013 High School Performance Policy Report" http://schoolreports.cps.edu/PerformancePolicyReport/Performance_Policy_2013_schlid_HS_609727.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every year since 2008, AUSL elementary schools, on average, have surpassed the district's growth on ISAT gains.&lt;ref&gt;"AUSL School Results" http://auslchicago.org/schools/results&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Research===
[[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration#Consortium on Chicago School Research|The University of Chicago Consortium on Chicago School Research]] and [[American Institutes for Research]] in 2012 released a summary from their independent research evaluating the effect of reform including AUSL schools&lt;ref&gt;"Turning Around Low-Performing Schools in Chicago" February 2012 http://ccsr.uchicago.edu/publications/turning-around-low-performing-schools-chicago&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded the following:
* Four years after intervention, the gap in test scores between reformed elementary/middle schools and the school system average closed by almost half in reading and by two-thirds in mathematics.
* The teacher workforce after intervention across all models was more likely to be white, younger, and less experienced, and were more likely to have provisional certification than teachers who were at those schools before the intervention.
* Without intervention, the comparison neighborhood schools saw minimal to no increases in average test scores.
* Furthermore, these significant results were achieved serving the same students as before intervention.
* Transformation of an elementary school is a process, not an event. The gains seen in the fourth year vs. the comparison schools are higher than those seen in the first year.
* High schools that underwent reform did not show significant improvements in absences or ninth grade on-track-to-graduate rates over matched comparison schools, but recent high school efforts look more promising than earlier ones.

==Criticism==

A [[Chicago Tribune]] article on AUSL from February 2012 entitled "School reform organization gets average grades"
&lt;ref&gt;"School reform organization gets average grades"  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-02-06/news/ct-met-cps-turnaround-20120206_1_turnaround-schools-urban-school-leadership-ausl&lt;/ref&gt; stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most of AUSL turnarounds score below CPS averages on the percentage of students meeting or exceeding state benchmarks on standardized testing. Those schools that beat district averages have been accused of pushing out their lowest-performing students or those with discipline problems to artificially inflate their test scores.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Alma S. Woolley''' (October 3, 1931, [[New York City]] – December 17, 2005, [[Baltimore]]) was an American [[nurse]], [[nurse educator]], nursing historian, and author. She led several [[School of Nursing|schools of nursing]], and authored a number of books and articles on nursing education, the history of nursing education, and nurses.

==Early years and education==
Woolley grew up a child of the depression in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]]: Her father, hit by a truck, died on his way to a [[public hospital]]; her maternal grandmother who had worked in a [[sweatshop]] made all her clothes; her widowed mother worked as a stenographer for [[General Motors|GM]]; but Woolley, who said "as a twelve year old, I admired the smart gray uniforms with the red trimming" of the [[Cadet Nurse Corps]] (during World War II), was selected to go to the elite all-girls [[Hunter College High School]] to which she commuted by public transport one hour each way.&lt;ref&gt;Ma Loewenberg, ''The View from 70'' (Iowa City: Gray Pearl Press, 2004), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; At Hunter, she won the all-city Latin Poetry Contest in 1949 and graduated second in her class, subsequently attending [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] and then [[Cornell School of Nursing|Cornell University's School of Nursing]], which granted her a bachelor's degree in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;"Alma S. Woolley, 74, nursing school dean," ''The Washington Times'' (Washington, DC), December 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently joined the [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]], married, and worked at a number of hospitals including Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica, Queens and, moving to [[Philadelphia]], at [[Philadelphia General Hospital]], and [[Jefferson Medical College]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; She later became a nursing instructor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], enrolled in their graduate program and was granted an M.S. in [[medical-surgical nursing]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle'', [Newsletter of the Barabara Bates Center for the Study of the History of Nursing], Spring 2006, vol. 19. pp. 10-11, accessed at http://www.nursing.upenn.edu/history/Documents/27077%20UofP%20newsletter.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627184139/https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/history/Documents/27077%20UofP%20newsletter.pdf |date=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an accomplishment which led to one of her early articles in ''The American Journal of Nursing'', "My Lamp Is Refueled," explaining how and why she kept up with her field while rearing four small children.&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 67, no. 8, (August 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Having moved to [[New Jersey]] with her husband and children in 1969, Woolley became an instructor at [[Atlantic Community College]], but was soon offered the task of creating a B.S. degree program in nursing for [[Stockton University|The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey]] which had opened its doors in 1971. The original program she designed was for [[registered nurse]]s, R.N.'s, without a university degree, to complete a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|Bachelor of Science in nursing]]. The transition of nursing education from that of R.N.'s trained in non-university programs, to 4-year B.S.N. programs or their equivalent was a matter of advocacy for Woolley as well as profession, and she subsequently published a number of pieces demonstrating the benefits of university-based nursing programs.&lt;ref&gt;"From RN to BSN: Faculty Perceptions" in ''Nursing Outlook'', vol. 26, no. 2, pp. 103-8, (Feb. 1978) which described student and faculty experiences in a degree completion program for RNs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, she was awarded a doctorate in nursing education by the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/obituaries/article_81f22e71-6d10-588b-acf8-64b45f5901d1.html posted Dec. 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, she was appointed Director of the School of Nursing at [[Illinois Wesleyan University]] and the Caroline F. Rupert Professor of Nursing, and in 1986 left Wesleyan to become Dean of [[Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Argus'', v. 92, no. 8 (Nov. 8, 1985), p. 1, accessed at http://europa.iwu.edu/argus/pdf/19851108v092i08.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910212245/http://europa.iwu.edu/argus/pdf/19851108v092i08.pdf |date=2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 she received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Cornell School of Nursing Alumni Association.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley H. Fondiller, ''Go and Do Thou Likewise'', (2007) p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; She stepped down as dean of Georgetown's School of Nursing in 1992&lt;ref&gt;See: http://nhs.georgetown.edu/about/history/leadership/&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to teaching and writing, retiring as professor emeritus of nursing in 1996, and becoming visiting professor at both the [[University of Maryland School of Nursing]] in Baltimore, Md, and the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Times'' (Washington, D.C.) December 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote or contributed to biographies of nurses including Maude Francis Essig who served with American combat troops in World War I,&lt;ref&gt;"A Hoosier Nurse in France: The World War I Diary of Maude Frances Essig," in ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Vol. 82, No. 1 (March 1986), pp. 37-68&lt;/ref&gt; and Virginia Matthews Dunbar,&lt;ref&gt;''American Nursing: a biographical dictionary'', Vol. 3, (NY: Springer Publishing, 2000), pp. 75-77.&lt;/ref&gt; an early advocate of university curricula for nurses.

Reflecting her view that "the history of nursing education is an important lacuna in general histories of nursing" and that "as part of public history in the [[United States]], nursing education can cite many accomplishments in the realm of health care policy,"&lt;ref&gt;Shirley H. Fondiller, ''Go, and Do Thou Likewise'', foreword by Alma S. Woolley. Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing Alumni Association (2007). pp. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolley also published histories of nursing schools, including "Nuns and Guns"&lt;ref&gt;"Nuns and Guns: Holy Wars at Georgetown, 1903-1947," ''The Nursing History Review''. 2003;11:69-87.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Learning, Faith and Caring''.&lt;ref&gt;(2001) distributed by the ''Tau'' Chapter of ''[[Sigma Theta Tau]],'' the international nursing honor society. Reviewed by M. Louise Fitzpatrick, ''Nursing History Review'', vol. 10, (2002) pp. 194-6.&lt;/ref&gt; But before her death in 2005, she was working on oral histories of women who, like her, had been recently admitted as members to the once all-male [[Cosmos Club]] of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenberg, ''op. cit.'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Balmford''' is a professor of [[conservation biology|conservation science]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His research focuses on planning conservation, comparing the costs and benefits of conservation and how conservation can be reconciled with other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/zoostaff/balmford.htm|title=Department of Zoology – Andrew Balmford |publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Balmford studied for his undergraduate degree, and PhD at the University of Cambridge before becoming a research fellow at the university. He was then a research fellow at the [[Institute of Zoology]] before becoming a lecturer at [[Sheffield University]]. He returned to Cambridge in 1998 as a member of the zoology department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/zoostaff/csg/balmford.html |title=Conservation Science Group – Professor Andrew Balmford |publisher=University of Cambridge – Department of Zoology |accessdate=2010-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102054946/http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/zoostaff/csg/balmford.html |archivedate=2009-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a fellow of [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/academic/handbook/teachingatclare.html|title=Teaching at Clare|publisher=Clare College, Cambridge|accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/people/andrew-balmford/|title=Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In 1993, along with two other researchers, he investigated why the tails of birds are shaped as they are, aiming to test [[Charles Darwin]]'s hypothesis that females have a preference for males with longer and more ornate tails using aerodynamic analysis. They reported that shallow forked shaped tails (such as those of the [[Common house martin|house martin]]) are aerodynamically optimal and that species with them had similar lengthed tails, indicating they could have developed through [[natural selection]]. In species with longer tails, males tend to have longer tails than females and which also create drag, since this is no advantage except for when courting, the authors suggested long tails may have evolved through [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13818672.900-science-are-birds-with-long-tails-sexier-.html|title=Science: Are birds with long tails sexier? |last=Mason|first=Georgia|date=3 April 1993|work=New Scientist|accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balmford|first=Andrew|first2=Adrian L.

In 1998, he published a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' describing how the [[biodiversity]] of [[rainforest]] in Uganda could be estimated by counting populations of birds and [[butterflies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ecologists tally few species as proxies for the rest in the jungle|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19980809&amp;id=y_QaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1EcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5101,1471801|agency=Associated Press|date=30 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Balmford | first1 = A. | last2 = Howard | first2 = P.

The ''Financial Times'' commented that removing [[agricultural subsidies]] was already known to be "fraught with difficulties" and that only $1bn had been channelled into conservation projects since an agreement in 1992. Balmford was quoted as saying that the strongest argument to protect nature is "moral, cultural and philosophical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Game of high stakes in a world being bled dry.|work=Financial Times|date=23 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he led a research project that found children could name a greater proportion of [[Pokémon]] characters than common species of British wildlife; 8-year-olds could identify 80% of Pokémon characters but only 50% of species. Balmford suggested that conservationists could create a game similar to Pokémon to encourage children to learn about the environment, saying "People tend to care about what they know."&lt;ref name=harfield&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1389192/Is-that-a-bee-a-bird-or-Pikachu.html|title=Is that a bee, a bird or Pikachu?|last=Harfield|first=Roger|date=29 March 2002|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balmford|first=Andrew|author2=Clegg L |author3=Coulson T |author4=Taylor J. |date=March 2002|title=Why conservationists should heed Pokémon|journal=Science  |volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2367b|url=http://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/TeachingResources/GeneralScience/PokemonWildlife.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.295.5564.2367b }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reported in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that the benefits of conserving nature far outweigh the benefits of development, by a factor of 100 to 1, due to the loss of [[ecosystem services]]. It was estimated that humanity loses about $250bn per year due to habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/sci/tech/2179291.stm|title=Nature  'pays biggest dividends'|last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=8 August 2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1073947|last=Andrew|first=Balmford|first2=Aaron |last2=Bruner |first3=Philip |last3=Cooper |first4=Robert |last4=Costanza |first5=Stephen |last5=Farber |first6=Rhys E. |last6=Green |first7=Martin |last7=Jenkins |first8=Paul |last8=Jefferiss |first9=Valma |last9=Jessamy |first10=Joah |last10=Madden |first11=Kat |last11=Munro |first12=Norman |last12=Myers |first13=Shahid |last13=Naeem |first14=Jouni |last14=Paavola |first15=Matthew |last15=Rayment |first16=Sergio |last16=Rosendo |first17=Joan |last17=Roughgarden |first18=Kate |last18=Trumper |first19=R.

&lt;blockquote&gt;One-third of the world's wild nature has been lost since I was a child and first heard the word 'conservation'. That's what keeps me awake at night. &lt;sub&gt; Andrew Balmford – 2002&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, he led a study which collected data on the maintenance costs of different conservation projects around the world. It was found that there was huge variation in the cost of conserving nature, ranging from $0.07 per acre to $1.37&amp;nbsp;million per acre depending on the project. Projects in the developing world were generally cheaper than those in the developed world, boding well for the protection of [[biodiversity hotspot]]s in poorer countries such as Indonesia and Madagascar. Balmford stated that it is important that the value for money of a conservation project should be taken into account as well as the number of threatened species in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17723790.300 How to get a bigger bang for your eco buck] ''[[New Scientist]]'' – 25 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he published as a lead researcher a paper in ''[[PNAS]]'' which estimated that to protect 30% of the world's oceans by making them [[marine protected area|protected areas]] would cost between $12bn and $14bn each year. He told the ''BBC'' that, "meeting this commitment to marine protection will require international effort on an unprecedented scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3806689.stm|title=$14bn cost of protecting oceans|last=Rincon|first=Paul|date=15 June 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403239101| pmid = 15205483| year = 2004| last1 = Balmford | first1 = A.| last2 = Gravestock | first2 = P.| last3 = Hockley | first3 = N.| last4 = McClean | first4 = C.| last5 = Roberts | first5 = C.| title = The worldwide costs of marine protected areas| volume = 101| issue = 26| pages = 9694–9697| pmc = 470737| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.9694B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a paper that Balmford co-authored was published in ''Science'' that found that the benefits gained from [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest]] were quickly reversed. In recently deforested areas, the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) was higher than other regions, but once deforestation was complete and replaced by other activities, for example farming, the HDI decreased to the same as that in areas that had not been deforested. Balmford described the current situation as "disastrous for local people, wildlife and the global climate" but hoped that [[REDD]] may allow changes to occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8095833.stm|title='Boom and bust' of deforestation |last=Black|first=Richard |date=11 June 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1174002| pmid = 19520958| year = 2009| last1 = Rodrigues | first1 = A.| last2 = Ewers | first2 = R.| last3 = Parry | first3 = L.| last4 = Souza Jr | first4 = C.| last5 = Veríssimo | first5 = A.| last6 = Balmford | first6 = A.| title = Boom-and-bust development patterns across the Amazon deforestation frontier| volume = 324| issue = 5933| pages = 1435–1437| journal = Science|bibcode = 2009Sci...324.1435R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper published in ''[[Public Library of Science|PLoS Biology]]'' found that between 1992 and 2006, the overall number of visitors to 280 protected areas in 20 countries had increased. Visitor numbers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America all grew significantly, while those in North America and Australasia did not change significantly. The results contrasted with an earlier study of visitor numbers to protected areas in Japan and the USA which found they had fallen consistently over a number of decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000144| pmid = 19564896| year = 2009| last1 = Balmford | first1 = A.| last2 = Beresford | first2 = J.| last3 = Green | first3 = J.| last4 = Naidoo | first4 = R.| last5 = Walpole | first5 = M.| last6 = Manica | first6 = A.| title = A Global Perspective on Trends in Nature-Based Tourism| volume = 7| editor1-first = Walt V.| issue = 6| pages = e1000144| editor1-last = Reid| pmc = 2694281| journal = PLoS Biology| last7 = Reid | first7 = W.

'''Arthur Murray''' (born '''Moses Teichman''', April 4, 1895 – March 3, 1991) was an American ballroom dancer and businessman, whose name is most often associated with the dance studio chain that bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', March 11, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

His pupils included [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the [[Duke of Windsor]], [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney]], [[Barbara Hutton]], [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Manuel L. Quezon]], [[Johnny Mercer]], and [[Jack Dempsey]]. Television evangelist [[D. James Kennedy]] and ''[[Little House on the Prairie]] ''actress [[Katherine MacGregor]] were instructors of Murray's technique.{{cn|date=December 2014}}

Arthur Murray was inducted into the [[National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame|National Museum of Dance's Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame]] in 2007.{{cn|date=December 2014}}

==Early life and start in dance==
[[File:1920 Radio Dance.png|thumb|left|300px|Arthur Murray's 1920 Radio Dance, as portrayed in the 1920 ''[[Blueprint (yearbook)|Blueprint]]''; "[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech|Ramblin' Wreck]]" was one of the songs played that night.]]
Arthur Murray was born in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], in 1895 as Moses Teichman. In August 1897, he was brought to America by his mother Sarah on the ''S.S. Friesland'', and landed at [[Ellis Island]]. They settled in Ludlow Street, in the [[Lower East Side]] of Manhattan with his father, Abraham Teichmann.

Murray was shy as a child and self-conscious about his tall, lanky appearance. He wanted very much to be a part of the social activities that most of his friends enjoyed, particularly the dances, but was afraid to socialize with girls. At the age of 14, Joe Feigenbaum, a friend of his whom he admired because of his popularity with girls, taught him his first dance steps. To get practice on the dance floor, Murray attended weddings in his neighborhood, where he found willing dance partners of every size and age.

In 1912, at the age of 17, he taught dance at night while working as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] by day. He studied under the popular dance team of [[Irene and Vernon Castle]] and went to work for them.

Murray won his first dance contest at the Grand Central Palace, a public dance hall where he later became a part-time dance teacher after graduation from high school. The first prize had been a silver cup, but Murray went home with nothing to show for his win. His partner of the evening took it; it was destined for a [[pawnshop]]. This loss made an impression on Murray, and in later years every winner in his dance contests took home a prize.

Between jobs as a dance instructor, Murray worked as a draftsman at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] and as a reporter at the [[New Haven Register]].

He soon began teaching [[ballroom dancing]] to patients from the greater [[Boston, Massachusetts]] area, at the Devereux Mansion Physical Therapy Clinic in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]],{{cn|date=July 2017}} before moving to [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. Murray arrived at the [[Battery Park Hotel]] November 28, 1914 at age 19 and began teaching dance there. At the outbreak of World War I, under the pressure of the anti-German sentiment prevalent in the U.S., Murray changed his last name of Teichman to a less German-sounding name. The ''[[Asheville Citizen-Times|Asheville Citizen]]'' reported in 1920 that Murray had spent six summers teaching at the Battery Park. At that time, he had also began his chain of dance studios and become a well-paid dance writer. He had also signed a deal to produce records for teaching dance for [[Columbia Gramophone Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/07/31/visiting-our-past-arthur-murray-among-battery-parks-denizens/517517001/|title=Visiting Our Past: Arthur Murray among Battery Park's denizens|last=Neufeld|first=Rob|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=2017-07-31|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Murray began studying business administration at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia School of Technology]], and taught ballroom dancing in Atlanta at the [[Georgian Terrace Hotel]]. In 1920, he organized the world's first "radio dance"; a band on the Georgia Tech campus played "[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]" and other songs, which were broadcast to a group of about 150 dancers (mostly Tech students) situated atop the roof of the Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/sum91/deaths.html |title=Arthur Murray Taught the World to Dance |work=Tech Topics |publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association |date=Summer 1991 |accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012133809/http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/sum91/deaths.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray was inspired by a casual remark made by [[William Jennings Bryan]] one evening at the hotel: "... You know, I have a fine idea on how you can collect your money. Just teach 'em with the left foot and don't tell 'em what to do with the right foot until they pay up!" Murray thought about Bryan's remark, and devised the idea of teaching dance steps with footprint diagrams supplied by mail. Within a couple of years, over 500,000 dance courses had been sold.

On April 24, 1925, Murray married his famous dance partner, Kathryn Kohnfelder (September 15, 1906, [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] – August 6, 1999, [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]),&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; whom he had met at a radio station in [[New Jersey]]. She had been in the audience while he was broadcasting a dance lesson.

After their marriage, the mail-order business declined and the Murrays opened a dance school offering personal instruction. Their business prospered, especially in 1938 and 1939 when Arthur picked two little-known dances, the "Lambeth Walk" and "The Big Apple", and turned them into dance crazes. They were taught at hotel chains throughout the country, and the name "Arthur Murray" became a household word.

There are now hundreds of Arthur Murray studios globally, with specially trained instructors, making Arthur Murray the most successful dance instructor in history.

Arthur and Kathryn Murray had twin daughters, Jane and Phyllis. On June 4, 1951, Jane married Dr. [[Henry Heimlich]] who became famous for the Heimlich maneuver in 1974. Phyllis married educator Edward Irvine "Ted" McDowell.

==The start of Arthur Murray Studios==
[[File:Arthur Murray System 1922.png|thumb| A 1922 advertisement for Arthur Murray's dance system]]
[[File:ECMB-ArthurMurray1aByVernBarber.jpg|thumb|Arthur Murray dance class at a Municipal Band concert in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]]]]

His first business was selling dance lessons by mail, using a [[kinetoscope]]. Though the idea was successful, he had problems with the business, which failed. His second business was drawing and selling "footprints" which prospective dancers placed on the floor and followed to learn dancing. This [[mail-order]] business remained successful. His third business, launched in 1925, involved selling [[brand]]ed dance lessons through [[franchising]]. He trained dance instructors for the [[Statler Hotel]] chain, who then went to various hotels and gave lessons; Murray kept some of the profits from each franchise.

This business was expanded more widely in 1938, when an Arthur Murray dance studio franchise was opened in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Others followed. His slogan was: "If you can walk, we teach you how to dance", and the company guaranteed that the pupils learn to dance in ten lessons.

After WWII, Murray's business grew with the rise of interest in [[Latin dance]], and he regularly taught and broadcast in [[Cuba]] in the 1950s. Murray went on television with a dance program hosted by his wife, Kathryn Murray, ''[[The Arthur Murray Party]]'', which ran from 1950 to 1960, on [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and then on CBS. Among the Arthur Murray dance instructors in the early 1950s was future television evangelist [[D. James Kennedy]], who won first prize in a nationwide dance contest.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=E. Russell |title=The Kennedy Explosion |publisher=David C. Cook Publishing |location=Elgin, IL |year=1972 |isbn=0-912692-02-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared as a guest on the June 17, 1956 episode of ''[[What's My Line?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xfGY_palCI What's My Line? - Arthur Murray; Pier Angeli &amp; Vic Damone; Paul Winchell (panel) (Jun 17, 1956)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Murrays retired in 1964; but they continued to be active for some time, appearing as guests on the ''[[Dance Fever]]'' disco show in the late 1970s. By then, there were more than 3,560 dance studios bearing his name. In 2007, about 220 Arthur Murray Studios remained in operation.  Arthur Murray Dance Studios claims to be the second-oldest franchised company (the first, [[A&amp;W Restaurants]], began in 1919).

==Death==
Murray died at his home in Honolulu. He was 95 years old and had also had another house in Rye, N.Y., for many years. 
His daughter, Phyllis Murray McDowell, said he died of pneumonia. She also said at the time that he had been active and in good health until very recently.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/04/obituaries/arthur-murray-dance-teacher-dies-at-95.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25706">The '''Brand rankings of Japanese universities''' (大学ブランドランキング ''Daigaku Burando Rankingu'') is a ranking of the Japanese universities by [[Nikkei Business Publications]], released annually in November.

It is a ranking system which evaluates the universities' power of brand. According to Nikkei BP, BRJU stands on the idea of "How people think", but not the quality or functions of university. Therefore, questionnaires are done to third-person groups.&lt;ref name="nbp_r_10"&gt;[http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/pickup/20101108/1033562/?rt=nocnt 「大学ブランド力」ランキング、首都圏は早稲田、近畿は京大が1位〜日経BPコンサルティングが調査 - トレンド - 日経トレンディネット&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
It is composed by 49 indicators related to the power of brand. Each indicator was calculated by the result of  questionnaires to business(wo)men, people who have children and people related to education in a same region of targeted universities. these indicators are related to not only reputation or popularity, but also various recognitions such as a review of [[Human resources|HR]]. Basically the same methodology of corporate brand research is applied to this ranking systems.&lt;ref name="nbp_r_10"/&gt;

It ranks universities in 5 areas, with [[Greater Tokyo Area]], [[Hokuriku region|Hokuriku]]/[[Tōkai region|Tokai]] Area, [[Kansai region|Kansai Area]], [[Chūgoku region|Chugoku]]/[[Shikoku]] Area and [[Kyushu]]/[[Okinawa Prefecture]]/[[Yamaguchi Prefecture|Yamaguchi]] Area. Each university is ranked in its own region's rankings, thus there are no national rankings.

==Top 10/20 Universities in the BRJU==

Rankings have been conducted on an annual basis since 2009, and apart from the 2009, rankings are all regional, so there is not an overall ranking for universities, rather a ranking within their geographical area.

'''Computer-Based Math''' is an educational project started by [[Conrad Wolfram]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/6719451/We-need-to-base-maths-lessons-on-computers.html We need to base maths lessons on computers] The Telegraph, 03 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/education/edex/article1394920.ece Revival Plan] The New Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers do it better, Times Higher Education Supplement, 30 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/europe/11iht-educside11.html Closing the gap between modern life and the math curriculum] New York Times, 10 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the idea that routine mathematical calculations should be done with a computer.

Conrad Wolfram believes that mathematics education should make the greatest possible use of computers for performing computation leaving students to concentrate on the application and interpretation of mathematical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/think-tank/we-need-rock-star-math-teachers?page=all Reinventing Math for the Computational Knowledge Economy] Big Think, Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfram also argues that computers are the basis of doing math in the real world and that education should reflect that &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6395648] Times Educational Supplement&lt;/ref&gt; and that programming should be taught as part of math education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/20/ict-teaching-programming-no-guidance ICT teaching upgrade expected in 2014] The Guardian, 20 Aug 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram contends that this approach is fundamentally different from most of the use of [[Computers in the classroom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers.html Teaching kids real math with computers] TED 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whose role is to help to teach students to perform hand calculations, rather than to perform those computations and is also distinct from delivery tools such as [[E-learning]] systems.

In 2010 the website [http://www.computerbasedmath.org www.computerbasedmath.org] was set up to start developing a new curriculum and interactive digital learning materials to support it. It holds an annual conference.

In February 2013, Estonia announced that it would be piloting a Computer-Based Math developed statistics course&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2013/02/11/estonian-schools-to-teach-computer-based-math/ Estonian Schools to Teach Computer-Based Math] Wall Street Journal, 11 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/computer-based-math-in-estonia/ Math Rebels Invade Estonia With Computerized Education] Wired, 12 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.err.ee/education/34fea787-9203-4811-9f5a-eb62ad8567e5 Estonia Chosen as Testing Ground for Math Education Experiment] Estonian Public Broadcasting News&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.postimees.ee/1135472/estonian-british-experts-team-up-to-develop-computer-based-math-education Estonian, British experts team up to develop computer-based math education] Postimees, 13 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The African Leadership University plans to use materials developed by ComputerBasedMath.org in its Data and Decisions curriculum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alueducation.com/en/alu-partner-computer-based-maths-announces-annual-summit-3/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]] supported the third Computer-Based Math Education Summit in New York, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicefstories.org/2013/10/22/unicef-and-computerbasedmath-org-announce-major-summit-to-reconceptualize-math-education-worldwide/ UNICEF and Computerbasedmath.org Announce Major Summit to Reconceptualize Math Education Worldwide] unicefstories.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of calculations that should be done with a computer include arithmetical operations such as [[long division]] or integration techniques such as [[trigonometric substitution]].

The building itself houses offices used by the Science Museum and the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. The Dana Centre is not directly accessible from the main museum, and is situated on the nearby [[Queen's Gate]] street.

Previously an events space and café, the building re-opened in late 2015 as the Dana Library and Research Centre, aiming to "provide a world-class environment for academic research, bringing together the museum’s thriving Research and Public History Department and access to its library and archive collections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Library and Research Centre|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/new_galleries/research_centre.aspx|website=www.sciencemuseum.org.uk|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building History==
[[File:Eastern Liggett.jpg|thumb|left|Eastern Liggett School c. 1916, showing the original 1913 building]]
In 1878, Rev. James D. Liggett settled in Detroit and established a small, independent school for girls, originally known as The Detroit Home and Day School, and later as The Liggett School.&lt;ref name = "ligg"&gt;{{cite web| title = Our History | publisher = University Liggett School | url = http://www.uls.org/Page/About-Us/Our-History | accessdate = September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was originally located at Grand River and Broadway in Detroit, and quickly established itself with many of Detroit's most prominent families. The school incorporated in 1881, with a board of directors that included [[Dexter M. Ferry]], Jacob S. Farrand, and David Whitney, Jr. By 1883, the school had grown from 57 students to  194, and had outgrown its first home. The school moved to a new location at Cass and Stimson.&lt;ref name = "hhh"&gt;{{citation | title = Century: The History of the Detroit Liggett School | author = Anne Getz Wormer | publisher = University Liggett School | date = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school continued to grow steadily, and by 1897 had annexed an adjacent house.&lt;ref name = "burton"&gt;{{citation | title = The City of Detroit, Michigan, 1701-1922, Volume 1 | editor1 = Clarence Monroe Burton | editor2 = William Stocking | editor3 = Gordon K. Miller | publisher = S. J.

In 1913, the school decided to develop an eastern branch campus to serve students on the city's east side.&lt;ref name = "hhh"/&gt; This site on Indian Village along Charlevoix was chosen, and the school again contracted Albert Kahn to design a new building.&lt;ref name = "burton"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "iv"&gt;{{citation | title = Historic Indian Village House and Garden Tour | author = Indian Village Association Indian Village Garden Club | publisher = Indian Village Association and Indian Village Garden Club | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=76fhAAAAMAAJ | pages = 17, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is one of only two schools designed by Kahn, and the only one still extant.&lt;ref name = "green"&gt;{{cite web | title = Detroit Waldorf School Honored as one of the nation’s 100 "Places that Matter" | publisher = Greening of Detroit | date =  June 7, 2011 | url = http://www.greeningdetroit.com/2011/06/07/detroit-waldorf-school-honored-as-one-of-the-nation%E2%80%99s-100-%E2%80%9Cplaces-that-matter%E2%80%9D/ | accessdate = September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn's design for the school drew from then-popular English influences,&lt;ref name = "aia"&gt;{{citation | title = AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture | author1 = Eric J.

C. Simonds]] designed a landscape plan for the school.&lt;ref name = "dis"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dispatch from the Archives: Documenting Liggett | author = Leslie S.

Enrollment at the Eastern Liggett School was 88 in 1913, which rose to 200 by 1919. By the early 1920s, changes in the neighborhood around the Cass Avenue campus led to declining enrollment there. In 1923, the school decided to enlarge the Eastern Liggett building and close the original one.&lt;ref name = "hhh"/&gt; An addition to the school, also designed by Kahn, was constructed in 1924, and houses an auditorium and additional classroom space.&lt;ref name = "iv"/&gt; The addition so closely follows the style of the original building that the difference is nearly imperceptible. Enrollment rose to a high of around 300 students in 1929; although the [[Great Depression]] reduced enrollment, the Liggett School continued to occupy the building until the early 1960s, when the changing nature of Detroit caused the school to decide to move. In 1964, construction began on a new school, and in early 1965, Liggett moved from the Indian Village campus to [[Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan]]. In 1969, The Liggett School merged with Grosse Pointe University School to form what is now [[University Liggett School]].&lt;ref name = "hhh"/&gt;

An impassioned speech by African-American Junius Harris, where he reminded Board members that families of color had far fewer educational choices for their children, convinced the board to allow the Waldorf nursery school to open in their building.&lt;ref name = "yelp"/&gt; The school opened as a nursery school in the Central United Methodist Church in 1965, and was deliberately integrated from its founding.&lt;ref name = "dn2016"/&gt; However, space in the church was limited, and later that year the school acquired the just-vacated Liggett campus.&lt;ref name = "green"/&gt; Classes for elementary students began at the present school building in September 1966.&lt;ref name = "yelp"/&gt; The Detroit Waldorf School was one of the first nine Waldorf schools in North America, and a founding member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA).&lt;ref name = "aws"&gt;{{citation | title = AWSNA Timeline, 1965-2010 | author = David Mitchell | publisher = AWSNA | year = 2010 | url = http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/04_AWSNA/documents/AWSNA-8-29-10_(2).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Werner and Barbara Glas founded the Waldorf Institute at the school.&lt;ref name = "heart"&gt;{{citation | title = Into the Heart's Land | author = Henry Barnes | publisher = SteinerBooks | year = 2005 | ISBN = 9780880108577 | page = 926 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oRBU8oERXVwC&amp;pg=PT926#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waldorf Institute was the first Waldorf teacher-training institution in the United States, and only the second English-speaking one.  In 1979, the Waldorf Institute moved to [[Southfield, Michigan]], and in 1986 moved to [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]].&lt;ref name = "sun"&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Sunbridge | publisher = Sunbridge Institute | url = http://www.sunbridge.edu/about/history-of-sunbridge/ | accessdate = September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the [[Sunbridge Institute]].

In 2011, the school was selected by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] as one of 100 "places that matter" in the United States.&lt;ref name = "green"/&gt; In 2013, businessman Jeff Adler donated $750,000 to various Detroit organizations, including $100,000 to the Detroit Waldorf School.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Fond memories inspire California couple to donate $750,000 to Detroit institutions | author = Rochelle Riley | date = October 18, 2013 | newspaper = Detroit Free Press | url = http://archive.freep.com/article/20131018/COL10/310180027/Rochelle-Riley-Fond-memories-inspire-California-couple-donate-750-000-Detroit-institutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, at the time of the Detroit Waldorf School's 50th anniversary, the school was designated a [[List of Michigan State Historic Sites|Michigan State Historic Site]] A state of Michigan historical marker was erected at the school commemorating both the original occupant of the building, Eastern Liggett School, and Detroit Waldorf School.&lt;ref name = "dn2016"&gt;{{cite news | title = Detroit’s Waldorf School gets historic marker | author = Karen Bouffard | newspaper = The Detroit News | date = September 24, 2016 | url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/09/24/waldorf-school-historic-marker/91033840/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Detroit Waldorf School has maintained a commitment to providing a strong [[Waldorf education]] children in Detroit,&lt;ref name = "cbs"/&gt; and to racial, ethnic, geographic, and social-economic diversity in its student body.&lt;ref name = "wdet"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dn2016"/&gt; The school has remained at its present location since 1966.

==Education in the Early Childhood Center==
The Detroit Waldorf School Early Childhood Center includes Pre-K classes for children 3-5 and full-day Kindergarten. The focus in the Early Childhood Center is on language and stories in circle/story time, and on indoor and outdoor creative free play.  The school believes that free play is a fundamental part of early learning, fostering imagination, creativity, problem solving and social skills which aid in academic learning in later years. Children in the Early Childhood Center experience movement in play, including skipping, jumping rope, and [[eurythmy]]. They also do arts and handwork, including coloring, painting, modeling with beeswax, and baking bread.&lt;ref name = "ec"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Early Childhood Center | publisher = Detroit Waldorf School | url = http://www.detroitwaldorf.org/early-childhood | accessdate = September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elementary and Middle School Academics==
Beginning in elementary school, the core academic subjects (language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies) are presented in a two-hour main lesson each day. The subject of the main lesson rotates every three to four weeks. The school believes that presenting material in blocks lets students explore the material more deeply.&lt;ref name = "curr"&gt;{{cite web | title = Curriculum | publisher = Detroit Waldorf School | url = http://www.detroitwaldorf.org/curriculum/ | accessdate = September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the core academic subjects, students also learn two foreign languages (Spanish and German),&lt;ref name = "one"&gt;{{cite web | title = Grades 1-5 | publisher = Detroit Waldorf School | url = http://www.detroitwaldorf.org/1-5-grade | accessdate = September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as music, movement, arts, and handwork.&lt;ref name = "glim"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Glimpse through the Grades Curriculum| publisher = Detroit Waldorf School | url = https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/264912244/CurriculumGuide.pdf/ | accessdate = September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum integrates the traditional academic subjects with the arts to provide engaging experiences for the student. The school aims to not only educate students, but also to prepare them to be creative, critical thinkers with individual initiative.&lt;ref name = "gs"&gt;{{cite web | title = Detroit Waldorf School | publisher = Great Schools | url = http://www.greatschools.org/michigan/detroit/4273-Detroit-Waldorf-School/ | accessdate = September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language Arts''' begins with an introduction to letters, reading, and handwriting in the first grade. It continues through spelling and grammar, further reading, research and creative writing, poetry, and composition. Students read stories, fables, and literature, culminating in a Shakespearean play in eighth grade. Each grade also puts on a class play.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"&gt;{{cite web | title = Grades 6-8 | publisher = Detroit Waldorf School | url = http://www.detroitwaldorf.org/6-8-grade | accessdate = September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematics''' starts with basic arithmetic and the introduction to numbers, and continues with multiplication, division, fractions, exponents, and roots. Geometry is taught in the middle and upper grades. The upper grades begin studying business math, pre-algebra, and algebra, including graphing equations.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

'''Science''' is introduced in the lower grades through observation and experience with nature, as well as gardening and cooking. Science continues in the middle grades with zoology, botany, and astronomy, and in the upper grades with physics, chemistry, anatomy, mechanics, and meteorology.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

'''Social Studies''' begins in the earlier grades with legends, myths, and folklore. It segues to local and world geography, and history from ancient Greek history through Medieval and Renaissance times to the present.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

'''Foreign Language''' includes both Spanish and German.  Teaching the languages parallels what students learn in Language Arts; this includes reading, conversation, and composition.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

'''Music''' begins with singing. Singing continues through later grades in chorus. All students also learn to play musical instruments. The early grades use a flute and recorder; the upper grades begin with stringed instruments and eventually into orchestra.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

'''Movement and Physical Education''' is introduced in the form of games and [[eurythmy]]. Gymnastics is introduced later, as well as dancing and team sports.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

'''Art and Handwork''' is introduced with painting, drawing, knitting, and beeswax modeling. As students progress, more sophisticated painting and drawing is introduced, as well as carving, pottery, sculpture, cross-stitch, sewing, carpentry, and woodworking.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "glim"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

==After School Programs==
The school offers various after-school programs for students. These include competitive sports, physical activities, musical instruction, and Games. 2015/2016 offerings include basketball, track, soccer, tennis, volleyball, circus arts, kinderharp, guitar, brain games, and chess.&lt;ref name = "as"&gt;{{cite web | title = After School Programs | publisher = Detroit Waldorf School | url = http://www.detroitwaldorf.org/after-school-programs/ | accessdate = September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2012, Lynch was accused of falsifying his doctorate, with an article alleging he claimed dates for a Masters in Philosophy that was not correct and for a PhD that he had not yet completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/upenn-dean-faked-phd-ivy-league/story?id=16229174|title = University of Pennsylvania Dean Faked PhD|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lynch resigned one day after the story broke in the national press. Another article that followed the controversy noted that the Penn website did not list his degrees, only that on one Penn website he was referred to as "Dr." Lynch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedp.com/article/2012/04/gse_vice_dean_resigns_amid_false_degree_claims|title = GSE vice dean resigns amid false degree claims|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in another article, it notes that he claimed he was "trained in economics" rather than having a doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/upenn-dean-faked-phd-ivy-league/story?id=16229174|title = University of Pennsylvania Dean Faked PhD|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/2439|title = Theme: Imagining Reality|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Penn Press release at the time of his hire, did not mention either degree but rather that he was enrolled in a doctoral program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v50/n31/lynD.html|title = Vice Dean at Graduate School of Education: Doug Lynch|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy continued a year later,  where another article claimed that he continued to fake his degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/01/former-penn-admin-continues-to-lie-about-credentials|title = Former GSE admin Doug Lynch continues to falsify credentials|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Columbia University website at the time of the article did listed him as having a PhD and with a dissertation in economics that focused on the value of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:155034|title = Does Diversity Matter?: Evidence from the Relationship Between an Institution's Diversity and the Salaries of its Graduates|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faroese Teachers School''' ({{lang-fo|Føroya Læraraskúli}}) is a college in [[Tórshavn]] in the [[Faroe Islands]], which became part of the [[University of the Faroe Islands]] on 1 August 2008.&lt;ref name="setrid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setur.fo/um-setrid/|title=Um Setrið|publisher=University of the Faroe Islands|language=Faroese|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 it has offered [[bachelor's degree]]s in general and specialized education; before 2008, education students did not receive a BA. The school's four-year program in general education qualifies graduates for teaching positions in [[primary school]]s and [[preschool]]s in the Faroe Islands and [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;Sroka, Wendelin. 2007. Faroe Islands. In: Holfgang Hörner et al. (eds.), ''The Education Systems of Europe'', pp. 249–250. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faroese Teachers School was founded as the Faroese Normal School in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Martin. 1907. ''Føroya Læraraskúli 1870–1970''.

[[Gregers Joensen]] and [[Óli Niklái Skaalum]] were members of the first graduating classes, and later many prominent persons attended the school. There has been no other teacher training program in the Faroe Islands since the establishment of the Faroese Teachers School. Today the school is part of the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]&lt;ref name="setrid"/&gt; and is also affiliated with the Faroese Research Council ({{lang-fo|Granskingarráðið}}).

'''Floss Casasola''', '''[[MBE]], [[Order of Distinction (Belize)|OD]]''' (1903–1991) was a [[Belizeans|British Honduran]] teacher and music instructor who became involved in the [[History of Belize#Genesis of modern politics, 1931–54|Belizean Independence Movement]]. She was one of the first women to vie for public office, serving on the Belize City Council from 1952 to 1956. Recognized numerous times for her contributions to increasing literacy and music development in the country, she was honored as a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]], with the Outstanding Artist Award in 1997 and in 2010 was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Distinction (Belize)|Order of Distinction]] from the government of Belize.

==Early life==
Floss Effie Kemp was born in 1903 in Belize City, [[British Honduras]] to Diana and Joseph Kemp. The youngest of seven siblings, her father died when she was one year old and the children were raised by their mother. Completing her elementary education at Wesley School, she went on to further her education as a [[pupil-teacher]], earning her certification to teach while a teenager.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}}

==Career==
Kemp began teaching at Wesley School and later moved to Ebenezer School, where she remained until Belize City was devastated by the [[1931 Belize hurricane|1931 hurricane]] and she was forced to move to another part of the city. While the damage was extensive and took considerable time to clean up, Kemp used her time to study music and began playing the organ at the Wesley Church. She soon became the choirmaster and began taking in students for piano lessons.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} She was classically trained and insisted that her students study theory.{{sfn|Hyde|2007}} She returned to Wesley Primary School when it reopened and designed the uniform of the school, extending her teaching to adults, whom she taught at the Belize City prison on Sundays. During one of those visits to the prisons in the early 1950s, she met [[Philip Goldson]], who was serving time for [[sedition]].{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} 

In 1933, Kemp married Edward Frederick Casasola. Though they had no children of their own, she raised his children from a prior relationship{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} and two girls, Greta Palma and Janice Robateau, whom she adopted.{{sfn|Hyde|2007}} Casasola was active in the Wesley Women's League and composed traditional folk songs for the group in [[Belizean Creole]]. She also founded several youth groups, including the B-Sharp Music Club, the Excelsior Choir and Drama Group, and the Wesley Primary School Choir. Each of these groups were active in the 1950s in competitions for drama, elocution and music, participating annually in the Festival of Arts.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}}

Casasola was elected as the president of the British Honduras Federation of Teachers in 1949 and began participating in regional conferences in such places as [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. She was instrumental in the creation of a teacher's pension plan. Having become an active member in the [[History of Belize#Genesis of modern politics, 1931–54|Belizean Independence Movement]], she ran for a seat on the Belize City Council in 1952.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} Her successful bid, as a candidate of the [[National Party (Belize)|National Party]],{{sfn|Vernon|1991|p=23}} earned her a stipend of $50 per month.{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1953|p=12}} In 1954 the year that [[universal suffrage]] was granted in British Honduras, Casasola was made principal of Wesley Primary School. In addition to acting head of the school, she tutored students free-of-charge to prepare for the Pupil Teachers' Examination in the evenings.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}}

Casasola was reelected in 1956,{{sfn|Vernon|1991|p=97}} becoming the first woman to run for a political office after full suffrage was granted in the country.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} No candidates for the National Party were elected in 1957 and as a result, the National Party and the [[Honduran Independence Party]] merged to form the [[National Independence Party (Belize)|National Independence Party]] (NIP).{{sfn|Vernon|1991|pp=99–100}} As elections approached in 1958, the NIP did not select her to run for re-election. Instead, she vied as an independent candidate and was expelled from the party for her disloyalty.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}}{{sfn|Vernon|1991|p=111}} Casasola was later reinstated to the party{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} and was honored as a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] on 31 December 1960.{{sfn|''The London Gazette''|1960|p=8912}} She ran as a representative of the [[Albert (Belize House constituency)|Albert Division]] in 1961, but lost her bid. That election was her last attempt to hold an elected office, though she did become a [[Justice of the Peace]]. Casasola continued to be politically active through the transformation of the NIP to the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] in 1973.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} 

After she withdrew from political life, Casasola continued teaching music lessons in her home. Some of her noted students include Yvonne Pilgrim Suite,{{sfn|Hyde|2007}} [[Francis Reneau]] and [[Colville Young]].{{sfn|Vernon|2016}}

==Death and legacy==
Casasola died in Belize City in 1991. Posthumously, she was honored at the Outstanding Artists' Awards ceremony in 1997 for her contributions to music.{{sfn|Vernon|2016}} In 2010, she was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Distinction (Belize)|Order of Distinction]] from Prime Minister [[Dean Barrow]].{{sfn|''7 News''|2010}}

'''The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants''' (or simply the '''''Glass Flowers''''') is a collection of highly realistic [[glass]] [[botany|botanical]] models at the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Created by [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]] from 1887 through 1936 at their studio in [[Hosterwitz]], near [[Dresden, Germany]], the collection was commissioned by [[George Lincoln Goodale]], the first director of Harvard's [[Botanical Museum]], and was financed by [[Mary Lee Ware]] and her mother [[Elizabeth Cabot (Lee) Ware|Elizabeth C. Ware]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaschka Plants Blend Science and Artistry (NYT) - https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-blaschka-plants-blend-science-and-artistry.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; It includes 847 life-size models (representing 780 species and varieties of plants in 164 families) and some 3,000 detail models such as of plant parts and anatomical sections. The collection comprises approximately 4,400 individual glass models representing over 830 plant species.

==Background==
{{main|Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka}}
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Rudolf (standing) and Leopold Blaschka]]
Starting in 1863 the Blaschkas had a thriving business making glass models of [[marine invertebrate]]s, selling them to museums and private collectors in a global enterprise (see {{crossreference|[[Glass sea creatures]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1886, the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale who, after seeing their work, had gone Dresden to ask them to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; the reason for the request being that only used method at time was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens—a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color, two drawbacks which glass models did not have.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold was hesitant but eventually agreed to make some sample models which, though badly damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; convinced Goodale of their value in botanical teaching.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

To fund the project Goodale approached his former student Mary Lee Ware and her mother, Elizabeth [[Cabot family|C.]] Ware, who were already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers that never fade / Franklin Baldwin Wiley. Boston Bradlee Whidden, Publisher 1897&lt;/ref&gt; The original arrangement (in 1887) provided that the Blaschkas would work half time on the project, but in 1890 a new arrangement called for them to work full-time.&lt;ref name="Schultes, Richard Evans 1982"&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Archives of Rudolph and Leopold Blaschka and the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants - http://botlib.huh.harvard.edu/libraries/glass.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The work continued until 1936, at which point Leopold and Elizabeth had both died.&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

The collection is formally dedicated to [[Charles Eliot Ware|Dr. Charles Eliot Ware]], the deceased father and husband of Mary and Elizabeth Ware, respectively.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

==The models==
[[File:Ware Dedication plaque.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|"In memory of physician Charles Eliot Ware (1814{{ndash}}1887), a graduate of this university. These models were presented by his wife and daughter who survived him. He sincerely cherished and deeply loved native plants as friends."]]
The models are glass with wire supports (internal or external), glue, a variety of organic media,{{Explain|date=March 2017}} and paint or enamel coloring.&lt;ref&gt;NcNally, Rika Smith and Nancy Buschini (1993). [http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic32-03-002_1.html Journal of the American Institute for Conservation], Volume 32, Number 3, Article 2 (pp. 231 to 240)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' has called them "anatomically perfect and, given all the glass-workers who've tried and failed, unreproducible."&lt;ref&gt;Putting the Glass Flowers in new light - http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/putting-the-glass-flowers-in-new-light/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard's glass flowers return - https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2016/05/24/harvard-glass-flowers-return/SwICUX1ZgpsP3CPPeMbpuO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GlassFlowers4HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4]]

It is often said that the Blaschkas employed secret techniques now lost; in fact their techniques were common at the time, but their skill, enthusiasm, and meticulous study and observation of their subjects in life were extraordinary, which Leopold ascribed to familial tradition, in a letter to Mary Lee Ware: "Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms{{nbsp}} ... &lt;!--, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation.--&gt; The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass."

The Blaschkas' primary technique was [[lampworking]], in which glass is melted over a flame fed by air from a foot-powered bellows, then shaped using tools to pinch, pull or cut; forms were blown as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Dictionary|url=http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/l|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their old-fashioned Bohemian lamp-working table is part of the museum exhibit.
Over the years Rudolf brought more and more of the entire production process under his personal control, eventually even manufacturing his own glass and colorants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Zone Books| isbn = 978-1-890951-43-6| last = Daston| first = Lorraine| title = Things that talk : object lessons from art and science| chapter = The Glass Flowers| location = New York| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist Donald Schnell has called the models "enchanting", and relates his surprise at finding that the models faithfully depict an unpublished detail of a bee's behavior while pollinating a particular plant{{emdash}}a detail which he had privately hypothesized.&lt;ref&gt;Schnell, Donald (2002). Carnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada. Timber Press. {{ISBN|0-88192-540-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whitehouse and Small wrote that "the superiority in design and construction of the Blaschka models surpasses all modern model making to date and the skill and art of the Blaschkas rests in peace for eternity."{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Glass Flowers is one of the most noted tourist attractions of the Boston area. More than 210,000 visitors view the collection annually. In 1936, when Harvard invited the public to tour the campus in honor of its tercentenary, a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter taking the tour commented "Tercentenary or no, the chief focus of interest remains the famous glass flowers, the first of which was put on exhibition in 1893, and which with additions at intervals since, have never failed to draw exclamations of wonder or disbelief from visitors."&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5696">[[File:BloomsCognitiveDomain.svg|right|thumb|250px|Categories in the cognitive domain of [[Bloom's taxonomy]] (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001)]]
'''Higher-order thinking''', known as '''higher order thinking skills''' ('''HOTS'''), is a concept of [[education reform]] based on learning [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] (such as [[Bloom's taxonomy]]). The idea is that some types of learning require more cognitive processing than others, but also have more generalized benefits. In Bloom's taxonomy, for example, skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis (creation of new knowledge) are thought to be of a higher order, requiring different learning and teaching methods than the learning of facts and concepts.

Higher-order thinking involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as [[critical thinking]] and problem solving. Higher-order thinking is more difficult to learn or teach but also more valuable because such skills are more likely to be usable in novel situations (i.e., situations other than those in which the skill was learned).

==Education reform==
It is a notion that students must [[Mastery learning|master the lower level skills]] before they can engage in higher-order thinking. However, the United States [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] objected to this line of reasoning, saying that cognitive research challenges that assumption, and that higher-order thinking is important even in elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Resnick |first=Lauren B. |date=1987 |title=Education and learning to think |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Academy Press]] |isbn=0309037859 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including higher-order thinking skills in [[educational aims and objectives]] is a very common feature of [[standards-based education reform]].

Advocates of [[traditional education]] object to elevating HOTS above direct instruction of [[basic skills]]. Many forms of education reform, such as inquiry-based science, [[reform mathematics]] and [[whole language]] emphasize HOTS to solve problems and learn, sometimes deliberately omitting direct instruction of traditional methods, facts, or knowledge. HOTS assumes [[standards based assessment]]s that use open-response items instead of multiple choice questions, and hence require higher-order analysis and writing. Critics of [[standards based assessment]]s point out that this style of testing is even more difficult for students who are behind academically. Indeed, while minorities may lag by 10 to 25 points on standardized percentile rankings, the failure rates of minorities are two to four times the best scoring groups on tests like the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]]. It is debated whether it is correct to raise the importance of teaching process over content.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The [[Republican Party of Texas]] expressed their opposition to the teaching of certain HOTS by including the following item in their 2012 Party Platform:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Republican Party Platform of 2012 |publisher=[[Republican Party of Texas]] |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012-Platform-Final.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629111643/http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012-Platform-Final.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student's fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the final wording of this item was evidently a "mistake" according to Republican Party of Texas Communications Director Chris Elam who said, in an interview with ''[[Talking Points Memo]]'', that the plank should not have included the phrase "critical thinking skills" and it was not the intent of the subcommittee to indicate that the RPT was opposed to critical thinking skills. When asked to clarify the meaning of the item he said, "I think the intent is that the Republican Party is opposed to the values clarification method that serves the purpose of challenging students beliefs and undermine {{sic}} parental authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lach |first=Eric |url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/06/texas_gops_2012_platform_accidentally_opposes_teaching_of_critical_thinking_skills.php |title=Texas GOP's 2012 platform opposes teaching of 'critical thinking skills' |website=[[Talking Points Memo]] |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics ==

Similarly, [[textbook]]s such as Dale Seymour's Investigations omit many standard [[arithmetic]] methods, instead relying on students to construct their own ways to compute [[average]]s, and perform [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Teachers are directed to discourage students who may have been taught how to regroup or take a sum and divide by the number of items to compute an average.

'''Idit R. Harel''' (born '''Idit Ron'''; September 18, 1958) is an [[Israeli Americans|Israeli-American]] entrepreneur and CEO of [[Globaloria]]. She is a [[learning sciences]] researcher and pioneer of [[Constructionist learning]]-based [[EdTech]] interventions.

==Overview==
Harel researches and writes on the impact of computational [[new media]] technology on the social and academic development of children and their [[epistemology]]. Her [[MIT Media Lab]] research with [[Seymour Papert]] has contributed to the development of [[constructionist learning]] theory. She blogs monthly on Huffington Post Impact and Technology verticals on computer skills education, particularly for young women, girls, and underprivileged children, and the value of [[MOOC]]s in education reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/idit-harel-caperton|title=Dr. Idit Harel Caperton: Huffington Post Author Page|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harel was the founder and CEO of [[MaMaMedia]] Inc., the executive director of the MaMaMedia Consulting Group (MCG), and the founder, President, and Chair of the [http://www.worldwideworkshop.org World Wide Workshop], [[educational technology]] development companies. She is presently the CEO and a founding Chair of [[Globaloria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/about-us/board-of-directors|title=World Wide Workshop: Board of Directors|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which designs computer learning programs for K-12 schools in the United States.

==Personal life==
Idit Ron was born in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. Her parents and their families are Holocaust survivors from Poland and Czechoslovakia. She married her first husband, [[David Harel]], in 1979 (divorced 1995); they have three children. She married her second husband, former [[West Virginia]] governor [[Gaston Caperton]], in 2003; they divorced in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redefineschool.com/idit-harel-caperton|title=Idit Harel Caperton profile|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Education===
Harel moved to the [[United States]] in 1982 for graduate study at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] after having previously received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]] from [[Tel-Aviv University]]. She earned two graduate degrees from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]: an EdM in Technology in Education (1984) and a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAS) in Human Development (1985) from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In 1988, she earned a Ph.D in Epistemology and Learning Research from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] after helping to formulate a new constructivist model with Seymour Papert, the "Instructional Software Design Learning Paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Idit Harel – Founder and CEO, Globaloria|url=http://www.tribecadisruptiveinnovationawards.com/idit-harel|accessdate=August 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811164042/http://www.tribecadisruptiveinnovationawards.com/idit-harel/|archivedate=August 11, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children Designers===
Harel's research at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the MIT Media Lab in the 1980s led to the 1991 publication of ''Children Designers'', which won the 1991 ''Outstanding Book Award'' from the [[American Education Research Association]], with an introduction by Harel's research collaborator, constructivist researcher Seymour Papert. ''Children Designers'' presents the results of Harel's research in which she introduced disadvantaged fourth-grade children from the Boston area to the [[Logo programming language]], and facilitated their creation of mathematical software applications that would help third-grade peers learn fractions. ''Children Designers'' suggested implementations within schools that emphasize this project-based and student-centered approach.&lt;ref name="mathbehavior"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Idit|last=Harel| year=1990|title=Children as software designers: a constructionist approach for learning mathematics|journal=The Journal of Mathematical Behavior|volume=9|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MaMaMedia===
{{main|MaMaMedia}}
In 1995, Harel moved to New York City, where she founded MaMaMedia, an Internet [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] that offered web services focused on inculcating digital literacy and creative learning skills among children and their parents who used the web games and activities offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of MaMaMedia Inc.|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=534587|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harel developed MaMaMedia based largely on her research in the MIT Media Lab in the educational principles of constructionism. The site provided web users with a range of "playful learning" activities and projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MaMaMedia.com helps families explore Web|publisher=The Rock River Times|url=http://rockrivertimes.com/1993/07/01/mamamediacom-helps-families-explore-web|date=July 1, 1993|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing the first print [[magazine]] for children about the Internet, ''MaMaMedia: A Kid's Guide to the Net''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MaMaMedia: A Kid's Guide to the Web|publisher=MaMaMedia.com|url=http://www.mamamedia.com/activities/magonline/home.html|accessdate=August 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000229214236/http://mamamedia.com/activities/magonline/home.html|archivedate=February 29, 2000|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wide Workshop and Globaloria===
{{main|Globaloria}}
Harel founded World Wide Workshop in 2004, a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization that develops applications for learning with technology that combine game design and online social media experiences for youth to empower them to be inventors and leaders in the global knowledge economy. The foundation's programs aim to transform education by connecting youth to technology learning opportunities in schools and community centers, facilitating children's localized community engagement, and fostering the potential for economic development through game production experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bracey Sutton|first=Bonnie|first2=Vic|last2=Sutton|date=August 30, 2010|url=http://etcjournal.com/2010/08/30/idit-harel-caperton-an-interview|title=Idit Harel Caperton – An Interview at the Edge of Change|accessdate=August 3, 2015|publisher=education, technology &amp; change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globaloria is a social learning system and educational program of the World Wide Workshop, in which participating students engage in a range of digital activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/03/19/high-quality-stem-education-for-all-it-takes-a-village|title=High-Quality STEM Education for All: It Takes a Village and global citizenship through game design.|last=Harel Caperton|first=Idit|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established in 2006 to cultivate both students' and educators' 21st century skills and digital literacy, facilitating mastery of social media technology tools, and students' deeper understanding of curricular areas, such as science, mathematics and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2013/02/13/alumna-develops-educational-game-changer|title=Alumna Develops Educational Game Changer|last=Marcott|first=Amy|publisher=MIT: Slice of Life|date=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Harel's published work in the 1990s and early 2000s focused on the emergence of what she has termed the "Clickerati Generation" - children born since 1991 who will grow up immersed in new media, and unable to imagine a world without Internet technology. She calls for a radical paradigm shift in the education and acculturation of this generation, emphasizing normalization of digital information and communication, and the cultivation of digital literacy skills for their successful development, citizenship, and leadership within such physical-digital blended environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Idit|last=Harel|date=Spring 2002|title=Learning New-Media Literacy: A New Necessity for the Young Clickerati Generation|journal=Telemedium|volume=48|issue=1|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Idit|last=Harel|date=March 1997|title=Clickerati Kids: Who Are They?|journal=21st Century Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructionist MOOCs===
Through the launch of the World Wide Workshop and research on its flagship program Globaloria, Harel has advanced the use of [[constructionist learning]] within the MOOC model. She has criticized MOOCs for generally replicating the instructor-led learning model, and asserts that Globaloria's educational tools are the only constructionist MOOCs for middle and high school students, and that this approach is unique in simultaneously training teachers and instructors on a [[blended learning]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Idit|last=Harel Caperton|title=Opinion: Before We Flip Classrooms, Let's Re-Think What We're Flipping To|url=http://www.wiredacademic.com/2012/10/opinion-before-we-flip-classrooms-lets-re-think-what-were-flipping-to|publisher=WiredAcademic|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Glader|title=Interview: Globaloria Founder Dr. Idit Harel Caperton On Video Games As The New Language Arts|url=http://www.wiredacademic.com/2011/12/interview-globaloria-founder-dr-idit-harel-caperton-on-video-games-as-the-new-language-arts|publisher=WiredAcademic|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irving Literary Society''' (also known as the '''Irving Literary Association''' or simply '''The Irving''') was a [[College literary societies|literary society]] at [[Cornell University]] active from 1868 to 1887. The [[U.S. Department of Education|U.S. Bureau of Education]] described it as a "purely literary society" following the "traditions of the old literary societies of Eastern universities."&lt;ref&gt;United States Bureau of Education, ''Contributions to American Educational History No. 28: History of Higher Education in New York, Circular of Information No. 3'', (H.B. Adams, ed. 1900) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=U5sFAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA393&amp;dq=%22the+Irving%22+Cornell&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8fAsTNXJI4aBlAeJ0J2dCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20Irving%22%20Cornell&amp;f=false 393.]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period when the [[Cornell literary societies]] flourished, the Irving and its peers produced literature at a rate higher than the campus average for the next generation, leading commentators at the turn of the 20th century to question whether academic standards had fallen since the university's founding.&lt;ref&gt;R.W., “The infancy of Cornell Journalism,” ''The Era'' (1900) at 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Named after the American writer [[Washington Irving]], the Irving Literary Society was founded on October 20, 1868, shortly after Cornell opened. Past members who went on to prominent careers included Judge [[Morris Lyon Buchwalter]], Senator [[Joseph Benson Foraker]], and the journalists [[John Andrew Rea]] and [[Francis Whiting Halsey]]. The Irving's last public meeting was held on May 23, 1887.&lt;ref name = "Moyer1896" /&gt; After that it ceased to exist as a Cornell University student society.  However, the [[List of fraternities and sororities at Cornell University|New York Alpha Chapter]] of the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] undergraduate [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] at Cornell claims to have "served as steward of the Irving Literary Society
since 1888".&lt;ref name="phikappapsi-cornell"&gt;New York Alpha Chapter of [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [http://www.phikappapsi-cornell.org/141-pkpcor/files/2010_1015_Irving_Summary_Redacted.pdf "Homecoming 2010, September 24-26"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:Cascadilla Place Cornell University.jpg|thumb|265 px|left|alt=Cascadilla Place under construction.|Cascadilla Place, where the Irving Literary Society was founded.]]
A preliminary meeting chaired to organize the Society was held Room No. 4, Cascadilla Place, on October 20, 1868, some thirteen days after [[Cornell University]] opened its doors.&lt;ref name = "Moyer1896"&gt;Moyer, Fayette E. (1896). "Cornell Student Activities: Literary Societies", [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22195/2/Magazine_V8_1895_96.pdf ''Cornell Magazine], Vol 8, October 1895-June, 1896 pp. 187-194&lt;/ref&gt; The second business meeting followed on November 7 with George F. Behringer as President when the society's name was discussed with members equally between the John Bright Brotherhood, honoring the English orator [[John Bright]] and others favoring the Irving Literary Association after [[Washington Irving]]. A compromise was struck in which the society was named after Irving, while Bright and the American orator, [[Charles Sumner]], were admitted as the first honorary members. Each of the early sessions was opened with prayer.&lt;ref name = "Moyer1896" /&gt; In 1930 [[John Andrew Rea]] recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What I was thinking of most at that time was founding a fraternity and a literary society.  I was Phi Kappa Psi, and wanted [[Joseph Benson Foraker|Foraker]] and [[Morris Lyon Buchwalter|Buchwalter]] to come on and join me in founding the New York Alpha, which we did, and we had a great bunch of boys.  The literary society was first in time.  Mr. Williams of our class agitated for the organization of a society under the name "Philanthea".  I was appointed on the committee to report on the name for the second society.  We did not want a Latin or Greek name, for this was a new institution, one that had never existed before.  After much discussion, we went to Mr. White [ [[Andrew Dickson White]] ] and told him we were starting a society and he suggested we use the name of "Irving", after the founder of American literature.  The committee accepted it and reported it to the boys and so it was called the Irving Literary Society.  I have no record of the demise of the Irving . . . . There were no other activities than those of the fraternity and the literary society.  That was all we knew anything about; no athletics the first year.  The literary society had public exhibitions with essays, orations, and debates.  They were held downtown.&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Rea, "The Immortal Eight" in ''A Half-Century at Cornell'', pp. 91-92. Cayuga Press, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first question 'put to the house' in 1869 was "Resolved, the erection of a theatre was not in the interest of promoting correct morals within the University community."  The answer was nodded in the affirmative.&lt;ref name = "Moyer1896" /&gt; The Irving was not to be the venue for the theatre arts at Cornell.
Beginning in February 1870, the Irving and the Philaletheian held their annual contest against each other.  That event has been noted as one reason the quality of debate was so high between 1869 and 1884.&lt;ref&gt;F.E. Moyer, ”Cornell Student Activities,” ''Cornell Magazine'' (8:4)(Jan. 1895) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=E48mAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22the+Irving%22+Cornell&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cT0uTPt7g7zyBpO3vZUD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20Irving%22%20Cornell&amp;f=false 187–194.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the Irving's proceedings were held on Friday evenings at Deming Hall, on what is now the [[Ithaca Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (Sept. 22, 1869) at 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Special events were held at the Cornell Public Library around the corner.  Later it shared [[Cornell literary societies#Society Hall|Society Hall]] with the other literary societies at Cornell. The Irving was initially a male-only society, but following the lead of Cornell's [[Cornell literary societies#The George William Curtis or Curtis Society|Curtis Literary Society]] (founded in 1872), membership in the Irving became open to women students and remained so throughout its existence.&lt;ref&gt;"A New Wrinkle at Sage", [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22165/2/Era_V13_1880_81.pdf ''The Cornell Era'' (29:2)](Sep. 24, 1886), p. 19 (Quote: "Besides these secret societies there is the Irving Literary Society which is open to both ladies and gentlemen of the college. All are cordially invited to become members. Meetings are held every Friday evening during the college year.")&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1873, members of the Curtis, Irving and Philaletheian societies jointly founded and ran the ''Cornell Review'', "a repository of original articles, essays, stories, Woodford orations, elaborate discussions, and poems."&lt;ref&gt;Hewett, Waterman Thomas (1905).

===Washington Irving's birthday and Cornell's first commencement ===
[[File:Portrait of Washington Irving by John Wesley Jarvis in 1809.jpg|thumb|250 px|alt=Washington Irving as a young man, in coat with fur collar.|[[Washington Irving]]]]
The Irving’s first major event was a celebration of [[Washington Irving|Washington Irving’s]] Birthday on April 3, 1869, at the Cornell Public Library in downtown [[Ithaca, New York]]. [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] both attended.&lt;ref name = "CE3April1869"&gt;Farnham, G.W. and O'Neil, J.. "Irving Literary Association, April 3, 1869", [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=cuda;cc=cuda;q1=Irving;rgn=full%20text;idno=cera001;didno=cera001;node=cera001%3A17;view=image;seq=135;page=root;size=50 ''The Cornell Era''] (Apr. 3, 1869) pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was so well regarded that it was added to the University's annual calendar until the event was eclipsed by the creation of Spring Break.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The first oration "Aristocracy of Sex" explored the natural law-based presumption of male supremacy in American and concluded that the assumption was based solely on "the prejudice of man."   After a musical interlude came an essay on "Our Capital and the War", recalling Washington, D.C. during the [[American Civil War]], including the assassination of President Lincoln.  Then came an oration on "Our National Tendency", namely the tendency of emerging nations to undergo an income a widening gap between rich and poor, and social violence that followed that widening.  The delivery was described by the Society's secretaries in ''The Cornell Era'' as "forcible, the orator receiving vigorous applause".&lt;ref name = "CE3April1869" /&gt;  The high point of the first event was a reading from Washington Irving's first major book, ''[[Washington Irving#A History of New York|A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker]]''. The event then closed with an oration by the future Judge [[Morris Lyons Buchwalter]], "On The Poles". His speech on extremes in moral and religious sentiment and action drew an analogy with new developments in physics, comparing the extremes to particles of matter vibrating between the poles of a magnet. In their description of Buchwalter's speech, the Society's secretaries wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The orator noted that some favored the gloomy side of human nature, believing man totally depraved.  Others, he said, dwell in the sunshine, seeing nothing but loveliness and purity.  The truth lies somewhere between these extremes. The easy grace of the speaker, the melody of his voice, and the sparkling thought of the oration, captivated the audience.&lt;ref name = "CE3April1869" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 1869 Commencement Week, the Irving Literary Society invited [[Theodore Tilton]] of the ''New York Independent'' to speak, Wednesday evening before the Thursday graduation exercises.  Society members gathered with guests again at the Cornell Public Library in downtown Ithaca.  [[Theodore Tilton]] spoke on "the human mind, and how to use it." The following day, Tilton stayed for the ceremonies as members of the Irving Literary Society spoke at the actual Commencement ceremony.  [[Morris Lyons Buchwalter|Morris Buchwalter]] spoke on "The Civil Sabbath Law", [[Joseph Foraker]] spoke on "Three Hundred Lawyers", and [[John Andrew Rea]] gave "A Plea for the Artist".  Buchwalter’s comments were so inflammatory that President White took to the platform before Foraker came to the dais and distanced the Trustees from Buckwalter's oration.&lt;ref&gt;First Commencement Exercises, ''The Ithacan'' (June 22, [http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202//Ithaca%20NY%20Ithaca/Ithaca%20NY%20Ithaca%201868%20-%201870%20pdf/Newspaper%20Ithaca%20NY%20Ithaca%201868%20-%201870%20-%200251.pdf 1869]); see also ''The Cornell Era'' (Sept. 15, 1869) at 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As John Rea recalled: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;President White in the presentation of the diplomas used these words, "Let your course be true." He also said, having in mind Buchwalter's speech, that the young men who made the talks were speaking their own thoughts and that the University was in no way responsible for their sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Rea, "The Immortal Eight", ''A Half Century at Cornell'' (Cornell Daily Sun)(Cayuga Press, 1930) pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other early exercises===
In mid-October 1869, the first regular meeting of the Irving Literary Society&lt;ref&gt;The name changes to ‘Society” in its second year.&lt;/ref&gt; was called “A Feast of Reason”.  [[Festus Walters]] gave a well-received oration, followed by a scholarly essay.  The question: — ”Resolved that Byron was not a great poet.”  [[Thomas Wilson Spence]] earnestly argued the question in the affirmative; Kirk Ingram in the negative.  The question being settled in the negative, [[Byron]] was placed in rank with [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], and [[Goethe]], which according to the ''Cornell Era'', “no doubt will cause [[Byron]], if his love of adulation has been interred with his bones, to rest easily in his coffin.  The number of visitors was unusually large, and manifested great interest in the discussion.  The topic for discussion for next Friday evening, is:— ‘Resolved that class feeling and distinctions should not be encouraged in the University.’&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (Oct. 20, 1869) at 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  A contest was also held between the Irving and its rival, Philalatheian, over the question “Resolved, that increased wealth is beneficial to the morals of a people.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (Nov. 3, 1869) at 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1870, the Irving took up capital punishment and whether it ought to be abolished&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (March 23, 1870) at 189.&lt;/ref&gt; and the question, “Resolved, That ladies should be admitted to our colleges.” By the end of the second academic year, the Irving diversified activities.  May 1870 saw the first extemporaneous orations, as well as miscellaneous essays such as Edgar Jayne’s “Secret Musings.”  In lieu of the regular debate, the Irving also went into committee-of-the-whole on the Irish question, argument extending beyond midnight. The last event of AY 1869–1870 was a debate on the Protective Tariff.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (June 29, 1870) at 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, it was resolved after debate that the tendency toward world societies was toward ‘the new Democracy.’ &lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (Nov. 25, 1870) at 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering its third decade, the Irving was the largest of the three Cornell literary societies.  It enrolled 26 members during the Fall Term 1880.  ''The Cornell Daily Sun'' noted the benefit of the training provided by the experience, the pleasant rooms assigned by University administrators, and the hearty support provided by the Cornell Faculty.  Despite these benefits, the Irving and its peers were losing the interest of the Cornell Student body. That only fourteen percent of Cornell students were active in the societies was seen as an intellectual weakness.&lt;ref name="CDS1October1880p18"&gt;Editorial, ''The Cornell Daily Sun'' (10:2)(Oct. 1, 1880) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22165/2/Era_V13_1880_81.pdf 18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief among the greatest distractions were the Greek letter fraternities, whose members lacked time or interest in activities outside their fraternal societies.  With insufficient numbers, society members were required to present or compete every three weeks.  The resulting literary activity was thought to be accordingly weak, further impacting on the quality and subsequent attendance of the  meetings.&lt;ref name="CDS1October1880p18" /&gt; In this environment, the Irving members invited the Cornell community to listen to debates over questions such as "Which has done most toward the promotion of civilization, Art or Science?"&lt;ref&gt;Cornelliana, ''The Cornell Daily Sun'' (13.9)(Nov. 19, 1880) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22165/2/Era_V13_1880_81.pdf 108].&lt;/ref&gt;  The elocutionist Robert P. Williams of New York City read before the Irving the same season.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornell Era'' (13:4)(Oct. 1, 1880) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22165/2/Era_V13_1880_81.pdf 45].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Cornell students attending the [[University of Michigan]] noted that for all their weaknesses, the Irving and its peers compared well against Michigan's literary societies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The literary societies—The Webster and The Jeffersonian—are well attended, but neither have as good or as pleasant rooms as the Irving or Curtis.  The grade of exercises is, if anything, lower than in those just mentioned.".&lt;ref&gt;"The University of Michigan", [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22165/2/Era_V13_1880_81.pdf  ''The Cornell Era'' (13:10)] (Nov. 16, 1880) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following Spring 1881 term, the Irving and the Cornell Club (a debating society) resumed their "union meetings" to bring the best of both organizations together for one evening's entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelliana, ''The Cornell Era'' (13:20)(Feb. 25, 1881) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22165/2/Era_V13_1880_81.pdf 236].&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1882, the Irving hosted a discussant, Professor Shackford, at Association Hall.

Extemporaneous addresses began to resemble those by [[toastmaster]]s, with topics such as "How to Run A Sailboat".  Readings came from current fiction, and poetry.

===Final years===
[[File:White Hall Cornell University 1906 postcard.jpg|thumb|350 px|alt=|Andrew Dickson White Hall which housed [[Cornell literary societies#Society Hall|Society Hall]], the main meeting room for Cornell's 19th century literary societies, including the Irving]]
By 1885, the other main literary societies at Cornell, the Adelpi, Curtis and Philalatheian had ceased to exist. Around the time of the Curtis' demise in 1881, an address by President White attributed the general decline in student interest for these societies to the growth of [[fraternities and sororities]], decreasing importance placed on the power of oratory, and the development of the seminar system in the University.&lt;ref name = "Moyer1896" /&gt; The Irving continued until 1887, but in 1884 the ''Ithaca Daily Democrat'' was already lamenting its decline as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Irving literary society met last evening, but was poorly attended. This institution should be one of the most prosperous student societies in the college, but strange to say, it has deteriorated in point of numbers, and its management has fallen into the hands of technical instead of literary students.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Democrat'' [http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newpapers%20Disk2/Ithaca%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat/Ithaca%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%201884.pdf/Newspaper%20Ithaca%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%201884%20-%200400.PDF#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=1122e432&amp;DocId=1819376&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=4&amp;hits=771+915+a16+a17+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf 2] (Sept. 27, 1884)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the move away from the English collegiate model and toward the German seminar system and a greater dedication of resources to the sciences and engineering (including agricultural sciences), campus leaders increasingly expressed concern about falling standards of recitation, elocution and oratory at Cornell.  The quickened pace of Irving exercises during the academic years 1885, 1886 and 1887 coincided with public expression of these concerns, one of which was an editorial in ''The Cornell Era'' of October 1, 1886:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The character and quality of the literary work done by Cornell students is inferior, in many respects, to that done by students of other colleges. The reason of this is two-fold and arises from a lack of opportunity and a want of interest, on the part of the students, in that direction. Who is there among us that does not realize the value of being able to address the people on questions of public moment!  Our classes in Elocution and Oratory go a great ways, but the work of the literary society ought to begin here and supplement the work of the class room. Irving Society and the Mock Congress are steps in the right direction, but their influence does not reach far enough. Either the character of their work is not such as to merit the attention of the students, or there is a disability arising from the lack of numbers. In other colleges there are societies that have large circulating libraries and that hold annual society contests. In addition to this, there are inter-collegiate contests and the matter goes so far even, that contestants meet from different states to determine where is the  'prince of college orators'. We have our Inter-collegiate Athletic Sports, why can we not have Intercollegiate Oratorical Contests ?&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''The Cornell Era'' (29:3)(Oct. 1, 1886) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/22164/2/Era_V19_1886_87.pdf 19].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To appeal to broader audiences, the Irving sponsored events that would be more properly defined as 'popular entertainment' rather than of the traditional literary society genre.  During the Fall Term, 1886, the society hosted Professor Spenser Baird Newberry and his [[stereopticon]] entertainments, most notably show featuring vistas of Athens, Constantinople and Egypt.  Newberry’s presentations proved popular enough for the Irving to charge admission.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelliana, The Cornell Era (29:5)(Oct. 15, 1886) at 19; id.

By the winter of 1887, the members settled on a two-part presentation.  The first part would include exercises in parliamentary practice, a paper reading, and perhaps a recitation or debate. Part two would include a social hour with music. Papers included topics such as "Cornell University Lake Survey", "Political History of Japan", "Small Nations", "Influence of the Jesuits on the Five Nations", and "Etching".&lt;ref&gt;"Irving Literary Society", ''The Cornell Era'' (29:14) (Jan. 21, 1887) p. 162; "Cornelliana", ''The Cornell Era'' (29:16) (Feb. 4, 1887) p. 176; "Cornelliana", ''The Cornell Era'' (29:16) (Apr. 29, 1887) p. 296; "Cornelliana", ''The Cornell Era'' (29: 27) (May 13, 1887) p. 318.

The Irving Literary Society's last public meeting was held on May 23, 1887.&lt;ref name = "Moyer1896" /&gt; After that it ceased to exist as a Cornell University society. However, the Cornell University Residence Plan of 1966 describes the Irving Literary Society as "doing business as the New York Alpha Chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at Cornell University".&lt;ref&gt;Schedule I, Appendix A, Cornell University Residence Plan of 1966, at [http://www.phikappapsi-cornell.org/141-pkpcor/files/1966_0416_CURP_66_Final_w_Appx.pdf 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of fraternities and sororities at Cornell University|New York Alpha chapter]] of [[Phi Kappa Psi]] describes itself as having "served as steward of the Irving Literary Society since 1888".&lt;ref name="phikappapsi-cornell" /&gt; The fraternity chapter has also claimed to have been "founded in 1868 through the Irving Literary Society."&lt;ref&gt;New York Alpha chapter of [[Phi Kappa Psi]].

==Members' later careers ==
[[File:Seeing Europe with famous authors (1914) - frontispiece.jpg|thumb|190 px|left|[[Francis Whiting Halsey]]'s ''Seeing Europe with Famous Authors'' (1914)]]
After graduating from Cornell, a number of Irving member had careers reflecting the literary and oratorical activities of the Society.

[[Harry Falkenau]] (1885), an early defender of [[Walt Whitman]]'s poetry and one of [[Cornell Chimes|Cornell's Chimes Masters]], went on to a career as a music critic for the ''[[Chicago Times|Chicago Herald]]'' and later as the owner of an antiquarian book shop in Chicago. [[Francis Whiting Halsey]] (1873), was a prolific journalist and author who wrote for ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 1880 to 1896 and served as its literary editor from 1892. Dewitt John Brigham (1870) was an editor and publisher at [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].  A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Brigham was appointed American Counsel at [[Aix-La-Chapelle]]. On his return to Iowa, he served as editor of the ''Midland Monthly'' prior to taking the position of State Librarian. Among his works of literature were ''The Youth of Old Age'' (1933), awarded outstanding contribution by an Iowa author in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News (39:6)(Oct. 29, 1936) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3554/30/039_06.pdf 76].&lt;/ref&gt;

John Bogert Laurence (1872) was a newspaper man known throughout the West. At Cornell he was elected president of his class in his junior year and was a member of the [[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity. In 1883 Laurence moved to [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] where he worked as the commercial editor, vice-president, and managing editor of the ''[[Kansas City Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News (20:27 )( March 28, 1918 ) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3535/12/020_27.pdf 316].&lt;/ref&gt; James L. Knapp (1880) worked for the ''[[Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger]]'' for over 55 years, between 1880 and 1940 eventually becoming its city editor. He also served  for four years served as the night editor of the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]''.  Prior to returning to Cornell for his first reunion in sixty years (1940), Knapp noted to a reporter:
[[File:Morris Lyons Buchwalter.jpg|thumb|200 px|Judge [[Morris Lyon Buchwalter]], third president of the Irving Literary Society]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[we] had no intercollegiate football. We played rugby, which is something like soccer. Drilling was the principal exercise. We had literary societies. Mine was called the Irving Literary Society, and in my Junior year I was editor of its Literary Review. Boys then were much the same as now as regards mischief, but the pranks were different. Ours would probably seem too tame today."&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News (42:35)(Aug. 1940) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3583/1/042_35.pdf 491].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Irving produced at least one member who later excelled in the mechanics of literary production.  William Henry French became a [[Type foundry|type founder]].  Born in [[Griggsville, Illinois]], French studied at Cornell between 1869 and 1873 and then at the [[University of Leipzig]]. On his return to the United States, he became agent and assistant general manager for the [[Associated Press]] in [[Chicago]] and [[New York, New York|New York City]] between 1873 and 1885. After a stint with the Oak Ranch Company, he became  secretary and director of the type founders Barnhart Bros. &amp; Spindler in 1887.  The position at Barnhart established French in the industry, and he was soon a president and director of St. Louis Printer's Supply Company and director and vice president of Fundicion Mexicana de Tipos in [[Mexico City]] as well as director of several other American type foundries.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Chicagoans: A Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men  (John W.

Several of the Irving's former members and orators entered the legal profession. The third president of the Irving Literary Society, Judge [[Morris Lyon Buchwalter]] entered the legal profession, as did his college roommate and fellow society member, Senator [[Joseph Benson Foraker]].  So too, did Edward L. Parker (1871), who transferred from [[Amherst College]] to Cornell during the University’s first year.  He entered the law office of his father, Perry Greene Parker, a trial lawyer. The younger Parker practiced law for thirty years and was a lecturer in the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|Buffalo Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News (20:34)(May 16, 1918) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3535/5/020_34.pdf 402].&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Harding (1881) attended [[Albany Law School]] after graduation from Cornell and was admitted to the bar at [[Binghamton, New York]]. He later served as deputy tax collector for [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York]], owned a cigar factory, and became president of the Orange County Trust Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News (25:34))(May 31, 1923) at [http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3540/7/025_34.pdf 422].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ira Adelbert Place (1881) also became a lawyer.

'''James Oswald''' (1710–1769) was a Scottish [[composer]], arranger, cellist, and music publisher, who was appointed as Chamber Composer for King [[George III]] but also wrote and published many Scottish folk tunes.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;David Johnson and Heather Melvill, "Oswald, James".  Grove Music Online.  Accessed March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;"James Oswald (1711–1769)". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.  Accessed March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Oswald was born in [[Crail]], [[Scotland]] in 1710, being baptised on 21 March, and died in [[Knebworth]], [[Hertfordshire]] on 2 January 1769.&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt;  As a young man he worked in [[Dunfermline]], Fife as a musician and dancing master. Throughout his career he maintained an interest in traditional Scottish music, but he also composed in classical ''[[style galant]]'' forms.

In 1741 he left [[Edinburgh]] for [[London]] and [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] lamented this fact in "An Epistle to James Oswald". In London he eventually set up his own publishing house and published the ''[[Caledonian Pocket Companion]]'', a collection of Scottish folktunes, some with his own variations. This ran to 12 volumes and many editions.

Like many others whose works feature in the [[Wighton Collection]] in [[Dundee]], he was a member of "[[The Temple of Apollo]]", a secret musical society of composers in London along with [[Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie]], [[John Reid (composer)|John Reid]], [[Charles Burney]] and others.

==Compositions==
He wrote variations of  popular Scottish [[Scottish folk music|folk tunes]], arranged these for the [[fiddle]] and composed other original tunes in the same [[genre]]. He published his chamber works under the nom de plume "Dottel Figlio".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; A "Collection of Minuets" was published in Edinburgh in 1736 and a "Curious Collection of Scots Tunes" in 1740.

He probably composed "The East Neuk of Fife" and "The Flowers of Edinburgh", "two classic [[Reel (dance)|reel]] tunes of the Scots fiddle repertory", and wrote tunes which were later used for some of [[Robert Burns]]'s song lyrics, included in his ''Caledonian Pocket Companion''. The earliest version of 'Ae Fond Kiss' was closely modelled on Oswald's tune 'Rory Dall's Port'. &lt;ref name="grove"/&gt;

Later, he wrote a collection of German military music, "40 Marches, Tattoos and Night Pieces for two German flutes, violins or guittars as performed by the Prussian and Hessian Armies".

He was appointed Chamber Composer to [[George III]] in 1761, when George became King.&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; Since many of his compositions were written anonymously, research still needs to be done to identify them.

Some of Oswald's most remarkable creations are his two sets of 'Airs for the Seasons' - some 96 compositions in all - each named for a different flower or shrub, and attributed to their appropriate season of the year. They are playable by violin (flute, oboe) and cello, with second violin parts available for 12 of them and therefore performable as trios. Contained within the Wighton Collection in [[Dundee]] is a manuscript of "Airs for Autumn" in the composer's own hand.

'''Johannes Itten''' (11 November 1888 &amp;ndash; 25 March 1967) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Expressionist architecture|expressionist]] [[Painting|painter]], designer, teacher, writer and theorist associated with the [[Bauhaus]] (''Staatliches Bauhaus'') school. Together with German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]] and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], under the direction of German architect [[Walter Gropius]], Itten was part of the core of the [[Weimar]] [[Bauhaus]].

== Life and work ==
He was born in [[Südern-Linden]], Switzerland. From 1904 to 1908 he trained as an elementary school teacher. Beginning in 1908 he taught using methods developed by the creator of the [[kindergarten]] concept, [[Friedrich Fröbel]], and was exposed to the ideas of [[psychoanalysis]]. In 1909 he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts in [[Geneva]] but was unimpressed with the educators there, and returned to [[Bern]]. Itten's studies at the Bern-Hofwil Teachers' Academy with Ernst Schneider proved seminal for his later work as a master at the [[Bauhaus]]. Itten adopted principles espoused by Schneider, including the practice of not correcting his students' creative work on an individual basis, for fear that this would crush the creative impulse. Rather, he selected certain common mistakes to correct for the class as a whole. In 1912, he returned to Geneva, where he studied under [[Eugène Gilliard]], an [[Abstract art|abstract]] painter.

He was heavily influenced by [[Adolf Hölzel]] and [[Franz Cižek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

From Hölzel, Itten adopted a series of basic shapes (the line, the plane, the circle, the spiral) as a means from which to begin creation, and the use of [[gymnastic]] exercises to relax his students and prepare them for the experiences that were to occur in the class.&lt;ref name=droste&gt;Droste, Magdalena (2002).

From 1919 to 1922, Itten taught at the Bauhaus, developing the innovative "preliminary course"&lt;ref&gt;Ruhrberg, Karl, and Walther, Ingo F. (2000). ''Art of the 20th Century'', p. 177. Taschen. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was to teach students the basics of material characteristics, composition, and color. "Itten theorized seven types of color contrast and devised exercises to teach them. His color contrasts include[d] (1) contrast by [[hue]], (2) contrast by [[Color value|value]], (3) contrast by [[Color temperature|temperature]], (4) contrast by [[Complementary colors|complements]] (neutralization), (5) simultaneous contrast (from [[Michel Eugène Chevreul |Chevreuil]]), (6) contrast by [[Color saturation|saturation]] (mixtures with gray), and (7) contrast by extension (from [[Goethe]])."&lt;ref name=burton1984 /&gt;

In 1919 he invited [[Gertrud Grunow]], to teach a course on the "theory of harmony" at the Bauhaus. This involved using music and relaxation techniques with the aim of improving the students' creativity.&lt;ref name="Forgács1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Éva Forgács|title=The Bauhaus Idea and Bauhaus Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMOdpTeMM1AC&amp;pg=PA58|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-1-85866-012-7|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 Itten invited [[Paul Klee]] and [[Georg Muche]] to join him at the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1924, Itten established the “Ontos Weaving Workshops” near [[Zurich]], with the help of Bauhaus weaver [[Gunta Stölzl]].{{verification needed|date=December 2018}}

Itten was a follower of [[Mazdaznan]], a fire cult originating in the United States that was largely derived from [[Zoroastrianism]]. He observed a strict [[vegetarian]] diet and practiced [[meditation]] as a means to develop inner understanding and intuition, which was for him the principal source of artistic inspiration and practice.&lt;ref name=droste/&gt; Itten's mysticism and the reverence in which he was held by a group of the students, some of whom converted to Mazdaznan (e.g. Georg Muche), created conflict with Walter Gropius who wanted to move the school in a direction that embraced [[mass production]] rather than solely individual artistic expression. The rift led to Itten's resignation from the Bauhaus and his prompt replacement by [[László Moholy-Nagy]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Droste and the Bauhaus Archive, Bauhaus, Taschen, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raizman, David (2003). ''A History of Modern Design'', p. 184. London: Laurence King Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|1-85669-348-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926 to 1934 he had a small art and architecture school in Berlin, in which [[Ernst Neufert]], the former chief-architect of Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus, taught as well from 1932 to 1934.

Itten's works exploring the use and composition of color resemble the square [[op art]] canvases of artists such as [[Josef Albers]], [[Max Bill]] and [[Bridget Riley]], and the [[expressionist]] works of [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

== Influence ==
Itten's work on color is also said to be an inspiration for [[color analysis (art)|seasonal color analysis]]. Itten had been the first to associate color palettes with four types of people, and had designated those types with the names of [[seasons]]. His studies of color palettes and color interaction directly influenced the Op Art movement and other color abstraction base movements. Shortly after his death, his designations gained popularity in the [[cosmetics]] industry with the publication of ''[[Color analysis (art)#Bernice Kentner.2C Color Me a Season .281978.29|Color Me A Season]]''. Cosmetologists today continue to use seasonal color analysis, a tribute to the early work by Itten.&lt;ref name=burton1984&gt;{{citation |title=Applying Color |author= David Burton |journal= Art Education |volume= 37 |year=1984 |publisher=National Art Education Association |location=USA |jstor=3192794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|John Maxwell Hall}}

'''John Hall Maxwell''' of Dargavel [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[FRSE]] (1812–1866) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[agriculturist]].

==Life==
Maxwell was born on 20 February 1812, at 19 Queen Street in [[Glasgow]]&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1819&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of William Maxwell of Dargavel, [[Renfrewshire]] (d.1847), and his wife, Mary Campbell, eldest daughter of John Campbell of [[Possil]], near [[Glasgow]]. He was apprenticed as a lawyer but does not appear to have had any university education.

He was called to the Scottish bar as an advocate in 1835.

He practised his profession until 1845, when he succeeded Sir Charles Gordon of Grimkin as secretary to the [[Highland Agricultural Society]]. At this time the number of members was 2,620, and the funds of the society amounted to £34,000; when he retired there were 4,200 members, and the finances had risen to £50,000. The annual shows under his management displayed improvements, and Maxwell paid attention to the collection of agricultural statistics. 

In 1848 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] his  proposer being Sir [[John Macneill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 1856 he was created a Commander of the Order of the Bath (CB). 

On his own estate at Dargavel, Maxwell carried out costly improvements, especially in the reclamation of waste land. 

He died at his residence, Torr Hall, near [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], on 25 August 1866. He is buried at [[Erskine]] Old Parish Church.

==Family==

On 3 August 1843 he married Eliza Anne Margaret Williams (d.1907), the eldest daughter of Thomas Williams of Southwick Crescent, [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London.

'''Leader's Challenge''' was a [[Colorado]], USA, based [[nonprofit organization]] that provided leadership training to high potential students through [[experiential education]] programs. Their mission was to create civic and service minded youth by developing leadership skills, inspiring purpose, and developing engagement in their communities. As of October 28, 2009, Leader's Challenge was shut down due to financial difficulties.

Leader's Challenge operated three programs, serving around 750 high school students annually.

== History ==

Leader's Challenge was founded in 2000 by American author [[Tommy Spaulding]], who serves as President/CEO of [[Up with People]]. The organization initially offered one program serving 60 eleventh grade students at 10 high schools in metro [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]. 

In 2006, the organization expanded, with the introduction of a program aimed at high school seniors, and the absorption of the long-established Colorado Close Up program.


== Programs ==

=== IGNITE ===
The flagship program, IGNITE is a year-long experience for high school juniors focusing on [[leadership development]], [[service learning]] and [[civic engagement]]. Beginning with a four-day Summer Academy, students develop knowledge, skills and behaviors related to leadership and active citizenship, including self-confidence, team building, [[conflict management]], critical thinking and problem solving skills. 

Throughout the year, teams of students at 35+ schools along Colorado's [[Front Range]] participate in monthly Challenges and service projects designed to involve them in their local communities while exploring topics such as [[community building]], the role of media in society, leadership in the workplace, and state and local government.  

IGNITE culminates with each school team identifying a need in their community and partnering with an outside organization to implement a project that helps that need.

=== Global Challenge ===
Global Challenge is a yearlong experience for high school seniors designed to expand students’ [[worldview]] and explore leadership in a global context, beginning with a 3-day Summer Academy. 

Throughout their senior year, students participate in monthly seminars centered on issues related to global leadership, including intercultural communication, [[diplomacy]], economics and development.  In addition, they examine topics such as indigenous cultures, historic and current conflict, the role of women, [[human rights]], and policies concerning the environment, health, and service. 

The cornerstone of Global Challenge is an international trip over Spring Break, in which students live and work with citizens of either [[Costa Rica]] or [[Slovakia]], and have the opportunity to experience their culture and customs firsthand while making a difference in the community.

=== Colorado Close Up ===
Colorado Close Up has been the state's largest civic education initiative since 1979, bringing students from across Colorado to the state Capitol for three days. 

While visiting Denver, students have the opportunity to observe the state legislature and courts, meet with elected officials from each branch of government, and work with [[lobbyists]] and business leaders to discuss how they can impact their communities.

Participants return home from Colorado Close Up with the knowledge and skills to identify problems and draw on local resources to create change in their communities.

Colorado Close Up was absorbed by Leader's Challenge in 2006.

== Fees ==
Each Leader's Challenge program requires a fee which covers all costs associated with participation, including materials, staffing, facilities, accommodations, meals, and [[honorarium]]s.

A hall, wall, or walk of fame is a list of individuals, achievements, or animals, usually chosen by a group of electors, to mark their [[Wiktionary:fame|fame]] in their field. In some cases, these halls of fame consist of actual halls or museums which enshrine the honorees with sculptures, plaques, and displays of memorabilia and general information regarding the inducted recipients. Sometimes, the honorees' plaques may instead be posted on a wall (hence a "wall of fame") or inscribed on a sidewalk (as in a "walk of fame" or an "avenue of fame"). In other cases, the hall of fame is more figurative and simply consists of a list of names of noteworthy people and their achievements and contributions. The lists are maintained by an organization or community, and may be national, state, local, or private.
==Etymology==
The English-language term was popularised in the United States by the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] at [[Bronx Community College]], in [[New York City]], in the form of a sculpture gallery completed in 1900 and officially declared the following year in 1901. Its inspiration is the [[Ruhmeshalle (Munich)|Ruhmeshalle]] ("Hall of Fame") in [[Munich, Germany]]. The [[Walhalla memorial]] in [[Bavaria, Germany]], is an even earlier hall of fame, conceived in 1807 and built between 1830 and 1842. The meaning of "fame" has changed over the years, originally meaning "renown" as opposed to today's more common meaning of "[[celebrity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R.

'''Max Bill''' (22 December 1908 &amp;ndash; 9 December 1994) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[architect]], [[artist]], [[Painting|painter]], [[typeface designer]], [[industrial designer]] and [[graphic designer]].

== Early life and education ==
Bill was born in [[Winterthur]]. After an [[apprenticeship]] as a [[silversmith]] during 1924-1927, Bill took up studies at the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]] under many teachers including [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[Oskar Schlemmer]] from 1927 to 1929, after which he moved to Zurich.

=== Art and design ===
After working on graphic designs for the few modern buildings being constructed, he built his first work, his own house and studio (1932–3) in Zurich-Höngg.&lt;ref name="Max Bill"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=559 Max Bill] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1937 onwards he was a prime mover behind the [[Allianz (arts)|Allianz]] group of Swiss artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo.info/isast/awardwinners.html Leonardo biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill is widely considered the single most decisive influence on Swiss graphic design beginning in the 1950s with his theoretical writing and progressive work.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis, R., ''Swiss Graphic Design, 1920-1965'', (2006), New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His connection to the days of the Modern Movement gave him special authority. As an industrial designer, his work is characterized by a clarity of design and precise proportions.&lt;ref name=KK&gt;Krippendorf, K., ''The Semantic Turn'', (2005), New York: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the elegant clocks and watches designed for [[Junghans]], a long-term client. Among Bill's most notable product designs is the "''Ulmer Hocker''" of 1954, a stool that can also be used as a shelf element, a speaker's desk, a tablet or a side table. Although the stool was a creation of Bill and Ulm school designer Hans Gugelot, it is often called "''Bill Hocker''" because the first sketch on a cocktail napkin was Bill's work.

As a designer and artist, Bill sought to create forms which visually represent the New Physics of the early 20th century. He sought to create objects so that the new science of form could be understood by the senses: that is as a [[concrete art]]. Thus Bill is not a rationalist – as is typically thought – but rather a phenomenologist. One who understands embodiment as the ultimate expression of a concrete art. In this way he is not so much extending as re-interpreting Bauhaus theory. Yet curiously Bill's critical interpreters have not really grasped this fundamental issue.&lt;ref name=KK/&gt; He made spare geometric paintings and spherical sculptures, some based on the [[Möbius strip]], in stone, wood, metal and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/baltimore/baltimore1.html Work in Baltimore sculpture garden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (December 14, 1994), [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/obituaries/max-bill-85-painter-sculptor-and-architect-in-austere-style.html Max Bill, 85, Painter, Sculptor And Architect in Austere Style] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His architectural work included an office building in Germany, a radio studio in Zurich, and a bridge in eastern Switzerland.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-14/local/me-8686_1_max-bill Max Bill, 85; Controversial Swiss : Artist, Sculptor and Writer] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', December 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He continued to produce architectural designs, such as those for a museum of contemporary art (1981) in Florence and for the [[Bauhaus Archive]] (1987) in Berlin. In 1982 he also entered a competition for an addition to the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin, built to a design by [[Mies van der Rohe]].&lt;ref name="Max Bill"/&gt; ''Pavillon-Skulptur (1979–83)'', a large [[granite]] sculpture, was installed adjacent to the [[Bahnhofstrasse, Zürich]] in 1983. As is often the case with modern art in public places, the installation generated some controversy. ''[[Endlose Treppe]]'' (1991), a sculpture made of North American granite, was designed for the philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]].

In 1982 he was awarded the [[Sir Misha Black]] award and was added to the [[College of Medallists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mishablackawards.org.uk/the-medal Website of ''The Sir Misha Black Awards'' - Sir Misha Black Medal]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
In 1944, Bill became a professor at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]]. In 1953, alongside [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], he founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: ''Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm'') in [[Ulm]], [[Germany]], a design school initially created in the tradition of the [[Bauhaus]] and which later developed a new design education approach integrating art and science. The school was notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968. Faculty and students included [[Tomás Maldonado]], [[Otl Aicher]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Johannes Itten]], John Lottes, Walter Zeischegg, and [[Peter Seitz]].

Bill was a professor at the [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg]] and chair of Environmental Design from 1967 to 1974. In 1973 he became an associate member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Science, Literature and Fine Art in [[Brussels]]. In 1976 he became a member of the [[Akademie der Künste|Berlin Academy of Arts]]. In addition to his teaching, Bill wrote and lectured extensively on art, architecture and design, appearing at symposiums and design conferences around the world. In particular, he wrote books about [[Le Corbusier]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and artistic theory.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Bill executed many public sculptures in Europe and exhibited extensively in galleries and museums, including a retrospective at the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]] in 1968-69. He had his first exhibition in the United States at the Staempfli Gallery in New York City in 1963 and was the subject of retrospectives at the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] in Buffalo and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1974, and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City in 1988. He participated in [[documenta]]s I (1955), II (1959), and III (1964). In 1993, he received the [[Praemium Imperiale]] for sculpture, awarded by the [[Emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Bill is credited with having been "the spark that lighted the fuse of Brazil's artistic revolution" and the country's "movement toward concrete art"&lt;ref&gt;Pepe Carmel (January 20, 1995), [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/arts/art-review-gathering-up-the-rich-strands-of-the-brazilian-avant-garde.html Gathering Up the Rich Strands of the Brazilian Avant-Garde] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; with his 1951 retrospective at the [[São Paulo Museum of Modern Art]]. He strongly influenced Brazilian artists like [[Franz Weissmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Johnson (July 25, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/25/arts/25weissmann.html Franz Weissmann, Leading Brazilian Sculptor, Dies at 93] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
After a liaison with [[Nusch Éluard]], Bill married the cellist and photographer Binia Mathilde Spoerri in January 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, A., ''max bill und seine zeit, vol. 1: mit subversivem glanz'', (2008), Zürich: Scheidegger &amp; Spiess, p. 255. (marriage)&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1988. From 1974 he was living together with art historian Angela Thomas; they married in 1991.

Bill was also involved in politics. He was elected to the Zurich municipal council in 1961.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt; From 1967 to 1971, he served as a member of the [[National Council of Switzerland|Swiss National Council]].

Bill died en route to a hospital after collapsing from a heart attack at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]. He was 85 and lived in Zumikon, a Zürich suburb.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; 

In 1996, Jakob Bill, the son of Max, founded the Swiss Max Bill Foundation (''max, binia + jakob bill stiftung''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bill-stiftung.ch/ "max, binia + jakob bill stiftung" website]&lt;/ref&gt;) and implemented the idea of his father. The purpose of the foundation is to collect and take care of the works in possession of the Bill family, as well as the promotion of scientific research.

According to the Science Education Institute of the Philippines, "she has left a legacy of teaching with compassion to the young generation of math and science teachers" and "her ability to simplify esoteric concepts into lessons easily understood by young minds significantly helped in demystifying mathematics".&lt;ref name="National Awardees"&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/june/03/yehey/top_stories/20080603top7.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122110731/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/june/03/yehey/top_stories/20080603top7.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational background==
Milagros Dimal Ibe was born in Lubao, [[Pampanga]] in 1931, but moved to Manila to study. She graduated ''summa cum laude'' from the now defunct [[Quezon College]] in Manila, with a BA in English and BSc major in mathematics. She taught for a few years in her hometown before she transferred to teach at the [[University of the Philippines Rural High School]] at Los Baños, Laguna. Eventually, she moved to the University of the Philippines Diliman, where she finished her Master of Arts major in curriculum and instruction. Later on, she got her PhD from the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]]. She almost became Dean of the College of Education in 1990, but instead she became Vice Chancellor of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].

==Awards and achievements==
In 1993 Ibe was appointed Director of the University of the Philippines - Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development (UP-ISMED). The [[Dolores Hernandez Lecture Series]] in science education was started by her during the start of her term, to be a monthly Friday afternoon event as part of the Institution's extension activities. The series continued through the years of her directorship and long after her term, though much less frequently. In December 1995, Dr. Ibe represented the Philippines in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).&lt;ref name="Appendix G TIMSS Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timss.bc.edu/timss1995i/TIMSSPDF/QAApG.pdf |format=PDF |title=Appendix G : TIMSS INTERNATIONAL CODING RELIABILITY STUDY
|website=Timss.bc.edu |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retired life==
Ibe retired from UP-ISMED in November 1996 on her sixty-fifth birthday, following the practice of those in government service, but she continued to work as consultant to various educational institutions and to the Professional Regulation Commission. Presently,{{when|date=January 2011}} Dr. Ibe, already in her mid-70s, is the Dean of Graduate School of [[Miriam College]] in Quezon City  and concurrently [[professor emeritus]] in the College of Education of the University of the Philippines, where she is still very active in promoting, among others, mathematics education.&lt;ref name = "Miriam College"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miriamcollege.com/academicunits/graduateschool/adminstaff.html |title=HugeDomains.com - MiriamCollege.com is for sale |publisher=Miriam College |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST)''', formerly known as '''Polytechnic of Namibia''', is an institute of tertiary education in [[Windhoek]], [[Namibia]]. It is headed by [[Vice chancellor]] [[Tjama Tjivikua]]. The largely ceremonial role of [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the university is held by [[Peter Katjavivi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Katjavivi appointed NUST chancellor | newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] | date= 18 October 2016 | url=https://www.newera.com.na/2016/10/18/katjavivi-appointed-nust-chancellor/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NUST emerged from the ''Academy for Tertiary Education'', founded in 1980, which was the first institution of higher education in Namibia. Act 9 of 1985 of the South African administration defined three sections for this academy, a university part, the ''College of Out-of-School Training'' (''COST'') for [[vocational education|vocational training]] programs, and the ''Technikon Namibia'' for technical programs related to science and technology.&lt;ref name="PolyHist"/&gt; When in 1992 the [[University of Namibia]] (UNAM) was founded, the Academy lost its university section. The remaining sections, COST and Technikon, were merged to form the ''Polytechnic of Namibia'' per Act of Parliament 33 / 1994.&lt;ref name="PolyHist"/&gt; In 2015 the Polytechnic was renamed Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST), again per Act of Parliament, as the 1994 Act prescribed the name "Polytechnic of Namibia".

[[File:Elisabeth House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Elisabeth house on NUST's main campus|alt=A red-roofed yellow building in bright sunlight, built in German colonial style. Over the entrance is a red cross and the inscription "Elisabeth Haus"]]
NUST consists of two campuses and a number of scattered former residential buildings all located in the [[Windhoek West]] suburb close to the [[Windhoek Central Business District|city centre]]. The main campus consists of the structures originally erected for the ''Academy for Tertiary Education''.&lt;ref name="PolyHist"/&gt; At its center is the Elisabeth house, Windhoek's former [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] hospital designed by [[Wilhelm Sander]] in 1907. Elisabeth house is a national monument since 1986 and houses the [[Academic senate|Senate]] chambers and the office of the Vice-Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Engineering campus'' is adjacent to the main campus; construction of this area started in 1995.&lt;ref name="JA"/&gt; Originally intended to house only the School of Engineering, this campus has gradually grown and accommodates the library, all [[auditorium|auditoria]], and many of the other faculty venues, including, most recently, a new building for the School of Health Sciences. A further building, to house new lecture venues and the Department of Architecture, is currently being constructed on this campus.

==Academic and vocational offerings==
[[File:Polytechnic of Namibia 01.JPG|thumb|NUST main campus]]
As a classic [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]] the institution offers both higher-level [[vocational training]] and academic degrees in technical subjects and the [[applied science]]s. In many cases these programs can be combined such that the academic degree can be attempted after a more basic vocational training was successfully passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Namibia University of Science and Technology comprises six academic faculties and offers undergraduate as well as postgraduate degrees in the areas of business and management, engineering, information technology, journalism, hospitality, natural resource management, and medicine. {{As of|2010}} there were 86 [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and 19 [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] degrees offered at the institution.&lt;ref name="PolyHist"&gt;[http://www.polytechnic.edu.na/about_us/history.php Polytechnic of Namibia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105015559/http://www.polytechnic.edu.na/about_us/history.php |date=5 January 2011 }} Historical Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition with the University of Namibia==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the argument about who delivers the best tertiary education in Namibia entered a new stage when a local study found the NUST again to be far ahead in terms of services delivery.

==Naming controversy==

The Polytechnic of Namibia had for a number of years attempted to change its name and its mandate to that of a Namibia's University of Science and Technology. The institution intermittently adopted the name on its web site and in much of its official communication.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; This, however, was against the law that established the institution. In August 2010 the motion was stopped by [[Cabinet of Namibia|cabinet]], stating upcoming overall changes to the [[Education in Namibia|Namibian education sector]] as the reason to decline the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two years later in December 2012 cabinet instructed the Ministry of Education to grant the Polytechnic of Namibia university status and a change to the desired name. Part of the transition process was the phasing out of one-year ''Diploma'' and one-semester ''Certificate'' courses within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Oil Barons Epyx 1a.jpg|thumb|left|''Oil Barons'' on the ''Commodore 64'']]
'''''Oil Barons''''' is both a strategy and simulation-type, [[turn-based game]], published by [[Epyx]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. It was released for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/oil-barons ''Oil Barons''] from [[MobyGames]] (retrieved on November 12, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the rarest of all Epyx games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=4307 ''Oil Barons''] from [[Home of the Underdogs]] (retrieved on November 12, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oil Barons'' represents an unusual fusion between a [[Personal computer game|computer game]] and a [[board game]], in that it included a game board consisting of a 50 X 40 square grid, as well as numerous individual game tokens, used to denote the significance of various grid locations (which corresponded to various [[terrain]]-specific locations within the game). ''Oil Barons'' was thus much like a numerically complex board game, in which the computer kept track of the numerous variables. The game could be played in any one of several modes, and with from one to eight players. Unfortunately, the fact this game has been out-of-print since the mid-1980s, and thus very few people today have an ''Oil Barons'' game board and tokens (particularly in light of the fact that only a very small number of copies were sold when it was in publication), potentially limits the game's appeal in contemporary times.

On 26 December 2014, the [[Internet Archive]] published the game as a [[DOSBox]] game.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oil_Barons_1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Oil Barons'' received mixed reviews. Although it was awarded a Certificate of Merit in the category of "1984 Best Multi-Player Video Game/Computer Game" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} ''[[Ahoy!]]'' criticized the pace of the game, noting that each player had to "sit at the computer for several minutes. Other players can use this time to strategize, but things can get pretty slow. ''Oil Barons'', for all its complexity, may not keep you entertained while you are waiting".&lt;ref name="herring198409"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_09_1984-09_Ion_International_US#page/n33/mode/2upst | title=Oil Barons | work=Ahoy! | date=September 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Herring, Richard | pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Dominion University''' ('''ODU''') is a [[state university (U.S.)|public]] [[research]] [[university]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].  It was established in 1930 as the Norfolk Division of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] and is now one of the largest universities in [[Virginia]] with an enrollment of 24,670 students for the 2014-2015 academic year. Its main campus covers over {{convert|251|acre|km2}} straddling the city neighborhoods of [[Larchmont-Edgewater|Larchmont]], [[Highland Park, Norfolk, Virginia|Highland Park]], and [[Lambert's Point]], approximately {{convert|5|mi|spell=in}} from [[Downtown Norfolk]].

Old Dominion University is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "Doctoral Universities: Higher Research Activity" and provides nearly $2 billion annually to the regional economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/research |title=Research &amp; Impact - Old Dominion University |publisher=Odu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university offers 168 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to over 24,000 students and is one of the nation's largest providers of online distance learning courses. Old Dominion University has approximately 124,000 alumni in all 50 states and 67 countries. Old Dominion University derives its name from one of Virginia's [[state nickname]]s, "The Old Dominion", given to the state by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] for remaining loyal to the crown during the [[English Civil War]].
==History==
[[File:JAC Chandler.jpg|left|150px|thumb|JAC Chandler]]
The foundations of Old Dominion University began in the minds of administrators and officials at the College of William and Mary in the first decades of the twentieth century. Notable among these men were Robert M. Hughes, a member of the Board of Visitors of William and Mary  from 1893 to 1917, and [[J.A.C. Chandler]], the eighteenth president of that school.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA&gt;Rutyna, Richard A.; Kuehl, John W. ''Old Dominion University: Heritage and Horizons''. Norfolk, Virgina: Donning Company. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Healy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/exhibits/odu75thanniversary/norfolkdivision.htm |title=ODU Libraries Exhibit - ODU 75th Anniversary - 2005 |work= Old Dominion University |date= |accessdate= May 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 after becoming the director of the William and Mary extension in Norfolk, Joseph Healy began organizing classes and finding locations for faculty and staff. He along with the collective efforts of Robert M. Hughes, Dr. J.A.C. Chandler, and A.H. Foreman, a two-year branch division was established on March 13, 1930.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/85/moments/history |title=University History |work= Old Dominion University |date= |accessdate= February 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 1930, the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary held its first class with 206 students (125 men and 81 women) in the old Larchmont School building which was an abandoned elementary school on Hampton Boulevard. On September 3, 1930, H. Edgar Timmerman became the Division's first director.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/units/85/sept-moments/annals-odufirstdecade.pdf |format=Ppdf |title=Annals of the College of William and Mary in Norfolk : The First Decade : 1930-1940 |edition=Revised |work= Old Dominion University  |accessdate= May 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Original sign from Old Dominion University.jpg|thumb|right|Original sign from the Norfolk Division]]

"The Division", as it was often called, started out in the old Larchmont School building and allowed people with less financial assets to attend a school of higher education for two years.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt;  Tuition for the first year was 50 USD.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt; The following September, [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], more commonly known as Virginia Tech, began offering classes at "The Division", expanding the number of courses taught.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt; Old Dominion began educating teachers and engineers. Created in the first year of the [[Great Depression]], the college benefited from federal funding as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt; The [[Public Works Administration]] provided funds for the Administration Building, now Rollins Hall, and [[Foreman Field]], named after A.H. Foreman, an early proponent of the college.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt;

In 1932, Lewis Warrington Webb joined the faculty as an instructor of engineering; he would later be called "the Father of Old Dominion". After serving ten years as an instructor at the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary, Webb was appointed assistant director in 1942. Webb also served as director of the Defense and War Training Program at the college from 1940 to 1944. Through its defense and training classes, the Norfolk Division contributed to the war effort. The program also allowed the school to remain open during a period when most young men were serving their country. The program attracted many women, who learn aircraft repair, drafting and other war-related subjects. In 1946, Webb was appointed Director of the Norfolk Division. Webb's dream was to see the Norfolk Division become an independent institution. 

The two-year Norfolk Division rapidly evolved into a four-year institution, and Webb saw his dream fulfilled in 1962 when the Norfolk Division gained its independence from William and Mary. On February 16, 1962, the William and Mary system was dissolved under General Assembly legislation that was signed by [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Albertis S. Harrison]]. Later that year the Norfolk Division was renamed Old Dominion College.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Dr. Webb served as the first president of Old Dominion College from 1962 to 1969.

Frank Batten, who was the publisher of ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' and ''[[The Ledger-Star]]'' and member of the Norfolk Division's advisory board, was chosen as the first rector of Old Dominion College on May 27, 1962. He held the position of rector until 1970 and the College of Engineering was named in his honor in 2004. In 1964, the first students lived on campus in the first dormitories, Rodgers and Gresham hall which were names after members of the advisory board.

In 1969, Old Dominion College transitioned to Old Dominion University under the leadership of President James L. Bugg, Jr. During Bugg's tenure the first doctoral programs were established along with a university-wide governance structure in which faculty, administrators and students were represented. Bugg also reestablished the [[Army ROTC]] program that had been originally created in 1948 but had been abandoned because of the outbreak of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/about/president/past-presidents/james-bugg |title=James L. Bugg, Jr. |work= Old Dominion University |date=May 23, 2013  |accessdate=February 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/about/historyandarchives/75-great-moments |title=75 Great Moments in ODU History |work= Old Dominion University |date= |accessdate=February 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Old Larchmont School Building.jpg|thumb|right|Old Larchmont School Building where the first classes were held]]

In the 1970s, during the tenure of President Alfred B. Rollins, Jr., Old Dominion began mutual partnerships between regional organizations such as [[NASA]], the [[U.S. Navy]], [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]], and [[Norfolk State University]]. This was a result of Dr. Rollins goal of becoming the leading educational institution in the [[Hampton Roads]] area. Under Rollins, the university expanded its state and private funding, improved student services and introduced an honors program along with many other improvements to the university. In 1971 the university established its own campus police force and hired several police officers to patrol the campus. In 1977, the Virginia Campus Police Act was made into a law, the university helped train local and campus police officers and the campus police officers were given full police authority on and around the campus grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/about/president/past-presidents/alfred-rollins |title=Alfred B. Rollins, Jr. |work= Old Dominion University |date= |accessdate=February 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college grew southward along Hampton Boulevard, turning an empty field into a sprawling campus. After completion at the Norfolk Division, students would move on to schools offering degrees or would seek careers locally. "The Division" began by educating teachers and engineers.

In 1962, it became an autonomous four-year college under the name Old Dominion College.

Following growth in enrollment, the expansion of research facilities, and preparation for the addition of graduate programs, the board to seek and receive university status in 1969.&lt;ref name=RUTYNA/&gt;

Since this time, the university has continued to grow and now has an enrollment of over 24,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.odu.edu/undergraduate.php?page=stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215104839/http://admissions.odu.edu/undergraduate.php?page=stats |dead-url=yes |archive-date= December 15, 2008 |title=Undergraduate Statistics |work= Old Dominion University |accessdate=February 18, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 8,600 seat arena has become the home of both men's and women's basketball, as well as a premiere venue for concerts and other performances. The "Ted" as it is affectionately called by students and alumni is part of a $55 million {{convert|75|acre|ha|adj=on}} development known as The University Village.

[[File:Monarch Fountain during Homecoming.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Monarch Fountain during Homecoming]]

Student housing has grown at ODU. The Quad, a collection of six new residential buildings—Ireland House (2006), Virginia House (2007), Scotland House (2008), France House (2009), England House (2009), Dominion House (2009)—and offices brings Old Dominion University closer to its goal of becoming a more residential university. Constructed alongside the Quad is the new student Recreation and Wellness Center. The center offers intramural and extramurals for the students and staff. ODU has expanded its sports facilities, recently completing the Folkes-Stevens Indoor Tennis Center and the Powhatan Sports Complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/305111 |title=Ground broken on ODU's $17 million Powhatan Sports Center &amp;#124; Sports &amp;#124; pilotonline.com |website=Hamptonroads.com |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|48000|sqft|adj=on}} facility that houses the intercollegiate athletic programs of field hockey, women's lacrosse, and football. Another football-related project was the renovation of Old Dominion University's historic [[Foreman Field]] for the sport's reintroduction in 2009.

Among the facilities are the fully automated Perry Library, laboratories in the sciences and engineering, the E.V.

Each of these churches has a campus ministry presence at ODU, as does [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life]], and the [[Islam|Tidewater Islamic Center]], which serves the [[Muslim]] community at ODU.

===Maglev===
In 1999, ODU agreed to work with American Maglev Technogies of Atlanta to construct an on-campus student transportation link of less than one mile using a ''smart train / dumb track'' design in which most sensors, magnets, and computation were located on the train rather than the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NJ&amp;p_theme=nj&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F420E16183164ED&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title = Maglev train makes tracks to Va |publisher=news-journalonline.org |first = Michael |last = Giusti |date =12 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cost and safety concern, several other institutes of higher learning rejected the project. While projected to cost less to build per mile than existing systems, the ODU maglev was never operational. After depleting its $14 million budget, a groundbreaking was held in 2001, the project was completed in 2002; and the technology failed: the vehicle lost its "float" and come to a full friction stop on top of the rail, damaging much of the system. American Maglev and ODU dissolved their relationship and the project became an internal university research project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.odu.edu/maglev/ |title=Maglev Development Project |publisher=Eng.odu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316085226/http://eng.odu.edu/maglev/ |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orgs.odu.edu/studentvoice/secondmeeting.html |title=The Student Voice: Will the Maglev Ever Run? |publisher=Dominion University |accessdate=5 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117053205/http://orgs.odu.edu/studentvoice/secondmeeting.html |archivedate=17 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sci.odu.edu/sci/scire/20Edition/college/maglev.htm |title = President Runte Comments On Status Of Maglev |publisher = Dominion College of Sciences Newsletter |accessdate = 5 February 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901145445/http://sci.odu.edu/sci/scire/20Edition/college/maglev.htm |archivedate = 1 September 2006 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the research team performed an unscheduled test of the car that went smoothly.

''On The Move.'' 10 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, the team retested the sled and was successful despite power outages on campus. ODU subsequently partnered with a Massachusetts-based company to test another maglev train. MagneMotion Inc. was expected to bring its prototype maglev vehicle, about the size of a van, to the campus to test in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hamptonroads.com/2009/02/odu-scientists-have-liftoff-maglev-experiment |title = ODU Scientists have Liftoff on Maglev Experiment |publisher=The Virginian Pilot |date =18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
{{main|Old Dominion Monarchs and Lady Monarchs}}
Old Dominion's 18 athletic teams are known as the [[Old Dominion Monarchs|Monarchs]] (men's teams, plus field hockey, women's lacrosse, and coed sailing) and [[Old Dominion Lady Monarchs|Lady Monarchs]] (all other women's teams) and mostly compete in the NCAA Division I [[Conference USA]] (C-USA). Old Dominion University athletic teams have captured 28 team national championships and four individual titles. The school's best-known sports team is the Lady Monarchs [[basketball]] team, which has won three national championships in 1979 (AIAW), 1980 (AIAW) and 1985 (NCAA). The Lady Monarchs also made it to the 1997 Women's NCAA Championship Game, losing to Tennessee. ODU athletic teams have won a further 28 national championships including 15 in men's and women's sailing and 9 in women's field hockey. The Lady Monarchs' nine national titles in field hockey are in NCAA record books for most titles in that sport by the same school.

In addition, Old Dominion's athletic teams have captured 49 championships in the Colonial Athletic Association.

In March 2010, Dr. Wood Selig became the new athletic director. Previously, Dr. Selig was the athletic director at [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers|Western Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gold, [http://www.insidesocal.com/ucla/2010/03/ross-bjork-named-western-kentu.html Ross Bjork named Western Kentucky University A.D.], ''Los Angeles Daily News'', March 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2012 Old Dominion announced it would move to C-USA on July 1, 2013. Four ODU sports which are not sponsored by C-USA have outside affiliations. In 2013, the [[Collegiate wrestling|Wrestling]] team became an associate of the [[Mid-American Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.mac-sports.com/News/tabid/969/Article/163766/MAC-Adds-Three-Affiliate-Members-In-Wrestling.aspx |title=MAC adds wrestling members |publisher=Mid-American Conference |date=September 19, 2012 |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020212436/http://www.mac-sports.com/News/tabid/969/Article/163766/MAC-Adds-Three-Affiliate-Members-In-Wrestling.aspx |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the field hockey team joined the [[Big East Conference|reconfigured Big East Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vuhoops.com/big-east/2013/5/1/4290556/temple-rutgers-join-new-big-east-lacrosse-field-hockey |title=Temple Joins New Big East in Lacrosse, Field Hockey |first=Brian |last=Ewart |work=VUHoops.com |publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date=May 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's lacrosse team spent the 2014 season (played in the 2013–14 school year) as an [[NCAA independent schools (lacrosse)|independent]] before joining the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.atlanticsun.org/wlacrosse/news/2012-13/7986/a-sun-welcomes-old-dominion-as-womens-lacrosse-affiliate/ |title=A-Sun Welcomes Old Dominion As Women's Lacrosse Affiliate |publisher=Atlantic Sun Conference |date=June 29, 2013 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716051823/http://www.atlanticsun.org/wlacrosse/news/2012-13/7986/a-sun-welcomes-old-dominion-as-womens-lacrosse-affiliate/ |archivedate=July 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the women's rowing team joined the [[Big 12 Conference]] in 2014–15 after the Big 12 effectively took over C-USA rowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=631647&amp;SPID=92796&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10410&amp;ATCLID=209389100 |title=Big 12 Invites Affiliates to Rowing Championship |publisher=Big 12 Conference |date=January 31, 2014 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the men's swimming and diving team, which was left without a conference affiliation for two years because C-USA sponsors the sport only for women, joined the Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association, later renamed the [[Coastal Collegiate Sports Association]], effective with the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.odusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=31100&amp;ATCLID=210220041 |title=ODU Men's Swimming to Join the CCSA |publisher=Old Dominion Monarchs and Lady Monarchs |date=July 16, 2015 |accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ODU-VCU rivalry===

{{main|VCU-ODU basketball rivalry}}
[[Virginia Commonwealth University]] is ODU's archrival, mainly because of the similarities between the two schools. Both schools were once part of the [[College of William and Mary]] and both are urban research universities located just 90 miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=21 Jan |url=http://www.caahoops.com/2011/01/vcuodu-the-rivalry-is-just-different/ |title=VCU/ODU: The Rivalry Is Just Different… |publisher=Caahoops.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119120344/http://www.caahoops.com/2011/01/vcuodu-the-rivalry-is-just-different/ |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men's basketball===
{{Main|Old Dominion Monarchs basketball}}
[[File:OldDominion-TedConstantConvocationCenter-ODUvsVT-20051230.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old Dominion's [[Ted Constant Convocation Center]]]]

The Old Dominion University Monarchs (men's) basketball team have captured six CAA championship titles (1992, 1995, 1997, 2005, 2010, and 2011) since their conference admission in 1992, which is the most among all CAA schools. In 2007, they received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, when the team went 24-8 and finished 37th in RPI. That season included a notable 13-point win at 8th ranked Georgetown. Their most recent trip to the NCAA tournament was with an automatic bid after capturing the 2010 CAA title. During the NCAA tournament, the 11th seeded Monarchs managed a 1-point first-round upset over the 6th seeded Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.

In 2002 ODU opened the [[Ted Constant Convocation Center]] for the 2002-2003 basketball season.  "The Ted" has 8,600 fully cushioned seats, 16 luxury suites, and a state-of-the-art scoreboard. In addition to being used for home basketball games, the Constant Center hosts family-oriented events as well as concerts, lectures, and commencement ceremonies.

===Women's basketball===
{{Main|Old Dominion Lady Monarchs basketball}}
Old Dominion also holds an important place in the history of women's collegiate athletics, having awarded the first athletic scholarship to any woman in the state of Virginia for a varsity sport when [[Nancy Lieberman]] was awarded a scholarship to play women's basketball.

The Old Dominion Lady Monarchs basketball team has won three national championships. In 1979 and 1980, the Lady Monarchs were AIAW Champions. In 1985, they captured the NCAA Division I National Championship with a 70-65 win over the University of Georgia. In addition, the Lady Monarchs have captured five Sun Belt conference championship titles (1983, 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1990), and captured 17 CAA championship titles, winning every year from 1991-92 to 2007–08.

===Monarch football===
{{Main|Old Dominion Monarchs football}}

The history of football at ODU began with the Norfolk Division, which had a football team until 1941 known as the Norfolk Division Braves. The program dissolved due to a rule against freshman players and a $10,000 debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/alumni_magazine/fall05/75greatmoments.html |title=Special Section-75 Great Moments in ODU History |website=Odu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717062852/http://www.odu.edu/ao/alumni_magazine/Fall05/75GreatMoments.html |archive-date=2012-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2005, its [[Board of Visitors]] approved by a 14-0 vote the creation of an [[NCAA Division I]] team, which began play on September 5, 2009.

On February 9, 2007, ODU's Athletic Director Jim Jarrett announced that [[Bobby Wilder]], the associate head football coach at the [[University of Maine]], would be the head football coach at Old Dominion University. The team signed its first class in 2008. As is the case with many new football programs, all players on the 2008 Monarchs football team were redshirted, and when added with the 2009 signing class and transfers from I-A schools, formed the nucleus of the school's first football team. Initially, ODU competed as an FCS program (formerly I-AA), and was independent for two years before joining the Colonial Athletic Association for the 2011 season.

The final record for Old Dominion's 2009 football program was 9-2, at the time the best winning record ever for a first-year collegiate football program. This record is now held by [[Mercer University]] who finished 10-2 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpb.org/news/2013/11/25/mercer-football-has-winningest-debut-season-in-ncaa-division-i-history |title=Mercer Football Has Winningest Debut Season In NCAA Division I History |publisher=Gpb.org |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Dominion's football program had continued success in 2010 finishing 8-3. In the following years, Old Dominion's football program finished their 2011-2012 season with a 10-3 record, and an 11-2 record for their 2012-2013 season which gained national attention. As the school's football program began to grow along with the university itself, Old Dominion's potential was realized by several commissioners for college football, particularly by Conference USA. Old Dominion officially joined Conference USA (C-USA) on July 1, 2013 leaving behind their former conference affiliation with the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA).&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, Dave. "ODU Makes Calculated Leap to Conference USA." Dailypress.com. Newport News Va., Daily Press, 17 May 2012. Web. 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They won their first C-USA game against [[Rice|Rice Owls]] on September 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnett|first1=Zach|title=Old Dominion, North Texas made Conference USA history on Saturday|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/09/21/old-dominion-north-texas-made-conference-usa-history-on-saturday/|accessdate=2014-09-21|work=College Football Talk|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=2014-09-21|ref=oldu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foreman Field]], formerly the [[field hockey]] and women's lacrosse teams' home venue, has been renovated to accommodate the new football program. Field Hockey and women's lacrosse teams have been relocated to the Powhatan Sports Complex.

As of the 2015 season the ODU football program has sold out every home game that has ever been played at [[Foreman Field]], 48 consecutive sellouts.

===Men's soccer===
{{main|Old Dominion Monarchs soccer}}

===Wrestling===

Old Dominion University Monarch Wrestling team was established in 1957. The school's departure from the CAA forced the [[College wrestling|Wrestling]] team to become an associate member of the [[Mid-American Conference]], as Conference USA does not sponsor wrestling. The Old Dominion head wrestling coach is Steve Martin, currently in his tenth season with the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ODU Athletics: Wrestling Team|url=http://www.odusports.com/fls/31100/old_site/pdf/m-wrestl/m-wrestl-07-08-media-guide.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=31100|publisher=Old Dominion University Athletics |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rowing===
The ODU Rowing Club (ODURC) has been under the Recreational Sports department since 1985. The club is fully student-run and is funded largely by the student members of the club. ODURC has been very successful in recent years, as it has increased its membership. Adding outstanding volunteer coaches in recent years has raised the competitiveness of the team greatly, and the men's club won a national championship in May, 2008.
Today, male and female rowers continue to compete as a club; in 2008 rowing also became a varsity sport for female students, and a full-time coach was hired for the new women's team. Within their first year at varsity level, the women's team placed at a national competition. The decision to elevate only the women's team to varsity status was made to keep ODU compliant with [[Title IX]] regulations, providing balance to the increased spending on men's athletics that a football program brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/news/media.php?todo=details&amp;todo=details&amp;id=10312 |title=Odu Rowing Club Team Captures National Championship |publisher=Odu.edu |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2012-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307115848/http://www.odu.edu/ao/news/media.php?todo=details&amp;todo=details&amp;id=10312 |archive-date=2012-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheerleading (co-ed)===
Led by head coach Carmen Harris, the Old Dominion University cheer squad is a safe, professional and athletic program. Its energetic team consists of athletes who are also students. The cheer squad, along with the Old Dominion Dynasty Dance Team, performs at all football home games as well as most football away games. They also perform at all Men and Women's Basketball home games, and occasionally a home soccer or baseball game. Along with their practices, games, competitions, and other events, ODU cheerleaders are required to actively participate in all fundraising efforts and volunteer work under their Spirit Squad Program.
The ODU cheer team began competing at the NCA College Nationals in Daytona, FL in 2016. Old Dominion cheerleaders placed first in the Division 1A Intermediate All-Girl Division in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odusports.com/trads/oldd-cheerleading.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325060453/http://www.odusports.com/trads/oldd-cheerleading.html |archivedate=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Old Dominion Athletic Foundation===
The Old Dominion Athletic Foundation (ODAF) is the official booster club for Old Dominion Athletics. the Old Dominion Athletic Foundation was previously known as the Big Blue Club, or The Old Dominion University Intercollegiate Foundation. The change from those to ODAF occurred March 1, 2011. The Old Dominion Athletic Foundation has a 501-C-3 designation as a non-profit organization.&lt;ref name="Big Blue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odusports.cstv.com/boosters/oldd-boosters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206205239/http://odusports.cstv.com/boosters/oldd-boosters.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monarch Maniacs===
Monarch Maniacs was the student (undergraduates and graduates) group that supports all the athletic programs at Old Dominion University. The group is for students to show their school spirit and pride at all athletic events. The group is administered by the Office of Student Activities and Leadership. In order to become a member, there is a $20 membership fee and once paid, you receive benefits. All members receive a T-shirt, early entry to the football and basketball games, giveaways during the games, priority seating for selected away games, viewing parties and a membership card which allows discounts at sponsored vendors in Norfolk.&lt;ref name="Monarch Maniacs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.odu.edu/osal/spirit/maniacs.shtml |title=Monarch Maniacs |publisher=Studentaffairs.odu.edu |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Efforts to develop cost-effective Internet connectivity between Papua New Guinea’s higher education institutions began in the mid-1990s. In 2006, discussions between the nation’s telecommunications providers, universities and government resulted in the decision to create a single entity that would address the issue.&lt;ref name=PNG&gt;“The PNG Yearbook 2009” – “PNGARNET.” Cassowary Books, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea&lt;/ref&gt;

PNGARNET was launched in April 2008, and its initial membership consisted of four state-funded schools – [[University of Goroka]], [[University of Papua New Guinea]], [[University of Technology]] and Vudal University – plus the privately owned [[Divine Word University]] and [[Pacific Adventist University]] and two government agencies, the National Research Institute and the National Agricultural Research Institute.&lt;ref name=TN /&gt;

==Internet connectivity==
Among PNGARNET’s earliest projects has been the development of a computer satellite virtual local area network designed to increase Internet bandwidth to the nation's higher education institutions. The first installation coordinated by PNGARNET was a 3.7 metre satellite dish at the University of Goroka, which was designed to replace an older and slower dish while enabling the facility to facilitate full Internet research and communications services across Papua New Guinea and in connection with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.com.pg/081108/nation40.php “UOG installs new satellite,” The National, August 11, 2008]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papua New Guinea’s topography, with its rugged landforms and seismic activity, discouraged the installation of optical fibre as the main telecommunications medium for Internet connectivity. A microwave transmission was not pursued, since the technology requires line-of-sight between towers, which could only be constructed and maintained by PNG Telikom. Therefore, it was decided to use satellite transmission for PNGARNET’s connectivity.&lt;ref name=PNG /&gt;

The PNGARNet system is made up of the participating institutions and a hub that is located in [[Hong Kong]]. The Hong Kong location was chosen due to the guarantee of uninterrupted electrical power and Internet connectivity and for its access to technology experts and supplies. PNGARNet rents its bandwidth on a geo-stationary orbiting satellite. &lt;ref name=PNG /&gt;

==Funding==
The institutions participating in PNGARNET are required to purchase and maintain their on-site equipment, and each institution is charged a fee to help defray the costs of the Hong Kong hub. Internet bandwidth needs are paid on a predetermined scale that is reviewed annually.&lt;ref name=PNG /&gt;

The '''Polish Children's Fund''' ({{Lang-pl|Krajowy Fundusz na rzecz Dzieci}}, KFnrD) is a Polish [[non-government organization]] which supports highly [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted]] schoolchildren. It was established in 1981 by Ryszard Rakowski and late [[Jan Szczepański (sociologist)|Jan Szczepański]].

The Polish Children's Fund organizes the national stage of the [[European Union Contest for Young Scientists]].

==Scholarship programme==

The Polish Children's Fund gives scholarships for pre-university students skilled in the sciences, humanities, musics or ballet. Every year around 550 children receives the scholarship. Instead of a financial aid, KFnrD gives its participants unique opportunity to participate in lectures, workshops and research projects in cooperation with some of the most eminent scholars both from Poland and other European countries.

Most of the scientific camps are devoted to a single discipline and have its further qualification. They are organized by various institutions of the [[University of Warsaw]], the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], [[Jagiellonian University]] and the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]].

One of the central events is a general camp, which takes place in [[Serock]] (near [[Warsaw]]) from April to June (previous locations included [[Otwock]] and Jadwisin). The participants have opportunity to attend in lectures and workshops related to their interests. Also, they take part in the activities not connected with any particular field of study: sport games, psychological workshops, movie projections, concerts, and meetings with intellectuals, often pertaining to profound themes of philosophy, religion and developing one's worldview.

During the summer the Polish Children's Fund scholars are sent to various scientific camps, including:
* [[Research Science Institute]] - a highly competitive research camp which takes place at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]],
* [[European Space Camp]] - astronomic camp in [[Lofoten]], [[Norway]],
* XLAB International Science Camp [http://www.xlab-goettingen.de/] at the [[University of Göttingen]],
* [[London International Youth Science Forum]].

In 2014, Polish Children's Fund together with [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Copernicus Science Centre]] organises [[EUCYS]] finals, which are being held in Warsaw.

'''''Port Royale 2''''' is the [[sequel]] to the [[business simulation game]] ''[[Port Royale: Gold, Power and Pirates]]''. It is set in the [[Caribbean]] during the 17th century. Created by [[Ascaron|Ascaron Entertainment]] in 2004, it combines a business simulator with real-time battles and towns that can be owned, built, developed or razed.

==Gameplay==
Port Royale 2 is an [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended game]], so the player can choose to pursue any career they wish. This could range from a business tycoon to a [[pirate]]. Initially, you must trade goods between Caribbean colonies to make money, but over the long term you can have substantial business interests in many Caribbean ports, and support large fighting fleets.

As a business tycoon, you trade with towns to gain their friendship, and can then buy building permits to establish businesses there. Ultimately, you can even come to have your own town, but this can take a very long time.

As a buccaneer (with a [[Letter of Marque]]), you can attack any of the four colonial nations in the Caribbean circa 1600; from largest to smallest: Spain, England, France, and The Netherlands.  If you have not acquired a Letter of Marque, every nation will see you as an enemy - you are a pirate.

Ships in this game range from a small [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|Pinnace]] to a massive [[Ship of the Line]]. There are also missions you can complete for money, supplies, or improved relations. At higher levels you can also automate the game to some degree, by setting up trade routes that your trading fleets will follow from town to town.

True to history, home-country politics are fickle and impact the game: One year you might choose to be loyal to [[Spain]] and fight [[England]]–but a year later, might join the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in their fight against the [[France|French]].

Famous pirates of the age also make appearances. These sea wolves are likely to attack any ship or town that they please, including those that belong to the player. They usually operate from heavily fortified bases, but if you defeat them, you'll gain favor with any nation you choose.

Initially, you have operating constraints (how many fleets you may have and how many towns you can buy building permits in), but as you gain levels (based on net worth), you can have unlimited fleets and permits.

The game received generally good reviews.
*[[PC Format]] found the game unremarkable, stating that Port Royale 2 "...passes the time, but gets old fast."&lt;ref name="PC Format"/&gt;
*[[IGN]] was slightly more positive, saying it is "...a solid if unremarkable game." Because the game has an open ending, IGN said it had "good replay value as you can take different career paths each time you play."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The game received praise from 1Up.com, which stated that: "...it's a continually engaging experience." However, they disliked the pace at the beginning, saying "Port Royale 2 is somewhat slow to start. It can take a long time to earn enough money..."&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt;
*[[GameSpot]] gave the game a solid 8.3/10, saying "Port Royale 2 might focus more on building shipping cartels than sea battles and swordplay, but its brilliantly realized design is more than just number crunching."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Notes==
The developer, [[Ascaron|Ascaron Entertainment]] has gone bankrupt. Its website is closed, and PR2 must be bought through third parties. The final(?) patch (1.1.3.2, in the lower left of the home screen) can be found around the web. The title was acquired by [[Kalypso Media]] which founded [[Gaming Minds Studios]] from former Ascaron developers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/news/index.shtml?pab=1_1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
''[[Port Royale 3: Pirates &amp; Merchants]]'' is the sequel.

'''Publication bias''' is a type of [[bias]] that occurs in published academic [[research]]. It occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publication bias matters because [[literature review]]s regarding support for a [[hypothesis]] can be biased if the original literature is contaminated by publication bias.&lt;ref name="Rothstein2005" /&gt; Publishing only results that show a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding disturbs the balance of findings.&lt;ref name="Song2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Song | first1 = F. | last2 = Parekh | first2 = S. | last3 = Hooper | first3 = L. | last4 = Loke | first4 = Y. K. | last5 = Ryder | first5 = J. | last6 = Sutton | first6 = A. J. | last7 = Hing | first7 = C. | last8 = Kwok | first8 = C. S. | last9 = Pang | first9 = C. | last10 = Harvey | first10 = I. | title = Dissemination and publication of research findings: An updated review of related biases | journal = Health technology assessment (Winchester, England) | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = iii, iix–xi, iix–193 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.3310/hta14080 | pmid = 20181324 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Experiment|Studies]] with significant results can be of the same standard as studies with a [[null result]] with respect to quality of execution and [[Design of experiments|design]].&lt;ref name=Easterbrook&gt;{{cite journal |last=Easterbrook |first=P. J. |last2=Berlin |first2=J. A. |last3=Gopalan |first3=R. |last4=Matthews |first4=D. R. |title=Publication bias in clinical research |journal=[[Lancet (journal)|Lancet]] |year=1991 |volume=337 |issue=8746 |pages=867–872 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)90201-Y |pmid=1672966}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, statistically significant results are three times more likely to be published than papers with null results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dickersin |first=K. |authorlink=Kay Dickersin|last2=Chan |first2=S. |last3=Chalmers |first3=T. C. |title=Publication bias and clinical trials |journal=[[Controlled Clinical Trials]] |year=1987 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=343–353 |doi=10.1016/0197-2456(87)90155-3 |display-authors=etal |pmid=3442991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple factors contribute to publication bias.&lt;ref name="Rothstein2005" /&gt; For instance, once a scientific finding is well established, it may become newsworthy to publish reliable papers that fail to reject the null hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luijendijk|first1=HJ|last2=Koolman|first2=X|title=The incentive to publish negative studies: how beta-blockers and depression got stuck in the publication cycle.|journal=J Clin Epidemiol|date=May 2012|volume=65|issue=5|pages=488–92|doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2011.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that the most common reason for non-publication is simply that investigators decline to submit results, leading to [[non-response bias]]. Factors cited as underlying this effect include investigators assuming they must have made a mistake, failure to support a known finding, loss of interest in the topic, or anticipation that others will be uninterested in the null results.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook" /&gt; The nature of these issues and the problems that have been triggered, have been referred to as the 5 diseases that threaten science, which include: "''significosis'', an inordinate focus on statistically significant results; ''neophilia'', an excessive appreciation for novelty; ''theorrhea'', a mania for new theory; ''arigorium'', a deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work; and finally, ''disjunctivitis'', a proclivity to produce large quantities of redundant, trivial, and incoherent works." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonakis|first=John|date=February 2017|title=On doing better science: From thrill of discovery to policy implications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104898431730070X|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=28|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2017.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to identify unpublished studies often prove difficult or are unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="Rothstein2005"&gt;H. Rothstein, A. J. Sutton and M. Borenstein. (2005). ''Publication bias in meta-analysis: prevention, assessment and adjustments''. Wiley. Chichester, England ; Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to combat this problem, some journals require that studies submitted for publication are [[Clinical trials registry|pre-registered]] (registering a study prior to collection of data and analysis) with organizations like the [[Center for Open Science]].

Other proposed strategies to detect and control for publication bias&lt;ref name="Rothstein2005" /&gt; include [[p-curve]] analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title =  P-curve: A key to the file-drawer.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033242|journal =   Journal of Experimental Psychology: General| doi=10.1037/a0033242|volume=143|pages=534–547}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disfavoring small and non-randomised studies because of their demonstrated high susceptibility to error and bias.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook" /&gt;

Publication bias occurs when the publication of research results depends not just on the quality of the research but also on the hypothesis tested, and the significance and direction of effects detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=K. Dickersin |title=The existence of publication bias and risk factors for its occurrence |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |date=March 1990 |volume=263 |issue=10 |pages=1385–9|pmid=2406472 |doi=10.1001/jama.263.10.1385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1959 by statistician Theodore Sterling to refer to fields in which "successful" research is more likely to be published. As a result, "''the literature of such a field consists in substantial part of false conclusions resulting from type-I errors''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sterling |first=Theodore D. |title=Publication decisions and their possible effects on inferences drawn from tests of significance—or vice versa |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |date=March 1959 |volume=54 |pages=30–34 |url= http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1960-05032-001 |accessdate=10 April 2011 |doi=10.2307/2282137 |issue=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication bias is sometimes called the "file drawer effect," or "file drawer problem." This term suggests that results not supporting the hypotheses of researchers often go no further than the researchers' file drawers, leading to a bias in published research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jeffrey D. Scargle |title=Publication bias: the "file-drawer problem" in scientific inference |url= http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_14_1_scargle.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=94–106 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "file drawer problem" was coined by [[Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|Rosenthal]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosenthal R | year = 1979 | title = File drawer problem and tolerance for null results | url = | journal = Psychol Bull | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 638–41 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive-results bias, a type of publication bias, occurs when authors are more likely to submit, or editors are more likely to accept, positive results than negative or inconclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=D.L. Sackett |title=Bias in analytic research |journal=[[Journal of Chronic Diseases|J Chronic Dis]] |year=1979 |volume=32 |issue=1–2 |pmid=447779 |pages=51–63 |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(79)90012-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcome reporting bias occurs when multiple outcomes are measured and analyzed, but the reporting of these outcomes is dependent on the strength and direction of its results. A generic term coined to describe these post-hoc choices is HARKing ("Hypothesizing After the Results are Known").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=N.L. Kerr |title=HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]] |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=196–217 |url=http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=048343521&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;from=searchengine |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4 |pmid=15647155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of publication bias in the literature has been most extensively studied in biomedical research. Investigators following clinical trials from the submission of their protocols to ethics committees (or regulatory authorities) until the publication of their results observed that those with positive results are more likely to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin| first1 = K.| last2 = Min | first2 = Y.I. | title = NIH clinical trials and publication bias| journal = Online J Curr Clin Trials| volume = Doc No 50| issue = | pages = [4967 words; 53 paragraphs]| date = 1993| pmid = 8306005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Decullier E, Lheritier V, Chapuis F | year = 2005 | title = Fate of biomedical research protocols and publication bias in France: retrospective cohort study | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = | pages = 19–22 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38488.385995.8f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Song F, Parekh-Bhurke S, Hooper L, Loke Y, Ryder J, Sutton A | year = 2009 | title = Extent of publication bias in different categories of research cohorts: a meta-analysis of empirical studies | url = | journal = BMC Med Res Methodol | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 79 | doi=10.1186/1471-2288-9-79|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies often fail to report negative results when published, as demonstrated by research comparing study protocols with published articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan AW, Altman DG | year = 2005 | title = Identifying outcome reporting bias in randomised trials on PubMed: review of publications and survey of authors | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = | page = 753 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38356.424606.8f | pmid=15681569 | pmc=555875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Riveros C, Dechartres A, Perrodeau E, Haneef R, Boutron I, Ravaud P | year = 2013 | title = Timing and completeness of trial results posted at ClinicalTrials.gov and published in journals | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 10 | issue = | page = e1001566 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of publication bias was investigated in [[meta-analyses]]. The largest such analysis investigated the presence of publication bias in systematic reviews of medical treatments from the [[Cochrane Library]].&lt;ref name="kicinski2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25988604| year = 2015| author1 = Kicinski| first1 = M| title = Publication bias in meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews| journal = Statistics in Medicine| pages = 2781–93| last2 = Springate| first2 = D.

Results showing no evidence of adverse effects have a 78% greater probability of inclusion in safety studies than statistically significant results showing adverse effects. Evidence of publication bias was found in meta-analyses published in prominent medical journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kicinski M | year = 2013 | title = Publication bias in recent meta-analyses | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081823 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = | page = e81823 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on meta-analysis==
Where publication bias is present, published studies are no longer a representative sample of the available evidence. This bias distorts the results of meta-analyses and [[systematic review]]s. For example, [[evidence-based medicine]] is increasingly reliant on meta-analysis to assess evidence.

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews can account for publication bias by including evidence from unpublished studies and the grey literature. The presence of publication bias can also be explored by constructing a [[funnel plot]] in which the estimate of the reported effect size is plotted against a measure of precision or sample size. The premise is that the scatter of points should reflect a funnel shape, indicating that the reporting of effect sizes is not related to their statistical significance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, when small studies are predominately in one direction (usually the direction of larger effect sizes), asymmetry will ensue and this may be indicative of publication bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Light &amp; Pillemer|title=Summing up: The science of reviewing research|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Pree|location=Cambridge, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because an inevitable degree of subjectivity exists in the interpretation of funnel plots, several tests have been proposed for detecting funnel plot asymmetry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debray|first=Thomas P.A.|last2=Moons|first2=Karel G.M.|last3=Riley|first3=Richard D.|title=Detecting small-study effects and funnel plot asymmetry in meta-analysis of survival data: a comparison of new and existing tests|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1266/abstract|journal=Research Synthesis Methods|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/jrsm.1266|issn=1759-2887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Zhi-Chao|last2=Zhou|first2=Xiao-Hua|last3=He|first3=Jia|date=2015-01-30|title=Statistical methods for dealing with publication bias in meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.6342/abstract|journal=Statistics in Medicine|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=343–360|doi=10.1002/sim.6342|issn=1097-0258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rücker|first=Gerta|last2=Carpenter|first2=James R.|last3=Schwarzer|first3=Guido|date=2011-03-01|title=Detecting and adjusting for small-study effects in meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.201000151/abstract|journal=Biometrical Journal|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=351–368|doi=10.1002/bimj.201000151|issn=1521-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often based on linear regression, and may adopt a multiplicative or additive dispersion parameter to adjust for the presence of between-study heterogeneity.

==Compensation examples==
Two meta-analyses of the efficacy of [[reboxetine]] as an [[antidepressant]] demonstrated attempts to detect publication bias in clinical trials. Based on positive trial data, reboxetine was originally passed as a treatment for depression in many countries in Europe and the UK in 2001 (though in practice it is rarely used for this indication). A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that reboxetine was ineffective and that the preponderance of positive-outcome trials reflected publication bias, mostly due to trials published by the drug manufacturer [[Pfizer]]. A subsequent meta-analysis published in 2011, based on the original data, found flaws in the 2010 analyses and suggested that the data indicated reboxetine was effective in severe depression (see [[Reboxetine#Efficacy|Reboxetine § Efficacy]]). Examples of publication bias are given by Goldacre&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Goldacre|Goldacre, Ben]] [http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_what_doctors_don_t_know_about_the_drugs_they_prescribe.html What doctors don't know about the drugs they prescribe]&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilmshurst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Wilmshurst|title=Dishonesty in Medical Research|url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social sciences, a study of published papers exploring the relationship between corporate social and financial performance found that "in economics, finance, and accounting journals, the average correlations were only about half the magnitude of the findings published in Social Issues Management, Business Ethics, or Business and Society journals".&lt;ref&gt;Marc Orlitzky [http://marcorlitzky.webs.com/Papers/Orlitzky2011beq_preprint.pdf Institutional Logics in the Study of Organizations: The Social Construction of the Relationship between Corporate Social and Financial Performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

One example cited as an instance of publication bias is the refusal to publish attempted replications of Bem's work that claimed evidence for precognition by ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'' (the original publisher of Bem's article).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/23/ben-goldacre-bad-science |title=Backwards step on looking into the future |first=Ben |last=Goldacre |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhenglun Pan, Thomas A. Trikalinos, Fotini K. Kavvoura, Joseph Lau, [[John P.A. Ioannidis]] | year = 2005 | title = Local literature bias in genetic epidemiology: An empirical evaluation of the Chinese literature | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020334 | journal = [[PLoS Medicine]] | volume = 2 | issue = 12| page = e334 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; comparing studies of gene-disease associations originating in China to those originating outside China found that those conducted within the country reported a stronger association and a more statistically significant result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ling Tang Jin | year = 2005 | title = Selection Bias in Meta-Analyses of Gene-Disease Associations | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020409 | journal = [[PLoS Medicine]] | volume = 2 | issue = 12| page = e409 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
[[John P. A. Ioannidis|Ioannidis]] argued that "claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias."&lt;ref name="pmid16060722"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ioannidis J|authorlink = John P. A. Ioannidis|title = Why most published research findings are false|journal = PLoS Med|volume = 2|issue = 8|page = e124|year = 2005|pmid = 16060722|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124|pmc = 1182327}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lists the following factors as those that make a paper with a positive result more likely to enter the literature and suppress negative-result papers:
* The studies conducted in a field are smaller.
* [[effect size|The effect size]]s are smaller.
* There is both a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships.
* There is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes.
* There is prejudice (financial interest or otherwise).
* More teams are involved in a particular scientific field and chasing statistical significance.

Other factors include [[Experimenter's bias|experimenter bias]] and [[white hat bias]].

==Remedies==
Publication bias can be contained through better-powered studies, enhanced research standards, and careful consideration of true and non-true relationships.&lt;ref name="pmid16060722" /&gt; Better-powered studies refer to large studies that deliver definitive results or test major concepts and lead to low-bias meta-analysis. Enhanced research standards such as the pre-registration of protocols, the registration of data collections and adherence to established protocols are other techniques. To avoid false-positive results, the experimenter must consider the chances that they are testing a true or non-true relationship. This can be untertaken by properly assessing the false positive report probability based on the statistical power of the test&lt;ref name="FalsePositiveProbability"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Chanock|first2=S|last3=Garcia-Closas|first3=M|last4=El Ghormli|first4=L|last5=Rothman|first5=N|date=March 2004|title=Assessing the Probability That a Positive Report is False: An Approach for Molecular Epidemiology Studies|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/96/6/434|journal=[[JNCI]]|volume=96|issue=6|pages=434–42|doi=10.1093/jnci/djh075|pmid=15026468|author=Wacholder, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reconfirming (whenever ethically acceptable) established findings of prior studies known to have minimal bias.

===Study registration===
In September 2004, editors of prominent medical journals (including the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', ''[[The Lancet]]'', ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'', and ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'') announced that they would no longer publish results of drug research sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, unless that research was registered in a public [[clinical trials registry]] database from the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=([[The Washington Post]]) |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/09/1094530773888.html |title=Medical journal editors take hard line on drug research |publisher=[[smh.com.au]] |date=2004-09-10 |accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some journals (e.g. ''[[Trials (journal)|Trials]]),'' encourage publication of [[clinical trial protocol|study protocols]] in their journals.&lt;ref name="Protocol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/info/instructions/?txt_jou_id=10096&amp;txt_mst_id=61789 |title=Instructions for Trials authors&amp;nbsp;— Study protocol |date=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) agreed that basic information about all clinical trials should be registered at the study's inception, and that this information should be publicly accessible through the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Additionally, public availability of complete study protocols, alongside reports of trials, is becoming more common for studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin| first1 = K.| last2 = Chalmers | first2 = I. | title = Recognizing, investigating and dealing with incomplete and biased reporting of clinical research: from Francis Bacon to the WHO | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 532–538 | date = 2011| pmid = 22179297 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2011.11k042 | journal=J R Soc Med | pmc=3241511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reading disability''' is a condition in which a sufferer displays difficulty reading. Examples of reading disabilities include: [[Dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]], [[Alexia (acquired dyslexia)]], and [[Hyperlexia]] (word-reading ability well above normal for age and IQ).

==Definition==
[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] defines reading disability or dyslexia as follows: "Dyslexia is a brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding. In adults, dyslexia usually occurs after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia." &lt;ref&gt;{{NINDS|dyslexia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NINDS definition is not in keeping with the bulk of scientific studies that conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that dyslexia and intelligence are related. The Rose Review 2009&lt;ref name="Identifying and Teaching Children and Young People with Dyslexia and Literacy Difficulties"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=James|title=Sir|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/14790/7/00659-2009DOM-EN_Redacted.pdf|website=Institute of Education|publisher=United Kingdom Government|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definition is more in keeping with modern research and debunked discrepancy model of dyslexia diagnosis:&lt;ref name="Discrepancy Definitions of Reading Disability: Has Intelligence Led Us Astray?"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanovich|first1=K|title=
Discrepancy Definitions of Reading Disability: Has Intelligence Led Us Astray? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly|date=Winter 1991|volume=26|issue=1|pages=7–29|jstor=747729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling.
*Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed.
*Dyslexia occurs across the range of intellectual abilities.
*It is best thought of as a continuum, not a distinct category, and there are no clear cut-off points.
*Co-occurring difficulties may be seen in aspects of language, motor co-ordination, mental calculation, concentration and personal organisation, but these are not, by themselves, markers of dyslexia.
*A good indication of the severity and persistence of dyslexic difficulties can be gained by examining how the individual responds or has responded to well founded intervention.

===Dyslexia===
{{Main article|Dyslexia}}
Dyslexia is a [[learning disability]] that manifests itself as a difficulty with word decoding and/or reading fluency. Comprehension may be affected as a result of difficulties with decoding, but is not a primary feature of dyslexia. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate [[reading instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stanovich KE |title=Explaining the differences between the dyslexic and the garden-variety poor reader: the phonological-core variable-difference model |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=590–604 |date=December 1988 |pmid=2465364 |doi=10.1177/002221948802101003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that dyslexia affects between 5–17% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCandliss BD, Noble KG |title=The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=196–204 |year=2003 |pmid=12953299 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10080 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Czepita2006 &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Czepita D, Lodygowska E |title=[Role of the organ of vision in the course of developmental dyslexia] |language=Polish |journal=Klin Oczna |volume=108 |issue=1–3 |pages=110–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16883955 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birsh2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Research and reading disability |editor=Judith R.

Holt]], [[D.B. Wortman]], [[D.T. Barnard]] and [[James Cordy|J.R. Cordy]] as a subset of the [[PL/I]] programming language designed for teaching programming. It was used for about a decade at over 40 universities, schools, and research laboratories in Canada and the United States.

SP/k was one of the first languages specifically designed to encourage [[structured programming]]. The features of SP/k were chosen to encourage structured problem solving by computers, to make the language easy to learn and use, to eliminate confusing and redundant constructs, and to make the language easy to compile.The resulting language was suitable for introducing programming concepts used in various applications, including business data processing, scientific calculations and non-numeric computation. 

SP/k is actually a sequence of language subsets called SP/1, SP/2, … SP/8. Each subset introduces new programming language constructs while retaining all the constructs of preceding subsets, forming a stepwise system for teaching computer programming. Each subset is precisely defined and self-contained, and can be learned or implemented without the following subsets. This allows for various levels of programming education. The design and philosophy of SP/k was a strong influence on the [[Turing programming language|Turing]] programming language.

'''Securly''' is a [[Silicon Valley]] based student safety company that provides software to K-12 schools and districts. Products include "Filter", a web filter that is fully custom for schools, "Auditor", an email filter for [[G Suite]], and "Tipline", an anonymous hotline for bullying to be used by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.securly.com/|title=Securly - The Student Safety Company|last=|first=|date=|website=Securly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Securly is a venture-backed&lt;ref name=UPenn-Wharton&gt;[http://vip.wharton.upenn.edu/default.aspx "Wharton Venture Initiation Program"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908083048/http://vip.wharton.upenn.edu/default.aspx |date=2013-09-08 }}, [http://vip.wharton.upenn.edu/ http://vip.wharton.upenn.edu], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; K-12 service provider based in Silicon Valley and was founded in 2012 by former [[McAfee]] network engineers Vinay Mahadlk&lt;ref name=Wharton-magazine&gt;[http://whartonmagazine.com/blogs/eager-for-entrepreneurship-at-wharton/ "Eager for Entrepreneurship at Wharton"], [http://whartonmagazine.com/ Wharton Magazine], 5 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and Bharath Madhusudan.&lt;ref name="securly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/securly?trk=top_nav_home |title=LinkedIn: About Securly |publisher=LinkedIn|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Securly is said to use [[emotional learning]], [[natural language processing]] and other machine learning techniques, to study the differences between, when a kid is involved in acceptable research activities, versus engaging oneself in harmful and unacceptable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/securly-raises-4-million-to-put-guard-rails-on-the-internet-for-k-12-students/|title=Securly raises $4 million to put guard rails on the internet for K-12 students|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Securly will charge for Filter on devices like the [[iPad]], [[MacBook]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] tablet, the [[Chromebook]] [[Chrome Web Store|Web Store Extension]] is free for G Suite Customers.

==Philosophy==
[[Content-control software|Web filters]] are commonly used for the purpose of preventing individuals from accessing websites. Securly, which serves only K-12 schools, employs a philosophy of using web filtering as a means of providing schools with data on how students are using their 1:1 devices in a positive manner.&lt;ref name=AS&gt;[http://anotherschwab.com/2015/02/07/the-power-of-positive-web-filtering/ "The Power of Positive Web Filtering"], [http://anotherschwab.com/ http://anotherschwab.com], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In October 2014, Securly was one of the first K-12 Service Providers to sign the Student Privacy Pledge co-created by the [[Future of Privacy Forum]] and the [[Software and Information Industry Association]]. On January 12, 2015, Securly and 74 other companies, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Microsoft]], were given recognition by President [[Barack Obama]] and the [[White House]] for their efforts to safeguard student data and privacy.&lt;ref name="White House Office of the Press Secretary"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/12/fact-sheet-safeguarding-american-consumers-families "FACT SHEET: Safeguarding American Consumers &amp; Families"], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/ http://www.whitehouse.gov], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Securly was reviewed by the popular educator website The Ed Tech Roundup and received a 5-star rating for its school product.&lt;ref name="Ed Tech Roundup"&gt;[http://www.edtechroundup.org/reviews/securly-manage-screen-time-any-device-anywhere "Securly: Manage Screen Time - Any Device, Anywhere"], [http://www.edtechroundup.org/ http://www.edtechroundup.org], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feedback ==
Securly gets a lot of negativity due to its constant blocking of safe sites. Checking the Chrome Web Store [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/securly-for-chromebooks/iheobagjkfklnlikgihanlhcddjoihkg reviews] on Securly, you will find one star ratings, almost all from students, who are saying that it goes overboard with what sites it blocks.

While the majority of foreign students who study in the United States are pursuing a full degree, most outgoing U.S. students study abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msmbainusa.com/|title=MS and MBA in USA|website=MS MBA in USA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; for one or two academic terms. The majority of US students now choose short-term study abroad programs according to the most recent Institute of International Education Open Doors Report. In the 2008–09 [[academic year]], the five countries US students chose to study abroad in most were the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[China]]. The total number of US students studying abroad during 2008–2009 was 260,327, compared to 262,416 the previous year, a modest decline of 0.8%. In the 2011–2012 academic year 283,332 US students opted to study abroad, a 0.9% increase from 2008–2009; however, US students who choose to study abroad represent only 1% of all students enrolled in higher education institutions.&lt;ref name=NAFSA&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in U.S. Study Abroad|url=https://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Advocacy_And_Public_Policy/Study_Abroad/Trends_in_U_S__Study_Abroad/|publisher=NAFSA: Association of International Educators|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Doors report is published annually by the Institute of International Education with funding from the U.S. [[Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]]. However, the report found that there were notable increases in the number of U.S. students going to study in less traditional destinations. Fifteen of the top 25 destinations were outside of Western Europe and nineteen were countries where English is not a primary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Institute of International Education, Inc. |title=Study Abroad by U.S. Students Slowed in 2008/09 with More Students Going to Less Traditional Destinations |url=http://www.iie.org/en/Who-We-Are/News-and-Events/Press-Center/Press-Releases/2010/2010-11-15-Open-Doors-US-Study-Abroad |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 764,495 international students studied in the United States.  During the same time period, 274,000 US students studied abroad.  This imbalance has been referred to as an "international education deficit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bottleneck Effect: Looking at Study Abroad &amp; Job Competitiveness|url=http://www.professionalintern.com/bottleneck-effect-looking-study-abroad-job-competitiveness|publisher=Professional Intern|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the data from the Open Doors Report is still wide-ranging, it is not entirely inclusive of all study abroad student data that had previously been included in the annual reports. As of 2013, according to the Open Doors' FAQs regarding the question of 'Who is counted in the U.S. Study Abroad survey?': "students who travel and take courses abroad that are not tracked by their home institution are not reported in Open Doors, nor are students who are enrolled overseas for full degrees from non-U.S. institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/FAQ#faq8|title=IIE Open Doors FAQs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Institute of International Education|access-date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[University of Delaware]] is credited with creating the first study abroad program designed for U.S. undergraduate students in the 1920s.

A few decades later, Professor Raymond W. Kirkbride of the University of Delaware, a [[French people|French]] professor and [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] veteran, won support from university president Walter S. Hullihen to send students to study in [[France]] in their junior year. UD initially refused to fund Kirkbride's travels, and he and Hullihen appealed to prominent public and private figures for support including then-[[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]] and businessman [[Pierre&amp;nbsp;S. du&amp;nbsp;Pont]]. Kirkbride set sail for on July 7, 1923, with eight students for six weeks of intensive language courses in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France, before moving on to Paris to study at [[The Sorbonne]]. The Delaware Foreign Study Plan, which came to be known as the Junior Year Abroad (JYA), was considered a success and was replicated by other U.S. institutions such as [[Smith College]]. In 1948, the Delaware Foreign Study Plan was discontinued due to post-war conditions in Europe and shifting priorities under a new university president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=University of Delaware| title= Center for International Studies: A Brief History| url= http://international.udel.edu/studyabroad/alumni/1923/brief_history.html| accessdate= 10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been re-instated in the form of their current study abroad program.

==Trend==
Despite flat overall study abroad numbers, there were notable increases in the numbers of U.S. students going to some of the less traditional destinations for study abroad in 2008/09. Double digit increases to host countries among the top 25 destinations include [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Peru]], [[South Africa]] and [[South Korea]]. Double-digit decreases among the top 25 host countries include [[Mexico]] (which experienced [[H1N1]] virus outbreak that year), [[Austria]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iie.org/en/Who-We-Are/News-and-Events/Press-Center/Press-Releases/2010/2010-11-15-Open-Doors-US-Study-Abroad "Study Abroad by U.S. Students Slowed in 2008/09 with More Students Going to Less Traditional Destinations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table represented the top 25 studied abroad destinations for U.S. students seeking academic credited in 2007/08 and 2008/09, according to the [[Institute of International Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/US-Study-Abroad/Leading-Destinations/2007-09 "Open Doors Data: U.S. Study Abroad: Leading Destinations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013/14, 886,052 international students studied at U.S. colleges and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Infographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NAFSAs website, "the number of U.S. students studying abroad for credit during the 2013-2014 academic year grew 5.2 percent from 289,408 students to 304,467 students. This represents just under 1.5 percent of all U.S. students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States and about 10 percent of U.S. graduates. A recent survey found that almost 40% of companies surveyed missed international business opportunities because of a lack of internationally competent personnel. When 95% of consumers live outside of the United States, we cannot afford to ignore this essential aspect of higher education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Advocacy_And_Public_Policy/Study_Abroad/Trends_in_U_S__Study_Abroad/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researched benefits==
It has been shown that through study abroad, students can gain a better understanding of themselves, and of their culture. They improve their ability to evaluate elements of their own culture in an unbiased manner. In addition, multicultural interactions become smoother and more natural for the students for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Effects of an Internationalized University Experience on Domestic Students in the United States and Australia. |year=2010 |publisher=Journal of Studies in International Education |location=Web |isbn=  |pages=313–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that 96% have increased self-confidence, 97% feel more mature and 98% understand their own values more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0403/benefits_study_abroad.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that when paired together, the use of social media and study abroad programs make second language acquisition much less difficult. Michele Back, Assistant Professor of World Languages Education at the University of Connecticut, conducted research on the positive influence Facebook has on second language acquisition for students participating in study abroad programs. Her work demonstrated that students who used Facebook to interact with native speakers, before and after their study abroad experience, found it easier to maintain long term interactions in their target language—further enhancing their second language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Back|first=Michele|year=2013|title=Using Facebook Data to Analyze Learner Interaction During Study Abroad|doi=10.1111/flan.12036|journal=Foreign Language Annals|volume=46|issue=3|pages=377–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of programs==
Despite the slight decline in U.S. students studying abroad for credit in 2008–2009, study abroad is likely to continue to grow. The number of outgoing U.S. students pursuing overseas study has increased over fivefold since the late 1980s, from less than 50,000 students to more than 260,000 in 2008–09. Behind the numbers, though, has been the proliferation in the type study abroad programs. According to Lilli Engel of the American University Center of Provence, there are fundamental differences in the academic and cultural experience offered by study abroad programs today that suggest the need to create a level-based classification system for program types. In an influential Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad article, she compares "a one-month summer term, requiring little or no host language proficiency, with subject-matter classes in English, collective housing and American roommates" with "a full-year program for students of advanced linguistic proficiency housed individually in a host family and directly enrolled in local university courses or engaged in a professional internship or service-learning project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=Lilli |last2=Engel |first2=John |year=2003 |title=Study Abroad Levels: Toward a Classification of Program Types |journal=Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |publisher=Forum on Education Abroad |url=http://www.frontiersjournal.com/issues/vol9/vol9-01_engleengle.pdf |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation, interaction and their connection to developing a second-language was examined by Todd A. Hernández of Marquette University. In terms of language acquisition, there is more to learning a language than just the assumption "that study abroad is superior to home education...". It is the interaction of the individual with the option of various opportunities, the exchange of language and ideas across cultures and the interpersonal connections established within various social settings. When these characteristics are pursued in Study Abroad, many researchers have found the "this sustained interaction is an important improvement in a Study Abroad context... contributing to language gain."&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c02ff713-3eb0-4543-99d3-53dd32d14df1%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=106&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, within international education, a universally accepted method of classifying study abroad programs has proven elusive. U.S. students can choose from a wide range of study-abroad opportunities differentiated by program sponsor, curriculum, cost, program model, language and degree of integration, to name a few. While study abroad in the U.S. is by no means uniform, study abroad programs can reasonably be grouped according to (a) duration, (b) program model (c) program sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey, William (2004). Guide to Studying Abroad, pp 16-20. Princeton Review, New York. {{ISBN|0-375-76371-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration===
Study abroad programs are available to students throughout the year. However, the majority enroll in [[Semester]] or [[Summer]] programs (37.3% and 35.8%). Even though the total number of outbound U.S. students grew by over 100,000 from 2000/01 to 2008/09, the percentages of students studying abroad during a given term remained largely stable. However, the long-term trends of steadily relatively fewer students signing up for Academic Year programs in favor of growing enrollments in programs less than 8 weeks during the Academic Year. For working and community college students study abroad can also last as short as a week.

===Four basic program models===
Four basic models have been identified to refer to a study abroad program's structure. They consist of (a) Island, (b) Integrated, (c) Hybrid, and (d) Field-study programs.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Wendy (2008). [http://www.abroadscout.com/studyabroad101/ Study Abroad 101 (Second Edition)]. [http://www.agapy.com/ Agapy LLC], Illinois. {{ISBN|978-0-9721328-4-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Island''' - Students participating in island programs study alongside other American students in a study center. Island programs are typically sponsored U.S. universities and/or third-party providers, who develop a curriculum specifically with American students in mind.
*'''Integrated''' Students who participate on an integrated program enroll directly in courses alongside local students at a host university. Program sponsors may provide additional services such as assistance with course registration and language tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braskamp|first=Larry A.|last2=Braskamp|first2=David C.|last3=Merrill|first3=Kelly|title=Assessing Progress in Global Learning and Development of Students with Education Abroad Experiences|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ883693|journal=Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad|language=en|volume=18|pages=101–118|issn=1085-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hybrid''' - Hybrid programs include elements of both island and integrated program. Typically students take a selection of their coursework at a host university and the remainder at a study center. Hybrid programs are common in countries where the primary language of instruction is not English, such as [[China]] and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Clemson University Study Abroad Programs |title= Third-Party Programs |url=http://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/study-abroad/programs/third-party.html |accessdate= 19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Field-based''' - Field-based study abroad programs for academic credit are structured much more liberally than traditional island, integrated or hybrid programs. Generally these programs involve a thematic focus, field study training and finally an independent study project. [[SIT Study Abroad]] programs are for the most part field-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=SIT Study Abroad |title=SIT Program Model |url=http://www.sit.edu/studyabroad/19773.htm |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program sponsor===
Programs can also be grouped and classified by identifying a program's sponsor. Sponsors are the institutions and/or circumstances that led to a program's creation, as well as what the goal of a program is. The main study abroad program sponsors are (a) host university (direct exchange and direct enroll), (b) U.S. college or university (study centers and international branch campuses), and (c) [[study abroad organization]]s known as third-party providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= StudyAbroad.com |title= Study Abroad Student Guide: Part II | url=http://studyabroad.com/pages/sitecontent/student_guide_two.aspx |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Host University Sponsor: direct exchange and direct enroll'''

Many U.S. institutions have long-standing [[direct exchange]] partnerships with foreign institutions that allow their students to enroll in classes as a [[visiting student]] while still paying standard tuition at their home university. Direct exchanges are facilitated by agreements governing academic credit transfer and financial aid between the home university and host university. While individual agreements may vary, direct exchange typically involves a 1:1 where the number of inbound exchange must be equivalent to the number of outgoing study abroad students. Typically, students enroll in standard courses at the host institution and are fully integrated with host country students and are responsible for their own housing, airport transfer, etc. Programs are administered on-site by the host university, with pre-departure advising and assistance from a U.S. university study abroad office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= Michigan Technological University |title=International Direct Enrollment Programs |url=http://www.mtu.edu/international/study-abroad/program/direct-enrollment |accessdate= 11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like direct exchange, direct enrollment programs are generally geared toward the more independent student, as participants enroll in courses directly alongside local students. Students are responsible for their housing and coordinating other logistics. Unlike direct exchanges, direct enrollment does not necessarily require an agreement between the U.S. institution and the foreign university. As such, credit transfer is not automatic and participants pay tuition and fees directly to the host university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= Clark University Office of Study Abroad Programs |title= Types (or "Models") of Study Abroad Programs |url=http://www.clarku.edu/offices/studyabroad/faculty/types.cfm |accessdate= 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sponsored by U.S. College and Universities: study centers and international branch campuses'''

Some of the most popular study abroad programs include those sponsored by a student's home institution, by another U.S. college or university, or by a consortium of U.S. colleges or universities. These programs are designed to allow students to study in a foreign environment while remaining within a U.S. academic framework. Credit transfer is arranged by the sponsoring and programs typically align with traditional U.S. academic calendars. The U.S. sponsor institution will typically assist with housing arrangements, and may arrange cultural activities and excursions for participating students. Study center are known as "island programs" because create separate classes and spaces for U.S. and foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= StudyAbroad.com |title= Student Study Abroad Guide:Living Abroad |accessdate= 16 October 2013|url=http://www.studyabroad.com/student-guide/introduction.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants may take classes at a study center or [[international branch campus]] run by the U.S. college or university sponsor. The curriculum of study centers are specifically designed for study abroad students. For example, students at [[Texas Tech University]]'s [[Seville]], [[Spain]] program study with TTU faculty, take TTU courses with other TTU students and earn TTU credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= Texas Tech University |title= Texas Tech Study Abroad Programs |url= https://www.studyabroad.ttu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; International branch campuses, however, are distinct in that U.S. study abroad students enroll in classes alongside full degree-seeking students. As an example, [[Florida State University Panama Canal Branch]] offers a broad curriculum and the majority of its students are [[Panamanian]] or are from other countries in [[Latin America]], notably Colombia and Costa Rica. Today, U.S. colleges and universities operate at least 80 international branch campuses worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=NPR |title= Middle East Woos U.S. Colleges |date=2010-05-12 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126509314 |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sponsored by third-party providers'''

Third-party providers are private companies and organizations that sponsor study abroad programs. Both for-profit and non-profit third-party providers assist program participants with logistics like course registration and housing arrangements. While models differ, academic and social guidance is generally included throughout the duration of a program, as are built-in excursions and community service opportunities.

Third-party providers of all stripes pursue relationships with U.S. universities in the form of affiliation agreements or membership consortia agreements. There are many third-party providers in operation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Clemson University Office of International Affairs |title= Third-Party Programs |url= http://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/study-abroad/programs/third-party.html |accessdate= 5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding study abroad==
Costs for a study abroad program include, but are not limited to [[tuition]] and fees, room and board, medical insurance, passport and visa fees and transportation costs. While U.S. universities vary in terms of policies related to financing study abroad, [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] for U.S. students who wish to study abroad may include a combination of [[scholarships]], grants from the home university, government student loans, and [[student loans#Private student loans|private student loans]].{{US student loans}}

An amendments made in 1992 to the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], TITLE VI, SEC. 601-604&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea98/sec601.html Section 601 - 1998 Amendments to Higher Education Act of 1965&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. ruled that students can receive financial aid for study abroad if they are enrolled in a program that is approved by their home institution and would be eligible to receive government funding without regard to whether the study abroad program is required as a part of the student's degree.

===Federal grants===

*'''The Pell Grant''' - The [[Pell Grant]] is a need-based grant. To qualify, you must be a full-time undergraduate student with an [[Expected Family Contribution]] (EFC) below the limit determined each year
*'''The Federal Supplemental Education Opportunities Grant''' - This need-based grant is awarded to those students demonstrating the greatest financial need. Students typically must qualify for the federal Pell Grant to receive an SEOG Grant

===Federal loans===

*'''Federal Stafford Loan''' - The [[Stafford Loan]] is in the student's name and is available to all students, regardless of financial need. If the loan is subsidized, the government will pay the [[interest]] while the student is in school. If the loan is unsubsidized, there is the choice of capitalizing the interest or of paying the interest quarterly during the in-school period. Payment of the principle itself (for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans) does not begin until six months after graduation, provided the student remains enrolled on at least a half-time (six credits) basis.
*'''Federal Perkins Loan''' - The [[Perkins Loan]] is a low-interest loan (5 percent) awarded to those students demonstrating the greatest financial need.
*'''Parent PLUS Loans for Undergraduate Students''' - Parents may borrow up to the full cost of a student's education, less the amount of any other financial aid received. There is a minimal credit check required for the [[PLUS loan]], so a good [[credit history]] is required.

===Federal scholarships===

*'''David L. Boren Undergraduate Scholarships for Study Abroad''' - The [[National Security Education Program]] (NSEP) provides scholarships to undergraduate students who wish to study languages and cultures considered to be important to U.S. [[national security]]. Students are not eligible to receive the Boren scholarship if they are studying in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], or the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.borenawards.org/eligibility.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship''' - If you receive a federal Pell Grant, you are eligible to apply for a Gilman Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;http://exchanges.state.gov/globalexchanges/gilman-scholarship-program.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.studyabroad101.com/scholarships Study Abroad Scholarships] from [https://www.studyabroad101.com/providers third party providers] and [https://www.studyabroad101.com/providers?view=universities host institutions] are another common source of funding for students.

==Criticism==
In mid-2007, [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[state attorney general|attorney general]] opened an inquiry into the relationships between universities and providers of foreign study. According to Benjamin Lawsky, former deputy counselor in the office of Attorney General [[Andrew M. Cuomo]], the inquiry was to focus on whether cash incentives and other perks that foreign-study providers give universities influence their decisions about where students may study. Critics contend that the practices, rarely disclosed and largely unknown, limit study abroad options and drive up the price that is ultimately passed onto students. The investigation follows disclosures in [[The New York Times]] that providers of study abroad are offering colleges rebates, free and subsidized travel, unpaid seats on advisory boards, help with back-office services and marketing stipends. In some cases, perks are tied to the number of students universities send to a given provider’s program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Diana Jean |last= Schemo |work=The New York Times |title= In Study Abroad, Gifts and Money for Universities |date= 2007-08-13 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/13/education/13abroad.html |accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked, Lawsky said that the inquiry grew out of his office's inquiries into similar practices in the [[student loan]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Diana Jean |last= Schemo |work=The New York Times |title= Study Abroad is New Focus of Inquiry into Perks |date= 2007-08-16 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/education/16abroad.html |accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the investigation, Cuomo's office issued subpoenas for five of the major study abroad providers in August 2007. The first batch of providers were the Institute for Study Abroad at [[Butler University]], the [[American Institute For Foreign Study]], the [[Institute for the International Education of Students]]; the Center for Education Abroad at [[Arcadia University]], and the Danish Institute for Study Abroad. Six months later, he issued subpoenas or requests for documents top 15 colleges in and out of New York State. In light of the unprecedented attention on the industry, [[NAFSA: Association of International Educators]] drafted a report in early 2008 calling on U.S. university study abroad offices to be more open in their decision making and to demonstrate that their policies directly benefit students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Karen |last= Fischer |title=International Education Group's Report Provides Principles, but Not Prescriptions, for Study Abroad |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=2008-01-25 |url=http://chronicle.com/article/International-Education/12450 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in response to Cuomo's investigation, The Forum on Education Abroad released a [[code of ethics]] in March 2008 that sought to be a "compass" for U.S. universities, study abroad providers and foreign host institutions. Unlike the NAFSA report, The Forum document offers a broad set of ethical principles and detailed guidance. It recommends, amongst other things, that U.S. institutions have specific procedures for reporting payments, like honoraria and consulting fees, for work done on behalf of providers; that agreements and criteria for selecting study abroad programs be disclosed fully; and that the goals and parameters for visits by campus officials to overseas program sites be clearly established in advance of the trips. The Forum is a consortium of American and overseas colleges and outside providers founded in 2001 to create standards of good practices for education abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Karen |last= Fischer |title=Code of Ethics for Study Abroad Is Offered to Colleges and Providers |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=2008-03-03 |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Code-of-Ethics-Is-Offered-to/558/ |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
While focus is often placed on the "romantic" experience of visiting another culture in discussions about the benefits of study abroad, there has been some research that shows that study abroad experience has a quantitatively positive net effect on students.  A study conducted from 2006-2010 showed that—during a period when only 49% of the average population of college graduates found a job within one year of graduatio—98% of students with study abroad experience had found employment within one year.   Students with study abroad experience reported starting salaries 25% higher than the general student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bottleneck Effect: Looking At Study Abroad &amp; Job Competitiveness|url=http://www.professionalintern.com/bottleneck-effect-looking-study-abroad-job-competitiveness|publisher=Professional Intern|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Benefits of Study Abroad|url=http://www.iesabroad.org/study-abroad/why/career-benefits|publisher=IES Abroad|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese students in the United States==
In China, study abroad in United States is increasingly popular in the present society. Many of them carry on the purpose of acquiring higher and better education in American universities. The number of Chinese students has increased in recent years. In just three years, the number of Chinese students has tripled to near 40,000, making them the largest group of foreign students at American universities. According to Kun and David (2010),  “Traditional Chinese culture places well-educated scholars in the highest social rank. Academic achievement is also an honour to the family. Dedication to scholarship becomes not only a personal goal but also a culture goal for Chinese international students.During the year of 2014-2015, China was the first in the world from which students are coming to U.S for studying and china is by far the largest student exchange in U.S during these years. Chinese students prefer to study in the US because US education focuses on quality education instead of quantity education followed by Chinese system. The reason is that China is one of the developed countries in the world and mostly students from wealthy and middle class families can easily fund their education and bear the expense of visa and education in the US. Hence they can easily settle there and carry out their education without problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/report-finds-china-sends-most-international-students-u-s-high-n792681|title=Report Finds China Sends Most International Students to U.S. High Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian students in the United States==
The number of Indian students in the United States grew from 148,360 in March 2015 to 194,438 in March 2016, a jump of 31.1%, according to the latest 'SEVIS by the Numbers' report.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Number-of-Indian-students-in-US-jumps-31/articleshow/52044943.cms&lt;/ref&gt; This is second only to China. Also, Indian Students contributed $5.01 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015-16 according to the Open Doors data 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37983915&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a '''technical school''' is a [[two-year college]] that covers fields such as business, finance, hospitality, tourism, construction, engineering, visual arts, information technology and community work.

==Associations supporting technical schools==
The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] is the largest U.S. education association dedicated to promoting career and technical education for youth and adults.

==United States military==
Technical school is also the term used in the [[United States Armed Forces]] for the job specific training given immediately after [[recruit training]]. Though similar to the training provided by a two-year college, the training is much more concise, eschewing any coursework outside the minimum necessary to begin working in the chosen career field; additionally, the training is more time intensive, often including more than nine in-class hours per day. [[Military]] technical school is typically one to three months in duration, though some schools are as short as two weeks or as long as two years.

Upon graduation, military technical school recruits are qualified only as apprentices and must work under supervision until they have completed a more extensive on-the-job training program. Many times the military training can be converted to standard university credits, leaving the graduating recruit with only a few general education requirement courses (such as speech or composition) to complete in order to receive the more traditional two-year technical school diploma referenced above.

===Beginning years===
The [[U.S. Congress]] laid the groundwork for the establishment of A.M.C. in 1862 with the adoption of the [[Morrill Act]]. The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the "leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life".&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In 1871, the [[Texas Legislature]] used these funds to establish the state's first public institution of higher education,&lt;ref name="txconstitution"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Texas Constitution, Article 7 – Education, Section 13 – Agricultural and Mechanical College|publisher=State of Texas|url=http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001300.html|accessdate=August 6, 2007

Enrollment began on October 2, 1876.  Six students enrolled on the first day, and classes officially began on October 4, 1876, with six faculty members. During the first semester, enrollment increased to 48 students, and by the end of the spring 1877 semester, 106 students had enrolled.  Admission was limited to white males, and all students were required to participate in the [[Texas A.M.C.

In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and clamored for an end of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, Texas A.M.C. was saved from potential closure by its new president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]], former [[governor of Texas]], and well-respected [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General]]. Ross made many improvements to the school and enrollment doubled to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A.M.C.

Under pressure from the legislature, in 1911 the school began allowing women to attend classes during the summer semester.&lt;ref name="kavanagh"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kavanagh |first=Colleen |title=Questioning Tradition |newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle |year=2001 |url=http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1questioningtradition.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041226171757/http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1questioningtradition.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 26, 2004 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=author%3AKavanagh+intitle%3AQuestioning+Tradition&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, A.M.C. began expanding its academic pursuits with the establishment of the [[Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences|School of Veterinary Medicine]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

===World Wars era===
Many Texas A&amp;M graduates served during [[World War I|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;I]]. By 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, more than any other school.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year.

Over 1,200&amp;nbsp;alumni served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&amp;M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; The first graduate school was organized in 1924 and the school awarded its first PhD in 1940.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&amp;M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony.&lt;ref name="crawford"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Texas A&amp;M Foundation Magazine &amp;#124; Spring 2010 | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Foundation | url=http://giving.tamu.edu/PDFs/Spring10_Spirit.pdf | accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling.&lt;ref name="kavanagh"/&gt;

Many Aggies again served in the military during [[World War II]], with the college producing 20,229 combat troops. Of those, 14,123 Aggies served as officers, more than any other school and more than the combined total of the [[United States Naval Academy]] and the [[United States Military Academy]].&lt;ref name="adams160"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams Jr.|first=John A.|title=Keepers of the Spirit |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2001|pages=160, 163|isbn=1-58544-127-9|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, 29 A&amp;M graduates reached the rank of general.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

At the start of World War II, Texas A&amp;M was selected as one of six engineering colleges to participate in the [[Electronics Training Program]], a ten-month activity of 12-hour study days to train Navy personnel who were urgently needed to maintain the then-new, highly complex electronic equipment such as [[radar]]. These colleges provided the Primary School, wherein the key topics of the first two years of a college [[electrical engineering]] curriculum were condensed into three months. The instructional effort at College Station was developed and led by Frank Bolton, EE department head and future Texas A&amp;M president. At a given time, some 500 Navy students were on the campus, a significant fraction of the then-years enrollment. Students graduating from the Primary Schools then went to a secondary school, one of which was at [[Ward Island (Texas)|Ward Island, Texas]] (the future location of [[Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Raymond C., Jr.; ''Solving the Naval Radar Crisis'', Trafford Publishing, 2007, pp. 210–211. {{ISBN|978-1-4251-6173-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University era===
[[File:Texas A&amp;M University Chemistry Building.jpg|thumb|Texas A&amp;M University Chemistry Plaza]]
On March 26, 1960, [[Major General]] [[James Earl Rudder]], class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college.&lt;ref name="dethloff184"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dethloff |first=Henry C. |title=A Pictorial History of Texas A&amp;M University, 1876–1976 |location=[[College Station, Texas]] |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |year=1975 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudder's tenure (1959–1970) marked a critical turning point in the school's history. Under his leadership, Texas A&amp;M underwent a dramatic expansion in its physical plant construction, but more importantly, it diversified and expanded its student body by admitting women and minorities. The Corps of Cadets became voluntary. In the face of growing student activism during the 1960s, Rudder worked diligently to ensure that the school continue to fulfill its mission of providing a quality education for all Aggies. By his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the school from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations.&lt;ref name="rudder"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ferrell |first=Christopher |title=Rudder's influence is evident on campus |work=The Eagle |location=Bryan-College Station |date=n.d. |url=http://archive.theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1rudderbio.htm |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908021731/http://archive.theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1rudderbio.htm |archive-date=September 8, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bean, Christopher B. "James Earl Rudder and the Transformation of Texas A&amp;M University," ''Journal of South Texas'' (Fall 2008), Vol. 21 Issue 2, pp 119–31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the 58th [[Legislature of Texas]] approved of Rudder's changes, and officially renamed the school "Texas A&amp;M University",&lt;ref name="rudder"/&gt; specifying that the "A" and the "M" were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for "Agricultural and Mechanical".&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In the following 35&amp;nbsp;years, Texas A&amp;M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000&amp;nbsp;&lt;!-- Measurement of population --&gt;students to over 45,000.&lt;ref name="TAMUfacts"&gt;{{Cite web |title=About Texas A&amp;M University |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |url= https://www.tamu.edu/about/ |accessdate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the legislative work allowing the expansion of Texas A&amp;M and the admission of women was pushed by [[Texas State Senate|State Senator]] [[William T. Moore (Texas politician)|William T. "Bill" Moore]], who served from 1949 to 1981. Known as "the Bull of the Brazos" and "the father of the modern Texas A&amp;M University", Moore was a Bryan attorney and businessman originally from [[Wheelock, Texas|Wheelock]] in [[Robertson County, Texas|Robertson County]]. He also taught economics at TAMU before his entry into World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Borden, Robert C. "Bull of the Brazos dies: Moore was champion of Texas A&amp;M", ''[[Bryan-College Station Eagle]]'', May 28, 1999, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas A&amp;M became one of the first four universities given the designation [[sea-grant university|sea-grant]] for its achievements in [[oceanography]] and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title [[space-grant college|space-grant]] by [[NASA]], to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Texas A&amp;M University|encyclopedia=Britannica|volume=1|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/589321/Texas-A-M-University|accessdate=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the school became the home of the [[George Bush Presidential Library]]. Operated by the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], it is one of thirteen American [[Presidential library|presidential libraries]]. Former President [[George H.W.

In 1998, activists on campus (including Professor Patrick Slattery) suggested the statue of former university president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]] should be removed on the basis that he was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name="deconstructingracismslattery"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slattery |first=Patrick |title=Deconstructing Racism One Statue at a Time: Visual Culture Wars at Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas at Austin |journal=Visual Arts Research|volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=28–31 |jstor=20715415 | date = 2006 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Slattery and others wanted to create a "diversity plaza", with a statue of [[Matthew Gaines]], an African-American politician.&lt;ref name="deconstructingracismslattery"/&gt; The project was abandoned in the wake of the [[Aggie Bonfire tragedy]], in 1999.&lt;ref name="deconstructingracismslattery"/&gt;

TAMU researchers have named the largest volcano on Earth, [[Tamu Massif]], after the university.
 
In December 2016, the university became the focus of a PETA campaign hoping to close down certain veterinary laboratories, which it alleges perform abusive experiments on dogs with [[muscular dystrophy]], including breeding dogs to worsen their illnesses and housing them in inhumane cages. The campaign urged supporters to write letters to the school in protest of experimenting on the dogs. Texas A&amp;M responded that a video had been posted by PETA with insufficient context, and it said that the animals in question receive high-quality care with oversight from the [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/action/action-alerts/texas-university-dog-laboratories/|title=This Texas A&amp;M Experimenter Has Received Millions to Breed Dogs with Painful Muscular Dystrophy|website=Peta.org|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/16/peta-bites-texas-m-over-cruel-golden-retriever-research.html|title=PETA bites Texas A&amp;M over 'cruel' golden retriever research|date=December 16, 2016|website=Foxnews.com|accessdate=June 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233548/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/16/peta-bites-texas-m-over-cruel-golden-retriever-research.html#|archive-date=June 28, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/disturbing-footage-shows-aandm-dogs-used-in-medical-research-updated-9012763|title=Disturbing Footage Shows A&amp;M Dogs Used in Medical Research [UPDATED]|first=Craig|last=Malisow|date=December 9, 2016|website=Houstonpress.com|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Texas-AM-responds-to-PETA-video-featuring-dogs-used-in-medical-research-406097505.html|title=Texas A&amp;M responds to PETA video showing dogs used for medical research|first=Rusty|last=Surette|website=Kbtx.com|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the idea that all enrolled students and "former students" comprise a family (the term alumni is not generally used, as "former students" include those who could not complete their education, such as those who entered military service), Aggies have created two traditions to honor members of the Aggie family who have died. [[Muster (Texas A&amp;M University)|Aggie Muster]] is held annually on the anniversary of the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], April 21, to honor the death during the previous year of any enrolled student or alumni. Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at [[Reed Arena]] on the [[Texas A&amp;M University campus]].&lt;ref name="lozano"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lozano|first=Juan A.|title=Especially solemn rite of Muster|date=April 22, 2000|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2000_3209862|accessdate=August 16, 2007|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent.

Students who die while enrolled at Texas A&amp;M are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, on the first Tuesday of the month.  This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A&amp;M president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]].&lt;ref name="hegstrom"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hegstrom|first=Edward|title='Silver Taps' honors Aggie Bonfire victims|date=December 8, 1999|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1999_3182335|accessdate=August 16, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of the ceremony, flags fly half-staff and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15&amp;nbsp;pm the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza. Following a [[21-gun salute]] by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six [[Bugle (instrument)|buglers]] play an A&amp;M version of the song ''[[Taps]]'', Silver Taps, three times from the dome of the school's Academic Building: once to the north, the south and to the west. The song is not played to the east symbolizing that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.&lt;ref name="silvertaps"/&gt;

====12th Man====
Aggie students are called the [[12th Man (football)|12th Man]], meaning in the context of football that they support the 11 players on the field and would be willing, if it were possible, to enter the game if necessary. To further symbolize their "readiness, desire, and enthusiasm," it is traditional for students in attendance to stand throughout the game.&lt;ref name="12thMan"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |title=Twelfth Man |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229030439/http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |archivedate=December 29, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition began on January 2, 1922, at the [[Dixie Classic (bowl game)|Dixie Classic]] where A&amp;M played [[Centre College]]. A&amp;M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that [[head coach|Coach]] [[Dana X. Bible]] feared he would not have enough men to finish the game.  He called into the stands for [[E. King Gill#History|E. King Gill]], a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball.  Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. A&amp;M won 22–14, but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies.&lt;ref name="beano"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Beano|title=Ten Days That Shook the Sport|publisher=ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2615391|date=October 8, 2006|accessdate=July 26, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent decades, the 12th Man is represented on the field by a [[Walk-on (sport term)|walk-on]] player who wears the No. 12 jersey and participates in kick-offs.&lt;ref name="heater"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heater|first=Jay|title=LaMantia A&amp;M's Main 12th Man|publisher=Oakland Tribune|date=December 27, 2006|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5761605.html|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally from football students supporting any of the sports.

'''''The Underground History of American Education: A Schoolteacher’s Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling''''' ({{ISBN|0-945700-05-9}}, pbk. {{ISBN|0-945700-04-0}}) is a critique of the United States [[education]] system by [[John Taylor Gatto]].

A former teacher, Gatto left the classroom the same year he was named New York State Teacher of the Year. He announced his decision in a letter titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20040203180418/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/prologue2.htm "I Quit, I Think]".

Using anecdotes gathered from thirty years of teaching, alongside documentation, Gatto presents his view of ''modern compulsion schooling'' as opposed to genuine education, describing a "conflict between systems which offer physical safety and certainty at the cost of suppressing free will, and those which offer liberty at the price of constant risk".
 
Gatto argues that educational strategies promoted by government and industry leaders for over a century included the creation of a system that keeps real power in the hands of very few people.

From the book's Introduction:
:"... Underground History isn’t a history proper, but a collection of materials toward a history, embedded in a personal essay analyzing why mass compulsion schooling is unreformable. The history I have unearthed is important to our understanding; it’s a good start, I believe, but much remains undone."

:"... what I’m trying to describe [is] that what has happened to our schools was inherent in the original design for a planned economy and a planned society laid down so proudly at the end of the nineteenth century."

[[Russ Kick]] offers this in summary:
:"In other words, the captains of industry and government explicitly wanted an educational system that would maintain social order by teaching us just enough to get by but not enough so that we could think for ourselves, question the sociopolitical order, or communicate articulately."{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The book was read from 2006-2007 for the [[Unwelcome Guests]] radio show.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/The_Underground_History_of_American_Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://johntaylorgatto.com/underground/prologue2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402134131/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/prologue2.htm |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition of the book is expected to be released in November, 2015, with a foreword by [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=David|url=https://twitter.com/djrodriguez2015/status/659849746920566784|website=twitter}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11869">[[Image:Tokyo University Entrance Exam Results 4.JPG|thumb|300px|At [[Tokyo University]], at the announcement of test results, a successful student is being thrown into the air in celebration.]]
The {{nihongo|'''yobikō'''|予備校|}} are privately-run schools marketed to students who are taking examinations held each year in [[Japan]] from January to March to determine college admissions. The students generally graduated from high school but failed to enter the school of their choice. The test, unlike the French ''[[baccalauréat]]'' and the South Korean [[College Scholastic Ability Test]], has different versions, with different schools looking for results from different exams. In Japan, the test is generally considered the most important event in a child's education. Students who fail may spend a year or more studying to retake the examination. They are colloquially referred to as ''[[rōnin (student)|rōnin]]''. Yobiko are similar to [[juku]] except for differences such as curriculum, legal status, and the main type of students who attend.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry." Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 448–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations." Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 285–303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
They are for-profit private corporations &lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): p.301&lt;/ref&gt; that are officially listed as schools by Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 448–60.&lt;/ref&gt; At the municipal level, they are supervised by boards of education.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 448–60&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, they are subject to little supervision, as compliance with regulations for physical conditions what is mainly checked, and curriculum and teacher salaries are not inspected.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 448–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Yobikō mainly differ by the number of enrolled students. The most numerous are those for each city, and each has less than 500 students.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): p.287-288&lt;/ref&gt; National yobikō, called mammoth yobikō, have 10,000 students or more.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 288&lt;/ref&gt; Some also prepare students to pass specialized entrance exams such as those for medical and art schools and have less than 100 students and typically charge higher tuition than other types.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Curriculum===
Designed to prepare students to pass college entrance exams, the curriculum had memorization of facts and learning of exam-taking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 456&lt;/ref&gt; A study of a typical yobiko&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p. 44-49&lt;/ref&gt; found that the curriculum consisted of studying questions that were on previous exams, specific ways to improve answers, and specific subject topics that would be covered in the exam.

===Personnel===
The teaching personnel is variety of teachers, mostly employed and casual part-time teachers such as retired teachers and teachers affiliated with another school.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 455&lt;/ref&gt; A few are regular full-time teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 455&lt;/ref&gt;

===Students===
The lines between the age groups of students that attend yobikō are becoming blurred. Junior high school students and high school seniors are known to attend&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 449&lt;/ref&gt; after their regular school hours and on Sundays &lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 288&lt;/ref&gt; but most students are ''rōnin'', high school graduates who have failed the college entrance exam and are preparing to take it again.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; As ''rōnin'' students, they attend yobiko classes full-time.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations". Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring===
The quality of teaching is observed and evaluated by methods such as cameras in classrooms and a survey related to the quality of teachers' performances that students take.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 455&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock exams===
Students take [[test (assessment)#Test preparations|mock exams]] throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Scores are made public so students are able to compare their scores with the scores of other students to find their academic standing.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their scores, students know whether they can meet the required entrance test scores required by the college to which they plan to apply.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance and popularity==
Family spending on private higher education is as common as that for public higher education. The [[OECD]] reported that in 2013, private spending accounted for about 66 percent of higher education costs and about 80 percent of that amount came from households (p.&amp;nbsp;2-3).

One of the most well-known yobikō is the Kawaii Juku.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 449&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is considered a juku, among the courses it offers are classes specifically for entrance exam preparation, giving it a yobikō-like characteristic. It appeals not only to ''rōnin'' students but also to a wide range of age groups, as classes are offered to students from elementary school to college (Kawaijuku Group, 2012).

==Advantages==
Japan’s low juvenile crime rate may be caused in part because children who attend yobikōor juku, in addition to regular school, have less free time.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry". Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 460&lt;/ref&gt;

Yobiko could improve students' chances of being accepting to a higher-quality college. Also, in general, ''rōnin'' who attend higher-quality colleges earn more income (Ono, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;282).

==Disadvantages==
The yobikō is not equally accessible to students. A national survey and a survey on the [[Hiroshima]] branch of a yobikō, which could be considered a typical one, found that more males attend yobikō than females.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations." Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 288&lt;/ref&gt; One reason is that a female ''rōnin''  is frowned upon in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, M. (1988b). The yobiko, the institutionalized supplementary educational institution in Japan: A study of the social stratification process (Doctoral dissertation) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Also, not all students are able to afford to attend one.&lt;ref&gt;Tsukada, Mamoru (1988). "Institutionalised Supplementary Education in Japan: The Yobiko and Ronin Student Adaptations." Comparative Education. Taylor &amp; Francis. 24 (3): 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The strain on family income created by the expenses of sending children to yobikō or juku may be contributing to the declining [[birth rate]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Tuvia (1992). "Japan's Juken Industry." Asian Survey. University of California Press. 32 (5): 460&lt;/ref&gt;
