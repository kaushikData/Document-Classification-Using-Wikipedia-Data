'''Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma''' ('''ATL''' or '''ATLL''') is a rare [[cancer]] of the immune system's own [[T-cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid4544052"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=572–3 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197403072901018 |title=Still More on NBT Technic |year=1974 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=290 |issue=10 |pmid=4544052 |last1=Yodoi |first1=J |last2=Takatsuki |first2=K |last3=Masuda |first3=T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid301762"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=301762 |year=1977 |last1=Uchiyama |first1=T |last2=Yodoi |first2=J |last3=Sagawa |first3=K |last4=Takatsuki |first4=K |last5=Uchino |first5=H |title=Adult T-cell leukemia: Clinical and hematologic features of 16 cases |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=481–92 |journal=Blood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22068231"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=423–8 |doi=10.1007/s12185-011-0957-x |title=The discovery of ATL: an odyssey in restrospect |year=2011 |journal=International Journal of Hematology |volume=94 |issue=5 |pmid=22068231 |last1=Yodoi |first1=J |last2=Maeda |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type 1 ([[HTLV-1]]) is believed to be the cause of it,&lt;ref name="pmid15726602"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=232–9 |doi=10.1002/ajh.20307 |title=Current views in HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma |year=2005 |last1=Nicot |first1=Christophe |journal=American Journal of Hematology |volume=78 |issue=3 |pmid=15726602}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to several other diseases.

==Signs and symptoms==
ATL is usually a highly aggressive [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] with no characteristic [[histologic]] appearance except for a diffuse pattern and a mature T-cell [[phenotype]]. Circulating [[lymphocyte]]s with an irregular nuclear contour (leukemic cells) are frequently seen. Several lines of evidence suggest that [[HTLV-1]] causes ATL. This evidence includes the frequent isolation of HTLV-1 from patients with this disease and the detection of HTLV-1 proviral [[genome]] in ATL leukemic cells. ATL is frequently accompanied by visceral involvement, [[hypercalcemia]], [[skin lesion]]s, and lytic bone lesions. Bone invasion and [[osteolysis]], features of bone metastases, commonly occur in the setting of advanced solid tumors, such as breast, prostate, and lung cancers, but are less common in hematologic malignancies. However, patients with HTLV-1–induced ATL and [[multiple myeloma]] are predisposed to the development of tumor-induced osteolysis and hypercalcemia. One of the striking features of ATL and [[multiple myeloma]] induced bone disease is that the bone lesions are predominantly osteolytic with little associated osteoblastic activity. In patients with ATL, elevated serum levels of IL-1, TGFβ, PTHrP, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1α), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) have been associated with hypercalcemia. Immunodeficient mice that received implants with leukemic cells from patients with ATL or with HTLV-1–infected lymphocytes developed hypercalcemia and elevated serum levels of PTHrP.&lt;ref name="pmid16118323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao L, Deng H, Zhao H, Hirbe A, Harding J, Ratner L, Weilbaecher K | title = HTLV-1 Tax transgenic mice develop spontaneous osteolytic bone metastases prevented by osteoclast inhibition | journal = Blood | volume = 106 | issue = 13 | pages = 4294–302 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16118323 | pmc = 1895233 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most patients die within one year of diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma |title=Treatment and prognosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infection with HTLV-1, like infection with other [[retroviruses]], probably occurs for life and can be inferred when [[antibody]] against HTLV-1 is detected in the [[blood plasma|serum]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Transmission==
Transmission of [[HTLV-1]] is believed to occur from mother to child; by sexual contact; and through exposure to contaminated blood, either through [[blood transfusion]] or sharing of contaminated needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors = Gotuzzo E, Verdonck K |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83714/ |title=HTLV-1: CLINICAL IMPACT OF A CHRONIC INFECTION |website=NCBI |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, it has been reported that the traditional glucocorticoid-based chemotherapy toward ATL are largely mediated by thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/TXNIP/VDUP1), suggesting the potential use of a TBP-2 inducer as a novel therapeutic target.&lt;ref name="pmid21151022"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=440–8 |doi=10.1038/leu.2010.286 |title=Thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2/VDUP1/TXNIP) regulates T-cell sensitivity to glucocorticoid during HTLV-I-induced transformation. |year=2011 |last1=Chen |first1=Z |last2=Lopez-Ramos |first2=D |journal=Leukemia |volume=25 |issue=3 |pmid=21151022 |pmc=3072512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20398702&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Z|author2=Yoshihara E|title=Differential roles of Annexin A1 (ANXA1/lipocortin-1/lipomodulin) and thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/VDUP1/TXNIP) in glucocorticoid signaling of HTLV-I-transformed T cells.|journal=Immunology Letters|year=2010|volume=131|issue=1|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/j.imlet.2010.04.003|pmid=20398702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[mogamulizumab]], has been approved for the treatment of ATL in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramaniam|first1=JM|last2=Whiteside|first2=G|last3=McKeage|first3=K|last4=Croxtall|first4=JC|title=Mogamulizumab: first global approval.|journal=Drugs|date=June 2012|volume=72|issue=9|pages=1293–8|doi=10.2165/11631090-000000000-00000|pmid=22686619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a medical conference in December 2013, researchers reported anywhere from 21-50% of ATL patients have disease expressing CD30.&lt;ref&gt;Campuzano-Zuluaga, G; Pimentel, A; Diaz, L; Chapman-Fredricks, JR; and Ramos, JC "	CD30 Expression Is Associated With Decreased Survival In Patients With Acute and Unfavorable Chronic Types Of Adult T-Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma" December 2013 https://ash.confex.com/ash/2013/webprogram/Paper64702.html&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests treatment with CD30-targeting [[brentuximab vedotin]] may be beneficial.

==Epidemiology==
HTLV-1 infection in the [[United States]] appears to be rare. Although little [[serologic]] data exist, prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among blacks living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among black intravenous drug abusers in [[New Jersey]], and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in [[New Orleans]]. It is possible that prevalence of infection is increasing in this risk group. Studies of HTLV-1 antibody indicate that the virus is endemic in southern [[Japan]], in the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], and in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

ATL is relatively uncommon among those infected with [[HTLV-1]]. The overall incidence of ATL is estimated at about 1 per 1,500 adult HTLV-1 carriers per year. Those cases that have been reported have occurred mostly among persons from the Caribbean or blacks from the Southeast (National Institutes of Health, unpublished data). There appears to be a long latent period between [[HTLV-1]] infection and the start of ATL.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Research==
Novel approaches to the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed or refractory setting are under investigation. [[Pralatrexate]] is one compound currently under investigations for the treatment of PTCL.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==In pregnancy==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.&lt;ref name=Shapira /&gt;  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of [[miscarriage]] and [[birth defect]]s, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive [[first trimester]].&lt;ref name=Shapira&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shapira T, Pereg D, Lishner M |title=How I treat acute and chronic leukemia in pregnancy|journal=Blood Rev.|volume=22|issue=5|pages=247–59|date=September 2008|pmid=18472198|doi=10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21114">'''Advanced maternal age''', in a broad sense, is the instance of a woman being of an older age at a stage of reproduction, although there are various definitions of specific age and stage of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Fretts2012&gt;[http://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-advanced-age-on-fertility-and-pregnancy-in-women Effect of advanced age on fertility and pregnancy in women] at [[UpToDate]].

This topic last updated: Dec 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The variability in definitions  is in part explained by the effects of increasing age occurring as a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] rather than as a threshold effect.&lt;ref name="Fretts2012" /&gt;

In Western, Northern, and Southern Europe, first-time mothers are on average 27 to 29 years old, up from 23 to 25 years at the start of the 1970s. In a number of European countries (Spain), the mean age of women at first childbirth has crossed the 30 year threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/SF2.3%20Mean%20age%20of%20mother%20at%20first%20childbirth%20-%20updated%20240212.pdf |title=SF2.3: Mean age of mothers at first childbirth |accessdate=2014-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222133841/http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/SF2.3%20Mean%20age%20of%20mother%20at%20first%20childbirth%20-%20updated%20240212.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is not restricted to Europe. [[Asia]], [[Japan]] and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise, and increasingly the process is spreading to countries in the [[developing world]] like [[China]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In the U.S., the average age of first childbirth was 26 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm|title=FastStats|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced maternal age is associated with adverse reproductive effects such as increased risk of [[female infertility|infertility]],&lt;ref name=Leridon2004 /&gt; and that the children have [[chromosomal abnormalities]].&lt;ref name=morris /&gt; The corresponding [[paternal age effect]] is less pronounced.&lt;ref name="Tournaye-2009"&gt;H. Tournaye, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=-SlaAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 Male Reproductive Ageing]," in Bewley, Ledger, and Nikolaou, eds., ''Reproductive Ageing'', Cambridge University Press (2009), {{ISBN|9781906985134}} (accessed 15 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kidd-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kidd SA, Eskenazi B, Wyrobek AJ |title=Effects of male age on semen quality and fertility: a review of the literature |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=237–48 |year=2001 |pmid=11172821 |doi= 10.1016/S0015-0282(00)01679-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015-0282(00)01679-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In present generations it is more common to have children at an older age. Several factors may influence the decisions of parents when having their first baby. Such factors include educational, social and economic status.

== History ==
Having children later  was not exceptional in the past, when families were larger and women often continued bearing children until the end of their reproductive age. What is so radical about this recent transformation is that it is the age at which women give birth to their first child which is becoming comparatively high, leaving an ever more constricted window of biological opportunity for second and subsequent children, should they be desired. Unsurprisingly, high first-birth ages and high rates of birth postponement are associated with the arrival of low, and lowest-low fertility.

This association has now become especially clear, since the postponement of first births in a number of  countries has now continued unabated for more than three decades, and has become one of the most prominent characteristics of fertility patterns in developed societies. A variety of authors (in particular [[Lesthaeghe]]) have argued that fertility postponement constitutes the ‘hallmark’ of what has become known as the [[second demographic transition]].

Others have proposed that the postponement process itself constitutes a separate 'third transition'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Kohler, H. P. |author2=Billari, F. C. |author3=Ortega, J. A. |year=2002|title=The emergence of lowest-low fertility in Europe during the 1990s|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=28|issue=4|pages=641–680|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2002.00641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this latter view, modern developed societies exhibit a kind of dual fertility pattern, with the majority of [[births]] being concentrated either among very young or increasingly older mothers. This is sometimes known as the '[[rectangularisation]]' of [[fertility patterns]].

== Examples ==
In the USA, the average age at which women bore their first child advanced from 21.4 years old in 1970, to 25 years old in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mathews|first=TJ|title=Delayed Childbearing: More Women Are Having Their First Child Later in Life|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db21.pdf|work=2009|publisher=CDC|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Federal Institute for Population Research]] claimed in 2015 the percentage for women with an age of at least 35 giving birth to a child was 25.9%. This figure rose from 7.6% in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bib-demografie.de/SharedDocs/Publikationen/DE/Download/Grafik_des_Monats/2017-12-20-Jedes-vierte-Neugeborene-hat-eine-Mutter-ueber-34-Jahre.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible factors that influence childbearing age==
There are many factors that may influence childbearing age in women, although they are mostly [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlations without certain causations]].

Two studies show that generous parental leave allowances in Britain encourage young motherhood and that parental-leave allowance reduces postponement in Sweden.&lt;ref name="balbo2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Balbo, Nicoletta|author2=Billari, Francesco C.|author3=Mills, Melinda|year=2013|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|journal=European Journal of Population|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–38|doi=10.1007/s10680-012-9277-y|pmc=3576563|pmid=23440941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Decreased fertility ===
[[File:Age and female fertility.png|thumb|270px|Cumulative percentage and average age for women reaching [[subfertility]], [[Infertility|sterility]], [[irregular menstruation]] and [[menopause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=te Velde|first1=E.

{{Main|Age and female fertility}}

A woman's fertility peaks lasts during the twenties and first half of thirties, after which it starts to decline, with advanced maternal age causing an increased risk of [[female infertility]].

According to Henri Leridon, PhD, an epidemiologist with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, of women trying to get pregnant, without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization:&lt;ref name=Leridon2004&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/humrep/2004/00000019/00000007/art01548] [http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/7/1548]

=== Risk of birth defects ===
[[File:Down risk by maternal age.png|thumb|The risk of having a Down syndrome pregnancy in relation to a mother's age.]]

A woman's risk of having a baby with [[chromosomal abnormalities]] increases with her age. [[Down syndrome]] is the most common chromosomal [[Congenital disorder|birth defect]], and a woman's risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is:&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=JK|author2=Mutton, DE|author3= Alberman, E|title=Revised estimates of the maternal age specific live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome.|journal=Journal of Medical Screening|date=2002|volume=9|issue=1|pages=2–6|pmid=11943789|doi=10.1136/jms.9.1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At age 20, 1 in 1,441
* At age 25, 1 in 1,383
* At age 30, 1 in 959
* At age 35, 1 in 338
* At age 40, 1 in 84
* At age 45, 1 in 32
* At age 50, 1 in 44

=== Other effects ===
Advanced maternal age is associated with adverse outcomes in the [[perinatal period]], which may be caused by detrimental effects on [[decidua]]l and [[placenta]]l development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Telfer | first2 = E. E. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = R. A. | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms043 | title = The ageing ovary and uterus: New biological insights | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–83 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23103636| pmc =3508627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of the mother dying before the child becomes an adult increases by more advanced maternal age, such as can be demonstrated by the following data from France in 2007:&lt;ref name=Schmidt2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = L. | last2 = Sobotka | first2 = T. | last3 = Bentzen | first3 = J. G. | last4 = Nyboe Andersen | first4 = A. | author5 = on behalf of the ESHRE Reproduction Society Task Force | title = Demographic and medical consequences of the postponement of parenthood | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–43 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21989171 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr040}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"

| 0.6 || 1.0 || 1.6 || 2.6 || 3.8 || 5.5
|}

Advanced maternal age continues to be associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight, pre-term birth, stillbirth, unexplained fetal death, and increased rates of Caesarean section.

On the other hand, advanced maternal age is associated with a more stable family environment, higher socio-economic position, higher income and better living conditions, as well as better parenting practices,&lt;ref name=Schmidt2011 /&gt; but it is more or less uncertain whether these entities are ''effects'' of advanced maternal age, are ''contributors'' to advanced maternal age, or common effects of a certain state such as personality type.

== Changes in interpregnancy interval ==
Kalberer et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalberer | first1 = U | last2 = Baud | first2 = D | last3 = Fontanet | first3 = A | last4 = Hohlfeld | first4 = P | last5 = de Ziegler | first5 = D | date = Dec 2009 | title = Birth records from Swiss married couples analyzed over the past 35 years reveal an aging of first-time mothers by 5.1 years while the interpregnancy interval has shortened | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 92 | issue = 6| pages = 2072–3 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.05.078| pmid = 19608170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that despite the older maternal age at birth of the first child, the time span between the birth of the first and the second child (= interpregnancy interval) decreased over the last decades. If purely biological factors were at work, it could be argued that interpregnancy interval should have increased, as fertility declines with age, which would make it harder for the woman to get a second child after postponed birth of the first one. This not being the case shows that sociologic factors (see above) prime over biological factors in determining interpregnancy interval.

With technology developments cases of [[post-menopausal]] pregnancies have occurred, and there are several known cases of [[Pregnancy over age 50|older women]] carrying a pregnancy to term, usually with [[in vitro fertilization]] of a donor egg.  A 61-year-old Brazilian woman with implantation of a donor egg expected gave birth to twins in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman, 61, pregnant|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/woman-61-pregnant-20110926-1ktkg.html|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/26/antonia-leticia-asti-61-year-old-mother-gives-birth-to-twins_n_2025486.html Antônia Letícia Asti, 61 Year-Old Brazilian Woman, Gives Birth To Twins]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ovarian aging ==

As women age, they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to [[menopause]].  This decline is tied to a decline in the number of [[ovarian follicle]]s.   Although about 1 million [[oocyte]]s are present at birth in the human [[ovary]], only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these [[Ovulation|ovulate]], and the rest do not ([[ovarian follicle atresia]]).  The decline in [[ovarian reserve]] appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age,&lt;ref name="pmid18192670"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansen KR, Knowlton NS, Thyer AC, Charleston JS, Soules MR, Klein NA |title=A new model of reproductive aging: the decline in ovarian non-growing follicle number from birth to menopause |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=699–708 |year=2008 |pmid=18192670 |doi=10.1093/humrep/dem408 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 51.  As ovarian reserve and [[fertility]] decline with age, there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and [[meiosis|meiotic]] errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal [[Fertilisation|conceptions]].

Titus et al.&lt;ref name=Titus&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Titus S, Li F, Stobezki R, Akula K, Unsal E, Jeong K, Dickler M, Robson M, Moy F, Goswami S, Oktay K |title=Impairment of BRCA1-related DNA double-strand break repair leads to ovarian aging in mice and humans |journal=Sci Transl Med |volume=5 |issue=172 |pages=172ra21 |year=2013 |pmid=23408054 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3004925 |pmc=5130338}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed an explanation for the decline in ovarian reserve with age.  They showed that as women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles.  Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of [[granulosa cell]]s.  An enzyme system is present in oocytes that normally accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks.  This repair system is referred to as [[homologous recombination]]al repair, and it is especially active during [[meiosis]].  Meiosis is the general process by which [[germ cell]]s are formed in [[eukaryote]]s, and it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA by homologous recombinational repair (see [[Origin and function of meiosis]] also&lt;ref&gt;Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein and Richard E. Michod  (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19 pages 357-382 in “DNA Repair” (Inna Kruman editor). InTech Open Publisher. DOI: 10.5772/25117  {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}} http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair&lt;/ref&gt;).  Human primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, that is prophase I (see [[Oogenesis]]).  Titus et al.&lt;ref name=Titus /&gt; also showed that expression of four key [[DNA repair]] genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair (''[[BRCA1]]'', ''[[MRE11A|MRE11]]'', ''[[Rad51]]'' and ''[[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]]'') decline in oocytes with age.  This age-related decline in ability to repair double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, which then likely contributes to the decline in ovarian reserve.

Women with an inherited mutation in the DNA repair gene ''BRCA1'' undergo menopause prematurely,&lt;ref name="pmid16773440"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rzepka-Górska I, Tarnowski B, Chudecka-Głaz A, Górski B, Zielińska D, Tołoczko-Grabarek A |title=Premature menopause in patients with BRCA1 gene mutation |journal=Breast Cancer Res. Treat. |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=59–63 |year=2006 |pmid=16773440 |doi=10.1007/s10549-006-9220-1 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in these women, and this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure.  [[Exome sequencing|Genomic]] data from about 70,000 women were analyzed to identify protein-coding variation associated with age at natural menopause.&lt;ref name="pmid26414677"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Day FR, Ruth KS, Thompson DJ, et al. |title=Large-scale genomic analyses link reproductive aging to hypothalamic signaling, breast cancer susceptibility and BRCA1-mediated DNA repair |journal=Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1614">In [[alchemy]], '''albedo''' is one of the four major stages of the [[magnum opus (alchemy)|magnum opus]]; along with [[nigredo]], [[citrinitas]] and [[rubedo]]. It is a Latinicized term meaning "whiteness". Following the [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] or ''massa confusa'' of the [[nigredo]] stage, the alchemist undertakes a purification in albedo, which is literally referred to as ''ablutio'' &amp;ndash; the washing away of impurities.  In this process, the subject is divided into two opposing principles to be later coagulated to form a [[unity of opposites]] or ''coincidentia oppositorum'' during rubedo.&lt;ref&gt;R. van den Broek, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Gnosis and Hermeticism from Antiquity to Modern Times.'' SUNY Press. 1998. p.158-159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titus Burckhardt]] interprets the albedo as the end of the lesser work, corresponding to a spiritualization of the body.  The goal of this portion of the process is to regain the original purity and receptivity of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Burckhardt. ''Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos- Science of the Soul.'' Penguin Books, 1967. p.183-189&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Carl Jung]] equated the albedo with unconscious contrasexual soul images; the [[Anima (Jung)|anima]] in men and [[Anima (Jung)#The female "animus"|animus]] in women. It is a phase where insight into shadow projections are realized, and inflated ego and unneeded conceptualizations are removed from the psyche.

The '''''American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology''''' (abbreviated '''ASPHO''') is an American multidisciplinary professional organization dedicated to improving care in the medical disciplines of [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[hematology|hematology]] and [[pediatric oncology|oncology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seibel N | title = The American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | journal = Journal of Oncology Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 313 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 29447566 | pmc = 2793658 | doi = 10.1200/jop.2006.2.6.313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, it had 2,000 members.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aspho.org/about/overview |title=About |website=aspho.org |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology was founded in 1981, largely because of the efforts of physician Carl Pochedly, who served as its secretary-treasurer for fourteen years. After holding meetings jointly with the [[American Pediatric Society]] and the [[Society for Pediatric Research]], the ASPHO held its first independent meeting in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearson HA | title = History of pediatric hematology oncology | journal = Pediatric Research | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 979–92 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12438679 | doi = 10.1203/00006450-200212000-00026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was incorporated in the state of Illinois in 1989.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Publications==
Since 2004, the official journal of ASPHO has been ''[[Pediatric Blood &amp; Cancer]]''. Its official journal was originally the ''Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology'', which was established by Pochedly in 1979 as the ''American Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology''.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Medical use==
* [[odontology|Odonto]][[stomatology]]: [[gingivitis]], [[stomatitis]], [[glossitis]], [[aphthous ulcers]], [[dental surgery]] and oral [[Mouth ulcer|ulceration]] due to [[radiation therapy]].
* Otorhinolaryngology: [[glandular fever]], [[pharyngitis]], [[tonsillitis]], post-[[tonsillectomy]], [[radiation]] or [[intubation]] [[mucositis]].
It may be used alone or as an adjunct to other therapy giving the possibility of increased [[therapeutic effect]] with little risk of interaction.

In some markets, the drug is supplied as an over-the-counter cream (Lonol in Mexico from [[Boehringer Ingelheim]]) used for topical treatment of musculoskeletal system disorders: sprains, strains, bursitis, tendinitis, synovitis, myalgia, periarthritis.

==Antimicrobial activity==
Studies indicate that benzydamine has notable [[in vitro]] [[antibacterial]] activity and also shows synergism in combination with other antibiotics, especially tetracyclines, against antibiotic-resistant strains of [[Staphylococcus aureus]] and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Fanaki NH, el-Nakeeb MA.

''Arzneimittelforschung.'' 1996 Mar;46(3):320-3. {{PMID|8901158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
There are no contraindications to the use of benzydamine except for known [[hypersensitivity]].

==Side effects==
Benzydamine is well tolerated. Occasionally oral tissue numbness or stinging sensations may occur, as well as itching, a skin rash, skin swelling or redness, difficulty breathing and wheezing.

==Pharmacology==
It selectively binds to inflamed tissues ([[Prostaglandin#Biosynthesis|Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor]]) and is normally free of adverse systemic effects.
Unlike other NSAIDs, it does not inhibit cyclooxygenase or lipooxygenase, and is not ulcerogenic.&lt;ref name=clintox/&gt;

==Recreational use==
Benzydamine has been used recreationally. In overdosages it acts as a [[deliriant]] and [[CNS stimulant]].&lt;ref name=clintox&gt;{{Cite journal

Synthesis starts with the reaction of the ''N''-benzyl derivative from [[methyl anthranilate]] with [[nitrous acid]] to give the ''N''-nitroso derivative. Reduction by means of [[sodium thiosulfate]] leads to the transient hydrazine ('''3'''), which undergoes spontaneous internal hydrazide formation. Treatment of the enolate of this amide with 3-chloro-1-dimethylamkino propane gives benzydamine ('''5'''). Please note there is an error in this section: US3318905 states that the nitroso derivative is reduced with sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) and not with sodium hyposulfite (sodium thiosulfate), as shown in the above scheme and stated in text. 
[[File:Benzydamine synthesis 2.svg|thumb|center|500px|&lt;ref name=Palazzo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Baiocchi, G. Corsi and G. Palazzo, Ann.Chim. (Roma), 55, 116 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An interesting alternative synthesis of this substance starts by sequential reaction of ''N''-benzylaniline with [[phosgene]], and then with [[sodium azide]] to product the corresponding carbonyl azide. On heating, nitrogen is evolved and a separatable mixture of [[nitrene]] insertion product and the desired ketoindazole # results. The latter reaction appears to be a [[Curtius rearrangement]] type product to produce an N-isocyanate #, which then cyclizes. Alkylation of the enol with sodium methoxide and 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride gives benzydamine.

Alternatively, use of [[chloroacetamide]] in the alkylation step followed by acid hydrolysis produces [[bendazac]] instead.

'''Blood glucose monitoring''' is a way of testing the concentration of [[glucose]] in the blood ([[Blood sugar|glycemia]]).   Particularly important in [[diabetes management]], a blood glucose test is typically performed by piercing the [[skin]] (typically, on the finger) to draw blood, then applying the blood to a chemically active disposable 'test-strip'.  Different manufacturers use different technology, but most systems measure an electrical characteristic, and use this to determine the glucose level in the blood. The test is usually referred to as capillary blood glucose.

Healthcare professionals advise patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] on the appropriate monitoring regimen for their condition. Most people with [[type 2 diabetes]] test at least once per day. The [[Mayo Clinic]] generally recommends that diabetics who use insulin (all [[Type 1 diabetes|type 1 diabetics]] and many [[Type 2 diabetes|type 2 diabetics]]) test their blood sugar more often (4–8 times per day for type 1 diabetics, 2 or more times per day for type 2 diabetics),&lt;ref name="Mayo SMBG Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood sugar testing: Why, when and how|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/blood-sugar/art-20046628|website=mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; both to assess the effectiveness of their prior insulin dose and to help determine their next insulin dose.

==Purpose==
Blood glucose monitoring reveals individual patterns of blood glucose changes, and helps in the planning of meals, activities, and at what time of day to take medications.&lt;ref name=medlineplus&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003438.htm MedlinePlus &gt; Blood glucose monitoring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122232739/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003438.htm |date=22 January 2010 }} Update Date: 6/17/2008. Updated by: Elizabeth H. Holt, MD, PhD. In turn citing: American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes" ''Diabetes Care'' 2008; 31: S12–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, testing allows for quick response to high blood sugar ([[hyperglycemia]]) or low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]). This might include diet adjustments, exercise, and insulin (as instructed by the health care provider).&lt;ref name=medlineplus/&gt;

==Blood glucose meters==
{{main|Glucose meter}}
[[File:glucose meters.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Four generations of blood glucose meter, c. 1991–2005. Sample sizes vary from 30 to 0.3 &amp;mu;l. Test times vary from 5 seconds to 2 minutes (modern meters typically require less than 15 seconds).]]
A '''blood glucose meter''' is an electronic device for measuring the blood glucose level. A relatively small drop of blood is placed on a disposable test strip which interfaces with a digital meter. Within several seconds, the level of blood glucose will be shown on the digital display.

Needing only a small drop of blood for the meter means that the time and effort required for testing is reduced and the compliance of diabetic people to their testing regimens is improved. Although the cost of using blood glucose meters seems high, it is believed to be a cost benefit relative to the avoided medical costs of the [[diabetes mellitus#Complications|complications of diabetes]].

Recent advances include:{{Citation needed|reason=Citations are required for each advancement, as well as proof that they are advancements.|date=April 2017}}
*  alternate site testing, the use of blood drops from places other than the finger, usually the palm or forearm. This alternate site testing uses the same test strips and meter, is practically pain free, and gives the finger tips a needed break if they become sore.  The disadvantage of this technique is that there is usually less blood flow to alternate sites, which prevents the reading from being accurate when the blood sugar level is changing.
*  no coding systems.  Older systems required 'coding' of the strips to the meter.  This carried a risk of 'miscoding', which can lead to inaccurate results. Two approaches have resulted in systems that no longer require coding.  Some systems are 'autocoded', where technology is used to code each strip to the meter.  And some are manufactured to a 'single code', thereby avoiding the risk of miscoding.
*  multi-test systems. Some systems use a cartridge or a disc containing multiple test strips.  This has the advantage that the user doesn't have to load individual strips each time, which is convenient and can enable quicker testing.
*  downloadable meters.  Most newer systems come with software that allows the user to download meter results to a computer.  This information can then be used, together with health care professional guidance, to enhance and improve diabetes management.  The meters usually require a connection cable, unless they are designed to work wirelessly with an insulin pump, are designed to plug directly into the computer, or use an infrared connection.

==Continuous glucose monitoring==
A [[continuous glucose monitor]] determines glucose levels on a continuous basis (every few minutes). A typical system consists of:
* a disposable glucose sensor placed just under the skin, which is worn for a few days until replacement
* a link from the sensor to a non-implanted transmitter which communicates to a radio receiver
* an electronic receiver worn like a pager (or insulin pump) that displays glucose levels with nearly continuous updates, as well as monitors rising and falling trends.

Continuous glucose monitors measure the concentration of glucose in a sample of [[interstitial fluid]].  Shortcomings of CGM systems due to this fact are:
* continuous systems must be calibrated with a traditional blood glucose measurement (using current technology) and therefore require both the CGM system and occasional "fingerstick"
* glucose levels in interstitial fluid lag behind blood glucose values
Patients therefore require traditional fingerstick measurements for calibration (typically twice per day) and are often advised to use fingerstick measurements to confirm hypo- or hyperglycemia before taking corrective action.

The lag time discussed above has been reported to be about 5 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wentholt Iris M. |author2=Vollebregt Marit A. |author3=Hart Augustus A. |author4=Hoekstra Joost B. |author5=DeVries J.

Technol. Ther. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 146–55 | doi=10.1089/dia.2006.8.146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anecdotally, some users of the various systems report lag times of up to 10–15 minutes. This lag time is insignificant when blood sugar levels are relatively consistent. However, blood sugar levels, when changing rapidly, may read in the normal range on a CGM system while in reality the patient is already experiencing symptoms of an out-of-range blood glucose value and may require treatment. Patients using CGM are therefore advised to consider both the absolute value of the blood glucose level given by the system as well as any trend in the blood glucose levels. For example, a patient using CGM with a blood glucose of 100&amp;nbsp;mg/dl on their CGM system might take no action if their blood glucose has been consistent for several readings, while a patient with the same blood glucose level but whose blood glucose has been dropping steeply in a short period of time might be advised to perform a fingerstick test to check for hypoglycemia.

Continuous monitoring allows examination of how the blood glucose level reacts to insulin, exercise, food, and other factors. The additional data can be useful for setting correct [[insulin]] dosing ratios for food intake and correction of hyperglycemia. Monitoring during periods when blood glucose levels are not typically checked (e.g. overnight) can help to identify problems in insulin dosing (such as basal levels for insulin pump users or long-acting insulin levels for patients taking injections). Monitors may also be equipped with alarms to alert patients of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia so that a patient can take corrective action(s) (after fingerstick testing, if necessary) even in cases where they do not feel symptoms of either condition. While the technology has its limitations, studies have demonstrated that patients with continuous sensors experience less hyperglycemia and also reduce their [[glycosylated hemoglobin]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Garg S. |author2=Zisser H. |author3=Schwartz S. |author4=Baile T. |author5=Kaplan R. |author6=Ellis S. |author7=Jovanovic L. | year = 2006 | title = Improvement in Glycemic Excursions With a Transcutaneous, Real-Time Continuous Glucose Sensor | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 44–50 | doi=10.2337/diacare.29.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deiss D. |author2=Bolinder J. |author3=Riveline J-P. |author4=Battelino T. |author5=Bose E. |author6=Tubiana-Rufi N. |author7=Kerr D. |author8=Phillip M. | year = 2006 | title = Improved glycemic control in poorly controlled patients with type 1 diabetes using real-time continuous glucose monitoring | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 | issue = 12| pages = 2730–32 | doi=10.2337/dc06-1134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mastrototaro, J.J., Cooper, K.W., Soundararajan, G., Sanders, J.B., and Shah, R.B.

Currently, continuous blood glucose monitoring is not automatically covered by [[health insurance]] in the United States in the same way that most other diabetic supplies are covered (e.g. standard glucose testing supplies, [[insulin]], and even [[insulin pump]]s). However, an increasing number of insurance companies do cover continuous glucose monitoring supplies (both the receiver and disposable sensors) on a case-by-case basis if the patient and doctor show a specific need. The lack of insurance coverage is exacerbated by the fact that disposable sensors must be frequently replaced. Some sensors have been U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved for 7- and 3-day use, (although some patients wear sensors for longer than the recommended period) and the receiving meters likewise have finite lifetimes (less than 2 years and as little as 6 months). This is one factor in the slow uptake in the use of sensors that have been marketed in the United States.

The principles, history and recent developments of operation of electrochemical glucose biosensors are discussed in a chemical review by [[Joseph Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr068123a | volume=108 | title=Electrochemical Glucose Biosensors | year=2008 | journal=Chemical Reviews | pages=814–25 | author=Wang Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glucose sensing bio-implants==
Investigations on the use of test strips have shown that the required self-injury acts as a psychological barrier restraining the patients from sufficient glucose control.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} As a result, [[Complications of diabetes mellitus|secondary diseases]] are caused by excessive glucose levels. A significant improvement of diabetes therapy might be achieved with an implantable sensor that would continuously monitor blood sugar levels within the body and transmit the measured data outside. The burden of regular blood testing would be taken from the patient, who would instead follow the course of their glucose levels on an intelligent device like a laptop or a smart phone.

Glucose concentrations do not necessarily have to be measured in blood vessels, but may also be determined in the [[interstitial fluid]], where the same levels prevail – with a time lag of a few minutes – due to its connection with the [[capillary system]]. However, the enzymatic glucose detection scheme used in single-use test strips is not directly suitable for [[implant (medicine)|implants]]. One main problem is caused by the varying supply of oxygen, by which glucose is converted to [[glucono delta-lactone|glucono lactone]] and H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|2}} by [[glucose oxidase]]. Since the implantation of a sensor into the body is accompanied by growth of encapsulation tissue,&lt;ref name= Frost06&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Frost |author2=M.E. Meyerhoff | title = Sensors: Tackling Biocompatibility | journal = Anal. Chem. | volume = 78 | pages = 7370–77 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1021/ac069475k}}&lt;/ref&gt; the diffusion of oxygen to the reaction zone is continuously diminished. This decreasing oxygen availability causes the sensor reading to drift, requiring frequent re-calibration using finger-sticks and test strips.

One approach to achieving long-term glucose sensing is to measure and compensate for the changing local oxygen concentration.&lt;ref name=Gou10&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.A. Gough |author2=L.S.

==Non-invasive technologies==
{{main|Noninvasive glucose monitor}}

Some new technologies to monitor blood glucose levels will not require access to blood to read the glucose level. [[Non-invasive]] technologies include [[near infrared spectroscopy|near IR]] detection,&lt;ref&gt;http://edn.com/design/medical/4422840/Non-invasive-blood-glucose-monitoring-using-near-infrared-spectroscopy&lt;/ref&gt; [[ultrasound]]&lt;ref name="Diabetes U/S SMBG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultrasound could provide lancet-less method for measuring blood glucose|url=https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2013/Nov/Ultrasound-could-provide-lancet-less-method-for-measuring-blood-glucose-98769321.html|website=Diabets.co.uk|publisher=Diabetes Digital Media Ltd|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dielectric spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="BlackBird SMBG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donimirska|first1=Monika|title=Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Devices Market Volume Analysis, size, share and Key Trends 2017–2027|url=http://www.military-technologies.net/2017/04/06/non-invasive-blood-glucose-monitoring-devices-market-volume-analysis-size-share-and-key-trends-2017-2027/|website=military-technologies.net|publisher=BlackBird|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may free the person with diabetes from finger sticks to supply the drop of blood for blood glucose analysis.

Most{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} of the non-invasive methods under development are continuous glucose monitoring methods and offer the advantage of providing additional information to the subject between the conventional finger stick, blood glucose measurements and over time periods where no finger stick measurements are available (i.e. while the subject is sleeping).

==Effectiveness==
For patients with [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], the importance of monitoring and the optimal frequency of monitoring are not clear. A 2011 study found no evidence that blood glucose monitoring leads to better patient outcomes in actual practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sidorenkov G, Haaijer-Ruskamp FM, de Zeeuw D, Bilo H, Denig P |title=Relation between quality-of-care indicators for diabetes and patient outcomes: a systematic literature review |journal=Med Care Res Rev |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=263–89 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21536606 |doi=10.1177/1077558710394200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One randomized controlled trial found that self-monitoring of blood glucose did not improve [[glycosylated hemoglobin]] (HbA1c) among "reasonably well controlled non-insulin treated patients with type 2 diabetes".&lt;ref name="pmid17591623"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farmer A, Wade A, Goyder E |title=Impact of self monitoring of blood glucose in the management of patients with non-insulin treated diabetes: open parallel group randomised trial |journal= BMJ|volume= 335|issue=  7611| page= 132|year=2007 |pmid=17591623 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39247.447431.BE |pmc=1925177|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a recent meta-analysis of 47 randomized controlled trials encompassing 7677 patients showed that self-care management intervention improves glycemic control in diabetics, with an estimated 0.36% (95% CI, 0.21–0.51) reduction in their glycosylated hemoglobin values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Minet | first1 = L. | last2 = Møller | first2 = S. | last3 = Vach | first3 = W. | last4 = Wagner | first4 = L. | last5 = Henriksen | first5 = J.

A recent study included 12 randomized controlled trials and evaluated outcomes in 3259 patients. The authors concluded through a qualitative analysis that SMBG on quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction or the patients' health-related quality of life.  Furthermore, the same study identified that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed greater than one year prior to initiation of SMBG, who were not on insulin, experienced a statistically significant reduction in their HbA1C of 0.3% (95% CI, -0.4 –  -0.1) at six months follow up, but a statistically insignificant reduction of 0.1% (95% CI, -0.3 – 0.04) at twelve months follow up.  Conversely, newly diagnosed patients experienced a statistically significant reduction of 0.5% (95% CI, -0.9 – -0.1) at 12 months follow up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Malanda | first1 = U.

| journal = The Cochrane Library| volume = 1 | pages = CD005060 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22258959 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that a treatment strategy of intensively lowering blood sugar levels (below 6%) in patients with additional [[cardiovascular disease]] risk factors poses more harm than benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gerstein, H. C. |author2=M. E. Miller |title=Effects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes|journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |issue= 358(24) |pages= 2545–59 |year=2008 |pmid=18539917|volume=358|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0802743|display-authors=etal|pmc=4551392}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For type 2 diabetics who are not on insulin, exercise and diet are the best tools.{{citation needed|reason=Has it been demonstrated that diet/exercise are the ''best'' tools?|date=April 2017}} Blood glucose monitoring is, in that case, simply a tool to evaluate the success of diet and exercise. Insulin-dependent type 2 diabetics do not need to monitor their blood sugar as frequently as type 1 diabetics.

==Recommendations==
The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), UK released updated diabetes recommendations on 30 May 2008, which recommend that self-monitoring of plasma glucose levels for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes must be integrated into a structured self-management education process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Guideline: The management of type 2 diabetes (update)|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index.jsp?action=byID&amp;o=11983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recommendations have been updated in August 2015 for children and young adults with type 1 diabetes. See: NICE Guideline for Continuous Blood Glucose Monitoring.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''Computer facial animation''' is primarily an area of [[computer graphics]] that encapsulates methods and techniques for generating and animating images or models of a character face. The character can be a human, a humanoid, an animal, a fantasy creature or character, etc. Due to its subject and output type, it is also related to many other scientific and artistic fields from [[psychology]] to traditional [[animation]]. The importance of [[face|human faces]] in [[communication|verbal and non-verbal communication]] and advances in [[Graphics processing unit|computer graphics hardware]] and [[software]] have caused considerable scientific, technological, and artistic interests in computer facial animation.

Although development of [[computer graphics]] methods for facial animation started in the early-1970s, major achievements in this field are more recent and happened since the late 1980s.

The body of work around computer facial animation can be divided into two main areas: techniques to generate animation data, and methods to apply such data to a character. Techniques such as [[motion capture]] and [[keyframing]] belong to the first group, while [[Morph target animation|morph targets animation]] (more commonly known as blendshape animation) and [[skeletal animation]] belong to the second. Facial animation has become well-known and popular through animated feature [[film]]s and [[computer games]] but its applications include many more areas such as [[communication]], [[education]], scientific [[simulation]], and [[software agent|agent]]-based systems (for example online customer service representatives). With the recent advancements in computational power in personal and [[mobile devices]], facial animation has transitioned from appearing in pre-rendered content to being created at runtime.

==History==
Human [[facial expression]] has been the subject of scientific investigation for more than one hundred years. Study of facial movements and expressions started from a biological point of view. After some older investigations, for example by [[John Bulwer]] in the late 1640s, [[Charles Darwin]]’s book ''The Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals'' can be considered a major departure for modern research in behavioural [[biology]].

Computer based facial expression modelling and [[animation]] is not a new endeavour. The earliest work with computer based facial representation was done in the early-1970s. The first three-dimensional facial animation was created by [[Fred Parke|Parke]] in 1972. In 1973, Gillenson developed an interactive system to assemble and edit line drawn facial images. in 1974, [[Fred Parke|Parke]] developed a parameterized three-dimensional facial model.

One of the most important attempts to describe facial movements was [[Facial Action Coding System]] (FACS). Originally developed by Carl-Herman Hjortsjö &lt;ref&gt;Hjortsjö, CH (1969). [http://diglib.uibk.ac.at/ulbtirol/content/titleinfo/782346 Man's face and mimic language].&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and updated by [[Paul Ekman|Ekman]] and [[Friesen]] in 1978, FACS defines 46 basic facial Action Units (AUs). A major group of these Action Units represent primitive movements of facial muscles in actions such as raising brows, winking, and talking. Eight AU's are for rigid three-dimensional head movements, (i.e. turning and tilting left and right and going up, down, forward and backward). FACS has been successfully used for describing desired movements of synthetic faces and also in tracking facial activities.

The early-1980s saw the development of the first physically based muscle-controlled face model by Platt and the development of techniques for facial caricatures by Brennan. In 1985, the animated short film ''[[Tony de Peltrie]]'' was a landmark for facial animation. This marked the first time computer facial expression and speech animation were a fundamental part of telling the story.

The late-1980s saw the development of a new muscle-based model by [[Keith Waters|Waters]], the development of an abstract muscle action model by [[Nadia Magnenat Thalmann|Magnenat-Thalmann]] and colleagues, and approaches to automatic speech synchronization by Lewis and Hill. The 1990s have seen increasing activity in the development of facial animation techniques and the use of computer facial animation as a key storytelling component as illustrated in animated films such as ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), ''[[Antz]]'' (1998), ''[[Shrek]]'', and ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (both 2001), and [[computer games]] such as ''[[The Sims (series)|Sims]]''.  ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'' (1995), a milestone in this decade, was the first movie in which a lead actor was produced exclusively using digital facial animation.

The sophistication of the films increased after 2000. In ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', dense [[optical flow]] from several high-definition cameras was used to capture realistic facial movement at every point on the face. ''[[Polar Express (film)]]'' used a large Vicon system to capture upward of 150 points. Although these systems are automated, a large amount of manual clean-up effort is still needed to make the data usable. Another milestone in facial animation was reached by ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', where a character specific shape base system was developed. Mark Sagar pioneered the use of [[Facial Action Coding System|FACS]] in entertainment facial animation, and FACS based systems developed by Sagar were used on ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', and other films.

==Techniques==

=== Generating facial animation data===
The generation of facial animation data can be approached in different ways: 1.) [[motion capture|marker-based motion capture]] on points or marks on the face of a performer, 2.) [[motion capture#Markerless|markerless motion capture]] techniques using different type of cameras, 3.) audio-driven techniques, and 4.) [[keyframe]] animation.

* '''[[Motion capture]]''' uses cameras placed around a subject. The subject is generally fitted either with reflectors (passive motion capture) or sources (active motion capture) that precisely determine the subject's position in space. The data recorded by the cameras is then digitized and converted into a three-dimensional computer model of the subject. Until recently, the size of the detectors/sources used by motion capture systems made the technology inappropriate for facial capture. However, miniaturization and other advancements have made motion capture a viable tool for computer facial animation. Facial motion capture was used extensively in [[Polar Express]] by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks|Imageworks]] where hundreds of motion points were captured. This film was very accomplished and while it attempted to recreate realism, it was criticized for having fallen in the '[[uncanny valley]]', the realm where animation realism is sufficient for human recognition and to convey the emotional message but where the characters fail to be perceived as realistic. The main difficulties of motion capture are the quality of the data which may include vibration as well as the retargeting of the geometry of the points.
* '''[[Motion capture#Markerless|Markerless motion capture]]''' aims at simplifying the motion capture process by avoiding encumbering the performer with markers. Several techniques came out recently leveraging different sensors, among which standard video cameras, Kinect and depth sensors or other structured-light based devices.  Systems based on [[structured light]] may achieve real-time performance without the use of any markers using a high speed structured light scanner. The system is based on a robust offline face tracking stage which trains the system with different facial expressions. The matched sequences are used to build a person-specific linear face model that is subsequently used for online face tracking and expression transfer.
* '''Audio-driven techniques''' are particularly well fitted for speech animation. Speech is usually treated in a different way to the animation of facial expressions, this is because simple [[keyframe]]-based approaches to animation typically provide a poor approximation to real speech dynamics. Often [[viseme]]s are used to represent the key poses in observed speech (i.e. the position of the lips, jaw and tongue when producing a particular [[phoneme]]), however there is a great deal of variation in the realisation of visemes during the production of natural speech. The source of this variation is termed [[coarticulation]] which is the influence of surrounding visemes upon the current viseme (i.e. the effect of context). To account for coarticulation current systems either explicitly take into account context when blending viseme keyframes or use longer units such as [[diphone]], [[triphone]], [[syllable]] or even [[word]] and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]-length units. One of the most common approaches to speech animation is the use of dominance functions introduced by Cohen and Massaro. Each dominance function represents the influence over time that a viseme has on a speech utterance. Typically the influence will be greatest at the center of the viseme and will degrade with distance from the viseme center. Dominance functions are blended together to generate a speech trajectory in much the same way that [[spline (mathematics)|spline]] basis functions are blended together to generate a curve. The shape of each dominance function will be different according to both which viseme it represents and what aspect of the face is being controlled (e.g. lip width, jaw rotation etc.). This approach to computer-generated speech animation can be seen in the Baldi talking head. Other models of speech use basis units which include context (e.g. [[diphone]]s, [[triphone]]s etc.) instead of visemes. As the basis units already incorporate the variation of each viseme according to context and to some degree the dynamics of each viseme, no model of [[coarticulation]] is required. Speech is simply generated by selecting appropriate units from a database and blending the units together. This is similar to concatenative techniques in audio [[speech synthesis]]. The disadvantage to these models is that a large amount of captured data is required to produce natural results, and whilst longer units produce more natural results the size of database required expands with the average length of each unit. Finally, some models directly generate speech animations from audio. These systems typically use [[hidden markov model]]s or [[neural net]]s to transform audio parameters into a stream of control parameters for a facial model. The advantage of this method is the capability of voice context handling, the natural rhythm, tempo, emotional and dynamics handling without complex approximation algorithms. The training database is not needed to be labeled since there are no phonemes or visemes needed; the only needed data is the voice and the animation parameters.
* '''[[Keyframe]] animation''' is the least automated of the processes to create animation data although it delivers the maximum amount of control over the animation. It is often used in combination with other techniques to deliver the final polish to the animation. The [[keyframe]] data can be made of scalar values defining the [[Morph target animation|morph targets]] coefficients or rotation and translation values of the bones in models with a bone based rig. Often to speed up the [[keyframe]] animation process a control rig is used by the animation. The control rig represents a higher level of abstraction that can act on multiple [[Morph target animation|morph targets]] coefficients or bones at the same time. For example, a "smile" control can act simultaneously on the mouth shape curving up and the eyes squinting.

===Applying facial animation to a character===
The main techniques used to apply facial animation to a character are: 1.) [[Morph target animation|morph targets animation]], 2.) [[Skeletal animation|bone driven animation]], 3.) texture-based animation (2D or 3D), and 4.) [[Physiology|physiological]] models.

* '''[[Morph target animation|Morph target]]s''' (also called '''"blendshapes"''') based systems offer a fast playback as well as a high degree of fidelity of expressions. The technique involves modeling portions of the face mesh to approximate expressions and [[viseme]]s and then blending the different sub meshes, known as morph targets or blendshapes. Perhaps the most accomplished character using this technique was Gollum, from ''The Lord of the Rings''. Drawbacks of this technique are that they involve intensive manual labor and are specific to each character. Recently, new concepts in 3D modeling have started to emerge.  Recently, a new technology departing from the traditional techniques starts to emerge, such as ''[[Curve Controlled Modeling]]''&lt;ref name="CurveControl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ding | first1 = H. | last2 = Hong | first2 = Y. | year = 2003 | title = NURBS curve controlled modeling for facial animation | url = | journal = Computers and Graphics | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 373–385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  that emphasizes the modeling of the movement of a 3D object instead of the traditional modeling of the static shape.
* '''[[Skeletal animation|Bone driven animation]]''' is very broadly used in games. The bones setup can vary between few bones to close to a hundred to allow all subtle facial expressions. The main advantages of bone driven animation is that the same animation can be used for different characters as long as the morphology of their faces is similar, and secondly they do not require loading in memory all the [[Morph target animation|Morph target]]sdata. Bone driven animation is most widely supported by 3D game engines. Bone driven animation can be used both 2D and 3D animation. For example, it is possible to rig and animated using bones a 2D character using [[Adobe Flash]].

[[File:Kara - animated short by Quantic Dreams.png|thumb|right|Screenshot from "Kara" animated short by Quantic Dream]]
* '''Texture-based animation''' uses pixel color to create the animation on the character face. 2D facial animation is commonly based upon the transformation of images, including both images from still photography and sequences of video. Image [[morphing]] is a technique which allows in-between transitional images to be generated between a pair of target still images or between frames from sequences of video. These [[morphing]] techniques usually consist of a combination of a geometric deformation technique, which aligns the target images, and a cross-fade which creates the smooth transition in the image texture. An early example of image [[morphing]] can be seen in [[Michael Jackson]]'s video for "Black Or White". In 3D animation texture based animation can be achieved by animating the texture itself or the UV mapping. In the latter case a texture map of all the facial expression is created and the UV map animation is used to transition from one expression to the next.
* '''[[Physiology|Physiological]] models''', such as skeletal muscle systems and physically based head models, form another approach in modeling the [[Human head|head]] and [[face]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A model of facial biomechanics for speech production|last = Lucero|first = J.C.|date = 1999|journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|doi = 10.1121/1.428108|pmid = 10573899|access-date = |last2 = Munhall|first2 = K.G.|pages = 2834–2842|volume=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the physical and [[anatomy|anatomical]] characteristics of [[bone]]s, [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[Human skin|skin]] are simulated to provide a realistic appearance (e.g. spring-like elasticity). Such methods can be very powerful for creating realism but the complexity of facial structures make them computationally expensive, and difficult to create. Considering the effectiveness of parameterized models for communicative purposes (as explained in the next section), it may be argued that physically based models are not a very efficient choice in many applications. This does not deny the advantages of physically based models and the fact that they can even be used within the context of parameterized models to provide local details when needed.

==Face animation languages==
Many face animation languages are used to describe the content of facial animation. They can be input to a compatible "player" [[software]] which then creates the requested actions. Face animation languages are closely related to other [[multimedia]] presentation languages such as [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] and [[VRML]]. Due to the popularity and effectiveness of [[XML]] as a data representation mechanism, most face animation languages are XML-based. For instance, this is a sample from [[Virtual Human Markup Language]] (VHML):
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
 &lt;vhml&gt;
   &lt;person disposition="angry"&gt;
     First I speak with an angry voice and look very angry,
     &lt;surprised intensity="50"&gt;
       but suddenly I change to look more surprised.
     &lt;/surprised&gt;
   &lt;/person&gt;
 &lt;/vhml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
More advanced languages allow decision-making, event handling, and parallel and sequential actions. Following is an example from [[Face Modeling Language]] (FML):
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
 &lt;fml&gt;
   &lt;act&gt;
     &lt;par&gt;
 	&lt;hdmv type="yaw" value="15" begin="0" end="2000" /&gt;
 	&lt;expr type="joy" value="-60" begin="0" end="2000" /&gt;
     &lt;/par&gt;
     &lt;excl event_name="kbd" event_value="" repeat="kbd;F3_up" &gt;
 	&lt;hdmv type="yaw" value="40" begin="0" end="2000" event_value="F1_up" /&gt;
 	&lt;hdmv type="yaw" value="-40" begin="0" end="2000" event_value="F2_up" /&gt;
     &lt;/excl&gt;
   &lt;/act&gt;
 &lt;/fml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45100">'''Epigenetics of anxiety and stress-related disorders''' is the field studying the relationship between [[epigenetic]] modifications of genes and [[anxiety]] and [[stress-related disorders]], including mental health disorders such as [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD), [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and more.

Epigenetic modifications play a role in the development and heritability of these disorders and related symptoms. For example, regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis by [[glucocorticoid]]s plays a major role in stress response and is known to be epigenetically regulated.

As of 2015 most work has been done in [[animal models]] in laboratories, and little work has been done in humans; the work is not yet applicable to clinical [[psychiatry]].&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015"/&gt;

== Epigenetic writers, erasers, and readers ==
Epigenetic changes are performed by enzymes known as writers, which can add epigenetic modifications, erasers, which erase epigenetic modifications, and readers, which can recognize epigenetic modifications and cause a downstream effect. Stress-induced modifications of these writers, erasers, and readers result in important epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and acetylation.

=== DNA methylation ===
[[File:DNA_methylation.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DNA_methylation.svg|thumb|During DNA methylation, cytosine is methylated.]]
[[DNA methylation]] is a type of epigenetic modification in which methyl groups are added to [[cytosine]]s of DNA. DNA methylation is an important regulator of [[gene expression]] and is usually associated with gene repression.

==== MeCP2 ====
Laboratory studies have found that early life stress in rodents can cause phosphorylation of methyl CpG binding protein 2 ([[MECP2|MeCP2]]), a protein that preferentially binds CpGs and is most often associated with suppression of gene expression. Stress-dependent phosphorylation of MeCP2 causes MeCP2 to dissociate from the promoter region of a gene called ''[[Arginine-vasopressin|arginine vasopressin]]'' (''avp''), causing ''avp'' to become demethylated and upregulated. This may be significant because arginine vasopressin is known to regulate mood and cognitive behavior. Additionally, arginine vasopressin upregulates [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), which is a hormone important for stress response. Thus, stress-induced upregulation of ''avp'' due to demethylation might alter mood, behavior, and stress responses. Demethylation of this locus can be explained by reduced binding of DNA methyl transferases (DNMT), an enzyme that adds methyl groups to DNA, to this locus.&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klengel T, Binder EB | title = Epigenetics of Stress-Related Psychiatric Disorders and Gene × Environment Interactions | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 6 | pages = 1343–57 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26087162 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.05.036 | department = review }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MeCP2 is known to have interactions with several other enzymes that modify chromatin (for example, HDAC-containing complexes and co-repressors) and in turn regulate activity of genes that modulate stress response either by increasing or decreasing stress tolerance. For example, epigenetic upregulation of genes that increase stress response may cause decreased stress tolerance in an organism. These interactions are dependent on the phosphorylation status of MeCP2, which as previously mentioned, can be altered by stress.&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellini_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellini E, Pavesi G, Barbiero I, Bergo A, Chandola C, Nawaz MS, Rusconi L, Stefanelli G, Strollo M, Valente MM, Kilstrup-Nielsen C, Landsberger N | title = MeCP2 post-translational modifications: a mechanism to control its involvement in synaptic plasticity and homeostasis? | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 236 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25165434 | pmc = 4131190 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00236 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DNMT1 ====
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) belongs to a family of proteins known as DNA methyltransferases, which are enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA. DNMT1 is specifically involved in maintaining DNA methylation; hence it is also known as the maintenance methylase DNMT1. DNMT1 aids in regulation of gene expression by methylating [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] regions of genes, causing transcriptional repression of these genes.

DNMT1 is transcriptionally repressed under stress-mimicking exposure both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' using a mouse model. Accordingly, transcriptional repression of DNMT1 in response to long-term stress-mimicking exposure causes decreased DNA methylation, which is a marker of gene acitvation. In particular, there is decreased methylation of a gene called ''[[FKBP5|fkbp5]]'', which plays a role in stress response as a glucocorticoid-responsive gene. Thus, chronic stress may cause demethylation and hyperactivation of a stress-related gene, causing increased stress response.&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee RS, Tamashiro KL, Yang X, Purcell RH, Huo Y, Rongione M, Potash JB, Wand GS | title = A measure of glucocorticoid load provided by DNA methylation of Fkbp5 in mice | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 218 | issue = 1 | pages = 303–12 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21509501 | pmc = 3918452 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-011-2307-3 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''DNMT1'' gene locus has increased methylation in individuals who were exposed to trauma and developed [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Increased methylation of ''DNMT1'' did not occur in trauma-exposed individuals who did not develop PTSD. This may indicate an epigenetic phenotype that can differentiate PTSD-susceptible and PTSD-resilient individuals after exposure to trauma.&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sipahi_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sipahi L, Wildman DE, Aiello AE, Koenen KC, Galea S, Abbas A, Uddin M | title = Longitudinal epigenetic variation of DNA methyltransferase genes is associated with vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 15 | pages = 3165–79 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25065861 | pmc = 4530981 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291714000968 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transcription factors ====
[[Transcription factor]]s are proteins that bind DNA and modulate the transcription of genes into RNA such as [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]], [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]], [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]], and more; thus they are essential components of gene activation. Stress and trauma can affect expression of transcription factors, which in turn alter DNA methylation patterns.

For example, transcription factor nerve growth-induced protein A (NGFI-A, also called NAB1) is up-regulated in response to high maternal care in rodents, and down-regulated in response to low maternal care (a form of early life stress). Decreased NGFI-A due to low maternal care increases methylation of a [[glucocorticoid receptor]] promoter in rats. [[Glucocorticoid]] is known to play a role in downregulating stress response; therefore, downregulation of glucocorticoid receptor by methylation causes increased sensitivity to stress.&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15220929"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weaver IC, Cervoni N, Champagne FA, D'Alessio AC, Sharma S, Seckl JR, Dymov S, Szyf M, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 847–54 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15220929 | doi = 10.1038/nn1276 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang TY, Labonté B, Wen XL, Turecki G, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms for the early environmental regulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor gene expression in rodents and humans | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 111–23 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22968814 | pmc = 3521971 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2012.149 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Histone acetylation ===
[[File:Acetylation.png|thumb|During DNA acetylation, lysines are acetylated.]]
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|Histone acetylation]] is a type of epigenetic modification in which acetyl groups are added to lysine on histone tails. Histone acetylation, performed by enzymes known as [[histone acetyltransferase]]s (HATs), removes the positive charge from lysine and results in gene activation by weakening the histone's interaction with negatively-charged DNA. In contrast, histone deacetylation performed by [[histone deacetylase]]s (HDACs) results in gene deactivation.

==== HDAC ====
Transcriptional activity and expression of HDACs is altered in response to early life stress.&lt;ref name="Klengel_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine A, Worrell TR, Zimnisky R, Schmauss C | title = Early life stress triggers sustained changes in histone deacetylase expression and histone H4 modifications that alter responsiveness to adolescent antidepressant treatment | journal = Neurobiology of Disease | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 488–98 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21964251 | pmc = 3225638 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.09.005 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesone-Coelho_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tesone-Coelho C, Morel LJ, Bhatt J, Estevez L, Naudon L, Giros B, Zwiller J, Daugé V | title = Vulnerability to opiate intake in maternally deprived rats: implication of MeCP2 and of histone acetylation | journal = Addiction Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–31 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 23980619 | doi = 10.1111/adb.12084 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; For animals exposed to early life stress, HDAC expression tends to be lower when they are young and higher when they are older.

== Transgenerational epigenetic influences ==
{{See also|Transgenerational stress inheritance}}

[[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] have shown that psychiatric disorders are partly heritable; however, heritability cannot be fully explained by classical [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]]. Epigenetics has been postulated to play a role. This is because there is strong evidence of transgenerational epigenetic effects in general. For example, one study found transmission of DNA methylation patterns from fathers to offspring during spermatogenesis. More specifically to mental illnesses, several studies have shown that traits of psychiatric illnesses (such as traits of PTSD and other anxiety disorders) can be transmitted epigenetically. Parental exposure to various stimuli, both positive and negative, can cause these transgenerational epigenetic and behavioral effects.&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeshurun S, Hannan AJ | title = Transgenerational epigenetic influences of paternal environmental exposures on brain function and predisposition to psychiatric disorders | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29520039 | doi = 10.1038/s41380-018-0039-z | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parental exposure to trauma and stress ===
Trauma and stress experienced by a parent can cause epigenetic changes to its offspring. This has been observed both in [[Population study|population]] and experimental studies.&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018" /&gt;

==== Holocaust ====
An [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study investigating behavioral, physiological, and molecular changes in the children of [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors found epigenetic modifications of a glucocorticoid receptor gene, ''[[NR3C1|Nr3c1]]''. This is significant because glucocorticoid is a regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and is known to affect stress response. These stress-related epigenetic changes were accompanied by other characteristics that indicated higher stress and anxiety in these offspring, including increased symptoms of PTSD, greater risk of anxiety, and higher levels of the stress hormone [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yehuda_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yehuda R, Halligan SL, Bierer LM | title = Relationship of parental trauma exposure and PTSD to PTSD, depressive and anxiety disorders in offspring | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 261–70 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11591428 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3956(01)00032-2 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yehuda_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yehuda R, Bierer LM | title = Transgenerational transmission of cortisol and PTSD risk | journal = Progress in Brain Research | volume = 167 | issue = | pages = 121–35 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18037011 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-6123(07)67009-5 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yehuda_2014" /&gt;

==== Experimental evidence ====
The effect of parental exposure to stress has been tested experimentally as well. For example, male mice who were put under early life stress through poor maternal care—a scenario analogous to human childhood trauma—passed on epigenetic changes that resulted in behavioral changes in offspring. Offspring experienced altered DNA methylation of stress-response genes such as [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB1]] and [[Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2|CRF2]] in the [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]], as well as epigenetic alterations in transcriptional regulation gene MeCP2. Offspring were also more sensitive to stress, which is in accordance with the altered epigenetic profile. These changes persisted for up to three generations.&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franklin TB, Russig H, Weiss IC, Gräff J, Linder N, Michalon A, Vizi S, Mansuy IM | title = Epigenetic transmission of the impact of early stress across generations | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 68 | issue = 5 | pages = 408–15 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20673872 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.05.036 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, male mice were socially isolated as a form of stress. Offspring of these mice had increased anxiety in response to stressful conditions, increased stress hormone levels, dysregulation of the HPA axis which plays a key role in stress response, and several other characteristics that indicated increased sensitivity to stress.&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin_2010" /&gt;

==== Inheritance of small-noncoding RNA ====
Studies have found that early life stress induced through poor maternal care alters sperm epigenome in male mice. In particular, expression patterns of [[Non-coding RNA|small-noncoding RNAs]] (sncRNAs) are altered in the sperm, as well as in stress-related regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="Yuan_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan TF, Li A, Sun X, Ouyang H, Campos C, Rocha NB, Arias-Carrión O, Machado S, Hou G, So KF | title = Transgenerational Inheritance of Paternal Neurobehavioral Phenotypes: Stress, Addiction, Ageing and Metabolism | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 53 | issue = 9 | pages = 6367–6376 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 26572641 | doi = 10.1007/s12035-015-9526-2 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gapp_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gapp K, Jawaid A, Sarkies P, Bohacek J, Pelczar P, Prados J, Farinelli L, Miska E, Mansuy IM | title = Implication of sperm RNAs in transgenerational inheritance of the effects of early trauma in mice | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 667–9 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24728267 | pmc = 4333222 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3695 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24896534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma U, Rando OJ | title = Father-son chats: inheriting stress through sperm RNA | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 894–5 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24896534 | pmc = 4131544 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2014.05.015 | department = comment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offspring of these mice exhibited the same sncRNA expression changes in the brain, but not in the sperm. These changes were coupled with behavioral changes in the offspring that were comparable to behavior of the stressed fathers, especially in terms of stress response. Additionally, when the sncRNAs in the fathers' sperm were isolated and injected into fertilized eggs, the resulting offspring inherited the stress behavior of the father. This suggests that stress-induced modifications of sncRNAs in sperm can cause inheritance of stress phenotype independent of the father's DNA.&lt;ref name="Yuan_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gapp_2014" /&gt;

=== Parental exposure to positive stimulation ===

==== Exercise ====
Just as parental stress can alter epigenetics of offspring, parental exposure to positive environmental factors cause epigenetic modifications as well. For example, male mice that participated in voluntary physical exercise resulted in offspring that had reduced fear memory and anxiety-like behavior in response to stress. This behavioral change likely occurred due to expressions of small non-coding RNAs that were altered in sperm cells of the fathers.&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Short_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Short AK, Yeshurun S, Powell R, Perreau VM, Fox A, Kim JH, Pang TY, Hannan AJ | title = Exercise alters mouse sperm small noncoding RNAs and induces a transgenerational modification of male offspring conditioned fear and anxiety | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = e1114 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28463242 | pmc = 5534950 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2017.82 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stress effect reversal ====
Additionally, exposing fathers to enriching environments can reverse the effect of early life stress on their offspring. When early life stress is followed by environmental enrichment, anxiety-like behavior in offspring is prevented.&lt;ref name="Yeshurun_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gapp_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gapp K, Bohacek J, Grossmann J, Brunner AM, Manuella F, Nanni P, Mansuy IM | title = Potential of Environmental Enrichment to Prevent Transgenerational Effects of Paternal Trauma | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 41 | issue = 11 | pages = 2749–58 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27277118 | pmc = 5026744 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2016.87 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have been conducted in humans and suggest that DNA methylation plays a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell C, Schneper LM, Notterman DA | title = DNA methylation, early life environment, and health outcomes | journal = Pediatric Research | volume = 79 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 212–9 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26466079 | doi = 10.1038/pr.2015.193 | department = review | pmc = 4798238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ==
[[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is a stress-related mental health disorder that emerges in response to traumatic or highly stressful experiences. It is believed that PTSD develops as a result of an interaction between these traumatic experiences and genetic factors. Evidence suggests epigenetics is a key element in this.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zannas AS, Provençal N, Binder EB | title = Epigenetics of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Current Evidence, Challenges, and Future Directions | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 327–35 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25979620 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.04.003 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DNA methylation ===
Through a number of human studies, PTSD is known to affect DNA methylation of cytosine residues in a several genes involved in stress response, neurotransmitter activity, and more.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;

=== Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis ===
The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a key role in stress response. Based on several findings, the HPA axis appears to be dysregulated in PTSD. A common pathway dysregulated in HPA axis involves a hormone known as glucocorticoid and its receptor, which aid in stress tolerance by downregulating stress response. Dysregulation of glucocorticoid and/or glucocorticoid receptor can disrupt stress tolerance and increase risk of stress-related disorders such as PTSD. Epigenetic modifications play a role in this dysregulation, and these modifications are likely caused by the traumatic/stressful experience that triggered PTSD.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;

==== NR3C1 ====
''Nr3c1'' is a gene that encodes a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and contains many GR response elements. Early life stress increases methylation of the 1&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; promoter in this gene (or the 1&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; promoter analog in rodents). Because of its role in stress response and its link to early life stress, this gene has been of particular interest in the context of PTSD and has been studied in PTSD of both combat veterans and civilians.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;

In studies involving combat veterans, those who developed PTSD had lowered methylation of the ''Nr3c1'' 1&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; promoter compared to those who did not develop PTSD. Additionally, veterans who developed PTSD and had higher ''Nr3c1'' promoter methylation responded better to long-term psychotherapy compared to veterans with PTSD who had lower methylation. These findings were recapitulated in studies involving civilians with PTSD.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yehuda_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yehuda R, Daskalakis NP, Desarnaud F, Makotkine I, Lehrner AL, Koch E, Flory JD, Buxbaum JD, Meaney MJ, Bierer LM | title = Epigenetic Biomarkers as Predictors and Correlates of Symptom Improvement Following Psychotherapy in Combat Veterans with PTSD | journal = Frontiers in Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 118 | date = 2013 | pmid = 24098286 | pmc = 3784793 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00118 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; In civilians, PTSD is linked to lower methylation levels in the T-cells of exons 1&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and 1&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Nr3c1'', as well as higher GR expression. Thus, it seems that PTSD causes lowered methylation levels of GR loci and increased GR expression.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Labonté_2014" /&gt;

Although these results of decreased methylation and hyperactivation of GR conflict with the effect of early life stress at the same loci, these results match previous findings that distinguish HPA activity in early life stress versus PTSD. For example, cortisol levels of HPA in response to early life stress is hyperactive, whereas it is hypoactive in PTSD. Thus, the timing of trauma and stress—whether early or later in life—can cause differing effects on HPA and GR.&lt;ref name="Labonté_2014" /&gt;

==== FKBP5 ====
''Fkbp5'' encodes a GR-responsive protein known as Fk506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5). FKBP5 is induced by GR activation and functions in negative feedback by binding GR and reducing GR signaling.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zannas_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zannas AS, Binder EB | title = Gene-environment interactions at the FKBP5 locus: sensitive periods, mechanisms and pleiotropism | journal = Genes, Brain, and Behavior | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–37 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24219237 | doi = 10.1111/gbb.12104 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang X, Clark AF, Yorio T | title = FK506-binding protein 51 regulates nuclear transport of the glucocorticoid receptor beta and glucocorticoid responsiveness | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 1037–47 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18326728 | pmc = 2442563 | doi = 10.1167/iovs.07-1279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wochnik_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wochnik GM, Rüegg J, Abel GA, Schmidt U, Holsboer F, Rein T | title = FK506-binding proteins 51 and 52 differentially regulate dynein interaction and nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor in mammalian cells | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 6 | pages = 4609–16 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15591061 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M407498200 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular interest in this gene because some ''FKBP5'' alleles have been correlated with increased risk of PTSD and development of PTSD symptoms—especially in PTSD caused by early life adversity. Therefore, ''FKBP5'' likely plays an important role in PTSD.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20393453"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie P, Kranzler HR, Poling J, Stein MB, Anton RF, Farrer LA, Gelernter J | title = Interaction of FKBP5 with childhood adversity on risk for post-traumatic stress disorder | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 1684–92 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20393453 | pmc = 2946626 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2010.37 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Binder_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Binder EB, Bradley RG, Liu W, Epstein MP, Deveau TC, Mercer KB, Tang Y, Gillespie CF, Heim CM, Nemeroff CB, Schwartz AC, Cubells JF, Ressler KJ | title = Association of FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood abuse with risk of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults | journal = JAMA | volume = 299 | issue = 11 | pages = 1291–305 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18349090 | pmc = 2441757 | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.11.1291 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boscarino_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boscarino JA, Erlich PM, Hoffman SN, Zhang X | title = Higher FKBP5, COMT, CHRNA5, and CRHR1 allele burdens are associated with PTSD and interact with trauma exposure: implications for neuropsychiatric research and treatment | journal = Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 131–9 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22536069 | pmc = 3333786 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S29508 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned previously, certain ''FKBP5'' alleles are correlated to increase PTSD risk, especially due to early life trauma. It is now known that epigenetic regulation of these alleles is also an important factor. For example, CpG sites in intron 7 of FKBP5 are demethylated after exposure to childhood trauma, but not adult trauma.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klengel_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klengel T, Mehta D, Anacker C, Rex-Haffner M, Pruessner JC, Pariante CM, Pace TW, Mercer KB, Mayberg HS, Bradley B, Nemeroff CB, Holsboer F, Heim CM, Ressler KJ, Rein T, Binder EB | title = Allele-specific FKBP5 DNA demethylation mediates gene-childhood trauma interactions | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–41 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23201972 | pmc = 4136922 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3275 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, methylation of FKBP5 is alters in response to PTSD treatment; thus methylation levels of FKBP5 might correspond to PTSD disease progression and recovery.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yehuda_2014" /&gt;

==== ADCYAP1 and ADCYAP1R1 ====
Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1) and its receptor (ADCYAP1R1) are stress responsive genes that play a role in modulating stress, among many other functions. Additionally, high levels of ADCYAP1 in peripheral blood is correlated to PTSD diagnosis in females who have experienced trauma, thus making ADCYAP1 a gene of interest in the context of PTSD.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;

Epigenetic regulation of these loci in relation to PTSD still require further investigation, but one study has found that high methylation levels of CpG islands in ADCYAP1R1 can predict PTSD symptoms in both males and females.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ressler_2011" /&gt;

=== Immune dysregulation ===
PTSD is often linked with immune dysregulation. This is because trauma exposure can disrupt the HPA axis, thus altering peripheral immune function.

Epigenetic modifications have been observed in immune-related genes of individuals with PTSD. For example, deployed military members who developed PTSD have higher methylation in immune-related gene [[Interleukin 18|interleukin-18]] (IL-18).&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rusiecki_2013" /&gt; This has interested scientists because high levels of IL-18 increase cardiovascular disease risk, and individuals with PTSD have elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Thus, stress-induced immune dysregulation via methylation of IL-18 may play a role in cardiovascular disease in individuals with PTSD.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uddin_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uddin M, Aiello AE, Wildman DE, Koenen KC, Pawelec G, de Los Santos R, Goldmann E, Galea S | title = Epigenetic and immune function profiles associated with posttraumatic stress disorder | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 9470–5 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20439746 | pmc = 2889041 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0910794107 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith_2011" /&gt;

Additionally, an epigenome-wide study found that individuals with PTSD have altered levels of methylation in the following immune-related genes: [[Translocated promoter region|TPR]], [[CLEC9A]], [[Anaphase-promoting complex|APC5]], [[ANXA2]], [[TLR8]], [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], and [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]]. This again shows that immune function in PTSD is disrupted, especially by epigenetic changes that are likely stress-induced.&lt;ref name="Zannas_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith_2011" /&gt;

== Alcohol use disorder ==
Alcohol dependence and stress interact in many ways. For example, stress-related disorders such as anxiety and PTSD are known to increase risk of [[Alcohol Use Disorder|alcohol use disorder]] (AUD), and they are often [[Comorbidity|co-morbid]]. This may in part be due to the fact that alcohol can alleviate some symptoms of these disorders, thus promoting dependence on alcohol. Conversely, early exposure to alcohol can increase vulnerability to stress and stress-related disorders. Moreover, alcohol dependence and stress are known to follow similar neuronal pathways, and these pathways are often dysregulated by similar epigenetic modifications.&lt;ref name="Palmisano_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmisano M, Pandey SC | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of alcoholism and stress-related disorders | journal = Alcohol | volume = 60 | pages = 7–18 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28477725|pmc=5464725 | doi = 10.1016/j.alcohol.2017.01.001 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Histone acetylation ===

==== HDAC ====
Histone acetylation is dysregulated by alcohol exposure and dependence, often through dysregulated expression and activity of HDACs, which modulate histone acetylation by removing acetyl groups from lysines of histone tails. For example, HDAC expression is upregulated in chronic alcohol use models.&lt;ref name="Palmisano_2017" /&gt; Monocyte-derived dendritic cells of alcohol users have increased HDAC gene expression compared to non-users.&lt;ref name="Agudelo_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agudelo M, Figueroa G, Parira T, Yndart A, Muñoz K, Atluri V, Samikkannu T, Nair MP | title = Profile of Class I Histone Deacetylases (HDAC) by Human Dendritic Cells after Alcohol Consumption and In Vitro Alcohol Treatment and Their Implication in Oxidative Stress: Role of HDAC Inhibitors Trichostatin A and Mocetinostat | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = e0156421 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27249803 | pmc = 4889108 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0156421 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results are also supported by ''in vivo'' rat studies, which show that HDAC expression is higher in alcohol-dependent mice that in non-dependent mice. Furthermore, knockout of HDAC2 in mice helps lower alcohol dependence behaviors.&lt;ref name="Moonat_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moonat S, Sakharkar AJ, Zhang H, Tang L, Pandey SC | title = Aberrant histone deacetylase2-mediated histone modifications and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala predisposes to anxiety and alcoholism | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 8 | pages = 763–73 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23485013 | pmc = 3718567 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.01.012 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same pattern of HDAC expression is seen in alcohol withdrawal, but acute alcohol exposure has the opposite effect; ''in vivo'', HDAC expression and histone acetylation markers are decreased in the amygdala.&lt;ref name="Palmisano_2017" /&lt;ref name="Moonat_2013" /&gt;

Dysregulation of HDACs is significant because it can cause upregulation or downregulation of genes that have important downstream effects both in alcohol dependence and anxiety-like behaviors, and the interaction between the two. A key example is BDNF (see "BDNF" below).

==== BDNF ====
[[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) is a key protein that is dysregulated by HDAC dysregulation. BDNF is a protein that regulates the structure and function of neuronal synapses. It plays an important role in neuronal activation, synaptic plasticity, and dendritic morphology—all of which are factors that may affect cognitive function. Dysregulation of BDNF is seen both in stress-related disorders and alcoholism; thus BDNF is likely an important molecule in the interaction between stress and alcoholism.&lt;ref name="Palmisano_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moonat_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moonat S, Pandey SC | title = Stress, epigenetics, and alcoholism | journal = Alcohol Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 495–505 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23584115 | pmc = 3860391 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, BDNF is dysregulated by acute ethanol exposure. Acute ethanol exposure causes phosphorylation of CREB, which can cause increased histone acetylation at BDNF loci. Histone acetylation upregulates BDNF, in turn upregulating a downstream BDNF target called activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc), which is a protein responsible for dendritic spine structure and formation. This is significant because activation of Arc can be associated with anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects. Therefore, ethanol consumption can cause epigenetic changes that alleviate stress and anxiety, thereby creating a pattern of stress-induced alcohol dependence.&lt;ref name="Palmisano_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moonat_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pandey_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pandey SC, Ugale R, Zhang H, Tang L, Prakash A | title = Brain chromatin remodeling: a novel mechanism of alcoholism | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = 14 | pages = 3729–37 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18385331 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5731-07.2008 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol dependence is exacerbated by ethanol withdrawal. This is because ethanol withdrawal has the opposite effect of ethanol exposure; it causes lowered CREB phosphorylation, lowered acetylation, downregulation of BDNF, and increase in anxiety. Consequently, ethanol withdrawal reinforces desire for anxiolytic effects of ethanol exposure. Moreover, it is proposed that chronic ethanol exposure results in upregulation of HDAC activity, causing anxiety-like effects that can no longer be alleviated by acute ethanol exposure.&lt;ref name="Palmisano_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moonat_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moonat_2013" /&gt;

'''Fat fetishism''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]] people due to their weight and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/t-magazine/22face-merkin-t.html|title=The F Word|first=Daphne|last=Merkin|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-excess/201506/the-fat-fetish-explained|title=The Fat Fetish, Explained|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of fat fetishism is ''feederism'' or ''gaining'', where sexual gratification is obtained not from the fat itself but from the process of gaining, or helping others gain, [[body fat]]. Fat fetishism also incorporates ''stuffing'' and ''padding'', whereas the focus of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] is on the sensations and properties of a real or ''simulated'' gain.

==Attraction==
[[File:Fa attraction.svg|thumb|Physical attraction of 47 male [[fat admiration|fat admirers]] (FA, in red) towards 10 female figures from the given [[Body mass index|BMI]] range, compared with a control group (CG, in blue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224490802645302| pmid = 19116865| title = Big Beautiful Women: The Body Size Preferences of Male Fat Admirers| journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]]| volume = 46| issue = 1| pages = 89–96| year = 2009| last1 = Swami | first1 = V. | last2 = Tovée | first2 = M. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A 2009 study found that heterosexual male [[fat admiration|fat admirers]] preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes "these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that [[fat admiration|FAs]] are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness".&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren|author2=Tovee, Martin J.|title=Big beautiful women: the body size preferences of male fat admirers.|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1 January 2009|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Big+beautiful+women:+the+body+size+preferences+of+male+fat+admirers-a0196534094|accessdate=25 November 2010|doi=10.1080/00224490802645302|volume=46|pages=89–96|pmid=19116865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaining and feeding==
Gainers and feedees are people who enjoy the fantasy or reality of gaining weight themselves. Encouragers and feeders enjoy the fantasy of helping someone else gain weight. Gainer and encourager are common labels among gay men, while both straight men and women as well as lesbian women often identify as feeders and feedees.&lt;ref name="Bestard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bestard|first=Alyshia|title=Feederism: an exploratory study into the stigma of erotic weight gain.|journal=University of Waterloo Thesis Paper|date=September 2008|url=https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/3985|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gainers and feedees have a wide array of personal weight-gain goals--only 10 percent of gainers and 13 percent of feedees express interest in immobility as a fantasy or reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.feabie.com/Home/Community|title=Feabie|website=Feabie|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grommr.com/Home/Community#gainer-report|title=Grommr|website=Grommr|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[gaining and feeding]] are often considered fetishes, many within the gainer and feederism communities report viewing them more as a lifestyle, identity or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Bestard"/&gt; 

The gay gainer community grew out of the [[Girth &amp; Mirth]] movement in the 70s. By 1988 there were gainer-specific newsletters and in 1992, the first gainer event, called EncourageCon, was held in New Hope, PA. In 1996, GainRWeb launched, the first website dedicated to gay men into weight gain, ushering in the internet era.&lt;ref name="Textor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Textor|first=Alex Robertson|title=Organization, Specialization, and Desires in the Big Men's Movement: Preliminary Research in the Study of Subculture-Formation.|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|date=July 1999|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023223013536|volume=4|pages=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
The '''French Connection''' was a scheme through which [[heroin]] was [[Smuggling|smuggled]] from [[Turkey]] to [[France]] and then to the [[United States]] through Canada. The operation reached its peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was responsible for providing the vast majority of the heroin used in the United States. The operation was headed by [[Corsica]]n criminals [[Paul Carbone]] (and his associate [[François Spirito]]) and Antoine Guérini, and also involved [[Auguste Ricord]], [[Paul Mondoloni]] and [[Salvatore Greco "The Engineer"|Salvatore Greco]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Most of the operation's starting [[Capital gains tax|capital]] came from assets that Ricord had stolen during [[World War II]] when he worked for [[Henri Lafont]], one of the heads of the [[Carlingue]] (French Gestapo) during the German occupation in World War II.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==From the 1930s to the 1950s==
Illegal heroin labs were first discovered near [[Marseille]], [[France]], in 1937. These labs were run by Corsican gang leader Paul Carbone. For years, the Corsican underworld had been involved in the manufacturing and trafficking of heroin, primarily to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910391-1,00.html Time.com], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 4, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; It was this heroin network that eventually became known as "the French Connection".

The [[Unione Corse|Corsican Gang]] was protected by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and the [[SDECE]] after [[World War II]] in exchange for working to prevent French [[Communists]] from bringing the [[Old Port of Marseille]] under their control.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. McCoy, Cathleen B. Reach, and Leonard D. Adams, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (Harper &amp; Row, 1972); Peter Dale Scott, The War Conspiracy (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972); Henrik Krueger, The Great Heroin Coup (South End, 1980); Leslie Cockburn, Out of Control (Atlantic Monthly, 1987). Carlo Cortes, AP, Manila, Oct. 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the raw material for most of the heroin consumed in the United States came from [[Indochina]], then [[Turkey]]. Turkish farmers were licensed to grow [[opium poppy|opium poppies]] for sale to legal drug companies, but many sold their excess to the underworld market, where it was manufactured into heroin and transported to the United States. The [[morphine]] paste was refined in Corsican laboratories in Marseille, one of the busiest ports in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The Marseille heroin was reputed for its quality.

Marseille served as a perfect shipping point for all types of illegal goods, including the excess opium that Turkish farmers cultivated for profit. The convenience of the port at Marseille and the frequent arrival of ships from opium-producing countries made it easy to smuggle the morphine base to Marseille from the [[Far East]] or the [[Near East]]. The French underground would then ship large quantities of heroin from Marseille to [[New York City]].

The first significant post-World War II seizure was made in New York on February 5, 1947, when seven pounds (3&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin were seized from a Corsican sailor disembarking from a vessel that had just arrived from France.

It soon became clear that the French underground was increasing not only its participation in the illegal trade of opium, but also its expertise and efficiency in heroin trafficking. On March 17, 1947, 28 pounds (13&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin were found on the French liner, ''St. Tropez''. On January 7, 1949, more than 50 pounds (22.75&amp;nbsp;kg) of opium and heroin were seized on the French ship, ''Batista''.

After Paul Carbone's death, the Guérini clan was the ruling dynasty of the [[Unione Corse]] and had systematically organized the smuggling of opium from Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries. The Guérini clan was led by Marseilles mob boss Antoine Guérini and his brothers, Barthelemy, Francois and Pascal.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==The 1960s==
The first major French Connection case occurred in 1960. In June, an informant told a drug agent in [[Lebanon]] that Mauricio Rosal, the [[Guatemala]]n Ambassador to [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]], was smuggling morphine base from [[Beirut]], Lebanon to Marseille. Narcotics agents had been seizing about 200 pounds (90&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin in a typical year, but intelligence showed that the Corsican traffickers were smuggling in 200 pounds (90&amp;nbsp;kg) every other week. Rosal alone, in one year, had used his diplomatic status to bring in about 440 pounds (200&amp;nbsp;kg).

The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]]'s 1960 annual report estimated that from 2,600 to 5,000 pounds (1,200 to 2,300&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin were coming into the United States annually from France. The French traffickers continued to exploit the demand for their illegal product, and by 1969, they were supplying the United States with 80 to 90 percent of its heroin.

Because of this increasing volume, heroin became readily available throughout the United States. In an effort to limit the source, US officials went to Turkey to negotiate the phasing out of opium production. Initially, the Turkish government agreed to limit their opium production starting with the 1968 crop.

At the end of the 1960s, after Robert Blemant's assassination by Antoine Guerini, a gang war sparked in Marseille, caused by competition over casino revenues. Blemant's associate, Marcel Francisci, continued the war over the next years.

===Jean Jehan===
Former New York City Police Department Narcotics Bureau detective [[Sonny Grosso]] has stated that the kingpin of the French Connection heroin ring during the 1950s into the 1960s was Corsican Jean Jehan.&lt;ref name="BBC-TV"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB0oNSYXEQY | title=Tracing the French Connection | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jehan arranged the famous 1962 deal gone wrong of 64 pounds of "pure" heroin, he was never arrested for his involvement in international heroin smuggling. According to Grosso, all warrants for the arrest of Jehan were left open. For years thereafter, Jehan was reported to be seen arranging and operating drug activities at will throughout Europe. According to [[William Friedkin]], director of the 1971 film ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', Jehan had been a member of the French Resistance to Nazi Occupation during World War II and, because of that, French law enforcement officials refused to arrest him. Friedkin was told that Jehan died peacefully of old age at his home in Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IdnXmI0pVo | title=The French Connection Audio Commentary | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1970s and the dismantling of the French Connection==
Following five subsequent years of concessions, combined with international cooperation, the Turkish government finally agreed in 1971 to a complete ban on the growing of Turkish [[opium]], effective June 29, 1971. During these protracted negotiations, law enforcement personnel went into action. One of the major roundups began on January 4, 1972, when agents from the U.S. [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] (BNDD) and French authorities seized 110 pounds (50&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin at the [[Paris]] airport. Subsequently, traffickers Jean-Baptiste Croce and Joseph Mari were arrested in Marseille. One such French seizure from the French Connection in 1973 netted 210 pounds (95&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin worth $38 million.

In February 1972, French traffickers offered a [[United States Army]] sergeant $96,000 ({{Inflation|US|96000|1972|fmt=eq}}) to smuggle 240 pounds (109&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin into the United States. He informed his superior who in turn notified the BNDD. As a result of this investigation, five men in New York and two in Paris were arrested with 264 pounds (120&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin, which had a street value of $50 million. In a 14-month period, starting in February 1972, six major illicit heroin laboratories were seized and dismantled in the suburbs of Marseille by French national narcotics police in collaboration with U.S. drug agents. On February 29, 1972, French authorities seized the shrimp boat, ''Caprice des Temps'', as it put to sea near Marseille heading towards [[Miami]]. It was carrying 915 pounds (415&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin. Drug arrests in France skyrocketed from 57 in 1970 to 3,016 in 1972. Also broken up as part of this investigation was the crew of [[Vincent Papa]], whose members included [[Anthony Loria Sr.]] and [[Virgil Alessi]]. The well-organized gang was responsible for distributing close to a million dollars worth of heroin up and down the East Coast of the United States during the early 1970s, which in turn led to a major [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) corruption scheme. The scope and depth of this scheme are still not known, but officials suspect it involved corrupt NYPD officers who allowed Papa, Alessi, and Loria access to the NYPD property/evidence storage room, where hundreds of kilograms of heroin lay seized from the now-infamous French Connection bust, and from which the men would help themselves and replace missing heroin with flour and cornstarch to avoid detection.&lt;ref name=20090222nytimes&gt;Blumenthal, Ralph. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/nyregion/22french.html "Mobster Makes Offer on French Connection Case"], New York Times, February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="19810906nytimes"&gt;Maitland, Leslie. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E3DF103BF935A3575AC0A967948260 Papa's Game], New York Times, September 6, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The substitution was discovered only when officers noticed insects eating all the bags of "heroin". By that point an estimated street value of approximately $70 million worth of heroin had already been taken. The racket was brought to light and arrests were made. Certain plotters received jail sentences, including Papa, who was later murdered in federal prison in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

Ultimately, the Guérini clan was exterminated during internecine wars within the French underworld. In 1971, Marcel Francisci was accused by police forces in the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics of being involved in the trafficking of heroin between Marseilles and New York City.&lt;ref name=upi160182&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/16/obituaries/marcel-francisci-shot-dead-tied-to-french-connection.html Marcel Francisci Shot Dead; Tied to 'French Connection'], UPI, January 16, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1982, Marcel Francisci was shot to death as he was entering his car in the parking lot of the building where he lived in Paris, France.&lt;ref name=upi160182/&gt;

Dr '''Joseph Friedrich ("Fritz") Weleminsky''' (20 January 1868, [[Golčův Jeníkov]]{{spaced ndash}}1 January 1945, London), was a [[physician]], a scientist and a ''[[privatdozent]]'' in Hygiene (now called [[Microbiology]]) at the [[Charles University in Prague|German University, Prague]]&lt;ref group=note&gt; From 1882 to 1939, [[Charles University ]]in Prague was divided into two institutions, one German-speaking and the other Czech-speaking. See https://www.lfhk.cuni.cz/Faculty/About-faculty/History/&lt;/ref&gt; who, in the early 20th century, created  an alternative treatment for [[tuberculosis]], ''tuberculomucin Weleminsky''.&lt;ref name="Tuberculomucin"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://tuberculomucin.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Tuberculomucin&amp;nbsp;– a forgotten treatment for tuberculosis|publisher=Carole Reeves|author= Reeves, Carole|date= 4 April 2012|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

He was born into a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family on 20 January 1868 at Golčův Jeníkov in [[Bohemia]], which was then part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and is now in the [[Czech Republic]]. His parents were Jacob Weleminsky (1834–1905), a [[General practitioner|general medical practitioner]] (GP)  in Golčův Jeníkov, and his wife Bertha (''née'' Kohn; 1844–1914).&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&amp;aid=nfp&amp;datum=19000715&amp;seite=17&amp;zoom=1 |title=M B Kohn |date=15 July 1900 |work=[[Neue Freie Presse]] |access-date=25 August 2017 |publication-place=Vienna |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich was their second child; he had an elder sister, Paula (1867–1936), who in 1888 married a [[Dresden]] lawyer, Felix Popper, and a younger brother, Josef ("Pepi") (1870–1937) who, like Friedrich, studied medicine in Prague and who went on to become  a [[laryngologist]].

The family moved to Dresden in 1879 when Jacob obtained a position as GP there, and later to Prague. Friedrich attended the [[Kreuzschule]] in Dresden and studied medicine in Prague.

==Career==

Friedrich Weleminsky enrolled in the medical faculty of the German University in Prague in 1893 and obtained a [[habilitation]] qualification as [[Doctor of Medicine|Dr.Med.]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Surman"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/16713653 |title=Database, Medical Faculty of German Charles University in Prague 1882–1918 |last=Surman  |first=Jon |publisher=Habsburg Universities 1848–1918. Biography of a Space. Unpublished doctoral dissertation. [[University of Vienna]] 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to a teaching post in the university's medical faculty as a ''privatdozent'' in Hygiene in July 1900.&lt;ref name="Surman"/&gt;

During the [[First World War]], Weleminsky was in charge of the reserve hospital "Halicz" which was stationed in various parts of [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]]. While stationed in [[Kleinreifling]], a village in the district of [[Steyr-Land]] in [[Upper Austria]], he successfully brought a local [[typhoid]] [[epidemic]] under control, for which he was made an [[Ehrenbürger]] of
[[Weyer, Austria|Weyer]].&lt;ref name= "Jones"/&gt;

===''Tuberculomucin Weleminsky''===

Weleminsky's particular area of interest was [[vaccination]] against tuberculosis. In 1935, an editorial in the ''[[American Society for Clinical Pathology|American Journal of Clinical Pathology]]'' cited one of his articles&lt;ref&gt;Weleminsky, Friedrich (1930). "Die B.C.G.-Literatur in französischer Sprache". ''Zentralbl. f. d. gesam. Tuberk.Forsch''. '''33''': 129–135.&lt;/ref&gt; as providing "a good review of the voluminous literature accumulated on BCG".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Editorial: The present status of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin)  vaccination and the clinical pathologist  |journal=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology|American Journal of Clinical Pathology]] |date=1 March 1935 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=167–170 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.39.10.1344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 Weleminsky, who was then second assistant to [[Ferdinand Hueppe]], the head of the Institute for Hygiene at the German University of Prague, published his discovery of a new treatment for [[tuberculosis]], which he named tuberculomucin (Tbm).&lt;ref name="Reeves UCL"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1568053/1/Reeves_Weleminsky%20article%20TMSL.pdf |title=Tuberculomucin: a forgotten treatment for tuberculosis |last=Reeves |first=Carole |date=13 April 2015 |publisher=[[University College London]]|access-date= 14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebringer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ebringer |first=Libor |title=Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovak Society for Microbiology and the world (Plenary lecture at the 19th Congress of Czechoslovak Society for Microbiology, Košice, 19 September 1992) |journal=Folia Microbiologica |language=English |publication-date=April 1993 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=83–96  |issn=1874-9356|doi=10.1007/BF02891693 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was tested on [[guinea pigs]],&lt;ref name="Reeves UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Von Ruck"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ljwTO0DvDdcC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=tuberculomucin#v=onepage&amp;q=tuberculomucin&amp;f=false |title=Studies in Immunization Against Tuberculosis |last=Von Ruck |first=Karl |last2=Von Ruck |first2=Sylvio |publisher=Paul B Hoeber |location=New York |date=1916 |page=120|access-date=14 August 2017|isbn=9781434473875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with number 1769 being the first to survive due to the treatment in 1909.&lt;ref name="Reeves UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klinische Wochenschrift"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weleminsky |first=Friedrich |date=1914 |title= Tierversuche mit Tuberculomucin |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Medicine|Berliner klinische Wochenschrift (Clinical Weekly)]] |volume=18 |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used ''tuberculomucin Weleminsky''&lt;ref name="Zemmin and Wille"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02093958#page-1|title=Beitrag zur Tuberkulosetherapie mit Tuberculomucin|vauthors= Zemmin H, Wille K|journal=Beiträge zur Klinik der Tuberkulose und Spezifischen Tuberkulose-Forschung (Contributions to Clinical Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis {{ndash}} Specific Research)|date=October 1926|volume= 64|issue= 5–6|pages= 679 {{ndash}} 682|doi= 10.1007/BF02093958|issn= 0341-2040|access-date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also spelt ''tuberkulomucin Weleminsky''&lt;ref name="Rezepttaschenbuch "&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rezepttaschenbuch (nebst Anhang)  |editor=Muller E |authors=Harms C; Hildebrand H; Otto G; Rapmund E; Schenk P; Siebert C; Straßner H; Uhlenhuth P; Vogt H |date=1923 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Verlag von Julius Springer]]  |location=Berlin|page=435|isbn=978-3-642-90953-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tuberkulomuzin Weleminsky'')&lt;ref name="Henius"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Henius|first=Kurt |last2=Basch |first2=Erich |date=25 December 1925 |title=Erfahrungen mit dem Tuberkulomuzin Weleminsky (Experiences with tuberculomuzin Weleminsky) |url=https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0028-1137468.pdf |journal=Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift (German Medical Weekly) |volume=51 |number=52|pages= 2149–2150|access-date=23 September 2017|doi=10.1055/s-0028-1137468}}&lt;/ref&gt; to treat cattle which he kept at his country retreat, Schloss Thalheim.

More than 60 papers were published in German describing tuberculomucin's use in humans, but very few of them were read by an English-speaking audience. By the mid-1920s it was known as ''tuberculomucin Weleminsky'' and at least two companies were involved in producing and marketing the treatment.&lt;ref name="Reeves UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 1927 advertisement pictured here was issued by the Biopharma [[pharmaceutical company]] in Vienna. It listed the distinctions between  [[tuberculin]] and  ''tuberculomucin Weleminsky'' (TbM) and invited general practitioners and clinical physicians to seek a brochure about TbM, or trial samples for clinical testing, by completing and returning a postcard in which they were also asked to say if they were already using Tbm and what success they had experienced in using it. ''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Sanders, a Belgian pharmaceutical company, planned to manufacture Tbm and to make it available in Western Europe and other parts of the developed world. However, Weleminsky fled from Prague in 1939, a couple of weeks before the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia]], and these plans and further development of the treatment ceased.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/staff/staff-news/25022014-spotlightoncarolereeves |title=Spotlight on Carole Reeves |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=[[University College London]] |publication-date=5 March 2014|access-date= 4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and family life==
On 4 December 1905 he married [[Jenny Weleminsky|Jenny Elbogen]] (1882–1957), at her parents' [[manor house|country home]], [[Jenny Weleminsky|Schloss Thalheim]], [[Lower Austria]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Schloss Thalheim is in the village of Thalheim (Kapelln), today a part of [[Kapelln]], [[Sankt Pölten-Land District]]; See [[:de:Liste der denkmalgeschützten Objekte in Kapelln#Denkmäler]], [[Jakob Prandtauer]]. The property was damaged during the [[Second World War]]. After restoration [http://www.schlossthalheim.at/en/historical-walls-history-manor-house.html it reopened in 2016 as a luxury hotel.]&lt;/ref&gt; The married couple lived in Prague and at Schloss Thalheim,&lt;ref name="Tuberculomucin"/&gt; which Jenny inherited from her father after his death in 1918 and which they ran as a model dairy farm.

They had four children together. Their eldest daughter, Marianne (born 1906), and their son, Anton&lt;ref group=note&gt;Anton was referred to as "Antonin" in official [[Czech (language)|Czech]] documents.&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1908), came to Britain just before the [[Second World War]]. Two of their daughters emigrated in the early 1930s to [[Mandatory Palestine]] where they took new names&amp;nbsp;– Eliesabeth (born 1909) became Jardenah, and Dorothea (born 1912) was known as Leah.  Like his wife, Friedrich Weleminsky was a [[secular Jew]] and an [[atheist]] but he did not share her opposition to [[Zionism]].  Jenny ceased all contact with the two daughters after they left Austria to live in Palestine, but Friedrich communicated with them clandestinely through their sister Marianne.

Facing [[Nazi]] persecution for being Jewish, Friedrich and Jenny Weleminsky found sanctuary in 1939 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="Tuberculomucin"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajr.org.uk/journalpdf/2011_July.pdf|title=My grandfather: A kind and modest man|author=Jones, Charlotte|journal=AJR Journal|date=July 2011|volume=11|issue=7|pages=5|access-date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Friedrich Weleminsky died of [[pneumonia]] on 1 January 1945 at [[Charing Cross Hospital|Fulham Hospital]], London&lt;ref name= "Jones"/&gt; and is buried at [[Golders Green Jewish Cemetery]]. His wife Jenny, who was 14 years younger, survived him by 12 years. Their grandchildren and great-grandchildren now live in Britain, [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]].

In 2011, following an approach by  Weleminsky’s eldest granddaughter, Dr Charlotte Jones, a retired [[general practitioner]], a team at the [[University College London]]'s Department of Science and Technology Studies resumed research on ''tuberculomucin Weleminsky''.&lt;ref name="UCL Donors"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/sts-publication-news/news_archive/2013_02_13_tuberculomucin |title=UCL Donors help fund a forgotten treatment for TB |publisher= [[University College London]] Department of Science and Technology Studies|date=13 February 2014|access-date= 31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2462">'''Fungistatics''' are anti-fungal agents that inhibit the growth of [[fungus]] (without killing the fungus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fungistatic | title=Definition of fungistatic | publisher=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''fungistatic'' may be used as both a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]]. Fungistatics have applications in agriculture, the food industry, the paint industry, and medicine.

== Anti-fungal medicines ==
[[Fluconazole]] is a fungistatic antifungal medication that is administered orally or intravenously. It is used to treat a variety of fungal infections, especially Candida infections of the vagina ("yeast infections'), mouth, throat, and bloodstream. It is also used to prevent infections in people with weak immune systems, including those with neutropenia due to cancer chemotherapy, transplant patients, and premature babies. Its mechanism of action involves interfering with synthesis of the fungal cell membrane.

[[Itraconazole]] (R51211), invented in 1984, is a triazole fungistatic antifungal agent prescribed to patients with fungal infections. The drug may be given orally or intravenously. Itraconazole has a broader spectrum of activity than fluconazole (but not as broad as voriconazole or posaconazole). In particular, it is active against Aspergillus, which fluconazole is not. The mechanism of action of itraconazole is the same as the other [[azole]] antifungals: it inhibits the fungal-mediated synthesis of [[ergosterol]].

== Anti-fungal food preservatives ==
[[Sodium benzoate]] and [[potassium sorbate]] are both examples of fungistatic substances that are widely used in the preservation of food and beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fbcindustries.com/Sodium_Benzoate.aspx | title=Sodium Benzoate | publisher=FBC Industries, Inc. | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/40abcj15.htm | title=Toxicological evaluation of some antimicrobials, antioxidants, emulsifiers, stabilizers, flour-treatment agents, acids, and bases | publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety (INCHEM) | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3359">There is a relatively low prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in [[New Zealand]], with an estimated 2,900 people out a population of 4.51 million living with HIV/AIDS as of 2014. The rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections was stable at around 100 annually through the late 1980s and the 1990s but rose sharply from 2000 to 2005. It has since stabilised at roughly 200 new cases annually. Male-to-male sexual contact has been the largest contributor to new HIV cases in New Zealand since record began in 1985. Heterosexual contact is the second largest contributor to new cases, but unlike male-to-male contact, they are mostly acquired outside New Zealand.&lt;ref name="progress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/NZL_narrative_report_2015.pdf |title=UNGASS Country Progress Report New Zealand: Reporting Period: January 2014 – December 2014|date=April 2015|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded death in New Zealand due to AIDS was in New Plymouth in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/publications/fact-sheets01/newzealand_en.pdf UNAIDS factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Eve van Grafhorst]] was ostracised in Australia since she had contracted HIV/AIDS caused by a transfusion of infected blood. The family moved to New Zealand where she died at the age of 11. By the time of her death, her plight had significantly raised the level of AIDS awareness in New Zealand.

[[World AIDS Day]] is observed in New Zealand.

==Organisations==
The [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] is the government department which deals with health issues, including HIV/AIDS.

The New Zealand AIDS Foundation is a registered charitable trust which focuses on prevention of AIDS in the most at-risk group, namely [[men who have sex with men]].

==Antiretroviral medications==
The [[Pharmac|Pharmaceutical Management Agency]] (Pharmac) manages the national schedule of subsidised medications. As of 2014, twenty-one different antiretroviral medications were subsidised for people with confirmed HIV/AIDS or for post-exposure prophylaxis.&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

In March 2018, New Zealand became one of the first countries in the world to publically fund pre-exposure prophylaxis medication for those at a high risk of contracting HIV.&lt;ref name= "New Zealand AIDS Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzaf.org.nz/news-and-media/news/pharmac-announces-prep-funding/ |title=NZ ahead of the pack in funding revolutionary HIV-prevention drug PrEP |date=7 February 2018 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public medical services of [[Ivory Coast]] are more important than the small number of private physicians and clinics. {{As of|2004}}, there were an estimated 9 physicians, 31 nurses, and 15 midwives per 100,000 people. About 77 percent of the population had access to safe water in 2000. Total health care expenditures were estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP.

== Health status ==
===Endemic diseases===
[[Malaria]], [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], [[leprosy]], [[trachoma]], and [[meningitis]] are endemic. A broad program was set up in 1961 to control these and other diseases. Compulsory vaccination against [[smallpox]] and yellow fever was instituted, efforts by mobile health units to track down cases and provide treatment were intensified, and general health measures were tightened both within the country and at the borders. In 1999, Ivory Coast immunized children up to one year old as follows: [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], and [[tetanus]], 62 percent, and [[measles]], 62 percent. Malnutrition affected 24 percent of children under the age of five.

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Ivory Coast}}
The [[HIV/AIDS in Ivory Coast]] prevalence was 0.60 per 100 adults in 2003. As of 2004, there were approximately 570,000 people living with [[HIV/AIDS]] in the country. There were an estimated 47,000 deaths from AIDS in 2003.

According to the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iv.html CIA World Factbook], in Ivory there are a total of 460,100 people who live with HIV/AIDS as of 2014. 

The high incidence of HIV/AIDS is attributed to a lack of HIV education programs.

===Maternal and child health care===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Ivory Coast is 470. This is compared with 944.1 in 2008 and 580.3 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 121 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 33. In Ivory Coast the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 4 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 44.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 36% of women have undergone [[female genital mutilation]] (as of 2006).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The birth rate in 1999 was 41.8 per 1,000. The infant mortality rate in 2005 was 90.83 per 1,000 live births, and 14 percent of all births were classified as low weight. In 2005, average life expectancy in Ivory Coast was estimated at 48.62.

== Diseases and illness caused by hunger ==

There are a lot of disease and illness caused by hunger. Ivory Coast decided to contain some diseases or illness in their National Development Plan. These were all problems relating to hunger. Whether it is not being able to access the right food or starving from hunger. 

Diseases or illnesses that Ivory Coast wants to reduce:

*Woman Anemia
*Stunting under the age of 5
*Low birth weight
*0-5 months breastfeeding
*Under 5 wasting (deaths)

[[File:Caf babies.jpg|300px|thumb|Mothers and babies aged between 0 and 5 years lining up in a health post in 2008 at Begoua, a district of [[Bangui]], waiting for the two drops of the oral [[polio vaccine]] that will prevent paralysis and death. Despite the progress over the past few years, medical care remains both costly and inaccessible for many families across the [[Central African Republic]]. Vaccination coverage for preventable diseases stands at less than 52% and one child in five does not live past five years of age.]]

In the [[Central African Republic]], mobile crews treat local [[Pandemic|epidemic disease]]s, conduct [[vaccination]] and [[inoculation]] campaigns, and enforce local health regulations.
They conduct research on [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[malaria]], and other tropical diseases and devise prophylactic methods best suited to the rural population.

== Health infrastructure ==
In 2004, it was estimated that there were fewer than 3 physicians and 9 nurses per 100,000 people. In 2000, 60 percent of the population had access to safe drinking water and 31% had adequate sanitation.

== Health status ==
=== Life expectancy ===
The 2014 CIA estimated average life expectancy in the Central African Republic was 51.81 years.&lt;ref name=iuonoa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook Life Expectancy|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endemic diseases===
The most common diseases are [[bilharziasis]], [[leprosy]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[poliomyelitis]] and [[yaws]]. The Central African Republic is a [[yellow fever]] endemic zone country. The [[Pasteur Institute]] at [[Bangui]] cooperates actively with vaccination campaigns. All [[medicine]], [[antibiotics]], and [[vaccine]] imports must be authorized by the Ministry of Health.

===Maternal and child healthcare===
As of 1999, the immunization rates for children up to one year old were as follows: [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], and [[tetanus]], 33 percent and [[measles]], 39%.

The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Central African Republic is 850. This is compared with 1570.4 in 2008 and 1757.1 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 172 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 26. In the Central African Republic the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 3 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 27.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
The [[Central African Republic]] is one of several [[African nations]] with a high incidence of AIDS. The [[HIV/AIDS]] prevalence was 13.50 per 100 adults in 2003. As of 2004, there were approximately 260,000 people living with [[HIV/AIDS]] in the country. There were an estimated 23,000 deaths from AIDS in 2003. This number dropped to 13,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsandemergencies.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=128|title=Central African Republic (CAR)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229223641/http://www.aidsandemergencies.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=128|archivedate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 11,000 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/global?page=cr09-ct-00|title=Global HIV Resources|website=hivinsite.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 160,000 people with HIV/AIDS were reported in 2007, and 140,000 in 2009, for a prevalence rate of about 3.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/car_statistics.html|title=Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the prevalence rate had dropped to about 2.8%, although the prevalence in gay males was over 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/centralafricanrepublic/|title=UNAids|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About||the short film|Hibakusha (film)}}

{{nihongo3||被爆者|'''Hibakusha'''}} is the Japanese word for the surviving victims of the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. The word literally translates as "explosion-affected people" and is used to refer to people who were exposed to [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] from the bombings.

==Official recognition==
The Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Law defines ''hibakusha'' as people who fall into one or more of the following categories: within a few kilometers of the [[hypocenter]]s of the bombs; within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the hypocenters within two weeks of the bombings; exposed to radiation from [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]]; or not yet born but carried by pregnant women in any of these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.nagasaki.jp/gentai/zaigai/e/survivor.html |title=Overseas Atomic Bomb Survivors Support Program |publisher=Atomic Bomb Survivors Affairs Division Health And Welfare Department Nagasaki prefectural Government |accessdate=2007-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184626/http://www.pref.nagasaki.jp/gentai/zaigai/e/survivor.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as ''hibakusha''. {{As of|2018|alt=As of March 31, 2018}}, 154,859 were still alive, mostly in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004640744 | title= Mayor vows to pass on Hiroshima history / Ceremony marks 73rd anniversary of bombing | last=  | first=  | date= August 6, 2018 | work= [[The Japan News]] | accessdate= 2018-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20070815a2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011123702/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20070815a2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-11 |title=Relief for A-bomb victims |date=2007-08-15 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |accessdate=2007-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hibakusha'' are entitled to government support. They receive a certain amount of allowance per month, and the ones certified as suffering from bomb-related diseases receive a special medical allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?appURL=nn20060315a7.html |title=30 A-bomb survivors apply for radiation illness benefits |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, {{As of|2018|alt=as of August 2018}}, the memorials record the names of almost 495,000 ''hibakusha''; 314,118 in Hiroshima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180806/p2a/00m/0na/016000c | title= Hiroshima mayor questions nuclear nations' nationalism, wants Japan to do more | date= August 6, 2018 | first= | last= | work= [[The Mainichi]] | accessdate= 2018-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 179,226 in Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nagasaki-marks-73rd-anniversary-of-atomic-bombing-13143585.php | title= Nagasaki marks 73rd anniversary of atomic bombing | last=  | first=  | date= August 9, 2018 | work= [[The Japan News]] | accessdate= 2017-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the Japanese Parliament passed a law providing for free medical care for ''hibakusha''. During the 1970s, non-Japanese ''hibakusha'' who suffered from those atomic attacks began to demand the right for free medical care and the right to stay in Japan for that purpose. In 1978, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that such persons were entitled to free medical care while staying in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=92137&amp;dt=2694&amp;dl=2009 US diplomatic cable reporting the ruling]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=23426 My Life: Interview with former Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka], Part 10, ''Chugoku Shimbun''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean survivors===
During the war, Japan brought many Korean conscripts to both Hiroshima and Nagasaki to work as slaves. According to recent estimates, about 20,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and about 2,000 died in Nagasaki. It is estimated that one in seven of the Hiroshima victims was of Korean ancestry.&lt;ref name="ModernJapan"&gt;
{{cite book | author=Mikiso Hane | title=Modern Japan: A Historical Survey | publisher= Westview Press | year=2001 |isbn=0-8133-3756-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, Koreans had a difficult time fighting for recognition as atomic bomb victims and were denied health benefits. However, most issues have been addressed in recent years through lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/culture/features/news/20080509p2g00m0fe008000c.html Hibakusha: A Korean's fight to end discrimination toward foreign A-bomb victims] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219002748/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/culture/features/news/20080509p2g00m0fe008000c.html |date=2013-02-19 }}, Mainichi Daily News. May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese American survivors===
It was a common practice before the war for American [[Issei]], or first-generation immigrants, to send their children on extended trips to Japan to study or visit relatives. More Japanese immigrated to the U.S. from Hiroshima than from any other prefecture, and Nagasaki also sent a high number of immigrants to Hawai'i and the mainland. There was, therefore, a sizable population of American-born [[Nisei]] and [[Kibei]] living in their parents' hometowns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bombings. The actual number of [[Japanese American]]s affected by the bombings is unknown&amp;nbsp;– although estimates put approximately 11,000 in Hiroshima city alone&amp;nbsp;– but some 3,000 of them are known to have survived and returned to the U.S. after the war.&lt;ref name=Wake&gt;Wake, Naoko. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Japanese%20American%20Hibakusha/ "Japanese American Hibakusha"], ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved Aug 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second group of ''hibakusha'' counted among Japanese American survivors are those who came to the U.S. in a later wave of Japanese immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. Most in this group were born in Japan and migrated to the U.S. in search of educational and work opportunities that were scarce in post-war Japan. Many were "war brides", or Japanese women who had married American men related to the U.S. military's occupation of Japan.&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt;

As of 2014, there are about 1,000 recorded Japanese American ''hibakusha'' living in the United States. They receive monetary support from the Japanese government and biannual medical checkups with Hiroshima and Nagasaki doctors familiar with the particular concerns of atomic bomb survivors. The U.S. government provides no support to Japanese American ''hibakusha''.&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt;

===Other foreign survivors===

One American POW, [[Joe Kieyoomia]], was in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/navcode.htm "How Effective Was Navajo Code? One Former Captive Knows"], ''News from Indian Country'', August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double survivors===
People who suffered the effects of both bombings are known as ''nijū hibakusha'' in Japan.

A documentary called ''Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki'' was produced in 2006. The producers found 165 people who were victims of both bombings, and the production was screened at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Twice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/06/08/twicesurvived.html|title=Twice Bombed, Twice Survived: Film Explores Untold Stories from Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki|date=August 2, 2006|publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized [[Tsutomu Yamaguchi]] (1916–2010) as a double ''hibakusha''. Tsutomu Yamaguchi was confirmed to be 3&amp;nbsp;kilometers from [[ground zero]] in Hiroshima on a business trip when [[Little Boy|the bomb]] was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He got back to his home city of Nagasaki on August&amp;nbsp;8, a day before [[Fat Man|the bomb]] in Nagasaki was dropped, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Hiroshima-And-Nagasaki-Atomic-Bomb-Survivor-Recognised/Article/200903415247958?lpos=World_News_Second_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15247958_Hiroshima_And_Nagasaki_Atomic_Bomb_Survivor_Recognised|1 Japan Confirms First Double A-Bomb Survivor]&lt;/ref&gt; Tsutomu Yamaguchi died at the age of 93 on January 4, 2010, of stomach cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/01/06/japan.bomb.victim.dies/index.html |title=Man who survived two atom bombs dies |date=January 8, 2010 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
[[File:Hibakusha.jpg|thumb|A hibakusha, a survivor of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, tells young people about his experience and shows pictures. United Nations building in Vienna, during the NPT PrepCom 2007.]]

''Hibakusha'' and their children were (and still are) victims of severe [[discrimination]] when it comes to prospects of marriage or work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Lewis M.|title=Children of Hiroshima, Nagasaki survivors facing prejudice, discrimination in Japan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19840607&amp;id=Z6QyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ru8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1441,3702452&amp;hl=en|accessdate=29 January 2016|agency=Knight-Rider News|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|date=June 7, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[radiophobia|public ignorance]] about the consequences of [[radiation sickness]], with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nci.org/0new/hibakusha-jt5701.htm |title=Prejudice haunts atomic bomb survivors |publisher=''[[Japan Times]]'' |accessdate=2007-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810060050/http://www.nci.org/0new/hibakusha-jt5701.htm |archivedate=2007-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear weapons used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/268/5/661.short The Children of Atomic Bomb Survivors: A Genetic Study. 1992.

The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities/birth defects than the rate which is observed in the Japanese average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/genetics_e/birthdef.html (RERF)Radiation Effects Research Foundation.

[[Studs Terkel]]'s book ''[[The Good War]]'' includes a conversation with two ''hibakusha''. The postscript observes:

{{quote|There is considerable discrimination in Japan against the hibakusha. It is frequently extended toward their children as well: socially as well as economically. "Not only hibakusha, but their children, are refused employment," says Mr. Kito. "There are many among them who do not want it known that they are hibakusha."|Studs Terkel (1984), ''The Good War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Terkel | first = Studs | authorlink = Studs Terkel | title = [[The Good War]] | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 1984 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = 542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The {{nihongo|[[Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations]]|日本被団協|Nihon Hidankyō}} is a group formed by ''hibakusha'' in 1956 with the goals of pressuring the Japanese government to improve support of the victims and lobbying governments for the abolition of [[nuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/hidankyo/nihon/rn_page/english/index_english/index_english.html|title=Welcome to HIDANKYO|publisher=Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization (''Nihon Hidankyo'') website|accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some estimates are that 140,000 people  in  Hiroshima  (38.9%  of  the  population)  and  70,000 people  in  Nagasaki  (28.0%  of  the  population)  died  in  1945, but how many died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the [[hypocenter]], who suffered  injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by [[acute radiation syndrome]](ARS), all within about 20–30 days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jhps/45/4/45_4_370/_pdf Latest Knowledge on Radiological Effects: Radiation Health Effects of Atomic Bomb Explosions and  Nuclear Power Plant Accidents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/4421057 Medical Effects Of Atomic Bombs The Report Of The Joint Commission For The Investigation Of The Effects Of The Atomic Bomb In Japan Volume 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rare cases of survival for individuals who were [[in utero]] at the time of the bombing and yet who still were close enough to be exposed to less than or equal to 0.57 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]], no difference in their cognitive abilities was found, suggesting a threshold dose for pregnancies below which, no life-limiting issues arise. In 50 or so children who survived the gestational process and were exposed to more than this dose, putting them within about 1000 meters from the hypocenter, [[Microcephaly]] was observed, this is the only elevated birth defect issue observed in the Hibakusha, occurring in approximately 50 in-utero individuals who were situated less than 1000 meters from the bombings.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykKlVU0V-oC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=microcephaly%20hiroshima&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eqT78xHiCX&amp;sig=9bckWb7x6IsnUC6lhvsa_QTfZ04&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OGtqTsG9NYTX8gOL3cwk&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=microcephaly%20hiroshima&amp;f=false|title=Teratology in the Twentieth Century Plus Ten|first=Harold|last=Kalter|date=28 July 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18776/effect-of-exposure-to-the-atomic-bombs-on-pregnancy-termination-in-hiroshima-and-nagasaki Effect of Exposure to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1956) doi.org/10.17226/18776]&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who did not suffer ARS, or who survived it. In a strictly dependent manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 ''Life Span Study'', conducted by the [[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]], a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958–1987 and who took part in the study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VFN3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=rerf+abcc+summary+leukemia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NP75Q0EteW&amp;sig=Glyw3rJ7BBSzKTT0_FVidAv9H9I&amp;hl=ga&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUnoWhscvVAhVJIMAKHQhKCYYQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=TABLE%207.3&amp;f=false Effects of Ionizing Radiation: Atomic Bomb Survivors and Their Children ... edited by Leif E.

An [[epidemiology]] study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers, of unspecified lethality, could be due to radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being estimated at 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality.&lt;ref name="rerf-cancers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa2.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions #2 |publisher=[[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]] |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cutting instruments and dissecting: Scalpels, Scissors, Saws.
# Grasping or holding instruments: Smooth [anatomical] and Toothed [surgical] Forceps, Towel Clamps, vascular clamps, and organ holders.
# Hemostatic instruments: Billroth’s clamps, hemostatic “mosquito” forceps, atraumatic hemostatic forceps, Deschamp’s needle, Höpfner’s hemostatic forceps.
# Retractors:Farabef’s C-shaped laminar hook, blunt-toothed hook, sharp-toothed hook, grooved probe, tamp forceps
# tissue unifying instruments and materials: needle holders, surgical needles, staplers, clips, adhesive tapes.

The '''International Classification of Primary Care''' ('''ICPC''') is a classification method for [[primary care]] encounters. It allows for the classification of the patient’s [[reason for encounter]] (RFE), the problems/diagnosis managed, primary or general [[health care]] interventions, and the ordering of the data of the primary care session in an episode of care structure. It was developed by the [[WONCA International Classification Committee]] (WICC), and was first published in 1987 by [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP). A revision and inclusion of criteria and definitions was published in 1998. The second revision was accepted within the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) Family of International Classifications.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/icpc2/en/ ''International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2)''.] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification was developed in a context of increasing demand for quality information on primary care as part of growing worldwide attention to global [[primary health care]] objectives, including the WHO's target of "[[health for all]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bentsen BG. "International classification of primary care." ''Scand J Prim Health Care.'' 1986 Feb;4(1):43-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first version of ICPC, which was published in 1987, is referred to as ''ICPC-1''. A subsequent revision which was published in the 1993 publication ''The International Classification of Primary Care in the European Community: With a Multi-Language Layer'' is known as ''ICPC-E''.

The 1998 publication, of version 2, is referred to as ''ICPC-2''. The [[acronym]] ''ICPC-2-E'', refers to a revised electronic version, which was released in 2000. Subsequent revisions of ICPC-2 are also labelled with a release date.

==Structure==

===Chapters===

The ICPC contains 17 chapters:
* A General and unspecified
* B Blood, blood forming organs, lymphatics, spleen
* D Digestive
* F Eye
* H Ear
* K Circulatory
* L Musculoskeletal
* N Neurological
* P Psychological
* R Respiratory
* S Skin
* T Endocrine, metabolic and nutritional
* U Urology
* W Pregnancy, childbirth, family planning
* X Female genital system and breast
* Y Male genital system
* Z Social problems

===Components===
The ICPC classification, within each chapter, is based on 3 components coming from 3 different classifications:
* Reason for Encounter Classification (1981)
* International Classification of Process in Primary Care (IC-Process-PC) (1985)
* International Classification of Health Problem in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-d) (1976, 1983)

Though he was of half-Delaware descent, quarter-blood [[French American|French]], and quarter-blood Caddo, John Wilson spoke only the [[Caddo language]] and identified only as a Caddo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peyote Religion: A History|last=Stewart|first=Omer|publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Pr.|year=1987|isbn=|location=Norman, Okla.|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have been born in 1845, when his band of Caddo were still living in [[Texas]]. They were driven into [[Indian Territory]] in 1859.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987 86"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peyote religion: a history|last=Stewart|first=Omer|publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Pr.|year=1987|isbn=|location=Norman, Okla.|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson, being interested in religion and only known as a [[medicine man]], sought out a path to be a [[peyote roadman]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="s86"&gt;Stewart 86&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Ghost Dance]] ceremonies regained popularity in Oklahoma, he became one of its most active leaders in the Indian Territory.

During a two-week period, Wilson consumed peyote for spiritual reasons and said he was shown essential astronomical symbols representing the life of Jesus Christ. These messages became part of his own teaching, which nevertheless remained reliant purely on peyote. He recalled that Peyote spoke to him, telling him to keep indulging in, and to keep walking in its "road" until the day he died of the peyote to create a higher enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987 86"/&gt;

The tribe had been exposed to the Half Moon peyote ceremony, but Wilson introduced the Big Moon ceremony to the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of North American Indians, volume 2: Indians in contemporary society|last=Bailey|first=Garrick|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caddo tribe remains very active in the [[Native American Church]] today.

He is the single human most known for the changes to the religious altar and the peyote ceremony. His changes to the altar, unintentionally persuaded{{explain|grammar/word choice|date=April 2017}} the image of the cross in Christian churches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peyote Religious Art: Symbols of Faith and Belief|last=Swan|first=Daniel|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1999|isbn=|location=Jackson, Mississippi|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson died at the age of 61 in 1901.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Medical Subject Headings''' ('''MeSH''') is a comprehensive [[controlled vocabulary]] for the purpose of [[Subject indexing|indexing]] journal articles and books in the life sciences; it serves as a [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]] that facilitates searching. Created and updated by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), it is used by the [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH is also used by [[ClinicalTrials.gov]] registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov.

MeSH was introduced in 1960, with the NLM's own [[Subject indexing|index catalogue]] and the subject headings of the [[Index Medicus|Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus]] (1940 edition) as precursors. The yearly printed version of MeSH was discontinued in 2007 and MeSH is now available online only.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web | title = Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Fact sheet | publisher = [[National Library of Medicine]] | date = 2005-05-27 | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/mesh.html | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through [[PubMed]]. Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different languages.

==Structure==
&lt;!-- [[Image:MeSH-example.svg|frame|Hierarchical relationships in MeSH 2005: ''Stomach Neoplasms'' and all of its broader terms]]--&gt;
The 2009 version of MeSH contains a total of 25,186 ''subject headings'', also known as ''descriptors''.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; Most of these are accompanied by a short description or definition, links to related descriptors, and a list of synonyms or very similar terms (known as ''entry terms''). This additional information and the hierarchical structure (see below) make the MeSH essentially a [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]], rather than a plain subject headings list.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/introduction.html Introduction to MeSH – 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptor hierarchy===
The ''descriptors'' or ''subject headings'' are arranged in a hierarchy. A given descriptor may appear at several locations in the hierarchical tree. The tree locations carry systematic labels known as ''tree numbers'', and consequently one descriptor can carry several tree numbers. For example, the descriptor "Digestive System Neoplasms" has the tree numbers C06.301 and C04.588.274; C stands for Diseases, C06 for Digestive System Diseases and C06.301 for Digestive System Neoplasms; C04 for Neoplasms, C04.588 for Neoplasms By Site, and C04.588.274 also for Digestive System Neoplasms. The tree numbers of a given descriptor are subject to change as MeSH is updated. Every descriptor also carries a unique alphanumerical ID that will not change.

===Descriptions===
Most subject headings come with a short description or definition. See the [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=mesh&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=68003924&amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Mesh.Mesh_ResultsPanel.Mesh_RVDocSum MeSH description for diabetes type 2] as an example. The explanatory text is written by the MeSH team based on their standard sources if not otherwise stated. References are mostly encyclopaedias and standard textbooks of the subject areas. References for specific statements in the descriptions are not given, instead readers are referred to the [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/intro_biblio2007.html bibliography].

===Qualifiers===
In addition to the descriptor hierarchy, MeSH contains a small number of standard ''qualifiers'' (also known as ''subheadings''), which can be added to descriptors to narrow down the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2009/introduction/topsubscope.html List of qualifiers – MeSH 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Measles" is a descriptor and "epidemiology" is a qualifier; "Measles/epidemiology" describes the subheading of epidemiological articles about Measles. The "epidemiology" qualifier can be added to all other disease descriptors. Not all descriptor/qualifier combinations are allowed since some of them may be meaningless. In all there are 83 different qualifiers.

===Supplements===
In addition to the descriptors, MeSH also contains some 139,000 ''supplementary concept records''. These do not belong to the controlled vocabulary as such; instead they enlarge the thesaurus and contain links to the closest fitting descriptor to be used in a MEDLINE search. Many of these records describe chemical substances.

==Use in Medline/PubMed==
In MEDLINE/PubMed, every journal article is indexed with about 10–15 subject headings, subheadings and supplementary concept records, with some of them designated as ''major'' and marked with an asterisk, indicating the article's major topics. When performing a MEDLINE search via PubMed, entry terms are automatically translated into (i.e. mapped to) the corresponding descriptors with a good degree of reliability; it is recommended to check the 'Details tab' in PubMed to see how a search formulation was translated. By default, a search for a descriptor will include all the descriptors in the hierarchy below the given one.

==Use in ClinicalTrials.gov==
In ClinicalTrials.gov, each trial has keywords that describe the trial. The ClinicalTrials.gov team assigns each trial two sets of MeSH terms. One  set for the conditions studied by the trial and another for the set of interventions used in the trial. The XML file that can be downloaded for each trial contains these MeSH keywords. The XML file also has a comment that says: "the assignment of MeSH keywords is done by imperfect algorithm".

==Categories==

The '''Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland''' is a tribunal of the [[Scottish Government]] to hear applications for, and appeals against, Compulsory Treatment Order, and appeals against Short Term Detention Certificates made under the [[Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003]], and other matters in relation to that Act, for example, appeals against Compulsion and Restriction Orders.

==History==
The Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland was established on 5 October 2005, under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.&lt;ref name="AboutTribunal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhtscotland.gov.uk/mhts/About_Tribunal/About_Tribunal |title=About the Tribunal |publisher=Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headquarters are located in Hamilton, although it has staff who work throughout Scotland.&lt;ref name="AboutTribunal" /&gt;

==Controversy==
The Mental Health Tribunal has been criticised regarding its opacity and its authority. In 2009, [[WikiLeaks]] published a membership list which had previously been hosted on the Tribunal's website but later removed, along with several observations to this effect.

'''Mission Florentino''' was a [[Bolivarian mission]] organized by the government of [[Venezuela]]n President, [[Hugo Chávez]], to coordinate the populace to vote "No" in the [[Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004]] to keep him in office. The organizational centers of the Mission were named '''Comando Maisanta''', as the ideological central headquarters (election brigades) for those who wished to keep Chávez as the President of Venezuela for the remainder of his presidential term.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hugo Chávez-Batalla de Santa Inés.jpg|thumb|200px|President Chávez organizes the campaign "Battle of Santa Inés" conducted by the Mission Florentino in 2004.]] --&gt;
The mission's name was inspired from a poem by [[Alberto Arvelo Torrealba]] entitled "Florentino y el Diablo (Florentino and the Devil)" in which a singer, Florentino, is tempted by the Devil to join him. Chávez claimed that reading the poem reminded him of the political situation in Venezuela at the time and encouraged his supporters to follow the example of Florentino fighting the Devil (those who were going to vote in favor of removing him from office). The name of the "Comandos" came from the [[Caudillo]] Pedro Pérez Delgado, great grandfather of Chávez and nicknamed "Maisanta", who fought as a [[guerrilla]] fighter against [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] for control of the country during the early years of the 20th Century.

On June 2004, Chávez announced that the campaign conducted by the Mission Florentino for the referendum will bear the name of "Battle of Santa Inés"[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2004/06/06/pol_ava_06A466303.shtml]. The campaign will have the intention of reenacting the battle fought in 1859, in a town near the city of [[Barinas, Barinas|Barinas]], in which [[Ezequiel Zamora]] lured the government army of the west into an area where he could defeat them in a counterattack [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212425/http://www.rnv.gov.ve/noticias/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=2&amp;t=5952]. Chávez referred to Zamora's enemies during the [[Federal War]] as members of an [[oligarchy]] and, in the same way, to all of those who wished to vote against him in the Referendum.

==Objectives of the Mission==
The official objectives of the Mission were defined as:
* Incorporate the "base" of the party to vote
* Avoid electoral fraud
* Consolidate reached achievements
* Attract the indecisive segment of the population
* Neutralize the growth of the adversary
* Isolate the ''golpistas'' ("coup people", referring to those who supported the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]] against Chávez)
* Incorporate the politically excluded

==Objectives and Structure of the "National Comando Maisanta"==
The "National Comando Maisanta" was conformed by members directly and solely appointed by President Chávez, for the purpose of:
*Establishing the guidelines of the campaign
*Organizing the Mission on all Venezuelan territory
*Directing and following all activities assigned to the organization

A '''monthly nurse''' is a woman who looks after a mother and her baby during the [[postpartum period|postpartum or postnatal period]].

Historically, women were confined to their beds or their homes for extensive periods after [[childbirth|giving birth]]; care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law), or, for those who could afford it, by the monthly nurse. These weeks were called confinement or [[lying-in]], and ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. The term "monthly nurse" was most common in 18th and 19th century England.

The job still exists, although it now might be described as "postnatal [[doula]]" or "maternity nurse" or "newborn care specialist" - all [[Nanny#maternity_nurse.2FNewborn_Care_Specialists.2FConfinement_Nanny|specialist sorts of nannies]]. A modern version of this rest period has evolved, to give maximum support to the new mother, especially if she is recovering from a difficult labour and delivery. It is especially popular in China and its diaspora, where [[postpartum confinement]] is known as "sitting the month".

==History==
{{See also|Midwifery#History of midwifery|History of midwifery}}
From long ago, the delivery of children and care of the mothers was a profession often handed down from mother to daughter, with the daughter spending many years as the pupil or apprentice. The Church supported that by a system of licensing, which required midwives to swear to certain rules relating to contraception, abortion and concealment of births and also to deliver the [[infant baptism|newborn infants for baptism]] or, in extreme cases, to perform the ceremony themselves.

In the mid-18th century the legal status of midwives was withdrawn and the responsibility for delivery was vested in the surgeon. The work of the nurse element had to be covered, as "who was to look after the baby?" Clearly, the first thought that would naturally occur to a mother was that the best person to look after her baby was a woman who had had one herself. Often, the task was allotted to motherly or grandmotherly hands and, from that requirement for postnatal care, the monthly nurse originated. [[The British Journal of Nursing|''The Nursing Record'']] reported that "there was little or no attempt at knowledge or instruction, and we know as a fact that ignorance, prejudice and neglect resulted in a goodly crop of errors, wrongs, and woes as regards the hapless infant".

The term "monthly nurse" is one that is frequently used to describe the nurse who cares for lying-in cases, certainly because such a nurse frequently remains with the patient for four weeks. The term "monthly" is somewhat inaccurate, as there is no reason for the nurse's services to be dispensed with after ten days or retained for much longer, but it is entirely a matter of arrangement.

''The Nursing Record'' reported that "nurses who attend the 'artisan' classes in their confinements as a rule pay a visit daily for ten days and then give up the case, as few working class mothers can afford to lie up for longer".

A monthly nurse could earn more than a midwife, as the monthly nurse was employed for periods between 10 days and often much longer and might attend several women on a part time basis. She often "lived in". The midwife's only duty was perceived as "being trained to assist the parturient woman while nature does her own work and able to call upon a surgeon who could step in where nature fails and skill and science are required". Many certified midwives transferred to the ranks of monthly nurses to benefit from an increased income.

==Certification==
Although 'registration' was not available for women to act as midwives or monthly nurses a system of 'certification' was in being in the late 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. To qualify, a candidate monthly nurse would attend a course in a lying-in hospital for four or five weeks and a midwife for up to three months. The prospective midwives and monthly nurses, as a rule, paid their own charges in respect of hospital expenses and then entered practice on their own responsibility. In 1893, a Miss Gosling reported that "although the certificated monthly nurse could be relied upon as being trustworthy and efficient, there were a number of women who attend lectures for a short time and through one cause or another fail to pass their examination and obtain a certificate nevertheless enter a 'Nurses Home' or open one for themselves".

As might be expected rogue institutions issued certificates and diplomas “for a price”. Another that reporting on a lying in hospital and signed herself a ‘victim of the system’ said that she “witnessed the first phase of the system which turns out yearly hundreds of midwives and monthly nurses on an unsuspecting public. These would be nurses represented almost every grade of the lower classes and every degree of lack of education, and one woman, I remember could not write.  Personally I found many to be dishonest, untruthful, indescribably dirty in their habits and persons, utterly unprincipled, shockingly coarse and deficient intelligence, and with not the faintest idea of discipline”’

==Reform and the 1902 Act==
In the late 19th century, reformers were calling not only for registration and recognition of the profession of midwife but also for the two functions of midwife and monthly nurse to be amalgamated: "The work of midwives lies, for the most part, amongst the poor and the poor lying-in woman needs not only to be delivered, but to be visited for some ten days subsequent to her confinement". The registration of midwives was opposed by members of the House of Lords and Parliament for many years, who argued that the delivery of infants was the responsibility of trained doctors and to allow women to do the job, even in straightforward cases, would take away doctors' income. It was not until the [[Midwives Act 1902]], following 12 years of representation by women, that midwives were "registered", but it would still take several years for it to be accepted. The professional training and formal qualification of midwives, and eventually, the postnatal care offered by the [[National Health Service]], saw the end of the monthly nurse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5815">'''NHS health checks''' are available to people in England between the ages of 40 and 74. The health check consist of an appointment with a healthcare professional at which people are asked about their family history and lifestyle and have their [[body mass index]], [[blood pressure]], and [[cholesterol]] concentration measured. Further investigations may then follow.

In January 2008, the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, announced “everyone in England will have access to the right preventative health check-up . . . there will soon be check-ups on offer to monitor for heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and kidney disease.” He also pledged a national screening committee, an independent clinical body, that “will look at the evidence and advise on what additional screening procedures would be genuinely useful in detecting other conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In full: Brown speech on the NHS|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7175083.stm|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every local authority in England is obliged to secure the provision of health checks to be offered to eligible persons (aged from 40 to 74 years) in its area.

The programme of health checks has been criticised as being without evidence of effectiveness by Dr Margaret McCartney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Too Much Medicine Where’s the evidence for NHS health checks?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5834.full?ijkey=Dpz11D0lz404W7L&amp;keytype=ref|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=British Medical Journal|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the [[UK National Screening Committee]] is reported as saying “There are certainly some aspects of the programme that look and feel like screening. However it is not run as a systematic ‘call-recall’ programme nor does it have quality assurance".  John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said he has “grave reservations” about health checks. “We are not convinced about the evidence base. There is a danger of medicalising social inequalities—in many ways health checks could be seen as playing into the pharmaceutical agenda. We should be focusing on disadvantaged communities—not finding more worried well.”

In September 2014 Professor [[Kevin Fenton]], head of health and wellbeing at [[Public Health England]], claimed the programme was being run on sound principles and rejected calls from to change track and focus on more opportunistic checking in people known to be at high risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS Health Checks programme ‘evidence based’, public health chief insists|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/therapy-areas/cardiovascular/nhs-health-checks-programme-evidence-based-public-health-chief-insists/20007914.article|accessdate=18 September 2014|publisher=Pulse|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the [[British Journal of General Practice]] found no significant differences in the change to the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, Chronic Heart Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease or Atrial Fibrillation in GP practices providing NHS Health Checks compared with control practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caley|first1=Michael|last2=Chohan|first2=Paradip|last3=Hooper|first3=James|last4=Wright|first4=Nicola|title=The impact of NHS Health Checks on the prevalence of disease in general practices: a controlled study|url=http://bjgp.org/content/64/625/e516.abstract|accessdate=18 September 2014|issue=Vol 64 no 625|publisher=British Journal of General Practice,|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Walsh, deputy director of the Strategy Group at [[NHS England]] admitted that take-up of the checks was poor in January 2016, after a study showed that  20% of those eligible aged 60-74 attended and 9.0% of those between 40–59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Take up of health checks are “not strong, to put it mildly”|url=http://www.nursinginpractice.com/article/take-health-checks-are-“not-strong-put-it-mildly”|accessdate=6 April 2016|publisher=Nursing in practice|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 researchers from [[Imperial College]] London concluded that the checkup reduced the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease by 0.21%, equivalent to one stroke or heart attack avoided every year for 4,762 people who attend. The programme cost £165 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS "mid-life MOT" has marginal health benefits, say researchers|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_2-5-2016-21-47-25|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Imperial College|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A retrospective observational study by the Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London found that take up in an ethnically diverse and socially deprived area of East London had increased from 7.3% of eligible patients in 2009 to 85.0% in
2013–2014.  New diagnoses of diabetes were 30% more likely in attendees than nonattendees, hypertension 50%, and Chronic Kidney Disease 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robson|first1=John|last2=Dostal|first2=Isabel|last3=Madurasinghe|first3=Vichithranie|last4=Sheikh|first4=Aziz|last5=Hull|first5=Sally|last6=Boomla|first6=Kambiz|last7=Griffiths|first7=Chris|last8=Eldridge|first8=Sandra|title=NHS Health Check comorbidity and management: an observational matched study in primary care|journal=British Journal of General Practice,|date=2016|issue=Online first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1989 the organisation came under scrutiny from the research team of [[Marianne Heiberg]] from [[Norwegian Institute of International Affairs|NUPI]] as part of a broad investigation of aid organisations funded by public allocations. The organisation was criticised for minimal-to-none developmental effects, lack of understanding of local needs, lack of control mechanisms and unprofessional management. NORWAC was also criticised for supporting fringe factions in Palestinian politics, and concluded that it did not meet the most elementary requirements for an aid organisation, in particular due to its "sectarian" work and taking political concerns. The report recommended to [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|NORAD]] to stop all public allocations to the organisation.&lt;ref name="UiO"/&gt; NORWAC was also scrutinised during a subsequent investigation of funds allocated by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="UiO"/&gt;

During the conflicts in Gaza in 2009 and 2014, Gilbert and Fosse were accused in Norway and abroad of facilitating propaganda by [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gaza-legene tilbakeviser kritikken|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/gaza-legene-tilbakeviser-kritikken-1.6428894|work=NRK|date=12 January 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=- Har aldri vært spesielt god i noe som helst|url=http://www.p4.no/story.aspx?id=298592|work=P4|date=19 January 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work at the [[Al-Shifa Hospital]] has been particularly noted amid allegations of the hospital's [[Al-Shifa Hospital#Allegations of use as Hamas bunker|use as a Hamas headquarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=– Ikke tvil om hvor nær Gilbert er Hamas |url=http://www.itromso.no/nyheter/article9944747.ece|work=iTromsø|date=22 July 2014|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Gilbert was banned indefinitely from entering Gaza through [[Israel]], officially for "security reasons", but according to intelligence sources because there had been revealed "close ties" between Gilbert and Hamas-leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Derfor er Gilbert svartelistet av Israel|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/midtoesten/derfor-er-gilbert-svartelistet-av-israel/a/23340800/|work=VG|date=21 November 2014|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=– Har tett kontakt med Hamas-topper |url=http://www.dagen.no/Nyheter/utestengt-fra-GAZA/%E2%80%93-Har-tett-kontakt-med-Hamas-topper-138725|work=Dagen|date=22 November 2014|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 it was reported that a hospital run by NORWAC in Syria in the town [[Tell Abyad]] treated wounded soldiers from terrorist organisation [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). Since 2013, when the hospital started being funded through NORWAC by Norwegian public aid, it was reported that ISIL had taken full control of the hospital and the surrounding area. According to both Arab and Kurdish sources, the hospital had become reserved entirely for ISIL soldiers and supporters. Erik Fosse rejected the latter reports, while admitting that the hospital treated ISIL jihadists.&lt;ref name="NRK"/&gt; After subsequent investigations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that ISIL had enforced religious rules at the hospital, including rituals for prayer, gender segregation and regulations on clothing, Foreign Minister [[Børge Brende]] cancelled all financial support directed to the hospital. While conforming to the decision, Fosse and NORWAC continued to deny that there were any enforcements by ISIL at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/syria/ud-stanser-stoette-til-norsk-sykehus-i-syria/a/23354114/ "UD stanser støtte til «norsk» sykehus i Syria"], ''VG'', 11.12.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">In educational statistics, a '''normal curve equivalent (NCE)''', developed for the [[United States Department of Education]] by the [[RMC Research Corporation]],&lt;ref name="Mertler"&gt;Mertler, C. A. (2002). ''Using standardized test data to guide instruction and intervention.'' College Park, MD: ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation. ([http://www.eric.ed.gov/ ERIC Document Reproduction Service] No. ED470589) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Normal curve equivalent (NCE): A normalized standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 21.06 resulting in a near equal interval scale from 0 to 99. The NCE was developed by RMC Research Corporation in 1976 to measure the effectiveness of the Title I Program across the United States and is often used to measure gains over time. (p. 3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a way of standardizing scores received on a test into a 0-100 scale similar to a percentile-rank, but preserving the valuable equal-interval properties of a z-score.  It is defined as:

: 50 + 49/qnorm(.99) × ''z''
or, approximately
: 50 + 21.063 × ''z'',

where ''z'' is the [[standard score]] or "z-score", i.e. ''z'' is how many [[standard deviation]]s above the mean the raw score is (''z''&amp;nbsp;is negative if the raw score is below the mean).  The reason for the choice of the number 21.06 is to bring about the following result: If the scores are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] (i.e. they follow the "bell-shaped curve") then
* the normal equivalent score is 99 if the [[percentile rank]] of the raw score is&amp;nbsp;99; 
* the normal equivalent score is 50 if the percentile rank of the raw score is&amp;nbsp;50;
* the normal equivalent score is 1 if the percentile rank of the raw score is&amp;nbsp;1.

This relationship between normal equivalent scores and percentile ranks does not hold at values other than 1,&amp;nbsp;50,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;99.  It also fails to hold in general if scores are not normally distributed.

The number 21.06 was chosen because
* It is desired that a score of 99 correspond to the 99th percentile;
* The 99th percentile in a [[normal distribution]] is 2.3263 standard deviations above the mean;
* 99 is 49 more than 50&amp;mdash;thus 49 points above the mean;
* 49/2.3263&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21.06.
&lt;!--
It is a measurement of where a student falls on a [[Normal distribution|normal curve]], indicating a student's rank compared to other students on the same test.&lt;ref name="roc"&gt;[http://www.rochesterschools.com/Webmaster/StaffHelp/rdgstudy/nce.html Rochester School Department] webpage&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Normal curve equivalents are on an [[Level of measurement#Ratio measurement|equal-interval scale]] (see [http://www.rochesterschools.com/Webmaster/StaffHelp/rdgstudy/ncurve2.gif] and [http://www.citrus.kcusd.com/gif/bellcurve.gif] for examples). This is advantageous compared to [[percentile rank]] scales, which suffer from the problem that the difference between any two scores is not the same as that between any other two scores (see below or [[percentile rank]] for more information).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="roc"/&gt; --&gt; 

The major advantage of NCEs over percentile ranks is that NCEs can be legitimately averaged.&lt;ref name="roc"&gt;[http://www.rochesterschools.com/Webmaster/StaffHelp/rdgstudy/nce.html Rochester School Department] webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caution==
Careful consideration is required when computing [[effect sizes]] using NCEs. NCEs differ from other scores, such as raw and scaled scores, in the magnitude of the effect sizes. Comparison of NCEs typically results in smaller effect sizes, and using the typical ranges for other effect sizes may result in interpretation errors.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, J. E., O'Neal, M. R., &amp; Barnette, J. J. (2000, November). ''Are all effect sizes created equal?'' Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Mid-South Educational Research Association, Bowling Green, KY. ([http://www.eric.ed.gov/ ERIC Document Reproduction Service] No. ED448188)&lt;/ref&gt;

Excel formula for conversion from Percentile to NCE:
: =21.06*NORMSINV(PR/100)+50, where PR is the percentile value.

Excel formula for conversion from NCE to Percentile:

: =100*NORMSDIST((NCE-50)/21.06), where NCE is the Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) value

An '''opportunistic infection''' is an [[infection]] caused by [[pathogen]]s ([[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[protozoa]]) that take advantage of an opportunity not normally available, such as a host with a [[immunodeficiency|weakened immune system]], an altered [[microbiota]] (such as a disrupted [[gut flora|gut microbiota]]), or breached [[integumentary system|integumentary]] barriers. Many of these pathogens do not cause disease in a healthy host that has a normal immune system. However, a compromised immune system, which is seriously debilitated and has lowered resistance to infection, a [[penetrating trauma|penetrating injury]], or a lack of competition from normal [[commensalism|commensals]] presents an opportunity for the pathogen to infect.

== Causes ==
[[Immunodeficiency]] or [[immunosuppression]] can be caused by:
* [[Malnutrition]]
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]
* Recurrent [[infection]]s
* [[Immunosuppressive drug|Immunosuppressing agents]] for [[organ transplant]] recipients
* Advanced [[HIV]] infection
* [[Chemotherapy]] for [[cancer]]
* [[genetics|Genetic]] predisposition
* [[Skin]] damage
* [[Antibiotic]] treatment leading to disruption of the physiological [[microbiome]], thus allowing some microorganisms to outcompete others and become [[pathogenic]] (e.g. disruption of [[intestinal flora|intestinal microbiota]] may lead to ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]'' infection
* Medical procedures
* Pregnancy {{further|Susceptibility and severity of infections in pregnancy}}
* [[Ageing]]
* [[Leukopenia]] (i.e. [[neutropenia]] and [[lymphocytopenia]])

The lack of or the disruption of [[List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women|normal vaginal microbiota]] allows the proliferation of [[List of bacterial vaginosis microbiota|opportunistic microorganisms]] and will cause the opportunistic infection - [[bacterial vaginosis]].&lt;ref name="AfricaNel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africa|first1=Charlene|last2=Nel|first2=Janske|last3=Stemmet|first3=Megan|title=Anaerobes and Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnancy: Virulence Factors Contributing to Vaginal Colonisation|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=11|issue=7|year=2014|pages=6979–7000|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph110706979|pmid=25014248|pmc=4113856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mastro2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastromarino|first1=Paola|last2=Vitali|first2=Beatrice|last3=Mosca|first3=Luciana|title=Bacterial vaginosis: a review on clinical trials with probiotics|url=http://www.newmicrobiologica.org/PUB/allegati_pdf/2013/3/229.pdf|journal=New Microbiologica|date=2013|volume=36|issue=3|pages=229–238|pmid=23912864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastromarino|first1=Paola|last2=Vitali|first2=Beatrice|last3=Mosca|first3=Luciana|title=Bacterial vaginosis: a review on clinical trials with probiotics|url=http://www.newmicrobiologica.org/PUB/allegati_pdf/2013/3/229.pdf|journal=New Microbiologica|date=2013|volume=36|issue=3|pages=229–238|pmid=23912864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knoester|first1=M.|last2=Lashley|first2=L.

== Prophylaxis (Prevention) ==
Since opportunistic infections can cause severe disease, much emphasis is placed on measures to prevent infection. Such a strategy usually includes restoration of the immune system as soon as possible, avoiding exposures to infectious agents, and using antimicrobial medications ("prophylactic medications") directed against specific infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Schlossberg|title=Clinical Infectious Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meFwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA688|date=2015-04-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03891-2|pages=688–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration of immune system ===
* In patients with HIV, starting [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]] is especially important for restoration of the immune system and reduces the incidence of opportunistic infections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = AIDS-related opportunistic illnesses occurring after initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy: the Swiss HIV Cohort Study|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=10605973|journal = JAMA|date = Dec 15, 1999|access-date = 2015-05-09|issn = 0098-7484|pmid = 10605973|pages = 2220–2226|volume = 282|issue = 23|first = B.|last = Ledergerber|first2 = M.|last2 = Egger|first3 = V.|last3 = Erard|first4 = R.|last4 = Weber|first5 = B.|last5 = Hirschel|first6 = H.|last6 = Furrer|first7 = M.|last7 = Battegay|first8 = P.|last8 = Vernazza|first9 = E.|last9 = Bernasconi|doi=10.1001/jama.282.23.2220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = HIV-associated opportunistic infections--going, going, but not gone: the continued need for prevention and treatment guidelines|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19191648|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = Mar 1, 2009|access-date = 2015-05-09|issn = 1537-6591|pmid = 19191648|pages = 609–611|volume = 48|issue = 5|doi = 10.1086/596756|first = John T.|last = Brooks|first2 = Jonathan E.|last2 = Kaplan|first3 = King K.|last3 = Holmes|first4 = Constance|last4 = Benson|first5 = Alice|last5 = Pau|first6 = Henry|last6 = Masur}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In patients undergoing chemotherapy, completion of and recovery from treatment is the primary method for immune system restoration. In a select subset of high risk patients, [[Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF)]] can be used to aid immune system recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the infectious diseases society of america|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21258094|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = Feb 15, 2011|access-date = 2015-05-09|issn = 1537-6591|pmid = 21258094|pages = e56–93|volume = 52|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/cid/cir073|first = Alison G.|last = Freifeld|first2 = Eric J.|last2 = Bow|first3 = Kent A.|last3 = Sepkowitz|first4 = Michael J.|last4 = Boeckh|first5 = James I.|last5 = Ito|first6 = Craig A.|last6 = Mullen|first7 = Issam I.|last7 = Raad|first8 = Kenneth V.|last8 = Rolston|first9 = Jo-Anne H.|last9 = Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 2006 update of recommendations for the use of white blood cell growth factors: an evidence-based clinical practice guideline|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16682719|journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology|date = Jul 1, 2006|access-date = 2015-05-09|issn = 1527-7755|pmid = 16682719|pages = 3187–3205|volume = 24|issue = 19|doi = 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.4451|first = Thomas J.|last = Smith|first2 = James|last2 = Khatcheressian|first3 = Gary H.|last3 = Lyman|first4 = Howard|last4 = Ozer|first5 = James O.|last5 = Armitage|first6 = Lodovico|last6 = Balducci|first7 = Charles L.|last7 = Bennett|first8 = Scott B.|last8 = Cantor|first9 = Jeffrey|last9 = Crawford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious exposures to avoid ===
* Cat feces (e.g. cat litter): source of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', [[Bartonella|''Bartonella'' spp]].
* Eating undercooked meat or eggs, unpasteurized dairy products or juices
* Potential sources of tuberculosis (high risk healthcare facilities, regions with high rates of tuberculosis, patients with known tuberculosis)
* Contact with farm animals, especially those with diarrhea: source of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]''
* Soil/dust in areas where there is known [[histoplasmosis]], [[Coccidioidomycosis|coccidiomycosis]]
* Reptiles, chicks, ducklings: source of [[Salmonella|''Salmonella'' spp]].
* Unprotected sexual intercourse with individuals with known [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.  Any sex practice that might result in oral exposure to feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/4/adult-and-adolescent-oi-prevention-and-treatment-guidelines/362/appendix-a--preventing-exposure|title = AIDSinfo: Recommendations to Help HIV-infected Patients Avoid Exposure to, or Infection from, Opportunistic Pathogens|date = 5/7/2013|accessdate = 2015-05-09|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prophylactic medications ===
Individuals at higher risk are often prescribed prophylactic medication to prevent an infection from occurring.  A patient's risk level for developing an opportunistic infection is approximated using the patient's [[CD4|CD4 T-cell count]] and sometimes other markers of susceptibility.  Common prophylaxis treatments include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adult_oi.pdf|title = AIDSinfo: Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents|date = 2013-06-17|accessdate = 2015-05-09|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the type of opportunistic infection, but usually involves different [[antibiotic]]s.

==Veterinary treatment==
Opportunistic infections caused by [[Feline Leukemia Virus]] and [[Feline immunodeficiency virus]] [[retroviral]] infections can be treated with [[Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator]].

'''Pre-crime''' (or '''precrime''') is a term coined by science fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]]. It is increasingly used in academic literature to describe and criticise the tendency in [[criminal justice]] systems to focus on crimes not yet committed. Pre-crime has been defined as "substantive coercive state interventions targeted at non-imminent crimes".{{cite quote|date=February 2018|reason=All quotations must be cited directly an inline. If this is also from McCulloch and Wilson 2016, and additional citation for it has to go right here.}} Pre-crime intervenes to punish, disrupt, incapacitate or restrict those deemed to embody future crime threats. The term pre-crime embodies a temporal paradox, suggesting both that a crime has not occurred and that the crime that has not occurred is a foregone conclusion (McCulloch and Wilson 2016).

==Origins of the concept==
[[George Orwell]] introduced a similar concept in his 1948 novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' using the term [[thoughtcrime]] to describe illegal thoughts which held banned opinions about the ruling government or intentions to act against it.  A large part of how it differs from pre-crime is in its absolute prohibition of anti-authority ideas and emotions, regardless of the consideration of any physical revolutionary acts.  However, Orwell was describing behaviour he saw in governments of his day as well as extrapolating on that behaviour, and so his ideas were themselves rooted in real political history and current events.

In Philip K. Dick's 1956 [[science fiction]] short story "[[The Minority Report]]", Precrime is the name of a criminal justice agency, the task of which is to identify and eliminate persons who will commit crimes in the future. The agency’s work is based on the existence of "precog mutants", a trio of "vegetable-like" humans whose "every incoherent utterance" is analyzed by a [[punch card]] computer. As Anderton, the chief of the Precrime agency, explains the advantages of this procedure: "in our society we have no major crimes ... but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals". He cautions about the basic legal drawback to pre-crime methodology: "We’re taking in individuals who have broken no law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last1 = Dick
| first = Philip K.
| year = 2002
| title = Minority Report
| location = London
| pages = 1–43
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was brought to wider public attention by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film [[Minority Report (2002 film)|''Minority Report'']], loosely adapted from the story.

==In criminological theory==
Pre-crime in criminology dates back to the positivist school in the late 19th century, especially to [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s idea that there are "born criminals", who can be recognized, even before they have committed any crime, on the basis of certain physical characteristics. Biological, psychological and sociological forms of criminological positivisms informed criminal policy in the early 20th century. For born criminals, criminal psychopaths and dangerous habitual offenders eliminatory penalties (capital punishment, indefinite confinement, castration etc.) were seen as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Radzinowicz]] and Roger Hood: ''A History of English Criminal Law and its Administration from 1750'' (1986), London:  Sweet &amp; Maxwell; pp.&amp;nbsp;231–387.{{clarify|date=February 2018|reason=What volume? There are at least 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas were advocated by the Social Defense movement and, more recently, by what is seen and criticized as an emerging "new criminology" (Feeley &amp; [[Jonathan Simon|Simon]] 1992) or "[[actuary science|actuary justice]]" (Feeley &amp; Simon 1994). The new "pre-crime" or "security society" requires a radically new criminology (Fitzgibbon 2004; [[Lucia Zedner|Zedner]] 2007; Zedner 2009; Zedner 2010; Zedner 2014).

==Testing for pre-delinquency==
[[Richard Nixon]]'s psychiatrist, [[Arnold Hutschnecker]], suggested, in a memorandum to the then president, to run mass tests of "pre-delinquency" and put those juveniles in "camps". Hutschnecker, a refugee from Nazi Germany and a vocal critic of Hitler at the time of his exodus,&lt;ref name=hutschneckerobit&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Goode | first1 = Erica | title = Arnold Hutschnecker, 102, Therapist to Nixon | newspaper = New York Times | date = 3 January 2001 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/opinion/l-nixon-era-plan-for-children-didn-t-include-concentration-camps-652188.html | accessdate = 24 Feb 2014 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; has rejected the interpretation of the memorandum that he advocated concentration camps:
{{Quote|It was the term ''camp'' that was distorted. My use of it dates back to when I came to the United States in 1936 and spent the summer as a doctor in a children's camp. It was that experience and the pastoral setting, as well as the activities, that prompted my use of the word "camp."|Hutschnecker, Arnold|"Nixon-Era Plan for Children Didn't Include Concentration Camps", Letter to the Editor, ''New York Times'', 1998&lt;ref&gt;

    }}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In criminal justice practice==
Frontline of a criminal justice system increasingly preoccupied with anticipating threats' and is the antithesis of the traditional criminal justice systems focus on past crimes (McCulloch and Wilson 2016). Traditionally, [[criminal justice]] and punishment presupposes [[Evidence (law)|evidence of a crime being committed]]. This time-honored principle is violated once punishment is meted out "for crimes never committed" (Anttila 1975, who criticised the measure of security detention). Today, a clear example of this trend is "nachträgliche Sicherungsverwahrung" (retrospective security detention), which became an option in German criminal law in 2004. This "measure of security" can be decided upon at the end of a prison sentence on a purely [[prognosis|prognostic]] basis (Boetticher/Feest 2008, 263 sq.). In France, a similarly retrospective measure was introduced in 2008 as "rétention de sûreté"  (security detention). The German measure was viewed as violating the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2009. It was, however, never completely abolished in Germany and new legislation is envisaged to continue this practice under the new name "Therapieunterbringung" (detention for therapy).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. A similar provision for indefinite [[administrative detention]] was found in [[Judicial system of Finland|Finnish law]], but it was not enforced after mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://plus.edilex.fi/stuklex/fi/he/20040262&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-crime is most obvious and advanced in the context of counter-terrorism, though it is argued that far from countering terrorism, pre-crime produces the futures it purports to preempt (McCulloch/Pickering 2009).

[[File:Swanger vrou2.jpg|thumb|Pregnancy.]]

Nutrition and [[weight management]] before and during [[:pregnancy]] has a profound effect on the development of [[infants]]. This is a rather critical time for healthy fetal development as infants rely heavily on maternal stores and nutrient for optimal growth and health outcome later in life.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; '''Prenatal nutrition''' addresses nutrient recommendations before and during pregnancy. Prenatal nutrition has a strong influence on [[birth weight]] and further development of the infant. There was a study at the National Institution of Health which found that babies born from an obese mother have a higher probability to fail tests of fine motor skills which is the movement of small muscles such as the hands and fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parent obesity linked to delays in child development, NIH study suggest|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/parental-obesity-linked-delays-child-development-nih-study-suggests|website=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common saying that 'a woman is eating for two while pregnant' implies that a mother should consume twice as much during pregnancy. However, in reality, this is not true. Although maternal consumption will directly affect both herself and the growing [[fetus]], overeating excessively will compromise the baby's health as the infant will have to work extra hard to become healthy in the future. Compared with the infant, the mother possesses the least biological risk. Therefore, excessive calories, rather than going to the infant, often get stored as fat in the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Leon|first=Victoria|title=Weight Problems During Pregnancy and the Effect on Your Baby|url=http://www.toloseweightafterpregnancy.com/losing-pregnancy-weight-weight-problems-during-pregnancy-and-the-effect-on-your-baby/|work=Losing Pregnancy Weight|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, insufficient consumption will result in lower birth weight.

Maintaining a healthy weight during [[gestation]] lowers adverse risks on infants such as [[birth defects]], as well as chronic conditions in adulthood such as [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD).&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; Ideally, the rate of weight gain should be monitored during pregnancy to support the most ideal infant development.&lt;ref name="Draft"/&gt;

==Background==

===Barker's hypothesis – influences of birth weight on health in later life===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:PregnancyAnatomicalModel.jpg|thumb|Anatomical pregnant model. {{pufc|PregnancyAnatomicalModel.jpg}}]] --&gt;
The "Barker Hypothesis", or [[Thrifty phenotype]], states that conditions during pregnancy will have long-term effects on adult health. Associated risk of lifelong diseases includes [[cardiovascular disease]], [[type-2 diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]].  Babies born lighter in weight appear to have an increased rate of mortality than babies born at a heavier weight.&lt;ref name="Bateson"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that heavy babies are less of a concern. Death rate would rise as birth weight increases beyond normal birth weight range.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy gestational weight gain throughout pregnancy for achieving the optimal infant birth weight.

When this theory was first proposed, it was not well accepted and was met with much skepticism.&lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;{{Cite journal

  | pmc=1731115}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The main criticism was that [[confounding]] variables such as environmental factors could attribute to many of the chronic diseases such that low birth weight alone should not be dictated as an independent risk factor.&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | last1 = Barker

  | id = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research studies supporting the theory attempted to adjust these environmental factors and in turn, provided more convincing results with minimal confounding variables.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;

"Barker's Hypothesis" is also known as "[[Foetal programming|Fetal Programming Hypothesis]]". The word "programming" illustrates the idea that during critical periods in early fetal development, there are persisting changes in the body structure and function that are caused by environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Byrne" /&gt; This relates to the concept of developmental plasticity where our genes can express different ranges of physiological or morphological states in response to the environmental conditions during fetal development.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;

If the mother has an inadequate diet then it signals the baby that the living condition in the long term will be impoverished.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; Consequently, the baby adapts by changing its body size and metabolism to prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; Physiological and metabolic processes in the body undergo long-term changes as a result of restricted growth.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; When the living environment switches from the condition of malnutrition to a society of abundant supply of nutrients, this exposes the baby to a bountiful environment that goes against what its body is designed for and this places the baby at a higher risk of adult diseases later in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; By the same token, if the fetus growing in the womb of a healthy mother is exposed to prolonged famine after birth, the infant would be less adaptive to the harsh environment than low-birth-weight babies.&lt;ref name="Bateson" /&gt;

===Pedersen's hypothesis – influences of maternal glucose concentration on fetal growth===
In 1952 the Danish physician [[Jørgen Pedersen]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]], formulated the hypothesis that maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy might cause fetal [[hyperglycemia]], thus exposing the fetus to elevated insulin levels. This would result in an increased risk of fetal macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diabetes-deutschland.de/archiv/archiv_5528.htm Erhöhte Blutzuckerwerte bei Schwangeren gefährden das Kind ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blood glucose]] concentration in humans is mainly dependent on [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], especially energy-ingestion and the percentage of [[carbohydrate]]s in the diet. High glucose concentrations in the blood of pregnant women cause an intensified transfer of nutrient to the fetus, increasing fetal growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00276845 The influence of maternal glucose metabolism on fetal growth, development and morbidity in 917 singleton pregnancies in nondiabetic women]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies could link higher maternal glucose to an increase in infant birth weight as well as different extents of morbidity, among other things the incidence of congenital malformations, supporting the Hypothesis, that even moderately increased blood glucose in the absence of diabetes positively influences growth in the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/6/514.full Maternal Glucose Concentration Influences Fetal Growth, Gestation, and Pregnancy Complications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3402161 | volume=6 | title=The extended Pedersen hypothesis | year=1988 | journal=Clin Physiol Biochem | pages=68–73 | author=Macfarlane CM, Tsakalakos N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently alterations of Pedersen's Hypothesis took place: [[Nutrient]]s other than sugar and their linkage to fetal overgrowth in [[diabetic]] pregnancy were taken into account, too, but the crucial role of the fetal [[hyperinsulinism]] and monitoring of motherly glucose was nevertheless stressed. Recent studies pointed out that diabetes in the mother could foster even more lasting effects on the child's health than previously thought, even raising the risk of [[obesity]] and [[type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/58/2/302.full Maternal Glycemia and Neonatal Adiposity: New Insights from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical cases==

Various nutritional conditions, both times of [[List of famines|scarcity]] and of [[Healthy diet|abundance]] occurred time and again in different societies at different times, and thus in some cases epidemiological studies have exposed a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the nutritional status of pregnant women and the health of their children or even grandchildren.

===The dutch famine===

Since small birth weight is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases in later life, and poor maternal nutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal development, maternal malnutrition may be a cause of increased disease susceptibility in adulthood.

The [[Dutch famine of 1944]] or the "Hunger Winter" during [[World War II]] serves as an [[epidemiological study]] that is used to examine the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. The famine was a period (roughly five to six months) of extreme food shortage in the west of Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt; The famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population and the official daily [[ration]] for the general adult population gradually decreased from 1800 calories in December 1943 to 1400 calories in October 1944 to below 1000 calories in the late November 1944.&lt;ref name="Nestle"&gt;{{Cite book

The Dutch Famine during World War II had a profound effect on the health condition of the general public, especially women who conceived during the period of time. The period of maternal starvation is shown to have limited intrauterine growth and has been identified as one of the most important contributors to [[coronary heart disease]] as well as other chronic diseases later in life.&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt; These findings agree well with Barker's hypothesis; it supports the theory that maternal under-nutrition leads to a lower birth weight due to restricted intrauterine development and ultimately leads to higher risks of chronic conditions in adult life.

===The french paradox===

The [[French paradox]] regards the seemingly paradoxical fact that people living in France since many generations suffer from a relatively little incidence of [[heart disease]], although the traditional [[French cuisine]] is [[List of French cheeses|high in saturated fatty acids]].

One explanation suggested for the paradox is the potential impact of nutritional enhancements during pregnancy and the first months and years of life that would positively influence the health of following generations: After the defeat in the [[War of 1870|Franco-German War]], a nutrition program for pregnant women and small children with the aim of strengthening future generations of soldiers was introduced by the French Government. This might be one explanation for positive health-outcomes in following generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/354711.stm BBC News: Health French health mystery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ht926VJgWu8C&amp;pg=PT53&amp;lpg=PT53&amp;dq=french+paradox+Franco-Prussian+War+pregnancy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ltZhkLoF-c&amp;sig=48rgThHOvI7VHy-hXn3V8ITq0x8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xw6jVJjyOYHqUqqNg4AB&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20paradox%20Franco-Prussian%20War%20pregnancy&amp;f=false Size Matters: How Height Affects the Health, Happiness, and Success of Boys]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations for pregnant women==

===Gestation stages===
[[Gestation]] is the period of embryo development from [[Fertilisation|conception]] to birth.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; Gestation is about 40 weeks in humans and is divided into three [[trimesters]], each spanning 3 months.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; Gestational stages, on the other hand, are based on physiological fetal development, which include [[blastogenesis]], embryonic stage and fetal stage.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;

'''Blastogenesis''' is the stage from fertilization to about 2 weeks. The fertilized egg or the zygote becomes a blastocyst where the outer layer and the inner cell mass differentiate to form placenta and the fetus respectively. [[Implantation (human embryo)|Implantation]] occurs at this stage where the blastocyst becomes buried in the [[endometrium]].&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embryonic stage''' is approximately from 2 weeks to 8 weeks. It is also in this stage where the blastocyst develops into an [[embryo]], where all major features of human are present and operational by the end of this stage.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;

'''Fetal stage''' is from 9 weeks to term. During this period of time, the embryo develops rapidly and becomes a [[fetus]]. Pregnancy becomes visible at this stage.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gain===

[[File:Body mass index chart.svg|left|thumb|[[Body mass index|BMI]] chart.]]
The pattern and amount of weight gain is closely associated with gestational stages.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; Additional energy is required during pregnancy due to the expansion of maternal tissues and stores in order to support fetal development.

In the [[first trimester]] (blastogenesis and early embryonic stages), the mother experiences a minimal weight gain (approximately 0.5-2 kilograms), while the [[embryo]] weighs only 6&amp;nbsp;grams, which is approximately the weight of 6 raisins.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;

In the [[second trimester]] and [[third trimester]] (late embryonic and fetal stages), the fetus undergoes rapid weight growth and the weight increases to about 3000~4000&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; It is also in this period that the mother experiences the bulk of her gestational weight gain but the amount of weight gain varies greatly.  The amount of weight gain depends strongly on their pre-pregnant weight.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

Generally, a normal weight is strongly recommended for mothers when entering gestation, as it promotes overall health of infants.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Maternal body weight is determined by the [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) which is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.&lt;ref name="BMI"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
While pregnant, body weight should be managed within the recommended gestational weight gain range as it is shown to have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational weight gain should also be progressive and the recommended weight depends on pre-pregnant body weight.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;

Since the total weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, it is recommended that underweight women should undergo a larger weight gain for healthy pregnancy outcomes, and overweight or obese women should undergo a smaller weight gain.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

====Normal weight women====
[[File:Milch-Jogurt-Früchte.jpg|thumb|Health choices such as low-fat milk and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables should be emphasized for pregnant women.]]
Women having a BMI of 18.5~24.9 are classified as having a ''normal or healthy'' body weight. This group have the lowest risk of adverse birth outcomes.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Their babies are least likely to either be low-birth weight or high-birth weight. It is advised that women with a normal weight before pregnancy should gain a total of 11.5 kilograms to 16.0 kilograms throughout gestation, which is approximately 0.4 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.&lt;ref name="Draft"&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 December 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain a steady weight gain, the mother should engage in mild physical activities. Participating in [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities such as walking and swimming 3 to 4 times a week is usually adequate.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Vigorous physical activity is not recommended since an excessive loss of calories is induced which is not sufficient to support fetal development.

A proper diet is also essential to healthy weight gain. The common saying "a woman is eating for two" often leads to mothers thinking that they should eat twice as much. In reality, only a small increase in caloric intake is needed to provide for the fetus; approximately 350 calories more in the second trimester and 450 calories more in the third trimester.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Also, healthy choices should be emphasized for these extra calories such as [[whole grain]] products, [[fruits]] and vegetables as well as low-fat dairy alternatives.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

====Underweight women====
Women are classified as ''underweight'' if they have a pre-pregnant BMI of 18.5 or below.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Low pre-pregnancy BMI increases the risk of low birth weight infants, but the risk can be balanced by an appropriate gestational weight gain from 12.5 to 18.0 kilograms in total, or about 0.5 kilogram each week in the second and third trimesters.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

Underweight women usually have inadequate nutrient stores that are not enough to provide for both herself and the fetus.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; While exercise and a proper diet are both needed to maintain the recommended weight gain, a balance between the two is very important. As such, underweight mothers should seek individualized advice tailored especially for themselves.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

====Overweight and obese women====
Women with a high pre-pregnancy weight are classified as ''overweight or obese'', defined as having a BMI of 25 or above.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Women with BMI between 25 and 29.9 are in the overweight category and should gain between 7.0 and 11.5 kilograms in total, corresponding to approximately 0.28 kilogram each week during the second and third trimesters.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Whereas women with BMI of 30 or above are in the obese category and should gain only between 5.0 and 9.0 kilograms overall, which equates to roughly 0.2 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

Diet, exercise or a combination of both has been seen to reduce weight gain in pregnancy by 20% and reduce high blood pressure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muktabhant|first1=B|last2=Lawrie|first2=TA|last3=Lumbiganon|first3=P|last4=Laopaiboon|first4=M|title=Diet or exercise, or both, for preventing excessive weight gain in pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=15 June 2015|volume=6|pages=CD007145|pmid=26068707|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007145.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diet with exercise may reduce the risk of caesarean section, having a large baby and having a baby with serious breathing problems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Diet and exercise help pregnant women not gain too much weight during pregnancy when compared with giving the women no help too control weight gain or routine care (usually one session in the pregnancy).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In general, walking is encouraged for mothers classified in this category.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Unfortunately, estimated energy requirements for them are not available.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; As such, they are encouraged to record activity and intake level. This can be done with the help of tools such as My Food Guide Servings Tracker from [[Health Canada]] and EATracker that are available online.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; In extreme cases where the BMI exceeds 35, help from a registered [[dietitian]] is recommended.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;

====Summary table====
The following table summarizes the recommended rate of weight gain and total weight gain according to pre-pregnancy BMI for singleton pregnancies. The first column categorizes the type of body weight based on the Body Mass Index. The second column summarizes the total recommended weight gain for each type of body weight, and the third column presents the corresponding weekly weight gain during the period when the fetus undergoes rapid growth (during second and third trimesters). In extreme cases, the amount of total and weekly weight gain can vary by a factor of two depending on a woman's pre-pregnant weight. For example, a woman in the obese category is recommended to gain a total of 5~9 kilograms, whereas an underweight woman needs to gain up to 18 kilograms in weight.

==Recommendations for low and high birth weight==

===Diagnosis===
[[File:Ultrasound image of a fetus.jpg|left|thumb|Ultrasound of fetus (~3 inches in length).]]
In order to have a good estimate of birth weight, [[ultrasonography]] or [[ultrasound]] during pregnancy and the date of last menstrual period are needed.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Measured values from ultrasonography are compared with the growth chart to estimate fetal weight.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt;

Crown-rump length can be used as the best ultrasonographic measurement for correct diagnosis of gestational age during the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; This correlation between crown-rump length and gestational age would be most effectively shown when no growth defects are observed in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; If growth defects were observed in the first trimester, then the measurement of the date of last menstrual period becomes quite important since the crown-heel length has become less of a reliable indicator of gestational age.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mother would need to visit the doctor for the measurement of [[fundal height]], which is the length from the top portion of the uterus to the pubic bone.&lt;ref name="Lucile"&gt;[http://www.lpch.org/DiseaseHealthInfo/HealthLibrary/hrnewborn/sga.html "Small for Gestational Age"], ''Lucile Packard Children's Hospital'', 2010. Retrieved 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The length measured in centimeters should correspond to the number of weeks that the mother has been pregnant.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; If the measured number is higher or lower than 2 centimetres, further tests using ultrasound would be needed to check the results.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; Another way to estimate fetal size is to look at the mother's weight gain.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; How much weight the mother gains can be used to indicate fetal size.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt;

===Low birth weight===
[[File:Birth weight chart 2.svg|thumb|Birth weight chart.]]
There are two ways to determine [[small for gestational age]] (SGA) infants. Many research studies agree that SGA babies are those with birth weight or crown-heel length measured at two [[standard deviations]] or more below the mean of the infant's gestational age, based on data consisting of a reference population.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Other studies classify SGA babies as those with birth weight values below the 10th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age.&lt;ref name="Merialdi"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that these babies are weighing less than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.

Many factors, including maternal, placental, and fetal factors, contribute to the cause of impaired fetal growth.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; There are a number of maternal factors, which include age, nutritional status, alcohol abuse, smoking, and medical conditions.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Insufficient uteroplacental perfusion is an example of a placental factor.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic diseases are examples of fetal factors.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;
Identification of the causes of SGA for individual cases aids health professionals in finding ways to handle each unique case.&lt;ref name="Gourley"&gt;Lisa Gourley, [http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-nutrition/4 "Prenatal Nutrition"], ''Healthline Networks, Inc.'', 2002. Retrieved 5 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Nutritional counseling, education, and consistent monitoring can be helpful to assist women bearing SGA infants.&lt;ref name="Gourley" /&gt;

Complications for the infant include limitations in body growth since the number and size of cells in tissues is smaller.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; The infant likely did not receive enough oxygen during pregnancy so the oxygen level is low.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; It is also more difficult to maintain body temperature since there is less blood flow within the small body.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt;

As such, it is necessary to monitor oxygen level to make sure that it doesn't go too low. If the baby can't suck well, then it may be necessary for tube-feed.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; Since the baby cannot maintain body temperature sufficiently, a temperature-controlled bed would help to keep their bodies from losing heat.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; There are ways to help prevent SGA babies. Monitoring fetal growth can help identify the problem during pregnancy well before birth.&lt;ref name="Lucile" /&gt; It would be beneficial to seek professional help and counseling.

===High birth weight===
[[File:Ultrasound examination of woman.JPG|thumb|Ultrasound examination.]]
Research shows that when birth weights of infants are greater than the 90th percentile of the [[growth chart]] for babies of the same gestational age, they are considered [[large for gestational age]] or LGA.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, [http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/23374/router.asp "Large for Gestational Age"], ''Children's Hospital and Health System'', 2010. Retrieved 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that these babies are weighing more than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt;

Many factors account for LGA babies, including [[genetics]] and excessive nutrient supply.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; It seems that a common factor for LGA babies is whether or not the mother has diabetes when she is pregnant.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; An indicator for excessive growth, regardless of gestational age, is the appearance of [[macrosomia]].&lt;ref name="BabyCenter"&gt;BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board, [http://www.babycenter.com/0_labor-complication-big-baby-macrosomia_1152319.bc "Labor complication: Big baby (macrosomia)"], ''BabyCenter, L.L.C.'', 2006. Retrieved 5 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many complications are observed for LGA babies and their mothers. A longer delivery time may be expected since it is a difficult birth.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; The infant would likely suffer hypoglycemia (low glucose level in the blood) after birth.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; The infant would also have difficulty breathing.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt;

There might be a need for early delivery if the baby gets too big and perhaps [[Caesarean section]] would be needed.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; Since the baby is bigger in size, there's a higher chance of injury when coming out of the mother's body.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; To increase the blood glucose level in blood, a glucose/water solution can be offered to the infant.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt;

There are ways to help prevent LGA babies. It is necessary to monitor fetal growth and perform pregnancy examinations to determine health status and detect any possibility of unrecognized diabetes.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt; For diabetic mothers, careful management of diabetes during pregnancy period would be helpful in terms of lowering some of the risks of LGA.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt;

==Points to consider==
The goal of pregnancy is to have a healthy baby. Maintaining healthy and steady weight gain during pregnancy promotes overall health and reduces the incidence of prenatal [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the baby's health.

Since conditions during pregnancy will have long-term effects on adult health, "moderation" should be taken into account for both dietary and physical activity recommendations. Most importantly, the total recommended pregnancy weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, and weight issues should be addressed before pregnancy.

==Future direction for research==
It is reasonable to expect higher weight gain for multiple gestations.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Recommendations for women carrying twins are given but more research should be done to precisely determine the total weight gain, as these ranges are wide.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Also, the ranges for underweight women carrying twins is unknown. There was not enough information to recommend weight gain cutoffs and guidelines for women carrying three or more babies, women of short stature (&lt;157 centimetres), and pregnant teens.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt; Estimated energy requirements (EER) for overweight/obese women are unavailable so more research is needed to evaluate on that.&lt;ref name="Draft" /&gt;
There are also important links between nutrition and mental health across pregnancy. For example, a women experiencing low mood may be more likely to smoke, use alcohol or neglect her diet&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/r&lt;Lewis, A. J., Galbally, M., Gannon T., Symeonides C., (2014) [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/33 Early life programming as a target for prevention of child and adolescent mental disorders: intervention and research directions. BMC Medicine: Special issue on Prevention of Mental Disorders]. 12:33 {{DOI|10.1186/1741-7015-12-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical advice for mothers==
The following general tips can be helpful to pregnant women. It would be beneficial to maintain adequate physical activity to meet energy needs from the food consumed.&lt;ref name="Health" /&gt; Eating a balanced diet would be optimal for healthy pregnancy results.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"&gt;Larissa Hirsch, [http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/preg_health.html?tracking=P_RelatedArticle# "Staying Healthy During Pregnancy"], ''The Nemours Foundation'', 2008. Retrieved 17 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent problems like dehydration and constipation, it is important to drink enough fluids, especially water, to support blood volume increases during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Ministry"&gt;Ministry of Health Promotion, [http://www.eatrightontario.ca/en/ViewDocument.aspx?id=72&amp;Topic=5&amp;Cat=162 "The Juicy Story on Drinks"], ''Queen's Printer for Ontario'', 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended to accompany regular meals with a daily prenatal vitamin supplement that has sufficient [[folic acid]] and iron content.&lt;ref name="Health" /&gt; 
  
If the fetus is predicted to have low birth weight, in addition to the general recommendations, it would be ideal to increase caloric intake, which can be done by having extra Food Guide Servings daily.&lt;ref name="Health" /&gt; 
If the fetus is predicted to have high birth weight, smaller and more frequent meals should be consumed to allow better weight management.&lt;ref name="Alberta" /&gt; Moderate sugar intake, such as fruit juices, is also suggested.&lt;ref name="Alberta"&gt;Alberta clinical experts, [http://www.capitalhealth.ca/EspeciallyFor/WeightWise/Prediabetes_Impaired_Glucose_Tolerance_Adults.htm "Prediabetes or Impaired Glucose Intolerance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202082454/http://www.capitalhealth.ca/EspeciallyFor/WeightWise/Prediabetes_Impaired_Glucose_Tolerance_Adults.htm |date=2 February 2010 }}, ''HealthLink Alberta'', 2008.

[[Professional sports|Professional]] [[sports league]]s are organized in numerous ways. The two most significant types are one that developed in Europe, characterised by a tiered structure using [[promotion and relegation]] to determine participation in a hierarchy of leagues or divisions, and a North American originated model characterized by its use of "franchises," closed memberships, and [[minor league]]s. Both these systems remain most common in their area of origin, although both systems are used worldwide.

==Etymology==
The term '''league''' has many different meanings in different areas around the world, and its use for different concepts can make comparisons confusing. Usually a league is a '''group of teams''' that play each other during the season. It is also often used for the name of the '''governing body''' that oversees the league, as in America's Major League Baseball or England's Football League. Because most European football clubs participate in different competitions during a season, regular-season home-and-away games are often referred to as '''league games''' and the others as '''non-league''' or '''cup''' games, even though the separate competitions may be organised by the same governing body. Also, there is a [[rugby football]] code called '''[[rugby league]]''', which is distinct from [[rugby union]].

==Structure of North American leagues (Franchise and minor league system)==
[[File:Map of Cities in the USA and Canada with MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL or NHL Teams.png|thumb|400px|All Cities in the US and Canada with at least one team in the MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL or NHL, 2018]]

{{see also|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Minor league}}
Professional sports leagues in North America comprise a stipulated number of clubs, known as franchises, which field one team each.&lt;ref&gt;Rader, Benjamin G.; 2002; Baseball:A History of America's Game; Second Edition; University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; 
The franchises have territorial rights, usually exclusive territories large enough to cover major metropolitan areas, so that they have no local rivals. New teams may enter the competition only by a vote of current members; typically, a new place is put up for bid by would-be owners. This system is often called a "franchise system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve James: The Twenty20 franchise system simply will not work|publisher=Daily Telegraph, London, UK |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/twenty20/7598735/Steve-James-The-Twenty20-franchise-system-simply-will-not-work.html | date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECB head dismissed talk of Twenty20 franchise system |publisher=Taipei Times, Taipei, Taiwan|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2008/05/01/2003410674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shropshire, Kenneth L. "The sports franchise game: Cities in pursuit of sports franchises, events, stadiums and arenas"&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in baseball with the formation of the [[National League]] in 1876&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Before 1876, baseball clubs joined the professional class (1869&amp;ndash;1870) or the [[NAPBBP|professional association]] by announcing their intentions and paying any required fees, an open system.&lt;/ref&gt; and later adopted by the other North American leagues.

Although member clubs are corporate entities separate from their leagues, they operate only under league auspices. Partly because that relationship is so close, and partly because the four major team sports leagues represent the top level of play in the world, North American teams almost never play competitive games against outside opponents, although [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams have played against European hockey and basketball teams in preseason exhibitions. The North American league, rather than any [[sport governing body]], determines the playing rules and scoring rules of its game, and the rules under which players join and change teams.

The teams are organized with a view to each major city having a team to support. Only the largest cities such as New York, Chicago or Los Angeles have more than one team. As such the teams are often referred to as franchises. Even though they are not technically franchises in a business sense, the league is organised in a way that assures teams continued existence in the league from year to year, which fosters an ongoing connection with the team's supporters. On occasion a league may decide to grow the sport by admitting a new [[expansion team]] into the league. Most of the teams in the four major North American pro sports leagues were created as part of a planned league expansion or through the merger of a rival league. Only a handful of teams in the [[National Hockey League]], for example, existed before becoming part of the NHL. The rest of the teams were created ''ex novo'' as [[expansion team]]s or as charter members of the [[World Hockey Association]], which merged with the NHL in 1979.

The best teams in a given season reach a [[playoff]] tournament, and the winner of the playoffs is crowned champion of the league, and, in some cases as world champions. American and Canadian sports leagues typically have such "playoff" systems. These have their roots in long travel distances common in US and Canadian sports; to cut down on travel, leagues are typically aligned in geographic divisions and feature unbalanced schedules with teams playing more matches against opponents in the same division. Due to the unbalanced schedule typical in US and Canadian leagues, not all teams face the same opponents, and some teams may not meet during a regular season at all. This results in teams with identical records that have faced different opponents differing numbers of times, making team records alone an imperfect measure of league supremacy. The playoffs allow for head-to-head elimination-style competition between teams to counterbalance this.

[[Major League Soccer]] is a North American league that exhibits some aspects of the European structure because soccer has a European rather than American origin. Major League Soccer is technically not an association of franchises but a single business entity, though each team has an owner-operator; the team owners are actually shareholders in the league. The league, not the individual teams, contracts with the players. Unlike teams in the four major sports, several Major League Soccer teams qualify to play competitive matches in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]] against teams from outside the U.S. and Canada, and MLS uses playing rules set by the international governing body of its sport. MLS followed its own playing rules until 2004, when it adopted [[FIFA]] rules. In another parallel with the European model, both the U.S. and Canada have separate knockout cup competitions during the MLS season that include teams from lower leagues. In the U.S., the [[U.S. Open Cup|Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] has had MLS participation from the league's inception; since the [[2012 U.S. Open Cup|2012 cup]], each competition has featured all American-based MLS sides. Similarly, all of Canada's MLS teams compete in the [[Canadian Championship]]. However, the league structure of MLS follows the North American model, with a single premier league and no promotion or relegation.

[[Major League Rugby]], which began play in 2018 as the second attempt to launch a professional [[rugby union]] league in the U.S., has a business structure identical to that of MLS—it is a single business entity, with each team owner-operator being a league shareholder, and all player contracts are held by the league. Also similar to MLS, MLR uses playing rules set by its sport's international governing body. However, MLR teams do not play competitive matches against teams from other leagues, and there is currently no cup competition in U.S. rugby similar to soccer's U.S. Open Cup. The MLR league structure also follows the North American model of one premier league without promotion or relegation.

A more rarely seen business model in North America is the pure single-[[entity]] league, typified by the now-defunct [[XFL]]. In the pure single-entity model, there are no individual owners or investors, with all teams centrally owned by a single corporation and operated by league employees. Many upstart leagues begin their existence as pure single-entity leagues before they secure investors for teams (such as the [[National Women's Hockey League (2015)|NWHL]]) or are forced to operate in the pure single-entity model when investors fail to materialize (such as the [[Stars Football League]]).

Some other North American systems also have a hierarchical structure but without the [[promotion and relegation]] of clubs exhibited in the European model. Instead, the sports leagues generally use a [[minor league]] system. For example, [[Major League Baseball]] has an affiliation with [[Minor League Baseball]] to develop young talent. Most minor league clubs are independently owned, but each one contracts with a major league club that hires and pays players and assigns them to its various affiliated clubs. The minor clubs do not move up or down in the hierarchy by on-field success or failure. Professional [[ice hockey]] has a system somewhat similar to baseball's (without as many levels), while the [[National Basketball Association]] operates a single [[NBA G League|developmental league]]. The [[National Football League]] does not have a minor league system as of 2011 but it has operated or affiliated with minor leagues in the [[American Association (football)|1930s]], [[Association of Professional Football Leagues|1940s]], [[Atlantic Coast Football League|1960s]], [[World League of American Football|1990s]], and [[NFL Europe|the early 2000s]] and invested in another in [[Arena Football League|the late 2000s]].

To prevent [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], most North American sports leagues that operate on the franchise system do not allow individual owners to hold more than one franchise at once. (This is a stipulation that arose out of a crisis in 1899, when the [[Cleveland Spiders]] were bought out by a rival team and had its roster raided, leading to the remains of the Spiders organization being stuffed with subpar talent and setting records for futility.) Most such leagues also use [[revenue sharing]] and a [[salary cap]] or luxury tax system in an effort to maintain some level of parity between franchises.

==Structure of European leagues (Promotion and relegation system)==
{{main|Promotion and relegation}}
[[Football in England]] developed a very different system from the North American one, and it has been adopted for football in most other European countries, as well as to many other sports founded in Europe and played across the world. The features of the system are:

*The existence of an elected governing body to which clubs at all levels of the sport belong
*The promotion of well-performing teams to higher-level leagues or divisions and the relegation of poorly performing teams to lower-level leagues or divisions.
*Matches played both inside and outside of leagues

European football clubs are members both of a league and of a governing body. In the case of England, all competitive football clubs are members of [[The Football Association]], while the top 20 teams also are members of the [[Premier League]], a separate organization. The 72 teams in the three levels below the Premier League are members of still another body, the [[English Football League]]. The FA operates the national football team and tournaments that involve teams from different leagues (except the [[EFL Cup]], operated by the English Football League and open to its own teams and those in the Premier League). In conjunction with FIFA and other countries' governing bodies, it also sets the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|playing rules]] and the rules under which teams can sell players' contracts to other clubs.

The rules or [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] are determined by the [[International Football Association Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/01/06/30/78/statusinhalt_en_122007.pdf FIFA Regulations On The Status And Transfer Of Players]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Premier League negotiates television contracts for its games. However, although the national league would be the dominating competition in which a club might participate, there are many non-league fixtures a club might play in a given year. In European football there are national cup competitions, which are single elimination knock-out tournaments, are played every year and all the clubs in the league participate. Also, the best performing clubs from the previous year may participate in pan-European tournaments such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], operated by the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]]. A Premier League team might play a league game one week, and an [[FA Cup]] game against a team from a lower-level league the next, followed by an EFL Cup game against a team in the EFL, and then a fourth game might be against a team from across Europe in the Champions League.

The [[promotion and relegation]] system is generally used to determine membership of leagues. Most commonly, a pre-determined number of teams that finish the bottom of a league or division are automatically dropped down, or relegated, to a lower level for the next season. They are replaced by teams who are promoted from that lower tier either by finishing with the best records or by winning a playoff. In England, in the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–2011]] season, the teams [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] were relegated from the Premier League to the [[EFL Championship|Football League Championship]], the second level of English football. They were replaced by the top two teams from the second level, [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], both of which won automatic promotion, as well as [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] (a Welsh club that plays in the English system), which won a playoff tournament of the teams that finished third through sixth. In the [[2011–12 FA Premier League|2011–12]] season, the teams [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]], and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] were relegated to the Championship. They were replaced by [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]].  The two former teams had won automatic promotion, while the latter occupied the last promotion spot when they defeated [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]] 5-0 on aggregate in the semifinals, and defeated [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] 2-1 at the final in Wembley Stadium.

The system originated in England in 1888 when twelve clubs decided to create a professional [[English Football League|Football League]]. It then expanded by merging with the [[Football Alliance]] in 1892, with the majority of the Alliance teams occupying the lower [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], due to the divergent strengths of the teams. As this differential was overcome over the next five years, the winners of the Second Division went into a playoff with the worst placed team in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], and if they won, were promoted into the top tier. The first club to achieve promotion was [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], which replaced the relegated [[Accrington F.C.]]

Relegation often has devastating financial consequences for club owners who not only lose TV, sponsorship and gate income but may also see the asset value of their shares in the club collapse. Some leagues offer a "[[parachute payment (Sports)|parachute payment]]" to its relegated teams for the following years in order to protect them from bankruptcy. If a team is promoted back to the higher tier the following year then the parachute payment for the second season is distributed among the teams of the lower division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1837801,00.html Article discussing the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Football League]&lt;/ref&gt; There is of course a corresponding bonanza for promoted clubs.

The league does not choose which cities are to have teams in the top division. For example, [[Leeds]], the fourth-biggest city in England, saw their team, [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], relegated from the Premier League to the Championship in 2004, and relegated again to the third-tier [[EFL League One|League One]] in 2007 before returning to the Championship in 2010, where they remain to this day. Leeds will remain without a [[Premier League|Premiership]] team as long as it takes for United, or in theory any other local club, to play well enough to be promoted into the Premiership. Famously, the French [[Ligue 1]] lacked a team from Paris, France's capital and largest city, for some years. Likewise, Berlin clubs in the [[Bundesliga]] have been rare, due to the richer clubs being all located in the former West Germany.

As well as having no right to being in a certain tier, a club also has no territorial rights to its own area. A successful new team in a geographical location can come to dominate the incumbents. In [[Munich]], for example, [[TSV 1860 München]] were initially more successful than the city's current biggest team [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern München]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-shot.com/bundesliga-faq/history-faq/ Bundesliga history ]&lt;/ref&gt; As of the current 2018–19 season, London has [[Football in London|11 teams in the top four league levels]], including six Premier League teams.

Clubs may be sold privately to new owners at any time, but this does not happen often where clubs are based on community membership and agreement. Such clubs require agreement from members who, unlike shareholders of corporations, have priorities other than money when it comes to their football club such as tradition or local identity. For similar reasons, relocation of clubs to other cities is very rare. This is mostly because virtually all cities and towns in Europe have a football club of some sort, the size and strength of the club usually relative to the town's size and importance. Buying an existing top-flight club and moving it to a new location is problematic, as the supporters of the town's original club are unlikely to switch allegiance to an interloper. This means anyone wanting ownership of a high ranked club in their native city must buy a local club as it stands and work it up through the divisions, usually by hiring better talent. There have been [[Relocation of professional sports teams#Team relocation in Europe|some cases]] where existing owners have chosen to relocate out of a difficult market, to better facilities, or simply to realize the market value of the land that the current stadium is built upon. As in the U.S., team relocations have been controversial as supporters of the club will protest at its loss.

A rare example of a North American league that is attempting to develop a European-style model is the [[Canadian Premier League]], set to launch in 2019 as a purely domestic top-flight soccer league, sharing said status with MLS. Unlike other North American leagues, the CPL is operating on a club-based model. While it will begin as a single league, it plans to eventually adopt promotion and relegation.

==Systems around the world==
Leagues around the world generally follow one or the other of these systems with some variation. Most sport leagues in Australia are similar to the North American model, using post-season playoffs and no relegation, but without geographical divisions, with the most notable examples being the [[Australian Football League]] ([[Australian rules football|Aussie rules]]) and [[National Rugby League]] ([[rugby league]]). [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] in Japan uses the North American system due to American influence on the game. In [[cricket]], the [[Indian Premier League]], launched in 2008, also operates on this system. The [[Super League]], which is the top level of rugby league in the United Kingdom and France, was run on a franchise basis from [[2009–11 Super League licences|2009]] to [[2012–14 Super League licences|2014]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasttackle.co.uk/eyeonrl.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1140028103&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; Article discussing the potentially negative effects of franchising on Rugby League]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to a promotion-relegation model with the [[Super League XX|2015 season]]. Another example of a franchised league in European sport is [[ice hockey]]'s [[Kontinental Hockey League]], centered mainly in Russia with teams also located in [[Belarus]], [[China]], Finland, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], and [[Slovakia]].

The promotion-relegation system is widely used in [[association football|football]] around the world, notably in Africa and Latin America as well as Europe. The most notable variation has developed in Latin America where many countries have [[Apertura and Clausura|two league seasons per year]], which scheduling allows because many Latin American nations lack a national cup competition. Promotion and relegation has historically been used in other team sports founded in the United Kingdom, such as [[rugby union]], rugby league and cricket.

The European model is also used in Europe even when the sports were founded in America, showing that the league system adopted is not determined by the sport itself, but more on the tradition of sports organisation in that region. Sports such as [[basketball]] in Spain and Lithuania use promotion and relegation. In the same vein, the Australian [[A-League]] does not use the pyramid structure normally found in football, but instead follows the tradition of Australian sports having a franchise model and a post-season playoff system that better suits a country with a few important central locations where a sport needs to ensure there is a team playing with no risk of relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/david-gallop-places-consolidation-of-aleague-high-on-agenda-20131111-2xcih.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=David Gallop places consolidation of A-League high on agenda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, another notable example of "European" sports using the American model is rugby union's [[Super Rugby]], currently featuring 15 franchises. Thirteen of these are from the competition's founding countries of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and the other two are teams from Argentina and Japan that joined the competition in 2016.

In east Asia, places such as Japan, China, [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] have a particular differentiation among leagues: "European" sports such as football and rugby use promotion and relegation, while "American" sports such as baseball and basketball use franchising and minor leagues, with a few differences varying from country to country. A similar situation exists in countries in Central America and the Caribbean, where football and baseball share several close markets.

==Historical comparisons==
{{main|Promotion and relegation#Historical comparisons|l1=Promotion and relegation: Historical comparisons}}

A major factor in the development of the North American closed membership system during the 19th Century was the distances between cities, with some teams separated by half of the North American continent, resulting in high traveling costs. When the [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs]] was established in 1876, its founders judged that in order to prosper, they must make baseball's highest level of competition a "closed shop", with a strict limit on the number of teams, and with each member having exclusive local rights. This guarantee of a place in the league year after year would permit each club owner to monopolize fan bases in their respective exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, such as improved ballparks. This in turn would guarantee the revenues needed to support traveling across the continent.&lt;ref name="Cain"&gt;Cain, Louis P. and Haddock, David D.; 2005; 'Similar Economic Histories, Different Industrial Structures: Transatlantic Contrasts in the Evolution of Professional Sports Leagues'; [[Journal of Economic History]] 65 (4); pp 1116–1147&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the shorter distances between urban areas in England allowed more clubs to develop large fan bases without incurring the same travel costs as in North America. When The Football League, now known as the [[English Football League]], was founded in 1888, it was not intended to be a rival of [[The Football Association]] but rather the top competition within it. The new league was not universally accepted as England's top-calibre competition right away. To help win fans of clubs outside The Football League, a system was established in which the worst teams at the end of each season would need to win re-election against any clubs wishing to join. A rival league, the [[Football Alliance]], was then formed in 1889. When the two merged in 1892, it was not on equal terms; rather, most of the Alliance clubs were put in the new [[Football League Second Division]], whose best teams would move up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in place of its worst teams. Another merger, with the top division of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1920, helped form the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in similar fashion, firmly establishing the principle of promotion and relegation.&lt;ref name="Cain"/&gt;

The '''Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG)''' is the body responsible for training and examining [[obstetricians]] and [[gynaecologists]] in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].

==Structure==
The head office of the College is in [[Melbourne]], Australia.

RANZCOG was formed in 1998 with the amalgamation of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RACOG) and the Royal New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RNZCOG).  The Australian Regional Council of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] (RCOG) was appointed in 1947 by the RCOG, a British organisation that had been in existence since 1929.

As of 2005, the College had over 4600 members of various classes.  Of these, 58% were male and 42% female.

There are 6 categories of membership:
# Fellows
# Members
# Diplomates
# Honorary Fellows - 37 honorary fellowships have been awarded
# Associate Members - Open to medical practitioners with specialist qualifications in obstetrics and gynaecology not awarded by RANZCOG
# Educational Affiliates - Open to medical practitioners in women's health who are not eligible for Associate Membership

The College has publicly supported the decriminalisation of abortion, expanded rural health services, and has been a strong advocate for the implementation of vaccination programmes relating to cervical cancers, such as [[Gardasil]].  {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The College is a non-government body, and is also independent of universities.

==Training program==
''RANZCOG training program'' is a 6-year structured post-graduate program which leads first to certification as a Member of RANZCOG (MRANZCOG) and then to certification as a Fellow of RANZCOG (FRANZCOG). FRANZCOG status is the only post-graduate qualification which leads to recognition as a specialist obstetrician &amp; gynaecologist in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthengine.com.au/info/Qualifications_in_Obstetrics_and_Gynaecology Qualifications in Obstetrics and Gynaecology] from ''HealthEngine''. Retrieved March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 4 years of general obstetric and gynaecological training is known as the Integrated Training Program (ITP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/work-pubs-mtrp-13-toc~work-pubs-mtrp-13-app~work-pubs-mtrp-13-app-b~work-pubs-mtrp-13-app-b-tra~work-pubs-mtrp-13-app-b-tra-obg Medical Training Review Panel: thirteenth report], from Australian Government Department of Health.

'''Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center''' is a [[hospital]] at 93 Campus Avenue in [[Lewiston, Maine]] adjacent to [[Bates College]].  It is part of a complex of care facilities now operated by [[Covenant Health Systems]], a [[Roman Catholic]] non-profit organization based in [[Massachusetts]].  The hospital has 233 beds.  It was founded in 1888 by the [[Grey Nuns]], and has been a major provided of emergency health services in the Lewiston-[[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] area since.

==Campus==
The medical center is located just south of the [[Bates College]] campus, and occupies a triangular lot bounded by Campus Avenue and Golder and Sabattus Streets. Separating the medical center from the campus is [[Marcotte Nursing Home|St. Mary's d'Youville Pavilion]], a senior care facility also operated by Covenant Health.  Access to the hospital is via a circular drive on Sabattus Street.  The facility's largest buildings are the result of expansion in the 1960s in 1970s.

==History==
The hospital was founded in June 1888 by the Sisters of Charity of St. Hyacinthe, and was the first Catholic-run hospital in the state.  The sisters originally converted the Sarah J. Golder house into a 30-bed hospital and [[orphanage]].  Saint Mary's hospital was also known as the Sister's Hospital, the French Hospital, or the Catholic Hospital. The first purpose-built hospital building was constructed in 1902.  This Late Gothic Revival building was designed by Lewiston architect [[William R. Miller (architect)|William R. Miller]], and still forms part of the facility today.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1987 for its architecture and historical significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarysmaine.com/about-/mission/values/about/mission/historyhtml.html St. Mary's Historical Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|87002191}}|title=NRHP nomination for Saint Mary's General Hospital|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samsjøen''' is a [[lake]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|10|km2|adj=on}} lake sits on the border of the municipalities of [[Midtre Gauldal]] and [[Melhus]].  Most of the lake lies in Midtre Gauldal, about {{convert|12|km}} north of the village of [[Singsås]].  The lake has a [[dam]] at the northwest end, which is used for [[hydroelectric power]] production.  The water flows out of the lake and into the Lundesokna river which flows into the river [[Gaula (Trøndelag)|Gaula]].&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Sama_kraftverk|title=Sama kraftverk|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shark cartilage''' is a [[dietary supplement]] made from the dried and powdered [[cartilage]] of a [[shark]]; that is, from the tough material that composes a shark's skeleton. Shark cartilage is marketed under a variety of brand names, including Carticin, Cartilade, or BeneFin, and is marketed explicitly or implicitly as a treatment or preventive for various illnesses, including [[cancer]].

There is no scientific evidence that shark cartilage is useful in treating or preventing cancer or other diseases.&lt;ref name="aacr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[American Cancer Society]] | url = http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/PharmacologicalandBiologicalTreatment/shark-cartilage | title = Shark Cartilage | date = November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled trials have shown no benefit to shark cartilage supplements,&lt;ref name="usa-today"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-06-04-cancer-shark-cartilage_N.htm | title = Shark cartilage flounders; flaxseed shows promise | work = [[USA Today]] | date = June 4, 2007| accessdate = March 8, 2012 | first = Liz | last = Szabo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shark cartilage contains potentially toxic compounds linked to [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="bmaa"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Marine Drugs | title = Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin β-N-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in Shark Fins |author1=Mondo K |author2=Hammerschlag N |author3=Basile M |author4=Pablo J |author5=Banack SA |author6=Mash DC | year = 2012 | volume =  10 | issue = 2| pages= 509&amp;ndash;520 | doi = 10.3390/md10020509 | url = http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/10/2/509/ | pmid=22412816 | pmc=3297012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-toxin"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Shark Cartilage May Contain Toxin | first = Anahad | last = O'Connor | date = March 8, 2012 | accessdate = March 8, 2012 | url = http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/shark-cartilage-may-contain-toxin/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shark cartilage supplements are still marketed using the misconception that sharks do not get cancer, a myth that was as popularized by the 1992 book ''[[Sharks Don't Get Cancer]]''.  In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has taken legal action against such fraudulent promoters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2000/06/operation-cureall-nets-shark-cartilage-promoters-two-companies "Operation Cure.all" Nets Shark Cartilage Promoters], Federal Trade Commission&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning Against BeneFin |publisher=About.com |date=26 January 2006 |url=http://coloncancer.about.com/b/a/101392.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628092055/http://coloncancer.about.com/b/a/101392.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumors of many kinds, some metastatic, have been found in numerous species of sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Natterson-Horowitz, MD. | first=Barbara | title=Zoobiquity, What Animals Can Teach Us About Health and the Science of Healing | year=2012 | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | location=New York | isbn=978-0-307-59348-1 | page=44 |author2=Bowers, Kathryn }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first shark tumor was recorded in 1908. Scientists have since discovered 40 benign and cancerous tumors in 18 of the 1,168 species of sharks.  Scarcity of studies on shark physiology has perhaps allowed the myth to be accepted as fact for so many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = sharksavers.org | url = https://www.sharksavers.org/en/education/biology/myth-sharks-don-t-get-cancer/ | title = Sharks and Cancer | accessdate = 2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cancers in sharks, including tumors in shark cartilage, were documented by Gary Ostrander and his colleagues from the [[University of Hawaii]] in research published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilcox|first1=Christie|title=Mythbusting 101: Sharks will cure cancer|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/mythbusting-101-sharks-will-cure-cancer/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing consumption of shark cartilage supplements has been linked to a significant decline in shark populations and the popularity of these supplements has been described as a triumph of [[pseudoscience]] and marketing over scientific evaluation.&lt;ref name="aacr"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ostrander GK |author2=Cheng KC |author3=Wolf JC |author4=Wolfe MJ |title=Shark cartilage, cancer and the growing threat of pseudoscience |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=64 |issue=23 |pages=8485&amp;ndash;91 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15574750 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2260 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;amp;pmid=15574750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

Manufacturers of shark cartilage supplements provide anecdotal testimonials from those who claim to have experienced relief from arthritis symptoms and pain, as a result of taking shark cartilage supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.nationalnutrition.ca/detail.aspx?ID=2917 | title= Shark Cartilage for Joint Relief }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=September 2017}}

Opponents cite existing studies of shark cartilage on a variety of cancers that produced negligible to non-existent results in the prevention or treatment of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Shark Cartilage Shows No Benefit as a Therapeutic Agent for Lung Cancer | date = June 1, 2007 | url = http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/530517/ | publisher = [[University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable among these was a breast-cancer trial conducted by the [[Mayo Clinic]] that stated that the trial "was unable to demonstrate any suggestion of efficacy for this shark cartilage product in patients with advanced cancer." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Loprinzi CL, Levitt R, Barton DL, etal |title=Evaluation of shark cartilage in patients with advanced cancer: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial |journal=Cancer |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=176–82 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15912493 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of another clinical trial were presented at the 43rd annual meeting of the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]]. In that study, sponsored by the [[National Cancer Institute]], "researchers did not find a statistical difference in survival" between patients receiving shark cartilage and those taking a placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/health/03cancer.html?ref=health | title = Shark Cartilage, Not a Cancer Therapy | publisher = ''New York Times'' | date = June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific evidence does not support the efficacy of shark cartilage nor the ability of effective components to remove cancer cells. The fact that people believe eating shark cartilage can cure cancer shows the serious potential impacts of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="aacr"/&gt;

Detractors also purport that previous beliefs in regards to sharks and cancer have been overturned, as forty-two varieties of cancer have now been discovered in sharks and related species.  Also, many opponents{{who|date=September 2011}} feel that non-existent (or even limited) results do not justify the rampant over-fishing of many endangered species of sharks, further threatening their extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Facts endangering sharks: Cartilage | publisher = Shark Foundation, Foundation for research and the preservation of sharks | date = 26 January 2006 | url = http://www.shark.ch/Preservation/Facts/cartilage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
In the summer of 2004, Lane Labs, the manufacturers of BeneFin, was ordered to cease the promotion of BeneFin as a treatment or cure for cancer, as they had not conducted any research as to their claims for the product, much less reported any potential side effects.  Thus, the FDA ordered Lane Labs to "pay restitution to all of its customers from September of 1999 to the present."&lt;ref name="about.com"/&gt;

'''Silver–Russell syndrome''' ('''SRS'''), also called '''Silver–Russell dwarfism''' or '''Russell–Silver syndrome''' ('''RSS''') is a growth disorder occurring in approximately  1/50,000  to 1/100,000 births. In the United States it is usually referred to as Russell–Silver syndrome, and Silver–Russell syndrome elsewhere. It is one of 200 types of [[dwarfism]] and one of five types of [[primordial dwarfism]]. 

There is no statistical significance of the syndrome occurring preferentially in either males or females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Silver-Russell Syndrome|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_109963|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Although confirmation of a specific genetic marker is in a significant number of individuals, there are no tests to clearly determine if this is what a person has. As a 'syndrome' a diagnosis is typically given for children upon confirmation of the 'presence' of several 'symptoms' listed below.&lt;ref name="patient"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://patient.info/doctor/silver-russell-syndrome|title = Russell-Silver Syndrome|format = |work = patient.info|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are [[Intrauterine Growth Restriction]] (IUGR) combined with some of the following:
* Often small for gestational age (SGA) at birth (birth weight less than 2.8&amp;nbsp;kg)
* Feeding problems: the baby is uninterested in feeding and takes only small amounts with difficulty
* [[Hypoglycemia]]
* Excessive sweating as a baby, especially at night, and a greyness or pallor of the skin. This may be a symptom of hypoglycemia
* Triangular shaped face with a small jaw and a pointed chin that tends to lessen slightly with age. The mouth tends to curve down
* A blue tinge to the whites of the eyes in younger children
* Head circumference may be of normal size and disproportionate to a small body size
* Wide and late-closing [[fontanelle]]
* [[Clinodactyly]]
* Body asymmetry: one side of the body grows more slowly than the other
* Continued poor growth with no "[[Compensatory growth (organism)|catch up]]" into the normal centile lines on growth chart
* [[Precocious puberty]] (occasionally)
* [[Hypotonia|Low muscle tone]]
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]]
* A striking lack of [[wikt:subcutaneous|subcutaneous]] fat
* Late closing of the opening between the head hemispheres
* Constipation (sometimes severe)

The average adult height for patients without growth hormone treatment is 4'11" for males and 4'7" for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8801103 |year=1995 |author1=Wollmann |first1=H. A. |title=Growth and symptoms in Silver-Russell syndrome: Review on the basis of 386 patients |journal=European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=154 |issue=12 |pages=958–68 |last2=Kirchner |first2=T |last3=Enders |first3=H |last4=Preece |first4=M. A. |last5=Ranke |first5=M. B. |doi=10.1007/bf01958638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Its exact cause is unknown, but present research points toward a genetic and [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] component, possibly following maternal genes on chromosomes 7 and 11.&lt;ref name="Silver-Russell Syndrome; SRS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Silver-Russell Syndrome; SRS|url=http://www.omim.org/entry/180860|website=OMIM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that approximately 50% of Silver Russell patients have [[DNA methylation|hypomethylation]] of ''[[H19 (gene)|H19]]'' and ''[[IGF2]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid19066168"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jmg.2008.061820 |pmid=19066168 |title=Epigenetic mutations of the imprinted IGF2-H19 domain in Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS): Results from a large cohort of patients with SRS and SRS-like phenotypes |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=192–7 |year=2008 |last1=Bartholdi |first1=D |last2=Krajewska-Walasek |first2=M |last3=Ounap |first3=K |last4=Gaspar |first4=H |last5=Chrzanowska |first5=K H |last6=Ilyana |first6=H |last7=Kayserili |first7=H |last8=Lurie |first8=I W |last9=Schinzel |first9=A |last10=Baumer |first10=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to lead to low expression of IGF2 and over-expression of the H19 gene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggermann|first=Thomas|last2=Begemann|first2=Matthias|last3=Binder|first3=Gerhard|last4=Spengler|first4=Sabrina|date=2010|title=Silver-Russell syndrome: genetic basis and molecular genetic testing|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1750-1172-5-19|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-5-19|issn=1750-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 10% of the cases the syndrome is associated with maternal [[uniparental disomy]] (UPD) on chromosome 7.&lt;ref name="Silver-Russell Syndrome; SRS"/&gt; This is an imprinting error where the person receives two copies of chromosome 7 from the mother (maternally inherited) rather than one from each parent.

Other genetic causes such as duplications, deletions and chromosomal aberrations have also linked to Silver–Russell syndrome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Interestingly, Silver-Russell patients have variable hypomethylation levels in different body tissues, suggesting a mosaic pattern and a postzygotic epigenetic modification issue. This could explain the body asymmetry of the SRS phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishida|first=Miho|date=2016-04|title=New developments in Silver–Russell syndrome and implications for clinical practice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2217/epi-2015-0010|journal=Epigenomics|volume=8|issue=4|pages=563–580|doi=10.2217/epi-2015-0010|issn=1750-1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other imprinting disorders (e.g. [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], [[Angelman syndrome]], and [[Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome]]), Silver–Russell syndrome may be associated with the use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] such as [[in vitro fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19844787 |pmc=2788689 |year=2009 |author1=Butler |first1=M.

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=October 2018}}For many years the diagnosis of Silver-Russell Syndrome was clinical. However, this lead to overlaps with syndromes with similar clinical features such as Temple Syndrome and 12q14 microdeletion syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spengler|first=S.|last2=Schonherr|first2=N.|last3=Binder|first3=G.|last4=Wollmann|first4=H.

If they are negative, then testing for mUPD16, mUPD20 should take place. Testing for 14q32 should also be considered, to rule out Temple syndrome as a differential diagnosis. If these tests come back inconclusive, then a clinical diagnosis should be made.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

It is recommended that the Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system (NH-CSS) is used to group the clinical features together in a point based score.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Treatment==
The caloric intake of children with SRS must be carefully controlled in order to provide the best opportunity for growth.&lt;ref name=patient/&gt; If the child is unable to tolerate oral feeding, then enteral feeding may be used, such as the [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]].

In children with limb-length differences or [[scoliosis]], physiotherapy can alleviate the problems caused by these symptoms. In more severe cases, surgery to lengthen limbs may be required. To prevent aggravating posture difficulties children with leg length differences may require a raise in their shoe.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Growth hormone therapy is often prescribed as part of the treatment of SRS.  The hormones are given by injection typically daily from the age of 2 years old through teenage years. It may be effective even when the patient does not have a growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone therapy has been shown to increase the rate of growth in patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02282833 |pmid=8891553 |title=Growth hormone therapy in Silver Russell Syndrome: 5 years experience of the Australian and New Zealand Growth database (OZGROW) |journal=European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=155 |issue=10 |pages=851–7 |year=1996 |last1=Rakover |first1=Y. |last2=Dietsch |first2=S. |last3=Ambler |first3=G. R. |last4=Chock |first4=C. |last5=Thomsett |first5=M. |last6=Cowell |first6=C. T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently prompts 'catch up' growth. This may enable the child to begin their education at a normal height, improving their self-esteem and interaction with other children. The effect of growth hormone therapy on mature and final height is as yet uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childgrowthfoundation.org/iugr_rss.htm Child Growth Foundation Russell Silver Syndrome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are some theories suggesting that the therapy also assists with muscular development and managing [[hypoglycemia]].

{{multiple issues|{{Notability|date=March 2018}}{{Unsourced|date=March 2018}}}}
In plumbing, a '''sink strainer''' is a type of perforated metal [[sieve]] or [[mesh]] strainer used to strain or filter out solid debris in the [[water system]]. Different varieties are used in residential premises and for industrial or commercial applications. Such strainer elements are generally made from [[stainless steel]] for corrosion resistance.

==Household use==
[[File:Gootsteenstop.png|thumb|right|A sink drain cover and a plastic sink plug]]
[[File:Stainless steel sink strainer 2017 - A.jpg|thumb|right|A sink strainer used to completely replace the sink drain cover.]]
In houses, sink strainers are often used as [[drain cover]]s in [[sink]]s, [[shower]]s and [[bathtub]]s.

Water lines or kitchen systems can get gravel, deposits that break free, and other stray items in the line. Due to the velocity of the water pushing them, they can severely damage or clog devices installed in the flow stream of the water line, for example [[p-trap]]s or pipes. A strainer is essentially a screen installed to allow water to pass through, but not larger items. The larger items fall to the bottom or are held in a basket for later clean out. They normally have an access that allows for them to be cleaned or have the strainer plate or basket replaced.

Strainers come in several different styles based on the needs. A plate strainer is the simplest, in which water flows through a perforated plate. Often the plate is corrugated shape to increase surface area. A basket strainer is a design where the strainer is shaped like a basket and usually installed in a vertical system. The basket strainer is easier to clean, since debris is captured in the basket. It can also sometimes offer more straining surface area than a plate strainer, improving flow rates, or decreasing pressure loss through the strainer.

They can be made of stainless steel AISI 304, 202 etc.

One of the obstacles to treatment of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] is its high genetic variability.&lt;ref name="pmid7723052"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson DL, Hahn BH, Sharp PM | title = Recombination in AIDS viruses | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–59 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7723052 | doi = 10.1007/BF00163230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV can be divided into two major types, HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2). HIV-1 is related to viruses found in [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s living in western Africa, while HIV-2 viruses are related to viruses found in the endangered west African primate [[sooty mangabey]].&lt;ref name="doi10.1101/cshperspect.a006841"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = a006841 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 22229120 | pmc = 3234451 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006841 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV-1 viruses may be further divided into groups. The HIV-1 group M viruses predominate and are responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Group M can be further subdivided into subtypes based on genetic sequence data. Some of the subtypes are known to be more [[virulent]] or are resistant to different medications. Likewise, HIV-2 viruses are thought to be less virulent and transmissible than HIV-1 M group viruses, although HIV-2 is known to cause AIDS.

==Major types==

===HIV-1===
{{Anchor|HIV1}}
HIV-1 is the most common and pathogenic strain of the virus. Scientists divide HIV-1 into a major group (Group M) and two or more minor groups, namely Group N, O and possibly a group P. Each group is believed to represent an independent transmission of [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] into humans (but subtypes within a group are not).&lt;ref name="doi10.1101/cshperspect.a006841"/&gt; A total of 39 [[Open reading frame|ORFs]] are found in all six possible [[reading frame]]s (RFs) of HIV-1 complete genome sequence,&lt;ref&gt;Dhar¹, D. V., Amit, P., &amp; Kumar, M. S. In-Silico Identification of New Genes in HIV-1 by ORF Prediction Method. I. Res. J. Biological Sci., 1(7), 52-54(2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but only a few of them are functional.

====Group M====
With 'M' for "major", this is by far the most common type of HIV, with more than 90% of HIV/AIDS cases deriving from infection with HIV-1 group M. This major HIV virus which was the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses originated in the 1920s in Kinshasa, which is now known as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria NR, Rambaut A, Suchard MA, Baele G, Bedford T, Ward MJ, Tatem AJ, Sousa JD, Arinaminpathy N, Pépin J, Posada D, Peeters M, Pybus OG, Lemey P | title = HIV epidemiology.

There are also "circulating recombinant forms" or CRFs derived from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mmed&amp;part=A2330 recombination] between viruses of different subtypes which are each given a number. CRF12_BF, for example, is a recombination between subtypes B and F.
* Subtype A is common in West Africa.&lt;ref name="pmid15332265"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bobkov AF, Kazennova EV, Selimova LM, Khanina TA, Ryabov GS, Bobkova MR, Sukhanova AL, Kravchenko AV, Ladnaya NN, Weber JN, Pokrovsky VV | title = Temporal trends in the HIV-1 epidemic in Russia: predominance of subtype A | journal = Journal of Medical Virology | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–6 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15332265 | doi = 10.1002/jmv.20177 | displayauthors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subtype B is the dominant form in Europe, the Americas, Japan, and Australia.&lt;ref name="Goudsmit"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Goudsmit J | title = Viral Sex; The Nature of AIDS. | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 1997 | pages = 51–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, subtype B is the most common form in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sallam M, Şahin GÖ, Ingman M, Widell A, Esbjörnsson J, Medstrand P | title = Genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission in the Middle East and North Africa | journal = Heliyon | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e00352 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28725873 | pmc = 5506879 | doi = 10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was exported from Africa when Haitian professionals visited Kinshasa in the 1960s and brought it to Haiti in 1964.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Subtype C is the dominant form in Southern Africa, Eastern Africa, India, Nepal, and parts of China.&lt;ref name="Goudsmit" /&gt;
* Subtype D is generally only seen in Eastern and central Africa.&lt;ref name="Goudsmit" /&gt;
* Subtype E is found in Southeast Asia which is the dominant form for heterosexuals as transmission rate is much higher than most other subtypes.
* Subtype F has been found in central Africa, South America and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Avert"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avert.org/hivtypes.htm | title = Introduction to HIV types, groups and subtypes | date = 3 March 2008 | access-date = 25 May 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913191755/http://www.avert.org/hivtypes.htm | archive-date = 13 September 2008 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Subtype H is limited to central Africa.&lt;ref name="Avert" /&gt;
* Subtype I was originally used to describe a strain that is now accounted for as CRF04_cpx, with the cpx for a "complex" recombination of several subtypes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

* Subtype K is limited to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Cameroon.&lt;ref name="Avert" /&gt;

[[Image:HIV-1 subtype prevalence in 2002.png|thumb|300px|HIV-1 subtype prevalence in 2002]]

====Group N====
The 'N' stands for "non-M, non-O". This group was discovered by a Franco-Cameroonia team in 1998, when they identified and isolated the HIV-1 variant strain, YBF380, from a Cameroonian woman who died of AIDS in 1995. When tested, the YBF380 variant reacted with an envelope antigen from SIVcpz rather than with those of Group M or Group O, indicating it was indeed a novel strain of HIV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mourez T, Simon F, Plantier JC | title = Non-M variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 448–61 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23824367 | pmc = 3719493 | doi = 10.1128/cmr.00012-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, less than 20 Group N infections have been recorded.&lt;ref name="doi10.1089/aid.2006.22.83"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'arc M, Ayouba A, Esteban A, Learn GH, Boué V, Liegeois F, Etienne L, Tagg N, Leendertz FH, Boesch C, Madinda NF, Robbins MM, Gray M, Cournil A, Ooms M, Letko M, Simon VA, Sharp PM, Hahn BH, Delaporte E, Mpoudi Ngole E, Peeters M | title = Origin of the HIV-1 group O epidemic in western lowland gorillas | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 11 | pages = E1343-52 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25733890 | pmc = 4371950 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1502022112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Group O====
The O ("Outlier") group has infected about 100,000 individuals located in West-Central Africa and is not usually seen outside of that area.&lt;ref name="doi10.1089/aid.2006.22.83"/&gt; It is reportedly most common in Cameroon, where a 1997 survey found that about 2% of HIV-positive samples were from Group O.&lt;ref name="pmid9084797"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peeters M, Gueye A, Mboup S, Bibollet-Ruche F, Ekaza E, Mulanga C, Ouedrago R, Gandji R, Mpele P, Dibanga G, Koumare B, Saidou M, Esu-Williams E, Lombart JP, Badombena W, Luo N, Vanden Haesevelde M, Delaporte E | title = Geographical distribution of HIV-1 group O viruses in Africa | journal = AIDS | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 493–8 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9084797 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199704000-00013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group caused some concern because it could not be detected by early versions of the HIV-1 test kits. More advanced [[HIV tests]] have now been developed to detect both Group O and Group N.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abbottmolecular.com/PDF/E0608633_RealTimeHIV_rev.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921045308/http://www.abbottmolecular.com/PDF/E0608633_RealTimeHIV_rev.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Group P====
In 2009, a newly analyzed HIV sequence was reported to have greater similarity to a simian immunodeficiency virus recently discovered in wild [[gorilla]]s (SIVgor) than to SIVs from chimpanzees (SIVcpz). The virus had been isolated from a [[Cameroon]]ian woman residing in France who was diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 2004. The scientists reporting this sequence placed it in a proposed Group P "pending the identification of further human cases".&lt;ref name="pmid19648927"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plantier JC, Leoz M, Dickerson JE, De Oliveira F, Cordonnier F, Lemée V, Damond F, Robertson DL, Simon F | title = A new human immunodeficiency virus derived from gorillas | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 871–2 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19648927 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC news HIV P"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/08/03/hiv-africa.html|date=2009-08-03|access-date=2009-08-03|title=New HIV strain discovered|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=millennia&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = McNeil DG | author-link = Donald G.

===HIV-2===
{{Anchor|HIV2}}

HIV-2 has not been widely recognized outside of Africa. The first case in the [[United States]] was in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 | url = http://www.hivworkshop.com/hiv-2.htm | work = HIV/AIDS Workshop | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090218003646/http://www.hivworkshop.com/hiv-2.htm | archive-date = 18 February 2008 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many test kits for HIV-1 will also detect HIV-2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cber/products/testkits.htm CBER - Donor Screening Assays for Infectious Agents and HIV Diagnostic Assays&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, there are 8 known HIV-2 groups (A to H). Of these, only groups A and B are pandemic. Group A is found mainly in West Africa, but has also spread globally to [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Europe]], and the [[US]]. Despite the presence of HIV-2 globally, Group B is mainly confined to West Africa.&lt;ref name=Santiago2005&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Santiago ML, Range F, Keele BF, Li Y, Bailes E, Bibollet-Ruche F, Fruteau C, Noë R, Peeters M, Brookfield JF, Shaw GM, Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Simian immunodeficiency virus infection in free-ranging sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) from the Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire: implications for the origin of epidemic human immunodeficiency virus type 2 | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = 19 | pages = 12515–27 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16160179 | pmc = 1211554 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.79.19.12515-12527.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marx2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marx PA, Alcabes PG, Drucker E | title = Serial human passage of simian immunodeficiency virus by unsterile injections and the emergence of epidemic human immunodeficiency virus in Africa | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 356 | issue = 1410 | pages = 911–20 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11405938 | pmc = 1088484 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.0867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its relative confinement, HIV-2 should be considered in all patients exhibiting symptoms of HIV that not only come from West Africa, but also anyone who has had any body fluid transfer with a person from West Africa (i.e. needle sharing, sexual contact, etc.).&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web | title = Clinical Guidelines | url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines | work = AidInfo | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV-2 is closely related to [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] endemic in [[sooty mangabey]]s (''Cercocebus atys atys'') (SIVsmm), a monkey species inhabiting the forests of Littoral West Africa. Phylogenetic analyses show that the virus most closely related to the two strains of HIV-2 which spread considerably in humans (HIV-2 groups A and B) is the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest, in western [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=Santiago2005/&gt;

There are six additional known HIV-2 groups, each having been found in just one person. They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from [[sooty mangabey]]s to humans. Groups C and D have been found in two people from [[Liberia]], groups E and F have been discovered in two people from [[Sierra Leone]], and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the [[Ivory Coast]]. Each of these HIV-2 strains, for which humans are probably [[Host (biology)|dead-end hosts]], is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from [[sooty mangabey]]s living in the same country where the human infection was found.&lt;ref name=Santiago2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;

====Diagnosis====

HIV-2 diagnosis can be made when a patient has no symptoms but positive blood work indicating the individual has HIV. The Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test is currently the only FDA approved method for such differentiation between the two viruses. Recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of HIV has always been to use enzyme immunoassays that detect HIV-1, HIV-1 group O, and HIV-2.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt; When screening the combination, if the test is positive followed by an indeterminate HIV-1 western blot, a follow up test, such as amino acid testing, must be performed to distinguish which infection is present.&lt;ref name="NYSDH"&gt;Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 (HIV-2) by New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute: http://www.hivguidelines.org&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NIH, a differential diagnosis of HIV-2 should be considered when a person is of West African descent or has had sexual contact or shared needles with such a person. West Africa is at the highest risk as it is the origin of the virus.

====Treatments====

HIV-2 has been found to be less pathogenic than HIV-1. The mechanism of HIV-2 is not clearly defined, nor the difference from HIV-1, however the transmission rate is much lower in HIV-2 than HIV-1. Both infections can lead to AIDS in affected individuals and both can mutate to develop drug resistance.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt; Disease Monitoring in patients with HIV-2 includes clinical evaluation and CD4 cell counts, while treatment includes [[Anti-Retroviral Therapy]] (ART), [[Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor|Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors]] (NRTIs), [[Protease Inhibitors]] (PI), and [[Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor|Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors]] (NNRTIs) with the addition of [[CCR5 receptor antagonist|CCR5 co-receptor antagonist]]s and [[fusion inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name="Kannangai"&gt;R Kannangai, S David, G Sridharan. "Human immunodeficiency virus type 2-A milder, kinder virus: An update". Indian Journal of Medical Micobiology, (2012) 30(1): 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Choice of initial and/or second-line therapy for HIV-2 has not yet been defined. HIV-2 appears to be resistant to NNRTIs intrinsically, but may be sensitive to NRTIs, though the mechanism is poorly understood. Protease inhibitors have shown variable effect, while integrase inhibitors are also being evaluated.  Combination regimens of the above listed therapies are being looked into as well, also showing variable effect depending on the types of therapies combined. While the mechanisms are not clearly understood for HIV-1 and HIV-2, it is known that they use different pathways and patterns, making the algorithms used to evaluate HIV-1 resistance-associated mutations irrelevant to HIV-2.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt;

Each virus can be contracted individually, or they can be contracted together in what is referred to as co-infection. HIV-2 seems to have lower mortality rates, less severe symptoms and slower progression to AIDS than HIV-1 alone or the co-infection. In co-infection, however, this is largely dependent on which virus was contracted first. HIV-1 tends to out compete HIV-2 for disease progression. Co-infection seems to be a growing problem globally as time progresses, with most cases being identified in West African countries, as well as some cases in the US.&lt;ref name="Kannangai"/&gt;

====Pregnancy====

	If a pregnant mother is exposed, screening is performed as normal. If HIV-2 is present, a number of perinatal ART drugs may be given as a prophylactic to lower the risk of mother-to-child transmission.  After the child is born, a standard 6-week regimen of these prophylactics should be initiated. Breast milk may also contain particles of HIV-2; therefore, breastfeeding is strictly advised against.&lt;ref name="NYSDH"/&gt;

==Evolution==
The rapid evolution of HIV can be attributed to the high mutation rate it has. During the early stages of mutation, evolution appears to be neutral due to the absence of an evolutionary response. However, when examining the virus in several different individuals, convergent mutations can be found appearing in these viral populations independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bons E, Bertels F, Regoes RR | title = Estimating the mutational fitness effects distribution during early HIV infection | journal = Virus Evolution | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = vey029 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 30310682 | doi = 10.1093/ve/vey029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV evolution within a host influences factors including the virus' set-point viral load. If the virus has a low set-point viral load, the host will live longer, and there is a greater probability that the virus will be transmitted to another individual. If the virus has a high set-point viral load, the host will live for a shorter amount of time and there is a lower probability that the virus will be transmitted to another individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser C, Hollingsworth TD, Chapman R, de Wolf F, Hanage WP | title = Variation in HIV-1 set-point viral load: epidemiological analysis and an evolutionary hypothesis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 44 | pages = 17441–6 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17954909 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0708559104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV has evolved to maximize the number of infections to other hosts, and this tendency for selection to favor intermediate strains shows that HIV undergoes stabilizing selection.

The virus has also evolved to become more infectious between hosts. There are three different mechanisms that allow HIV to evolve at a population level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One includes the continuous battle to evolve and overcome the immune system which slows down the evolution of HIV and shifts the virus’ focus towards a population level. Another includes the slow evolution of viral load due to viral load mutations being neutral within the host. The last mechanism focuses on the virus' preference to transmit founding viral strains stored during the early stages of infection. This preference of the virus to transmit its stored genome copies explains why HIV evolves more quickly within the host than between hosts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

HIV is evolving to a milder form but is ''"an awfully long way"'' from no longer being deadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=James|title=HIV evolving 'into milder form'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-30254697|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

===Drug resistance mutations===
Isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2 with resistance to antiretroviral drugs arise through [[natural selection]] and genetic mutations, which have been tracked and analyzed. The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and the International AIDS Society publish lists of the most important of these; first year listing 80 common mutations, and the latest year 93 common mutations, and made available through the [[HIV Drug Resistance Database|Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database]].

'''TEDMED''' is an annual conference focusing on [[health]] and [[medicine]], with a year-round web-based community.  TEDMED is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference.&lt;ref name="tedblog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Trost |first=Matthew |title=TEDMED: A New Partnership |url=http://blog.ted.com/2010/01/19/tedmed_a_new_pa/|date=January 19, 2010 |work=blog.ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tedmed.jpg|thumb|The TEDMED 2010 Conference]]

== Background ==
{{As of|2014}}, TEDMED staff operates from [[Stamford, Connecticut]].

Talks given at TEDMED combine “the nexus of health, information and technology” with “compelling personal stories” and “a glimpse into the future of healthcare.”&lt;ref name="ihealth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarasohn-Kahn|first=Jane|title=TEDMED highlights best of health, technology innovation|url=http://www.ihealthbeat.org/Perspectives/2003/TEDMED-highlights-best-of-health-technology-innovation.aspx|date=June 17, 2003|publisher=iHealthBeat|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G36lBTQl?url=http://www.ihealthbeat.org/Perspectives/2003/TEDMED-highlights-best-of-health-technology-innovation.aspx|archivedate=April 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciamer"&gt;{{cite news|last=DiChristina|first=Mariette|title=TED MED: The power of the mind over the body|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=ted-med-the-power-of-the-mind-over-2009-10-31|newspaper=Scientific American|date=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lemley|first=Brad|title=TEDMED: A gathering of geniuses confront a simple question: Why do we know more about our cars than our own bodies?|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/apr/featted|newspaper=DISCOVER Magazine|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent of the conference has been described as “a gathering of geniuses” that brings together “some of the most innovative, thoughtful pioneers of healthcare technology, media, and entertainment into one big four-day ‘dinner party’ to learn from one another and mix people up from different disciplines and industries to solve big problems in healthcare.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Aaron|title=Gadgets and Ideas to Revolutionize Healthcare|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/tedmed/|date=November 4, 2009|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dishman|first=Eric|title=Musings from TED MED So Far: The Medical Model is Hard to Move Past|url=http://blogs.intel.com/healthcare/2009/10/musings_from_ted_med_so_far_the_medical_model_is_hard_to_move_past.php|date=October 28, 2009|publisher=Intel Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
TEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED’s founder [[Richard Saul Wurman|Richard Wurman]]. TEDMED was inactive for a number of years, and in 2008 Wurman sold the rights to TEDMED to entrepreneur [[Marc Hodosh]].

Hodosh recreated TEDMED and launched its first conference under his guidance in San Diego in October 2009.

In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.&lt;ref name="tedblog" /&gt;

In October 2010, TEDMED was held in San Diego again and sold out for a second year, attracting notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZX0culYjU_A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Jay S. Walker|Jay Walker]] and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.medgadget.com/2011/04/tedmed_sold_to_jay_walker_richard_saul_wurman_says_adios.html |publisher=Medgadget |title=TEDMED Sold to Jay Walker, Richard Saul Wurman Says Adios |date=April 14, 2011 |author=Ostrovsky, Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, TEDMED was held in Palm Springs, CA.

'''Tropical diseases''' are [[Infectious disease|disease]]s that are prevalent in or unique to [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar|first1=Jeremy|last2=Hotez|first2=Peter J|last3=Junghanss|first3=Thomas|last4=Kang|first4=Gagandeep|last5=Lalloo|first5=David|last6=White|first6=Nicholas|title=Manson's tropical diseases.|date=2013|publisher=Saunders [Imprint]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780702051012|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases are less prevalent in [[temperate climate]]s, due in part to the occurrence of a cold [[season]], which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th centuries before modern understanding of disease causation. The initial impetus for [[tropical medicine]] was to protect the health of colonialists, notably in India under the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=John|title=Bilharzia : a history of imperial tropical medicine.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0521530601|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals. Most often disease is transmitted by an insect "bite", which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.

Human exploration of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[deforestation]], rising [[immigration]] and increased international air travel and other [[tourism]] to tropical regions has led to an increased incidence of such diseases.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|title=Deforestation Boosts Malaria Rates, Study Finds|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103133648/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm UK 'faces tropical disease threat'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm |date=2006-06-15 }}, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health programmes ==
In 1975 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to focus on [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected infectious diseases]] which disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations in developing regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. It was established at the [[World Health Organization]], which is the executing agency, and is co-sponsored by the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

TDR's vision is to foster an effective global research effort on infectious [[diseases of poverty]] in which disease endemic countries play a pivotal role. It has a dual mission of developing new tools and strategies against these diseases, and to develop the research and leadership capacity in the countries where the diseases occur. The TDR secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, but the work is conducted throughout the world through many partners and funded grants.

Some examples of work include helping to develop new treatments for diseases, such as ivermectin for onchocerciasis (river blindness); showing how packaging can improve use of artemesinin-combination treatment (ACT) for malaria; demonstrating the effectiveness of bednets to prevent mosquito bites and malaria; and documenting how community-based and community-led programmes increases distribution of multiple treatments.

* [[Chagas disease]]
*: (also called ''American trypanosomiasis'') is a [[parasitic disease]] which occurs in the [[Americas]], particularly in [[South America]]. Its [[pathogen]]ic agent is a [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n named ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', which is [[Vector (epidemiology)|transmitted]] mostly by [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] '''[[assassin bug]]s''', however other methods of transmission are possible, such as ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, [[blood transfusion]] and [[fetus|fetal]] transmission. Between 16 and 18 million people are currently infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|title=Chagas Disease After Organ Transplantation --- United States, 2001|author=|date=|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013805/https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dengue]]
* [[Helminths]]
* [[African trypanosomiasis]]
*: or '''sleeping sickness''', is a [[parasitic]] [[disease]], caused by protozoa called trypansomes. The two responsible for African trypanosomiasis are Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.These parasites are transmitted by the '''[[tsetse fly]]'''
* [[Leishmaniasis]]
*: caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the genus Leishmania, and transmitted by the bite of certain species of '''[[sand fly]]'''.
* [[Leprosy]]&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
*: (or '''Hansen's disease''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[infectious disease]] caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]]. Leprosy is primarily a [[granuloma]]tous disease of the [[peripheral nerves]] and [[mucosa]] of the [[upper respiratory tract]]; skin lesions are the primary external symptom.&lt;ref name= Sherris&gt;Kenneth J. Ryan and C. George Ray, Sherris Medical Microbiology Fourth Edition McGraw Hill 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Contrary to popular conception, leprosy does not cause body parts to simply fall off, and it differs from [[tzaraath]], the malady described in the Hebrew scriptures and previously translated into English as ''leprosy''.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 13:59, Artscroll Tanakh and Metsudah Chumash translations, 1996 and 1994, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Filariasis|Lymphatic filariasis]]
*: is a [[parasite|parasitic]] disease caused by thread-like parasitic filarial worms called [[nematode]]s, all transmitted by '''[[mosquito]]es'''. [[Loa loa]] is another filarial parasite transmitted by the [[deer fly]]. 120 million people are infected worldwide. It is carried by over half the population in the most severe endemic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Supali, T. |author2=Ismid, I.S. |author3=Wibowo, H. |author4=Djuardi, Y. |author5=Majawati, E. |author6=Ginanjar, P. |author7=Fischer, P.  | title=Estimation of the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis by a pool screen PCR assay using blood spots collected on filter paper | journal=Tran R Soc Trop Med Hyg |date=Aug 2006 | volume=100 | issue=8 | pages=753&amp;ndash;9 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.10.005 | pmid=16442578  |issn=0035-9203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noticeable symptom is [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]]: a thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Elephantiasis is caused by chronic infection by filarial worms in the lymph nodes. This clogs the lymph nodes and slows the draining of lymph fluid from a portion of the body.
* [[Malaria]]
*: Caused by a [[Protozoan]] [[parasite]]s transmitted by female ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]]es, as they are the blood-feeders. The disease is caused by species of the genus Plasmodium.

Some tropical diseases are very rare, but may occur in sudden [[epidemic]]s, such as the [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever, [[Lassa fever]] and the [[Marburg virus]]. There are hundreds of different tropical diseases which are less known or rarer, but that, nonetheless, have importance for [[public health]].

==Relation of climate to tropical diseases==
The so-called "exotic" diseases in the tropics have long been noted both by travelers, explorers, etc., as well as by physicians. One obvious reason is that the hot climate present during all the year and the larger volume of [[rain]]s directly affect the formation of breeding grounds, the larger number and variety of [[natural reservoir]]s and animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans ([[zoonosis]]), the largest number of possible [[insect]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of diseases. It is possible also that higher temperatures may favor the replication of pathogenic agents both inside and outside biological organisms. Socio-economic factors may be also in operation, since most of the poorest nations of the world are in the tropics. Tropical countries like [[Brazil]], which have improved their socio-economic situation and invested in [[hygiene]], [[public health]] and the combat of transmissible diseases have achieved dramatic results in relation to the elimination or decrease of many [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] tropical diseases in their territory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[Climate change]], [[global warming]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], and the resulting increase in global [[temperature]]s, are possibly causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the [[Southern United States]], the Mediterranean area, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange Climate change brings malaria back to Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305222344/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange |date=2016-03-05 }} ''The Guardian'' 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm Climate link to African malaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173736/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm |date=2006-06-16 }} 20 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, global warming enabled Chytridiomycosis, a tropical disease, to flourish and thus force into decline amphibian populations of the Monteverde Harlequin frog.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, J. Alan et al. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Deisease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.12 (2006) 161-67&lt;/ref&gt; Here, global warming raised the heights of orographic cloud formation, and thus produced cloud cover that would facilitate optimum growth conditions for the implicated pathogen, B. dendrobatidis.

Some of the strategies for controlling tropical diseases include: 
* Draining wetlands to reduce populations of [[insect]]s and other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, or introducing natural predators of the vectors.
* The application of [[insecticide]]s and/or [[insect repellent]]s) to strategic surfaces such as clothing, skin, buildings, insect habitats, and [[bed net]]s.
* The use of a [[mosquito net]] over a bed (also known as a "bed net") to reduce nighttime transmission, since certain species of tropical [[mosquito]]es feed mainly at night.
* Use of water [[Water well|well]]s, and/or [[water filtration]], [[water filter]]s, or [[water treatment]] with water tablets to produce drinking water free of parasites.
* [[Sanitation]] to prevent transmission through human waste.
* In situations where vectors (such as mosquitoes) have become more numerous as a result of human activity, a careful investigation can provide clues: for example, open dumps can contain stagnant water that encourage disease vectors to breed. Eliminating these dumps can address the problem.  An education campaign can yield significant benefits at low cost.
* Development and use of [[vaccine]]s to promote disease [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].
* Pharmacologic pre-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease before exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic post-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease after exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic treatment (to treat disease after infection or infestation).
* Assisting with economic development in endemic regions. For example, by providing [[microloan]]s to enable investments in more efficient and productive agriculture. This in turn can help [[subsistence farming]] to become more profitable, and these profits can be used by local populations for disease prevention and treatment, with the added benefit of reducing the poverty rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The most common symptoms are [[dysuria|burning with urination]] and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of [[vaginal discharge]] and significant pain.&lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; These symptoms may vary from mild to severe&lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt; and in healthy women last an average of six&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; Some pain above the [[pubic bone]] or in the [[lower back pain|lower back]] may be present.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt; --&gt; People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or [[pyelonephritis]], may experience [[abdominal pain|flank pain]], [[fever]], or nausea and [[vomiting]] in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.&lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt; Rarely, the urine may appear [[Hematuria|bloody]]&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; or contain visible [[pyuria|pus in the urine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arellano|first=Ronald S.|title=Non-vascular interventional radiology of the abdomen|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7731-1|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=au-OpXwnibMC&amp;pg=PA67|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610151717/https://books.google.com/books?id=au-OpXwnibMC&amp;pg=PA67|archivedate=2016-06-10|df=|date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
In young children, the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI) may be a fever.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt;  --&gt;  Because of the lack of more obvious symptoms, when females under the age of two or uncircumcised males less than a year exhibit a fever, a culture of the urine is recommended by many medical associations.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt;  --&gt; Infants may feed poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of [[jaundice]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt;  --&gt; In older children, new onset [[urinary incontinence]] (loss of bladder control) may occur.&lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt;

===Elderly===
Urinary tract symptoms are frequently lacking in the [[Old age|elderly]].&lt;ref name=Elder2011/&gt; The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a [[Altered level of consciousness|change in mental status]], or fatigue as the only symptoms,&lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt; while some present to a health care provider with [[sepsis]], an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; Diagnosis can be complicated by the fact that many elderly people have preexisting incontinence or [[dementia]].&lt;ref name=Elder2011/&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
[[File:Bladder Infection.png|thumb|Bladder infection]]
The [[bacteria]] that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or [[lymph]].&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; It is believed that the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; After gaining entry to the bladder, ''E. Coli'' are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a [[biofilm]] that resists the body's immune response.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt;

''Escherichia coli'' is the single most common microorganism, followed by ''Klebsiella'' and ''Proteus'' spp., to cause urinary tract infection. ''Klebsiella'' and ''Proteus'' spp., are frequently associated with stone disease. The presence of Gram positive bacteria such as ''Enterococcus'' and ''Staphylococcus'' increased.&lt;ref name="Jorge Gutierrez-Aceves 2012 p. 39"&gt;Jorge Gutierrez-Aceves, "Preoperative Antibiotics and Prevention of Sepsis in Genitourinary Surgery" in ''Smith's Textbook of Endourology, 3rd Edition'' (2012), p. 39 edited by Arthur D. Smith et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased resistance of urinary pathogens to quinolones has been reported worldwide and might be the consequence of overuse and misuse of quinolones.&lt;ref name="Jorge Gutierrez-Aceves 2012 p. 39"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.&lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via [[urinalysis]], looking for the presence of [[urinary nitrite]]s, [[white blood cells]] (leukocytes), or [[leukocyte esterase]].&lt;ref name="Detweiler2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Detweiler K, Mayers D, Fletcher SG |title=Bacteruria and Urinary Tract Infections in the Elderly|journal=The Urologic Clinics of North America|volume=42|issue=4|pages=561–8|date=November 2015|pmid=26475952|doi=10.1016/j.ucl.2015.07.002|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another test, [[urine microscopy]], looks for the presence of [[red blood cells]], white blood cells, or bacteria.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; --&gt; Urine [[microbiological culture|culture]] is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[colony-forming unit]]s per mL of a typical urinary tract organism.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; --&gt; Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; --&gt; However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.&lt;ref name=Elder2011/&gt;

===Classification===
A urinary tract infection may involve only the lower urinary tract, in which case it is known as a bladder infection.  Alternatively, it may involve the upper urinary tract, in which case it is known as pyelonephritis.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt; --&gt; If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as [[asymptomatic bacteriuria]].&lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt; If a urinary tract infection involves the upper tract, and the person has [[diabetes mellitus]], is pregnant, is male, or [[immunocompromised]], it is considered complicated.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; Otherwise if a woman is healthy and [[premenopausal]] it is considered uncomplicated.&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.&lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhat RG, Katy TA, Place FC |title=Pediatric urinary tract infections.|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=August 2011|volume=29|issue=3|pages=637–53|pmid=21782079|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2011.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
To make the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt; --&gt; Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used, thus a cutoff of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;CFU/mL is used for a "clean-catch" mid stream sample, 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;CFU/mL is used for [[suprapubic aspiration]]s (a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt; --&gt; The use of "urine bags" to collect samples is discouraged by the [[World Health Organization]] due to the high rate of contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt; --&gt; Some, such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends [[renal ultrasound]] and [[voiding cystourethrogram]] (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time x-rays while they urinate) in all children less than two years old who have had a urinary tract infection.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt; --&gt; However, because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings.&lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
In women with [[cervicitis]] (inflammation of the [[cervix]]) or [[vaginitis]] (inflammation of the [[vagina]]) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' or ''[[Neisseria gonorrheae]]'' infection may be the cause.&lt;ref name=EM2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raynor |first1=MC |author2=Carson CC, 3rd|title=Urinary infections in men.|journal=The Medical Clinics of North America|date=January 2011|volume=95|issue=1|pages=43–54|pmid=21095410|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infections are typically classified as a [[urethritis]] rather than a urinary tract infection.

==Prevention==
A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or [[defecating]], or whether a person typically bathes or showers.&lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, [[tampon]] use, and [[Douche|douching]].&lt;ref name=NA2011/&gt; In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use [[spermicide]] or a [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; In those with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=Y|last2=Pinckaers|first2=JH|last3=Ten Brinck|first3=RM|last4=Lycklama À Nijeholt|first4=AA|last5=Dekkers|first5=OM|title=Urinating Standing versus Sitting: Position Is of Influence in Men with Prostate Enlargement.

Urinary tract infections are the most frequent bacterial infection in women.&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35&amp;nbsp;years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; --&gt; Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently.&lt;ref name=Review08/&gt; They are the most common cause of [[Nosocomial infection|hospital acquired infections]] accounting for approximately 40%.&lt;ref name=Nurse2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Brunner &amp; Suddarth's textbook of medical-surgical nursing.|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-8589-1|page=1359|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=PA1359|edition=12th|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428194226/https://books.google.com/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=PA1359|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes.&lt;ref name=NA2011/&gt; Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%.&lt;ref name=Elder2011/&gt; Asymptomatic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Smaill-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Smaill | first1 = F. | last2 = Vazquez | first2 = JC. | title = Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy. | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 2 | pages = CD000490 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000490.pub2 | pmid = 17443502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urinary tract infections may affect 10% of people during childhood.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; Among children, urinary tract infections are most common in uncircumcised males less than three months of age, followed by females less than one year.&lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt; Estimates of frequency among children, however, vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and two years, two to 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.&lt;ref name=PeadsNA2011/&gt;

==Society and culture==
In the United States, urinary tract infections account for nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and one hundred thousand hospitalizations every year.&lt;ref name=Sal2011/&gt; The cost of these infections is significant both in terms of lost time at work and costs of medical care.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Nurse2010/&gt; --&gt; In the United States the direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;USD yearly.&lt;ref name=Nurse2010/&gt;

==History==
Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] dated to c. 1550 BC.&lt;ref name=His2008/&gt; It was described by the Egyptians as "sending forth heat from the bladder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson...]|first=[general ed.: Graham|title=Topley and Wilson's Principles of bacteriology, virology and immunity : in 4 volumes|year=1990|publisher=Arnold|location=London|isbn=978-0-7131-4591-5|page=198|edition=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective treatment did not occur until the development and availability of antibiotics in the 1930s before which time herbs, [[bloodletting]] and rest were recommended.&lt;ref name=His2008/&gt;

==Pregnancy==
Urinary tract infections are more concerning in [[pregnancy]] due to the increased risk of kidney infections.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NA2011/&gt; --&gt; During pregnancy, high [[progesterone]] levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, which leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NA2011/&gt; --&gt; While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection.&lt;ref name=NA2011/&gt; Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Preg10/&gt; --&gt; [[Cephalexin]] or [[nitrofurantoin]] are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Preg10&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Guinto, V.T.|author2=De Guia, B.|author3=Festin, M.R.|author4=Dowswell, T.|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=9|pages=CD007855|year=2010|pmid=20824868|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007855.pub2|editor1-last=Guinto|editor1-first=Valerie T|title=Different antibiotic regimens for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy|pmc=4033758}}&lt;/ref&gt; A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in [[premature birth]] or [[pre-eclampsia]] (a state of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to [[seizures]]).&lt;ref name=NA2011/&gt; Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneeberger|first1=C|last2=Geerlings|first2=SE|last3=Middleton|first3=P|last4=Crowther|first4=CA|title=Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection during pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=26 July 2015|issue=7|pages=CD009279|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009279.pub3|pmid=26221993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome''' ('''WKS''') is the combined presence of [[Wernicke encephalopathy]] (WE) and [[alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome]]. Due to the close relationship between these two disorders, people with either are usually diagnosed with WKS as a single syndrome. 
The cause of the disorder is [[thiamine deficiency|thiamine (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) deficiency]], which can cause a range of disorders including [[beriberi]],  Wernicke encephalopathy, and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. These disorders may manifest together or separately. WKS is usually secondary to [[alcohol abuse]]. It mainly causes vision changes, [[ataxia]] and impaired memory.&lt;ref name=Medline771 /&gt;

Wernicke encephalopathy and WKS are most commonly seen in people who are alcoholic, and only 20% of cases are identified before death. This failure in diagnosis of WE and thus treatment of the disease leads to death in approximately 20% of cases, while 75% are left with permanent brain damage associated with WKS.&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomson |first1=Allan D. |last2=Marshall |first2=E. Jane |title=The natural history and pathophysiology of Wernicke's Encephalopathy and Korsakoff's Psychosis |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=151–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16384871 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agh249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of those affected, 25% require long-term institutionalization in order to receive effective care.&lt;ref name="thomson"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The syndrome is a combined manifestation of two namesake disorders, [[Wernicke encephalopathy]] and [[alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome]]. It involves an acute Wernicke-encephalopathy phase, followed by the development of a chronic alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome phase.&lt;ref name="vetreno"/&gt;

===Wernicke encephalopathy===
WE is characterized by the presence of a triad of symptoms;&lt;ref name="Sechi"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sechi |first1=GianPietro |last2=Serra |first2=Alessandro |title=Wernicke's encephalopathy: new clinical settings and recent advances in diagnosis and management |journal=The Lancet Neurology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=442–55 |year=2007 |pmid=17434099 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70104-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ocular disturbances ([[ophthalmoplegia]])
# Changes in mental state ([[confusion]])
# Unsteady stance and [[gait]] ([[ataxia]])

This triad of symptoms results from a deficiency in vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which is an essential [[coenzyme]]. The aforementioned changes in mental state occur in approximately 82% of patients' symptoms of which range from confusion, [[apathy]], inability to concentrate, and a decrease in awareness of the immediate situation they are in. If left untreated, WE can lead to coma or death. In about 29% of patients, ocular disturbances consist of [[nystagmus]] and paralysis of the [[lateral rectus muscle]]s or other muscles in the eye. A smaller percentage of patients experience a decrease in reaction time of the pupils to light stimuli and swelling of the [[optic disc]] which may be accompanied by [[retinal hemorrhage]]. Finally, the symptoms involving stance and gait occur in about 23% of patients and result from dysfunction in the [[cerebellum]] and [[vestibular system]]. Other symptoms that have been present in cases of WE are [[stupor]], low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), elevated heart rate ([[tachycardia]]), as well as [[hypothermia]], [[epileptic seizures]] and a progressive loss of hearing.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

About 19% of patients have none of the symptoms in the classic triad at first diagnosis of WE; however, usually one or more of the symptoms develops later as the disease progresses.&lt;ref name="Sechi" /&gt;

===Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome===
KS is described as an acute onset of severe memory impairment without any dysfunction in intellectual abilities.&lt;ref name=Medline771&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000771|Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="korsakoff overview"/&gt; The [[DSM IV]] lists the following criteria for the diagnosis of alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome:

# [[anterograde amnesia]]
# Variable presentation of [[retrograde amnesia]]
One of:
# [[Aphasia]]
# [[Apraxia]]
# [[Agnosia]]
# A deficit in [[executive functions]]

In addition, the DSM-IV indicates that normal activities and function will be impaired by the memory deficits and that the experience of amnesia must occur outside of times where the individual is in a state of [[delirium]], intoxification, or withdrawal. The criteria for diagnosis also maintain that there must be evidence that the amnesia is caused by the use of alcohol.&lt;ref name="korsakoff overview"/&gt;

Despite the assertion that alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome must be caused by the use of alcohol, there have been several cases where it has developed from other instances of thiamine deficiency resulting from gross malnutrition due to conditions such as; stomach cancer, [[anorexia nervosa]], and [[gastrectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=V. |last1=Ingram |first2=M. |last2=Kelly |first3=G. |last3=Grammer |title=Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Following Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for Sleep Apnea}} in {{cite journal |title=Abstracts Presented at the Thirty-First Annual International Neuropsychological Society Conference, February 5–8, 2003 Honolulu, Hawaii |journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society |volume=9 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=135–330 |doi=10.1017/S1355617703920017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive effects===
Several cases have been documented where Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome has been seen on a large scale. In 1947, 52 cases of WKS were documented in a prisoner of war hospital in Singapore where the prisoners' diets included less than 1&amp;nbsp;mg of thiamine per day. Such cases provide an opportunity to gain an understanding of what effects this syndrome has on [[cognition]]. In this particular case, cognitive symptoms included [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], difficulties in concentration, loss of memory for the immediate past, and gradual degeneration of mental state; consisting of confusion, [[confabulation]], and [[hallucinations]].&lt;ref name="thomson"/&gt; In other cases of WKS, cognitive effects such as severely disrupted speech, giddiness, and heavy headedness have been documented. In addition to this, it has been noted that some patients displayed an inability to focus, and the inability of others to catch patients' attention.&lt;ref name="wernickes review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomson |first1=Allan D. |last2=Cook |first2=Christopher C. H. |last3=Guerrini |first3=Irene |last4=Sheedy |first4=Donna |last5=Harper |first5=Clive |last6=Marshall |first6=E. Jane |title=Review: Wernicke encephalopathy revisited: Translation of the case history section of the original manuscript by Carl Wernicke 'Lehrbuch der Gehirnkrankheiten fur Aerzte and Studirende' (1881) with a commentary |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=174–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18056751 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agm144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted in 2003 by Brand et al. on the cognitive effects of WKS, the researchers used a [[neuropsychological]] test battery which included tests of intelligence, speed of [[information processing]], memory, executive function and cognitive estimation. They found that patients suffering from WKS showed impairments in all aspects of this test battery but most noticeably, on the cognitive estimation tasks. This task required subjects to estimate a physical quality such as size, weight, quantity or time (i.e. What is the average length of a shower?), of a particular item. Patients with WKS performed worse than normal control participants on all of the tasks in this category. The patients found estimations involving time to be the most difficult, whereas quantity was the easiest estimation to make. Additionally, the study included a category for classifying "bizarre" answers, which included any answer that was far outside of the normal range of expected responses. WKS patients did give answers that could fall into such a category and these included answers such as 15s or 1 hour for the estimated length of a shower, or 4&amp;nbsp;kg or 15 tonnes as the weight of a car.&lt;ref name="KScog"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brand |first1=Matthias |last2=Fujiwara |first2=Esther |last3=Kalbe |first3=Elke |last4=Steingass |first4=Hans-Peter |last5=Kessler |first5=Josef |last6=Markowitsch |first6=Hans J. |title=Cognitive Estimation and Affective Judgments in Alcoholic Korsakoff Patients|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=324–34 |year=2003 |pmid=12916646 |doi=10.1076/jcen.25.3.324.13802 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory deficits===
As mentioned previously, the amnesic symptoms of WKS include both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.&lt;ref name="vetreno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vetreno |first1=Ryan Peter |year=2011 |title=Thiamine deficiency-induced neurodegeneration and neurogenesis |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Binghampton University |oclc=781626781 |isbn=978-1-124-75696-7}}{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retrograde deficit has been demonstrated through an inability of WKS patients to recall or recognize information for recent public events. The anterograde memory loss is demonstrated through deficits in tasks that involve [[encoding]] and then recalling lists of words and faces, as well as [[semantic]] learning tasks. WKS patients have also demonstrated difficulties in preservation as evidenced by a deficit in performance on the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]].&lt;ref name="vetreno"/&gt; The retrograde amnesia that accompanies WKS can extend as far back as twenty to thirty years, and there is generally a temporal gradient seen, where earlier memories are recalled better than more recent memories.&lt;ref name="Kopelman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kopelman |first1=M. D. |last2=Thomson |first2=A. D. |last3=Guerrini |first3=I. |last4=Marshall |first4=E. J. |title=The Korsakoff Syndrome: Clinical Aspects, Psychology and Treatment |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=148–54 |year=2009 |pmid=19151162 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely accepted that the critical structures that lead to the memory impairment in WKS are the mammillary bodies, and the thalamic regions.&lt;ref name="Oscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oscar-Berman |first1=Marlene |last2=Pulaski |first2=Joan L. |title=Associative learning and recognition memory in alcoholic Korsakoff patients |journal=Neuropsychology |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=282–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9110334 |doi=10.1037/0894-4105.11.2.282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the aforementioned memory deficits, [[non-declarative memory]] functions appear to be intact in WKS patients. This has been demonstrated through measures that assess [[perceptual priming]].&lt;ref name="vetreno"/&gt;

Other studies have shown deficits in [[recognition memory]] and stimulus-reward associative functions in patients with WKS.&lt;ref name="Oscar" /&gt; The deficit in stimulus-reward functions was demonstrated by Oscar-Berman and Pulaski who presented patients with reinforcements for certain stimuli but not others, and then required the patients to distinguish the rewarded stimuli from the non-rewarded stimuli. WKS patients displayed significant deficits in this task. The researchers were also successful in displaying a deficit in recognition memory by having patients make a yes/no decision as to whether a stimulus was familiar (previously seen) or novel (not previously seen). The patients in this study also showed a significant deficit in their ability to perform this task.&lt;ref name="Oscar" /&gt;

===Confabulation===
People with WKS often show [[confabulation]], spontaneous confabulation being seen more frequently than provoked confabulation.&lt;ref name="confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kessels |first1=Roy P. C. |last2=Kortrijk |first2=Hans E. |last3=Wester |first3=Arie J. |last4=Nys |first4=Gudrun M. S. |title=Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff's syndrome: Role of source memory and executive functioning |journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=220–5 |year=2008 |pmid=18412846 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2008.01758.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous confabulations refer to incorrect memories that the patient holds to be true, and may act on, arising spontaneously without any provocation. Provoked confabulations can occur when a patient is cued to give a response, this may occur in test settings. The spontaneous confabulations viewed in WKS are thought to be produced by an impairment in source memory, where they are unable to remember the spatial and contextual information for an event, and thus may use irrelevant or old memory traces to fill in for the information that they cannot access. It has also been suggested that this behaviour may be due to executive dysfunction where they are unable to inhibit incorrect memories or because they are unable to shift their attention away from an incorrect response.&lt;ref name="confabulation"/&gt;

==Causes==
WKS is usually found in chronic alcoholics. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome results from thiamine deficiency. It is generally agreed that Wernicke encephalopathy results from severe acute deficiency of [[thiamine]] ([[vitamin B]]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), whilst Korsakoff's psychosis is a chronic neurologic [[wikt:sequela|sequela]] of Wernicke encephalopathy. The metabolically active form of thiamine is [[thiamine pyrophosphate]], which plays a major role as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] or coenzyme in glucose metabolism. The enzymes that are dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate are associated with the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the [[Krebs cycle]]), and catalyze the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase|oxidation of pyruvate]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] and [[branched chain amino acids]]. Thus, anything that encourages glucose metabolism will exacerbate an existing clinical or [[sub-clinical]] thiamine deficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

As stated above, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome in the United States is usually found in malnourished [[chronic alcoholic]]s, though it is also found in patients who undergo prolonged [[intravenous]] (IV) therapy without [[vitamin B]]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation, [[gastric bypass|gastric stapling]], [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) stays or [[hunger strikes]]. In some regions, physicians have observed thiamine deficiency brought about by severe malnutrition, particularly in diets consisting mainly of [[white rice|polished rice]], which is thiamine-deficient. The resulting nervous system ailment is called [[beriberi]]. In individuals with sub-clinical thiamine deficiency, a large dose of glucose (either as sweet food, etc. or glucose infusion) can precipitate the onset of overt encephalopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimitat |first1=Craig |last2=Nixon |first2=Peter F. |title=Glucose loading precipitates acute encephalopathy in thiamin-deficient rats |journal=[[Metabolic Brain Disease]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1999 |pmid=10348310 |doi=10.1023/A:1020653312697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18034292&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro |first1=Darren |last2=Zwingmann |first2=Claudia |last3=Chatauret |first3=Nicolas |last4=Butterworth |first4=Roger F. |title=Glucose loading precipitates focal lactic acidosis in the vulnerable medial thalamus of thiamine-deficient rats |journal=Metabolic Brain Disease |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=115–22 |year=2008 |pmid=18034292 |doi=10.1007/s11011-007-9076-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=A.

Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome in alcoholics particularly is associated with [[atrophy]]/[[infarction]] of specific regions of the brain, especially the [[mamillary bodies]]. Other regions include the anterior region of the [[thalamus]] (accounting for amnesic symptoms), the medial dorsal [[thalamus]], the [[basal forebrain]], the median and dorsal [[raphe nuclei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Karl |last2=Agartz |first2=Ingrid |last3=Harper |first3=Clive |last4=Shoaf |first4=Susan |last5=Rawlings |first5=Robert R. |last6=Momenan |first6=Reza |last7=Hommer |first7=Daniel W. |last8=Pfefferbaum |first8=Adolf |last9=Sullivan |first9=Edith V. |last10=Anton |first10=Raymond F. |last11=Drobes |first11=David J. |last12=George |first12=Mark S. |last13=Bares |first13=Roland |last14=Machulla |first14=Hans-Juergen |last15=Mundle |first15=Goetz |last16=Reimold |first16=Matthias |last17=Heinz |first17=Andreas |title=Neuroimaging in Alcoholism: Ethanol and Brain Damage |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=25 |issue=5 Suppl ISBRA |pages=104S–109S |year=2001 |pmid=11391058 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02383.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cerebellum.&lt;ref name=Butterworth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butterworth |first1=RF |title=Pathophysiology of cerebellar dysfunction in the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=20 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S123–6 |year=1993 |id={{INIST|4778798}} |pmid=8334588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One as-yet-unreplicated study has associated susceptibility to this syndrome with a hereditary deficiency of [[transketolase]], an [[enzyme]] that requires thiamine as a coenzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nixon |first1=Peter F. |last2=Kaczmarek |first2=M. Jan |last3=Tate |first3=Jill |last4=Kerr |first4=Ray A. |last5=Price |first5=John |title=An erythrocyte transketolase isoenzyme pattern associated with the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome |journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=278–81 |year=1984 |pmid=6434322 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.1984.tb01181.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-gastrectomy===
The fact that gastrointestinal surgery can lead to the development of WKS was demonstrated in a study that was completed on three patients who recently undergone a gastrectomy. These patients had developed WKS but were not alcoholics and had never suffered from dietary deprivation. WKS developed between 2 and 20 years after the surgery.&lt;ref name="gastrectomy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shimomura |first1=Tatsuo |last2=Mori |first2=Etsuro |last3=Hirono |first3=Nobutsugu |last4=Imamura |first4=Toru |last5=Yamashita |first5=Hikari |title=Development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome after long intervals following gastrectomy |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=55 |issue=9 |pages=1242–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9740119 |url=http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=55&amp;page=1242 |doi=10.1001/archneur.55.9.1242}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were small dietary changes that contributed to the development of WKS but overall the lack of absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract was the cause. Therefore, it must be ensured that patients who have undergone gastrectomy have a proper education on dietary habits, and carefully monitor their thiamine intake. Additionally, an early diagnosis of WKS, should it develop, is very important.&lt;ref name="gastrectomy" /&gt;

===Alcohol–thiamine interactions===
Strong evidence suggests that ethanol interferes directly with thiamine uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. Ethanol also disrupts thiamine storage in the liver and the transformation of thiamine into its active form.&lt;ref name="Todd, K. G. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Todd |first1=Kathryn G. |last2=Hazell |first2=Alan S. |last3=Butterworth |first3=Roger F. |title=Alcohol-thiamine interactions: an update on the pathogenesis of Wernicke encephalopathy |journal=Addiction Biology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=261–72 |year=1999 |pmid=20575793 |doi=10.1080/13556219971470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of alcohol consumption in the development of WKS has been experimentally confirmed through studies in which rats were subjected to alcohol exposure and lower levels thiamine through a low-thiamine diet.&lt;ref name="rats"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=He |first1=Xiaohua |last2=Sullivan |first2=Edith V |last3=Stankovic |first3=Roger K |last4=Harper |first4=Clive G |last5=Pfefferbaum |first5=Adolf |title=Interaction of Thiamine Deficiency and Voluntary Alcohol Consumption Disrupts Rat Corpus Callosum Ultrastructure |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=2207–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17299515 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, studies have demonstrated that clinical signs of the neurological problems that result from thiamine deficiency develop faster in rats that have received alcohol and were also deficient in thiamine than rats who did not receive alcohol.&lt;ref name="rats"/&gt; In another study, it was found that rats that were chronically fed alcohol had significantly lower liver thiamine stores than control rats. This provides an explanation for why alcoholics with [[liver cirrhosis]] have a higher incidence of both thiamine deficiency and WKS.&lt;ref name="Todd, K. G. 1999"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

Brain [[atrophy]] associated with WKS occurs in the following regions of the brain: the [[mammillary bodies]], the [[thalamus]], the [[periaqueductal grey]], the walls of the [[3rd ventricle]], the floor of the 4th ventricle, the cerebellum, and the [[frontal lobe]]. In addition to the damage seen in these areas there have been reports of damage to [[cerebral cortex|cortex]], although it was noted that this may be due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol as opposed to thiamine deficiency that has been attributed as the underlying cause of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.&lt;ref name="korsakoff overview"/&gt;

The amnesia that is associated with this syndrome is a result of the atrophy in the structures of the [[diencephalon]] (the thalamus, [[hypothalamus]] and mammillary bodies), and is similar to [[amnesia]] that is presented as a result of other cases of damage to the [[medial temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name="fMRI WK"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caulo |first1=M. |title=Functional MRI study of diencephalic amnesia in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome |journal=Brain |volume=128 |issue=7 |pages=1584–94 |year=2005 |pmid=15817513 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the memory impairments can occur as a result of damage along any part of the [[mammillo-thalamic tract]], which explains how WKS can develop in patients with damage exclusively to either the thalamus or the mammillary bodies.&lt;ref name="korsakoff overview"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome is by clinical impression and can sometimes be confirmed by a formal neuropsychological assessment. Wernicke [[encephalopathy]] typically presents with [[ataxia]] and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], and Korsakoff's psychosis with anterograde and retrograde [[amnesia]] and confabulation upon relevant lines of questioning.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Frequently, secondary to thiamine deficiency and subsequent cytotoxic edema in Wernicke encephalopathy, patients will have marked degeneration of the [[mamillary bodies]]. Thiamine (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is an essential coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism and is also a regulator of osmotic gradient.  Its deficiency may cause swelling of the intracellular space and local disruption of the blood-brain barrier.  Brain tissue is very sensitive to changes in electrolytes and pressure and edema can be cytotoxic.  In Wernicke this occurs specifically in the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal areas.  Sufferers may also exhibit a dislike for sunlight and so may wish to stay indoors with the lights off. The mechanism of this degeneration is unknown, but it supports the current neurological theory that the mammillary bodies play a role in various "memory circuits" within the brain. An example of a memory circuit is the [[Papez circuit]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Treatment==

The onset of Wernicke encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency, and thus thiamine administration should be initiated immediately when the disease is suspected.&lt;ref name="Sechi"/&gt; Prompt administration of thiamine to patients with Wernicke encephalopathy can prevent the disorder from developing into Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or reduce its severity. Treatment can also reduce the progression of the deficits caused by WKS, but will not completely reverse existing deficits. WKS will continue to be present, at least partially, in 80% of patients.&lt;ref name="treatment"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Victor |first1=M |last2=Adams |first2=RD |last3=Collins |first3=GH |title=The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

If no response is seen then treatment should be discontinued but for those patients that do respond, treatment should be continued with a 250&amp;nbsp;mg dose delivered [[intravenously]] or [[intramuscularly]] for three to five days unless the patient stops improving.

Carter  |author2=Edward Bernstein |lastauthoramp=yes |page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
As described, alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome usually follows or accompanies Wernicke encephalopathy. If treated quickly, it may be possible to prevent the development of AKS with thiamine treatments. This treatment is not guaranteed to be effective and the thiamine needs to be administered adequately in both dose and duration. A study on Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome showed that with consistent thiamine treatment there were noticeable improvements in mental status after only 2–3 weeks of therapy.&lt;ref name="Sechi"/&gt; Thus, there is hope that with treatment Wernicke encephalopathy will not necessarily progress to WKS.

In order to reduce the risk of developing WKS it is important to limit the intake of alcohol or drink in order to ensure that proper nutrition needs are met. A [[healthy diet]] is imperative for proper nutrition which, in combination with thiamine supplements, may reduce the chance of developing WKS. This prevention method may specifically help heavy drinkers who refuse to or are unable to quit.&lt;ref name=Medline771/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Internationally, the prevalence rates of WKS are relatively standard, being anywhere between zero and two percent. Despite this, specific sub-populations seem to have higher prevalence rates including people who are homeless, older individuals (especially those living alone or in isolation), and psychiatric inpatients.&lt;ref name=EMedicine288379&gt;{{EMedicine|article|288379|Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies show that prevalence is not connected to alcohol consumption [[per capita]]. For example, in France, a country that is well known for its consumption and production of wine, prevalence was only 0.4% in 1994, while Australia had a prevalence of 2.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harper |first1=Clive |last2=Fornes |first2=Paul |last3=Duyckaerts |first3=Charles |last4=Lecomte |first4=Dominique |last5=Hauw |first5=Jean-Jacques |title=An international perspective on the prevalence of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome |journal=Metabolic Brain Disease |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=17–24 |year=1995 |pmid=7596325 |doi=10.1007/BF01991779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Wernicke encephalopathy===
[[Carl Wernicke]] discovered [[Wernicke encephalopathy]] in 1881. His first diagnosis noted symptoms including paralyzed eye movements, [[ataxia]], and mental confusion. Also noticed were [[hemorrhages]] in the [[gray matter]] around the third and fourth [[ventricular system|ventricles]] and the [[cerebral aqueduct]]. Brain atrophy was only found upon post-mortem autopsy. Wernicke believed these hemorrhages were due to inflammation and thus the disease was named polioencephalitis haemorrhagica superior. Later, it was found that Wernicke encephalopathy and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome are products of the same cause.&lt;ref name=EMedicine288379/&gt;

===Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome===
[[Sergei Korsakoff]] was a Russian physician after whom the disease "Korsakoff's syndrome" was named. In the late 1800s Korsakoff was studying long-term alcoholic patients and began to notice a decline in their memory function.&lt;ref name=EMedicine288379/&gt; At the 13th International Medical Congress in Moscow in 1897, Korsakoff presented a report called: ''"On a special form of mental illness combined with degenerative polyneuritis".'' After the presentation of this report the term "Korsakoff's syndrome" was coined.&lt;ref name="korsakoff overview"&gt;Kyoko Konishi. (2009) The Cognitive Profile of Elderly Korsakoff's Syndrome Patients.{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although WE and AKS were discovered separately, these two syndromes are usually referred to under one name, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, due to the fact that they are part of the same cause and because the onset of AKS usually follows WE if left untreated.

==Society and culture==
The British neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] describes case histories of some of his patients with the syndrome in the book ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]'' (1985).

==Mission and history==
WTO was founded by [[Jack Sim]] in Singapore on 19 November 2001. Since its inception, WTO has brought together governments, academia, civil society, multilateral agencies and the private sector to explore innovative and sustainable solutions to end the global sanitation crisis. WTO’s mission is to promote the global sanitation movement through collaborative action that inspires and drives demand for [[sanitation]] and provides innovative solutions to achieve [[sustainable sanitation]] for all.
[[File:WTO Mission.png|thumb|338x338px|WTO's Mission]]
Key pillars of WTO’s work:
# Advocate to change policy on sanitation: Through its global advocacy efforts, WTO hopes to break the taboo associated with sanitation. Its advocacy events include the annual World Toilet Summit, [[World Toilet Day]] and Urgent Run.
# Educate to change mind-sets on sanitation: WTO collaborates with grassroots organisations and schools to increase awareness of the importance of sanitation in local communities. It does this via public exhibition roadshows and school sanitation and hygiene promotion programs.
# Build to develop sanitation infrastructure and capacity: WTO builds toilet infrastructure in various schools and communities in several developing countries. It does this directly, for example through the Rainbow Toilet Initiative in China or via its partners, for example in the Floating Community Toilet project in Cambodia.
# Empower to bring about long term social change on sanitation: WTO takes a market-based approach that empowers communities to solve their own sanitation challenges. This is done via the World Toilet College training model which builds capacity for sanitation workers and professionals and also via its social enterprise model, SaniShop.

==Founder==
{{Main article|Jack Sim}}
Jack Sim is the founder of the World Toilet Organization, the BoP HUB and is a global advocate for sanitation. Formerly in the construction industry, he founded WTO in 2001 after attaining financial independence at age of 40 and deciding to devote the rest of his life to social work. For ‘creating good will and bringing the subject into the open’ and ‘mobilizing national support in providing on-the-ground expertise’ Jack Sim received the Schwab Foundation award for Social Entrepreneur of the Year in 2001. In 2007, Jack became one of the key members to convene the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] composed of key players for sanitation. He is an Ashoka Global Fellow, and was named one of the Heroes of the Environment for 2008 by Time Magazine.

== Initiatives ==

===World Toilet Summit===
The World Toilet Summit &amp; Expo (WTS) is a global platform that brings together sanitation stakeholders to share, learn and collaborate to address the global sanitation challenge. The annual summit is jointly organised by a host government or organization involving policy makers, toilet associations, non-profits and for-profit entities and private sector stakeholders in the sanitation sector. WTS aims to empower these key players to exchange knowledge, expertise and resources in scaling up impact and innovation in the sanitation marketplace.

===World Toilet Day===
{{Main article|World Toilet Day}}
WTO was founded on 19 November 2001 and the inaugural WTS was held on the same day. WTO recognized the need for an international day to draw global attention to the sanitation crisis – and so established [[World Toilet Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/11/19/dont-laugh-world-toilet-day-aims-to-promote-sanitation-rid-world-disease/|title=Don't Laugh: World Toilet Day Aims to Promote Sanitation, Rid World of Disease|date=19 November 2008|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs, the private sector, civil society organisations and the international community joined in to mark the global day.

=== Urgent Run ===
Each year, WTO commemorates WTD with the Urgent Run. The Urgent Run is a call for urgent action to end the sanitation crisis and aims to bring communities around the world together to raise awareness for the global sanitation challenge and engage people with sanitation issues in their local communities. For the past few years, in the lead-up to UN World Toilet Day, communities worldwide have come together to organize sanitation-themed Urgent Runs in varying formats and include fun runs, educational events, awareness walks, [[toilet]] cleaning programs, carnivals and even motorbike parades. They are organised by community groups, companies, universities, volunteers and NGOs to engage their local communities on their sanitation challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urgentrun.com/why.php|title=What's the urgency?|last=|first=|date=|website=The Urgent Run|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rainbow School Toilet Initiative ===
Many school toilets in rural China face problems of having old, unhygienic dry system toilets, absent [[hand washing]] facilities, and are often designed where the excreta disposal site is located right behind the toilet building – uncovered and exposed to the environment. Often, these schools lack a cohesive management system to upkeep and maintain the facilities, resulting in the toilet falling into a state of disrepair and neglect. This coupled with students who do not practice good hygiene habits, like handwashing with soap, can result in long-lasting health and environmental consequences.

With the aim of inspiring positive, long-lasting behavioural change among Chinese students, WTO`s Rainbow School Toilet Initiative was launched in 2015. In 2016 4 rural schools, with an estimated 1,300 students (average 300 students per school) benefited from the new toilet buildings equipped with a recyclable wastewater treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;manic, &amp; Sim, J. (22 March 2016). World Toilet. Retrieved 5 May 2017, from http://worldtoilet.org/delivering-hygiene-promotion-classes-to-the-students-of-tai-ping-primary-school-in-badong-county-hubei-province/
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Floating Community Toilet Project ===
Until recently, no proper sanitation solution existed for the almost 100,000 people living in floating communities on Cambodia’s Tonle Sap Lake. To address sanitation issues in these floating communities, Wetlands Work! (WW) developed the HandyPod, a product that contains the raw sewage and treats it by harnessing various biological processes. This project aims to eliminate open defecation by providing sanitation systems to floating schools and teaching students to use toilets; improve sanitation and hygiene; reduce school absences due to diarrhea; increase school attendance especially for girls, as well as driving demand for household toilets.

WTO and WW raised funds for the project through various platforms and in 2016 a total 8 HandyPods have been installed befitting approximately 900 students and 650 indirect beneficiaries in their households. The project was developed with a holistic and sustainable approach of technology (Handypods) and behavioural change (hygiene awareness classes) to the communities.

=== World Toilet College ===
The World Toilet College (WTC) started as a social enterprise in 2005 with the belief that there is a need for an independent world body to ensure best practices and standards in toilet design, cleanliness and sanitation technologies. While the lack of toilets is an endemic problem, poor management and hygienic maintenance are equally serious issues. A well-kept toilet will encourage proper usage and prevent deadly diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/abehal/2015/09/24/world-toilet-college-set-to-open-in-india/#711a25667068 | title=World Toilet College Set To Open In India | work=Forbes | date=24 September 2015}} {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of WTC’s programmes is to ensure the dignity of sanitation workers and elevate the otherwise poor image (and consequent low pay) reserved for this employment category in many places around the world. WTC does this by training and providing toilet cleaners with professional skills in both cleaning and performance of small repairs, thereby boosting their self-confidence. This empowers them with the opportunity to master the profession while at the same time enhancing their productivity. Since 2005 WTC has trained more than 5,000 people across its various courses and conducted programmes and courses.

=== SaniShop ===
WTO created SaniShop, a social enterprise that improves sanitation conditions globally by empowering local entrepreneurs. The organization started its market-based approach in Cambodia in 2009 in collaboration with the University of North Carolina, Lien Aid and iDE in Kampung Speu. Since then SaniShop has built more than 12,000 household toilets and trained more than 526 sales entrepreneurs in 7 provinces.

The SaniShop model is a self-sustaining market ecosystem. WTO teaches community members to educate and spread messaging regarding the importance of good hygiene and sanitation, whilst training masons to build new toilets and to market them to their community. WTO believes in addressing the issue of inadequate sanitation and to end open defecation via a multi-pronged approach that inspires behavioural change both in the individual, and community.
