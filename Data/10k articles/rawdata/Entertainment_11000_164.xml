'''''Albion Online'' (AO)''' is a [[medieval]] [[fantasy]] [[MMORPG]] developed by Sandbox Interactive, a studio based in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://albiononline.com/en/jobs|title=Careers at Sandbox Interactive|work=www.albiononline.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the beta stages of development, players were able to purchase "Founder's Packs" to gain access to the closed beta play-tests which were run intermittently by Sandbox Interactive, typically after an interval of a few months of development.  These Founder packs are no longer available, since the release of the full game. Albion Online removed its free-to-play model for various reasons on December 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/27962-Road-to-Release/|title = Road to Release - Albion Online Forum|website = Albion Online Forum|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its release on July 17, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://albiononline.com/en/news/albion-online-official-release|title=Albion Online- The Journey Starts NOW!|work=www.albiononline.com|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albion online now offers a selection of "Starter Packs" which grant players access to the game and offer a varying amount of gold to get started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://albiononline.com/en/founderpacks|title=Albion Online:Become a Founder|work=www.albiononline.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a player purchases any of the starter packs, they will be granted open-ended access to the game with no extra mandatory fees. It is possible to purchase gold (in-game premium currency) to gain a further advantage. Players can also purchase membership for a limited amount of time without the benefits of the starter packs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2183">{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}The '''armwrestling match of EAP robotic arm against human''' ('''AMERAH''') is a challenge posed by [[Yoseph Bar-Cohen]] of the [[JPL]] in 1999. The initial challenge is to create a simple human-like robotic arm which, using [[electroactive polymers]] (EAP) as artificial muscles, can beat a [[human]] opponent (e.g., a high school student) in an [[arm wrestling]] match. The ultimate goal, however, is to create an arm using EAP as similar as possible to a human arm, which can beat any human in an arm wrestling competition. The competition aims to stimulate research in the field of electroactive polymers, as well as arouse interest both in the general public and among potential investors.

The first trial was held on March 7, 2005 at the [[The International Society for Optical Engineering|International Society for Optical Engineering]]'s (SPIE) 2005 Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices (EAPAD) conference  in [[San Diego, California]]. Three teams entered robotic contestants:

*[[Environmental Robots Incorporated]], of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]];
*The [[Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research]] (EMPA), of [[Dübendorf]], [[Switzerland]];
*A team of three undergraduate students from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]: Steven Deso, Stephen Ros, and Noah Papas, advised by John Cotton, an associate professor.

The human opponent was Panna Felsen, a straight-A high school student from the San Diego school district with an interest in robotics. She beat all three robotic contenders easily, one in just three seconds.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

'''''Babysitting Mania''''' is a simulation-style, time-management game developed by [[Gogii Games]] and iWin and available for [[macOS|OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and the [[Nintendo DS]]. The game allows the player to [[babysit]] many virtual children while cleaning the house and managing parties all under a certain time limit.  The game is available for free as a download from iWin.com.

The player has a limited amount of time to keep the chaos meter down by clicking items with a red outline, washing clothes, or putting rubbish in the bin.  If the player does not manage the chaos, the player will not be able to put the children to bed.  If the player does not do it before the parents come home then the player will have to retry the level.  To make it more difficult, there are different and larger houses in which the kids get more chaotic.

'''''Blueberry''''' is [[western (genre)|Western]] comic series created in the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian ''bandes dessinées'']] (BD) tradition by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Script (comics)|scriptwriter]] [[Jean-Michel Charlier]] and [[France|French]] [[comics artist]] [[Jean Giraud|Jean "Mœbius" Giraud]]. It chronicles the adventures of Mike Blueberry on his travels through the [[American Old West]]. Blueberry is an atypical western hero; he is not a wandering lawman who brings evil-doers to justice, nor a handsome cowboy who "rides into town, saves the ranch, becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm."&lt;ref name="marvelage"&gt;R.J.M. Lofficier: Before Nick Fury, There was... Lieutenant Blueberry in Marvel Age #79 October, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In any situation, he sees what he thinks needs doing, and he does it.

The series spawned out of the 1963 ''Fort Navajo'' comics series, originally intended as an ensemble narrative, but which quickly gravitated around the [[breakout character]] "Blueberry" as the main and central character after the first two stories, causing the series to continue under his name later on. The older stories, released under the ''Fort Navajo'' moniker, were ultimately reissued under the name ''Blueberry'' as well in later reprint runs. Two [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s series, '''''La Jeunesse de Blueberry''''' ('''''Young Blueberry''''') and '''''Marshal Blueberry''''', were created pursuant the main series reaching its peak in popularity in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/giraud.htm "Lambiek Comiclopedia: Jean Giraud"], Lambiek.net&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been remarked that during the 1960s, Blueberry "was as much a staple in French comics as, say, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' or ''[[The Flash]]'' here [in the USA]."&lt;ref name="DAK64"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lofficier | first = Jean-Marc | date = December 1988 | title = Moebius | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 64 | pages = 24–37 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Born on 30 October 1843 on Redwood Plantation near [[Augusta, Georgia]], '''Michael Steven Donovan''' is the son of a rich [[Southern United States|Southern]] planter and starts out life as a decided [[racist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mike Steve Donovan" in the original publication. Date and place of birth as provided by co-creator Charlier in his fictional ''Blueberry'' biography included in the 1974 book ''Ballade pour un cercueil''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the brink of the [[American Civil War]], Donovan is forced to flee north after being framed for the murder of his fiancée Harriet Tucker's father, a plantation owner. On his flight toward the [[Kentucky]] border, he is saved by Long Sam, a fugitive [[African-American]] slave from his father's estate, who paid with his life for his act of altruism. Inspired when he sees a [[blueberry]] bush, Donovan chooses the surname "'''Blueberry'''" as an alias when rescued from his Southern pursuers by a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[cavalry]] patrol (during his flight war had broken out between the States). After enlisting in the [[Union Army]], he becomes an enemy of [[discrimination]] of all kinds, fighting against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] (although being a Southerner himself, first enlisting as a [[bugler]] in order to avoid having to fire upon his former countrymen), later trying to protect the rights of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. He starts his adventures in the [[American frontier|Far West]] as a lieutenant in the [[United States Cavalry]] shortly after the war. On his many travels in the West, Blueberry is frequently accompanied by his trusted companions, the hard-drinking deputy Jimmy McClure, and later also by "Red Neck" Wooley, a rugged pioneer and army scout.

{{Main|List of Blueberry characters}}

==Publication history==
In his youth, Giraud had been a passionate fan of American [[Westerns]] and ''Blueberry'' has its roots in his earlier [[Western comics|Western]]-themed works such as the ''Frank et Jeremie'' shorts, which were drawn for ''Far West'' magazine when he was only 18 &amp;ndash; also having been his first sales as free-lancer &amp;ndash; , the Western short stories he created for the magazines from French publisher [[:fr:Fleurus presse|Fleurus]] (his first professional tenured employment as comic artist in the period 1956-1958), and his collaboration with [[Jijé|Joseph "Jijé" Gillain]] on an episode of the latter's ''[[Jerry Spring]]'' series in 1960, which appeared in the [[Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' ("[[:fr:La Route de Coronado]]", issues 1192 – 1213, 1961), aside from his subsequent Western contributions to Benoit Gillian's (son of Jijé) short-lived comic magazine ''Bonux-Boy'' (1960/61). Directly before he started his apprenticeship at Jijé, Jean Giraud had already approached Jean-Michel Charlier on his own accord, asking him if he was interested in writing scripts for a new western series for publication in ''[[Pilote]]'', the just by Charlier co-launched legendary French comic magazine.&lt;ref name="pilote"&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, pp. 141-228]]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier refused on that occasion, claiming he never felt much empathy for the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|''Collective'', 1986, p. 21]]; [[#Sources|Berner, 2003, p. 23]]&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[:fr:Gilles Ratier]] though, has noted that Charlier, when he felt he was preaching to the choir, had the tendency to "take liberties" with actual events for dramatic effect. Charlier had in effect already written several Westerns, both comics and illustrated short prose stories, in the period 1949-1959 for various previous magazines. One such short entailed the [[Text comics|text comic]] "[[Cochise]]" in ''Jeannot'' magazine, July 1957, dealing with the historical "[[Bascom Affair]]", which six years later would become the apotheosis of the first ''Blueberry'' story, "Fort Navajo". Furthermore, Charlier had already visited the South-West of the United States in 1960, resulting in several Native-American themed educational ''Pilote'' editorials.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, pp. 118-120, 205]]; [http://www.jmcharlier.com/recits.html#jeannot "Récits authentiques dans Jeannot"], JMCharlier.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the magazine sent Charlier on a reporting assignment around the world for its editorials, and one of his last 1963 ports of call was [[Edwards Airforce Base]] in the [[Mojave Desert]], California. He took the opportunity to (re-)discover the American West, returning to France with a strong urge to write a western.&lt;ref name="pilote"/&gt; First he asked Jijé to draw the series, but Jijé, a lifelong friend and collaborator of Charlier, thought there would be a conflict of interest, since he was then a tenured artist at ''Spirou'', a competing comic magazine, which published his own Western comic ''Jerry Spring'', and in which he was very much invested.&lt;ref name=blue2-afterword&gt;Afterword by Jean-Michel Charlier in Blueberry 2: Ballad for a Coffin. Epic Comics. 1989 {{ISBN|0871355701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his stead, Jijé proposed his protégé Giraud as the artist.&lt;ref name="lambiek"/&gt; A happy coincidence was that Giraud was also intimately familiar with the landscapes that had inspired Charlier, as he already had been on an extended stay of nine months in Mexico in 1956, where the endless blue skies and unending flat plains of Mexico's northern deserts had "cracked open his mind".&lt;ref&gt;''Moebius Redux: A Life in Pictures '' documentary, {{OCLC|891515384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier and Giraud have also collaborated on another Western strip, ''[[#Jim Cutlass|Jim Cutlass]]''.

{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="Charlier, together with [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] the editors-in-chief, wanted a western. He already had outlines in mind, but asked me to come up with a name. He suggested a couple of names, which sounded not bad, but I wanted something softer for this rough and basic character. It was then that I saw that somebody had signed with the name "Blueberry" in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|Geographic Magazine]]'', which was lying opened in front of me, purely by coincident. That was the right choice, and Charlier liked the name as well. For the hero's facial traits, I chose Belmondo, as he was at the time something of an art symbol for guys my age."|salign=right|source=—Giraud, 1975, on his claim of inventing the name Blueberry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 156]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="[The idea of giving Blueberry Belmondo's face] originated from the both of us. That came about this way: To have Blueberry come across as a non-conformist, I described him right from the start as uncombed, disheveled, unshaven, broken nosed, etc. After he had read that, Jean exclaimed to me, ''"That's Belmondo!"''"|salign=right|source=—Charlier, 1978, on conceiving the initial countenance of Blueberry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Berner, 2003, p. 24]] (quoted from the ''SCHTROUMPF: Les Cahiers De La Bd'', issue 37, magazine interview, [[Glénat Editions|Glénat]], 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
:''note: English titles in parentheses where they exist and when first mentioned, original titles only where none are available''
''Blueberry'' was first published in the October 31, 1963 issue of ''Pilote'' magazine&lt;ref name=BDO-p&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1963.htm "Pilote année 1963"], BDoubliées.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; hence Charlier's corresponding October 30 birth-date for his fictional character, when the magazine was printed and ready for dissemination. Initially titled "Fort Navajo", the story grew into 46 pages over the following issues. In this series Blueberry &amp;ndash; whose physical appearance was inspired by French actor [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blueberry "Comicbook/Blueberry"], TVtropes.com&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; was only one of many protagonists; the series was originally intended to be an assemble narrative, but quickly gravitated towards Blueberry as the central and primary character, even though the series' (sub-)title ''Fort Navajo, une Aventure du Lieutenant Blueberry'' was maintained for a decade by original publisher [[Dargaud]] for the numerous reprint, and international, runs, before the "Fort Navajo" (sub-)moniker was finally dropped in 1973 with the book publication of "L'homme qui valait 500 000 $" ("The Half-a-Million Dollar Man"). Charlier came up with the name during his American trip: "When I was traveling throughout the West, I was accompanied by a fellow journalist who was just in love with blueberry jam, so much in love, in fact, that I had nicknamed him 'Blueberry'. When I began to create the new series, and everything started to fall into place, I decided to reuse my friend's nickname, because I liked it and thought it was funny. [...] I had no idea that he would prove so popular that he would eventually take over the entire series, and later we would be stuck with that silly name!"&lt;ref name="blue2-afterword"/&gt; In an anecdote, Charlier related how caught off guard he had been, "My memory is a somewhat like a sieve. In the first album, Blueberry was called Steve. I forgot that first name and then I named him Mike. So, in order to get things straight, I coined him Mike Steve Blueberry eventually; This kind of forgetfulness happens to me often."&lt;ref name="Ratier, 2013, p. 205"&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, p. 205]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that Blueberry became the most popular character so early on in the ''Fort Navajo'' story-arc, Charlier was forced to do an about-face and started to write out the other main characters he had in place in order to make room for Blueberry. However, in one instance that had an unexpected side effect; when Charlier killed off the Native-American [[List of Blueberry characters|lieutenant Crowe]] in the fifth and last installment of the story-arc, "La piste des Navajos" ("Trail of the Navajo"), the editorial offices of ''Pilote'' received many angry letters from readers accusing Charlier of murdering a sympathetic protagonist. Taken aback, Charlier later stated, "It was too late to do anything about it, it was done. A strange experience, Giraud in particular took it very hard." Still, while all characters slated for prominence were written out, Blueberry excepted, one major, recurrent secondary character was written in over the course of the story arc in "Le cavalier perdu" ("Mission to Mexico"), Blueberry's trusted friend and sidekick Jimmy McClure. Actually, and by his own admission, Charlier had originally written McClure as a temporary, minor background character, but Giraud was so taken with the character that he asked Charlier to expand his role in the series, and which stands out as the earliest known instance of Giraud exercising influence on the scripts of his senior colleague.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, p. 41]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-war Europe, it has been tradition to release comics in "pre-publication" as serialized magazine episodes, before publication as a comic book, or rather [[comic album]] (in North-American understanding though, "[[graphic novel]]" is the more applicable terminology in this case, the distinction being a non-issue in native France), typically with a one to two year lag. In French, ''Blueberry'' has firstly seen pre-publication in ''Pilote'' (issue 210, 31 October 1963 &amp;ndash; issue 720, 23 August 1973) and ''[[:fr:Super Pocket Pilote]]'' (issue 1, 1 July 1963 &amp;ndash; issue 9, 19 October 1970)&lt;ref name="pocketpilote"&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/revue-Super-Pocket-Pilote.html "''Super Pocket Pilote''"] ({{OCLC|474397159}}), Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; from publisher Dargaud, the parent and main publisher of ''Blueberry'', with Giraud frequently creating original ''Blueberry'' art for the magazine covers and illustrations for editorials, aside from creating on occasion summarizing, introduction plates, none of which reprinted in the original book editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/blueberry.htm "Fort Navajo (Blueberry) dans Pilote"], Bdoubliees.com {{fr icon}}; Where applicable, the introduction plates, as were some of the magazine covers, ''were'' included in the American Epic publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, much of this material did find its way in later reprint variations, particularly in the editorials of the 2012 (trade) main series anthology collection &amp;ndash; invariably called "integrals" in their respective languages in mainland Europe &amp;ndash; of parent publisher Dargaud,&lt;ref name="integrale"&gt;[http://www.bedetheque.com/serie-5160-BD-Blueberry-Integrale.html "''Blueberry Intégrale''"] (2012 nine-volume series), Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}; Actually, when discounting the [[#Prequel: La Jeunesse de Blueberry (Young Blueberry)|1984 co-publication with Rombaldi]], Dargaud's first serious attempt to release an integral &amp;ndash; main series only &amp;ndash; collection themselves, after a [https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Blueberry-INT-1-Integrale-1-21347.html false start in 1988], and only initiated ''after'' the previous licensed Egmont releases had proven to be successful, particularly in Germany. As of 2017, Dargaud's collection is translated in Spanish, Dutch, Finnish and Swedish, the Swedes having previously foregone participation in Egmont's collection project.&lt;/ref&gt; and in those of their licensees such as [[Egmont Group|Egmont]] for their earlier German/Danish/Norwegian 2006-2011 '''all'''-series integral edition collection&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?collectie=1937&amp;sort=collectienr "''Die Blueberry Chroniken''"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes all three language editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="werkausgabe"&gt;[http://www.comicforum.de/showthread.php?73522-Blueberry-Werkausgabe "Blueberry-Werkausgabe"], EhapaComicForum.de {{de icon}}; originally this collection was also slated to appear in Swedish, but the Egmont affiliated publisher for that language edition opted out at the last moment.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first (French) ''Blueberry'' comic album, "Fort Navajo", was released in September 1965 and originally appeared as the 17th (and last) volume of the ''La Collection Pilote'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/search/albums?RechCollection=La+Collection+Pilote&amp;RechEO=1 "''La Collection Pilote''"], Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, this collection had been an initiative of Charlier himself in his function as publishing co-editor, and the 17 titles in the collection were in effect Dargaud's first comic album releases, and an influential release at that. In order to give these releases a more "mature" image, the books were from the start executed as hard cover editions. Favorably received and though not being the first, the hard cover format became the norm in France definitively, where henceforth all comic albums were executed in the format &amp;ndash; becoming indeed generally accepted as a mature part of French culture eventually&lt;ref&gt;In France, and at a later point in time in French-Belgium &amp;ndash; the actual birthplace of the modern European comic &amp;ndash; as well, comics are invariably considered, and officially recognized, as "[[:fr:Classification des arts|Le Neuvième Art]]" ("the 9th art"), in no small part due to the efforts in the 1980s of French minister of culture, [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]. While the expression is also used in other countries, albeit unofficially, none have afforded the medium the same status. Lang incidentally, personally presented Giraud his 1985 Angoulême Award for ''Blueberry''. (''[http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detail.cfm?Id=296 BDParadiso.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925123136/http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detail.cfm?Id=296 |date=2008-09-25 }}'')&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; , whereas the vast majority of the other European countries continued to employ the soft cover format for decades to come, somewhat reflecting the status comic books had in their societies at the time. These included for the time being French-Belgium as well, Charlier's native country, where exactly the same collection was concurrently licensed to, and released by [[Le Lombard]], albeit as soft cover only. Charlier's initiative was not entirely devoid of a healthy dose of self-interest, as over half the releases in the collection, were, aside from ''Blueberry'', titles from other comic series he had co-created. After "Fort Navajo", the collection was suspended and each comic hero hitherto featured therein, spun off in book series of their own, including ''Blueberry'' or rather ''Fort Navajo, une Aventure du Lieutenant Blueberry'' as it was then still coined.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Intégrale Tanguy et Laverdure 2'': "L'escadrille des cigognes", Paris:Dargaud, 2015, pp. 6–8, {{ISBN|9782205073119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dargaud had lost publishing rights for over a decade for new ''Blueberry'' titles to firstly German publisher [[:de:Koralle-Verlag]] and subsequently to Belgian publisher [[:fr:Novedi|Novedi]], as a result from a conflict with the creators over ''Blueberry'' royalties, the series has seen, predominantly one-time only, French pre-publication in such comic magazines as ''[[Métal Hurlant]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/metalhurlant/series1/blueberry.htm "Blueberry dans Metal Hurlant"], Bdoubliees.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[L'Écho des savanes]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/echodessavanes/series1/blueberry.htm "Blueberry dans l'Echo des Savanes"], Bdoubliees.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[:fr:Super As|Super As]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/superas/series/blueberry.htm "Blueberry dans Super As"], Bdoubliees.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries followed the same template with local magazines. However, the format, for decades a staple in Europe and shaping entire generations of comic readers, went out of vogue in the late 1980s/early 1990s and the vast majority of European comic magazines have since then become defunct by the mid 1990s, including those from Belgium, the country were the phenomenon was born in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="croa"&gt;A very notable exception had been Croatia, where the format has managed to persevere, as recent as the late 2000s/early 2010s.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, while "Le bout de la piste" ("The End of the Trail") and "Arizona Love" became main series titles to see serialized pre-publication elsewhere, neither were serialized as such in France itself, where "La tribu fantôme" ("The Ghost Tribe") had previously become the very last ''Blueberry'' title pre-published as such in ''L'Écho des savanes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tebeosfera.com/obras/series/blueberry_charlier_giraud_1963.html "FORT NAVAJO (LIEUTENNANT BLUEBERRY)"], Tebeosfera.com {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, new ''Blueberry'' titles were directly released in album format, starting with the 1990 ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' (''Young Blueberry'') title, "Le raid infernal". Any subsequent French magazine, or newspaper serialized publication occurred ''after'' the initial book release while ''Blueberry'' was housed at Novedi and its successor, Swiss publisher [[:fr:Alpen Publishers]], and which had actually already included "Angel Face" in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Nouveau Tintin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/journaltintin/series1/blueberry.htm "Blueberry dans le journal Tintin"], BDoubliees.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "La dernière carte" ("The Last Card") in ''Spirou''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/series1/blueberry.htm "Blueberry dans le journal Spirou"], BDoubliees.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously, both having been serialized after their respective book releases.

After Charlier had died on 10 July 1989, Giraud, aside from completing "Arizona Love" on his own, wrote and drew five albums, from "Mister Blueberry" to "Dust" (constituting the ''OK Corral'' story arc), until his own death in 2012. Additionally, Giraud also scripted the intermezzo series ''Marshal Blueberry'' (1991-2000), but had no creative input for the ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' prequel series, after the first three, original volumes.

By the time Giraud embarked on the ''OK Corral'' cycle, publishing rights had returned to Dargaud, and that publisher decided to revitalize the magazine serialized pre-publication format as part of their marketing effort on behalf of ''Blueberry''{{'}}s return  (see ''[[#Return to the parent publisher (1993-)|below]]''), albeit with a twist; As Dargaud no longer had a comic magazine of their own (''Pilote'' had become defunct in 1989), it was decided to farm out pre-publication to parties who showed the most interest, resulting in that ''Blueberry'' titles in that cycle became serialized in different publications, not all necessarily comic-related by origin. The summer of 1997 saw the serialization of "Ombres sur Tombstone" in the French daily [[newspaper]] ''[[Le Monde]]'', followed by the pre-publication of "Géronimo l’Apache" in the monthly ''[[:fr:BoDoï]]'' comic magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/bodoi/series1/blueberry.htm "Blueberry dans BoDoï"], BDoubliees.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly before the album release in October 1999 as part of Dargaud's substantial marketing campaign for the album. The next title, "OK Corral", was published in a similar manner in the summer of 2003 in the "L'ExpressMag" appendix of the non-comic weekly [[news magazine]] ''[[L'Express]]''.

The mere fact that serious newspapers and magazines were by then vying for the opportunity to run ''Blueberry'' in their publications first (aside from the above-mentioned publications, the newspaper ''[[France-Soir]]'' had already run the first two outings of the revitalized ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' series in 1985 and 1987 &amp;ndash; see ''[[#Change of artist|below]]''), was testament to the status ''Blueberry'' and its creator(s) had by then attained in French society.

====Royalties conflict (1974–1979)====
{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="That was a coincidence all right. It coincided with the break between Jean-Michel and Dargaud, where questionable issues in regard to [[authors' rights]] were in play."|salign=right|source=—Giraud, 1988, when asked if the format change of ''Pilote'' from a weekly to monthly magazine had anything to do with the creators leaving.&lt;ref name="Sadoul, 1991, p. 163"&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 163]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
With the growing popularity of ''Blueberry'' came the increasing disenchantment over financial remunerations of the series. Already in 1974, Charlier made his displeasure known in this regard, when he had "Angel Face" pre-published in ''Nouveau Tintin'' of industry competitor Le Lombard, the very first time a ''Blueberry'' adventure was not serialized in ''Pilote'' &amp;ndash; nor would it ever be again in hindsight. The magazine was forced to drop the announcement page it had prepared for the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 82]]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfazed, Dargaud founder and owner [[:fr:Georges Dargaud|Georges Dargaud]], unwilling to give in, countered by having the book released before ''Nouveau Tintin'' had even had the chance to run the story. Then Giraud left on his own accord. While Charlier had no influence on this whatsoever, it did serve a purpose as far as he was concerned. Giraud had left ''Blueberry'' on a cliff-hanger with "Angel Face", resulting in an insatiable demand for more, putting the pressure on Dargaud. Whenever Georges Dargaud asked Charlier for a next ''Blueberry'' adventure, repeatedly, Charlier was now able to respond that he was "devoid of inspiration".&lt;ref name="fueri"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fuéri |first=Jean-Pierre |title=Au nom du père, du fils et de St Blueberry |year=November 1999 |publisher=LZ Publications|location=Paris |work=BoDoï |issue=24 |pages=35–36, 38 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stripspeciaalzaak.be"&gt;[http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Toppers/FransenTop/30_Blueberry13.htm "Fransen Top 30: Blueberry 13 - Chihuahua Pearl"], Stripspeciaalzaak.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of fact, Giraud was dying to leave ''Pilote'' and ''Blueberry'', partly because he was tired of the stifling publication pressure he was under in order to produce the series, partly because of the royalties conflict, but ''mostly'' because he wanted to further explore and develop his "Mœbius" alter ego. For Giraud the conflict was actually a godsend, "At that moment Charlier and I also had a financial conflict with Dargaud which came at the exact right time, because it provided me with an alibi [to leave]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, pp. 17-19]]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reason for him to leave, took on an urgency after [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], impressed by his ''Blueberry'' art, had already invited Giraud to come over to [[Los Angeles]] to work as concept designer and storyboard artist on [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|his ''Dune'' movie project]] earlier that year, constituting the first Jodorowsky/Mœbius collaboration. Very eager to return to Los Angeles as Jodorowksy requested his presence again, Giraud &amp;ndash; who had returned to France for his other work during one of the lulls in the ''Dune'' production &amp;ndash; greatly accelerated his work on "Angel Face", then underway, breaking his "absolute record speed-drawing", as he had coined it, and sheared off weeks from its originally intended completion date.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, p. 24]]&lt;/ref&gt; Giraud in overdrive was so fast that he even overtook Charlier's script pages (Charlier habitually fed his artists piecemeal with script pages, usually a couple at the time), forcing him to write ten pages of the story on his own, as Charlier was at that time on documentary assignment in the United States for French television. Upon his return, Charlier took one look at the pages completed in his absence, and continued where Giraud had left off without further much ado.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 157]]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier himself had actually already left Dargaud in 1972, because he additionally felt ill at ease with the editorial modernization of ''Pilote'', which resulted from the 1968 revolt at the editorial offices staged by key artists, chief among them Giraud (see also: "''[[Jean Giraud#Notes|Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote]]''").&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, pp. 226-227]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Charlier continued to provide his younger colleague with scripts (but not his other artists), he started working as documentary maker for French television. It was while he was working on two documentaries on the [[Mexican Revolution]] that he gained inspiration for his below-mentioned ''Les Gringos'' Western comic series, which started its run in 1979 at Koralle.&lt;ref name="hoff"&gt;{{cite news  |last=van der Hoff |first=Marcel |last2=van Helden |first2=Wim |title=Charlier: De nieuwe bladen? "Veel geweld, veel porno, maar weinig of geen enkele rechtvaardiging voor wat ze brengen". |year=July 1977 |publisher=Thespa |location=Amsterdam |work=Stripschrift |issue=101 |pages=16–19 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first time that Giraud wrote for ''Blueberry'' by himself, and was, considering Charlier's easy acceptance of Giraud's writing, also testament to the close, and trusting working relationship both men had cultivated by that time. Incidentally, Giraud intimated that the deteriorating circumstances at ''Pilote'' had already left its mark on him before he left, "The story was started in 1972/73 but remained shelved until 1975 [sic.]. Yet, I think one can not discern its difficult birth; there are good scenes, pages I really poured heart and soul into. It is true that [the art for] "Le hors-la-loi" ("The Outlaw") had been quite weak, but "Angel Face" made up for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 161]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years later, Giraud was ready to return to ''Blueberry'', at long last feeling the urge again to do so, but ''not'' into the employ of ''Pilote''/Dargaud, as he had formally terminated his position in 1974 with no intention whatsoever to return, instead plying his ''Blueberry'' trade as a [[freelancer]], "Publishers were waving with those fat checks, so we started again. But it is no longer the same. I won't be taken in by ''Blueberry'' anymore!", referring to the first half of the 1970s when he felt smothered by his co-creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, p. 27]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the whole business surrounding ''Blueberry'' residuals itself remained unresolved, and in order to drive home the point the pe-publication of the eagerly awaited "Nez Cassé" ("Broken Nose") story was farmed out to ''Métal Hurlant'' magazine (published by [[Les Humanoïdes Associés]], co-founded by Giraud in 1974, and in the US released as ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' in the mid-1970s, though the story was not run in the American version), instead of ''Pilote''. That Charlier was able to repeat this ploy after "Angel Face" stemmed from the proviso he had built in when he signed over the publication, and copyrights of his [[Print syndication|syndication]] agency EdiFrance/EdiPresse &amp;ndash; co-established in 1955 with [[Victor Hubinon]], [[Albert Uderzo]], and [[René Goscinny]] for the express purpose to syndicate their own and other artist's comic creations &amp;ndash; to Dargaud in 1960. On that occasion Charlier, owning a law degree,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|''Collective'', 1986, p. 85]]&lt;/ref&gt; stipulated an exemption clause for magazine (pre-)publications of his own (co-)creations.&lt;ref&gt;''Blueberry'', "Intégrale 1", Paris: Dargaud, 2012, p. 5, {{ISBN|9782205071238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though never intended as such, the hitherto dormant exemption clause now served him well in his conflict with Dargaud, without having to fear for any legal ramifications on Dargaud's part. Yet, Georges Dargaud refused to take the bait and the creators subsequently put forward the ''Jim Cutlass'' western comic as a last ditch effort to spell out to Dargaud that the creators had other options. Dargaud still would not budge. It was then that it became clear to Charlier, that he was left with no other option than to leave, and this he did taking all his other co-creations with him, to wit ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Redbeard]]'' and ''[[Tanguy et Laverdure]]'', which, while not as popular as ''Blueberry'', were steady money making properties for Dargaud nonetheless.&lt;ref name="pilote"/&gt;

====Blueberry's publishing wanderings (1979–1990)====
Though they were still contractually obligated to leave their most recent ''Blueberry'' title, "Nez Cassé", at Dargaud for book publication, Charlier and Giraud then threw in their lot with German publisher Koralle-Verlag &amp;ndash; incidentally the first German language ''Blueberry'' book publisher back in the early 1970s &amp;ndash; , a subsidiary at the time of German media giant [[Axel Springer SE]], for their next publication, "La longue marche" ("The Long March"). The choice for the German publisher was made for their very ambitious international expansion strategy they had in place at that time. Fully subscribing to the publisher's strategy, Charlier not only revitalized his ''Redbeard'' and ''Tanguy et Laverdure'' comic series &amp;ndash; having been equally "devoid of inspiration" for these as well in the 1974-1979 ''Pilote''-era because of the royalties issue &amp;ndash; , but created the new Western comic, ''Les Gringos'' (art by [[Victor de la Fuente]]), as well. Yet, for all Charlier's business acumen, he had failed to recognize that Koralle's exuberant expansion drive had essentially been a do-or-die effort on their part. In 1978 Koralle was on the verge of bankruptcy, and a scheme was devised to stave off this fate; international expansion. In the European comics world that was a rather novel idea at the time and Koralle did expand beyond the German border into large parts of Europe with variants of their main publication ''[[:de:Zack (Zeitschrift)|Zack]]'' magazine, with the revived ''Blueberry'' as its flagship, accompanied with comic book releases.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Intégrale Barbe-Rouge'' 8: "L'île des vaisseaux perdus", Paris: Dargaud, 2016, pp. 26-29, {{ISBN|9782205075496}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not pay off however, as the holding company already pulled the plug in 1980, leaving ''Blueberry'' and the others quite unexpectedly without a publishing home.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Jurgeit, 2003, p. 10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It were not only the ''Blueberry'' creators that were left in a pickle, as Koralle had managed to convince other well known Franco-Belgian comic artists to switch sides. Aside from Giraud's old mentor Jijé (who, having abandoned his own ''Jerry Spring'' Western comic, was now penciling Charlier's revitalized ''Redbeard'' and ''Tanguy et Laverdure''), these predominantly concerned artists from publishing house Le Lombard. The most prominent of the latter was [[Hermann Huppen]] with his new post-apocalyptic Western ''[[Jeremiah (comic)|Jeremiah]]'' for which he had abandoned that other famed 1970s Franco-Belgian Western, ''[[:fr:Comanche (bande dessinée)|Comanche]]'' (written by [[Greg (cartoonist)|Greg]]), second only in renown after ''Blueberry'' at the time.&lt;ref name="bigfive"&gt;The "big five" Franco-Belgian realistic Western comics of the 1970s constituted in descending order of popularity, ''Blueberry'', ''Comanche'' (Le Lombard), ''[[Buddy Longway]]'' (Le Lombard), ''[[:fr:Mac Coy]]'' (Dargaud) and ''[[:fr:Jonathan Cartland]]'' (Dargaud); The hitherto most popular Western, ''Jerry Spring'', had by 1970 become irrelevant '''''because''''' of ''Blueberry''{{'}}s success.&lt;/ref&gt; Tapping into his substantial social Franco-Belgian comic network, Charlier found Jacques de Kezel &amp;ndash; a highly influential behind-the-scenes figure of the Belgian comic world at those times, and who had actually gathered the stable of artists for Koralle &amp;ndash; willing for Axel Springer to pass the torch to. As a token of goodwill, a relieved Springer, as they now could turn over the current contractual obligations without much further ado, even allowed the French-language version of ''Zack'', ''Super As'', to run for a few issues longer in order to allow as many series as possible to complete their magazine run, which included "La longue marche". De Kezel's new publishing house [[:fr:Novedi|Les Nouvelles Editions Internationales S.A.]] (Novedi) was established in November 1980 with its seat in Brussels, Belgium. Part of their strategy was to forego on a magazine of their own and instead release titles directly in album format, as it was noticed that the serialized comic magazine format had already started to wane in Europe as a format (and actually one of the main reasons for Axel Springer to pull the plug on Koralle), resulting in the advantage of not having to incur the expenses of maintaining magazine editorial offices. Any still existing comic magazine elsewhere, willing to publish serialized comic series after the initial book releases, was merely considered an added bonus.&lt;ref name="novedi"&gt;Schifferstein, Mat. "Margreet van Muijlwijk over de behoedzame politiek van uitgeverij Novedi: Kwaliteit en bestendigheid", ''Stripschrift'', issue 198/199, pp. 38-43 &amp; insert page 9, [[Zeist]]: Vonk, August/September 1985 {{nl icon}}; Relatively small Belgian publishing house Novedi released their books, including ''Blueberry'', themselves for Belgium and the Netherlands. For the other European countries, including France, Novedi farmed out publication licenses to local publishers in return for approximately 10% gross of their actually ''sold'' print runs. (p. 40) This actually made ''(Young) Blueberry'' a Belgian creation between 1980 and 1991, instead of a French one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, it took some time for the new publisher to get up and running, and some sort of stop-gap resolution had to be found for the intervening 1979-1980 period in order to secure income for the stable of comic artists. On recommendation of Charlier, who has had previous dealings with the publisher,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, p. 260]]&lt;/ref&gt; the catalog was legally, but temporarily, housed at the French publishing house [[:fr:Édi-Monde]] of the Hachette group, who for the occasion established the equally temporary EDI-3-BD imprint, though making use of Koralle's infrastructure &amp;ndash; allowed to continue to exist for the time being by Axel Springer &amp;ndash; in regard to printing and distribution. As impromptu publisher, EDI-3-BD published around two dozen album titles, including "La longue marche", before turning the copyrights of these over to Novedi,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=70&amp;sort=jaar "EDI-3-BD"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which started publishing themselves in 1981. EDI-3-BD published their books for Belgium and the Netherlands themselves, but farmed out licenses for other countries, including France somewhat surprisingly, where Giraud's former alma mater and Hachette competitor Fleurus firstly became the album publisher for "La longue marche". After Novedi had become operational, the business model was adopted by them and it was decided to continue with Giraud's other alma mater Hachette for France with the subsequent titles in the ''Blueberry'' (and other) series in recognition of the help Édi-Monde had provided. Hachette incidentally, later acquired a special, one-time only license from Dargaud to reissue the entirety of the ''Blueberry'' series in 2013-2014 as the 52 volume ''La Collection Blueberry'' anthology, each volume augmented with a six-page illustrated editorial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-39639-BD-Blueberry-La-collection-Hachette__10000.html "''La Collection Blueberry''"], Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a decade ''Blueberry'' resided in calm waters at Novedi. The 1980s saw three additions to the main series (completing the ''Rehabilitation'' story arc) as well as four new titles in the newly created ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' series. Nevertheless, despite the two ''Blueberry'' incarnations and ''Jeremiah'' being the top selling series for the publisher, it appeared that the financial base was too narrow for even a publisher the modest size of Novedi, as the publisher went out of business in 1990, after having published approximately 120 album titles, and despite having taken over the book publications for France themselves as well in the latter half of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=16&amp;sort=jaar Novedi], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It again left ''Blueberry'' and the others without a publishing home.

====Death of a creator (1989)====
{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="I have twenty completed pages, the rest consists of annotations and loose ideas...I was not quite on board with the development of the story yet, we still had not decided upon anything. There were some great ideas, which needed to be finalized."|salign=right|source=—Giraud, August 1989, on the script status of "Arizona Love" at the time of Charlier's death.&lt;ref name="arizona"&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 164]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On 10 July 1989, Jean-Michel Charlier passed away from a heart condition after a short sickbed. By all accounts Charlier had been a [[workaholic]] throughout his career, working simultaneously on as much as a dozen projects at any given time, steadily increasing his workload as he grew older. His heart condition had already troubled him in his later years and his death, while sudden, was not entirely a surprise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, p. 299]]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier's penchant for hard work increasingly became a concern for Giraud when he visited his longtime co-worker six months before his death, "He was a work bulimic! There were always seven to eight scenarios underway. His life was a true path of self-destruction. You should have seen him working at his desk! Six months before his passing, I advised him to calm down. Very artistically, he replied: ''No, I have chosen this!''"&lt;ref name="bosser68"&gt;[[#Sources|Bosser, 2005, p. 68]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlier, having been of a previous generation, conservative in nature and wary of science fiction in general, had never understood what his younger colleague tried to achieve as "Mœbius". Nonetheless, he never tried to hinder Giraud in the least, as he understood that an artist of Giraud's caliber needed a "mental shower" from time to time. Furthermore, Charlier was very appreciative of the graphic innovations Giraud ported over from his work as "Mœbius" into the mainstream ''Blueberry'' series, most specifically "Nez Cassé", making him "one of the all-time greatest artists in the comic medium", as Charlier himself worded it in 1982.&lt;ref name="bree41"&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, pp. 23, 41-43]]&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[:fr:Michel Rouge]], who was taken on by Giraud in 1980 for the inks of "La longue marche" ("The Long March") painted a slightly different picture though. Already recognizing that the two men were living in different worlds, he noted that Charlier was not pleased with Giraud taking on an assistant, afraid that it might have been a prelude to him leaving the series in order to pursue his "experimentations" as Mœbius further.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 69]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even Giraud was in later life led to believe that Charlier apparently "detested" his other work, looking upon it as something akin to "treason", though his personal experiences with the author was that he had kept an "open mind" in this regard, at least in his case.&lt;ref name="flip"&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 2015, pp. 220-226]]&lt;/ref&gt; While Charlier was willing to overlook Giraud's wanderings in his case only, he was otherwise of the firm conviction that artists, especially his own, should totally and wholeheartedly devote themselves to their craft &amp;ndash; as Charlier always had considered the comic medium &amp;ndash; , but which was somewhat incongruous on his part as he himself was habitually engaged in several divergent projects at any given time.&lt;ref name="hoff"/&gt; This has caused many of his artists problems on a frequent basis, as he was consistently and notoriously late with his piecemeal provided script pages, including Giraud at the start of his ''Blueberry'' career. However, as he recognized quit early on that ''Blueberry'' occupied a special place in his body of work, he later made sure that (only) his ''Blueberry'' artists were provided with scripts in a timely fashion. Charlier's method of working came at a cost however, as his scripts frequently contained continuity errors on the detail level, and which included those of ''Blueberry'', such as in his above cited instance of his hero's first name.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 32]]; [[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 46]]; [[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, p. 225]]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier has cited the ''Blueberry'' titles "La mine de l'allemand perdu" ("The Lost Dutchman's Mine") through "L'homme qui valait 500 000 $" ("The Half-a-Million Dollar Man") as his favorites for their "potency", both story and artwise, the latter making him the co-winner of his 1973 American [[#Awards|comic award]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Berner, 2003, p. 25]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script being one-thirds ready at the time of Charlier's passing, the completion of "Arizona Love" was postponed as Giraud needed time to come to terms with that fact. Due to his intimate twenty-five year familiarity with both the series and its writer, it was a foregone conclusion that Giraud would from then on take on the scripting of the main series as well, especially since it was already agreed upon in the "contracts signed with Jean-Michel" that "the survivor would take over the series".&lt;ref name="flip"/&gt; It was this circumstance that has led Philippe Charlier, son of the deceased author and now the heir and steward of his father's ''bande dessinée'' legacy, to make the unsubstantiated claim that Novedi was surreptitiously negotiating with Giraud only for the existing and future ''Blueberry'' series, intent on cutting the Charlier family out, which was incongruous as Novedi was already heading toward receivership, aside from the fact that Giraud has never even hinted at such alleged dealings and that no rumors have ever surfaced in the otherwise tight-knit Franco-Belgian comic community, save for the claim Charlier Jr. himself made on a single occasion in the comic journal ''BoDoï'' (issue 24, 1999). Furthermore, per French law, Charlier's widow Christine remained entitled to 10 percent of the revenues from the existing and subsequent post-Charlier ''Blueberry'' titles, which provided her with a "decent" living standard, according to son Philippe, in effect to an extent contradicting his own claim on the same occasion.&lt;ref name="fueri"/&gt; As for Giraud, having to work without a safety net for the first time, came initially with bouts of self-doubt and second-guessing, as [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]] (by then the new ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' artist) testified to, after a visit to Giraud in this period, "[[:fr:Janet Gale|Janet]] and I visited Jean when he was working on "Arizona Love" &amp;ndash; around May 1989 [sic.] I think. Some of the first pages he showed us then were radically different from the ones ultimately published in the album later on. I did not had the time to read the scripts for those pages he had shown us, but I know that Jean redid several pages entirely anew, before the album was eventually released".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2013, p. 47]]&lt;/ref&gt; The by Giraud rejected pages were published as a bonus in the 1995 deluxe limited edition of "Mister Blueberry", a joint publication of Dargaud and Giraud's publishing house Stardom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/74295_Blueberry_24_Mister_Blueberry "Mister Blueberry"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stunned by the sudden death of his longtime co-worker, it took Giraud nearly five years before he could bring himself to embark on ''Blueberry'' again as artist, after completing "Arizona Love". Giraud stated that the series had lost its "father", and that the "mother needed time to mourn".&lt;ref name="bosser68"/&gt;

====Continued publishing wanderings (1990–1993)====
Charlier's death coincided by chance with the growing problems at Novedi, and Giraud suggested to Philippe Charlier, the heir and steward of his father's legacy, to move all his fathers co-creations to Les Humanoïdes Associés (with whom Giraud maintained close personal and creative ties after his ''Métal Hurlant'' days &amp;ndash; which had included "Nez Cassé" &amp;ndash; , among others by having them publish his acclaimed ''[[The Incal|L'Incal]]'' series), to step up to the plate vacated by Novedi. Yet, Giraud undertook no further action himself, partly because he was still residing in the United States, too preoccupied with his own projects and the wrapping up of his affairs over there before his return to France (and thus too busy to be engaged in secret negotiations with Novedi),&lt;ref name="stripspeciaalzaak.beA"&gt;[http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Toppers/FransenTop/26_Blueberry15.htm "Fransen Top 26: Blueberry 15 - Ballade voor een doodskist"], stripspeciaalzaak.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly because his marriage to his first wife Claudine was in the early stages of falling apart at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whoswho.fr/decede/biographie-m%C5%93bius_42760 "Biographie Mœbius"], Whoswho.fr {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier Jr. approached [[Fabrice Giger]], who had bought the by Giraud co-founded publisher previously in early 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/livres/0101234875-special-bande-dessinee-giger-le-genre-humanoide-repreneur-des-humanoides-associes-en-1989-le-jeune-suisse-fabrice-giger-est-a-present-a-la-tete-d-un-groupe-multimedia-sans-egal-dans-le-monde-de-la-bd- "Spécial bande dessinée. Giger, le genre humanoïde."], [[Libération]] 01.22.1998 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not choose for that publishing house eventually, but rather go with Giger's original, founding publishing house, Alpen Publishers, the latter had set up in 1988 in Switzerland&lt;ref name="Giger"&gt;[http://www.humano.com/blog/blog_de_giger/commentList/a-zapper-vite-fait/1 "Le Blog de Giger, page 1] and [http://www.humano.com/blog/blog_de_giger/commentList/a-zapper-vite-fait/2 page 2], Humano.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; even though comic artists themselves, due to the close entanglement of Alpen and Humanoïdes, always referred to Alpen as "Humanos" (''see quote boxes below''). It turned out that Philippe was actually picking up where his father had left off. Shortly after he had established Alpen and unbeknownst to Giraud, Giger was already approached by Charlier Sr. in 1988. The veteran Charlier had already sensed the writings on the wall at Novedi and discussed plans with Giger to have ''all'' his comic creations moved over to the new publisher, and to this end had already arranged his old friend [[:fr:Guy Vidal]] from his ''Pilote'' days to be hired as editor-in-chief at the new publisher, incidentally in the process doing exactly what his son had accused Novedi of.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, p. 295]]&lt;/ref&gt; Giger disclosed in 2008 that it was on the occasion of his subsequent dealings with Philippe that the "JMC Aventures" foundation was established, intended to safeguard the commercial and artistic legacy of Charlier's body of work. "After the death of Jean-Michel, a project was born between his son, Philippe, his mother, and us, to create a structure dedicated to the continuation of the series co-created by Charlier, JMC Aventures. We were shareholders with the Charlier family," stated Giger, confirming the preliminary dealings with the author in his final year.&lt;ref name="Giger"/&gt;

The relatively short tenure at Alpen saw the release of "Arizona Love", which was actually started under the aegis of Novedi, but for which Charlier had not yet contracted with the publisher because of his hunch, thus leaving the title legally "free" for JMC Aventures to be signed with Alpen, according to Giger, adding that this had the full and immediate blessing of Giraud.&lt;ref name="Giger"/&gt; The artist himself though, has later expressed a slightly different opinion as evidenced in the quotebox featured below, where it was implied that he was not as happy with the behind-the-scenes machinations as Giger made it out to be, especially since his late script partner had kept him out of the loop in 1988. Ironically, it was Philippe Charlier, among others, who indirectly conceded the point when he accused Giraud of wanting "to settle scores" with Charlier Sr. with the later ''OK Corral''-cycle, which Philippe had issues with (see ''[[#Sequel: Blueberry 1900|below]]'').&lt;ref name="flip"/&gt; Additional Alpen releases included the ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' title "Trois hommes pour Atlanta", as well as the inception of the spin-off series ''Marshal Blueberry'' with two titles, aside from additions to the ''Les Gringos'' and ''Redbeard'' series, taken over by other artists after both Jijé and Charlier Sr. had passed away. While the initial intention was to have the entire body of work of Charlier published at Alpen, the corporation with the publisher did not pan out for undisclosed reasons &amp;ndash; though Giger had mentioned increasingly difficult copyright negotiations with other copyright holders, predominantly heirs of other artists who had worked with Charlier, the widow of Jijé in particular, who had taken Giger and Charlier Jr. to court.&lt;ref name="Giger"/&gt; The relationship was ended in 1992, shortly thereafter followed by the demise of Alpen itself in 1994 with Guy Vidal moving over to Dargaud (having taken on the writing for ''Les Gringos'' after his friend's death, until his own death in 2002),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=580&amp;sort=jaar "Alpen"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Giger himself became successful with Humanoïdes, expanding into the United States as "Humanoids Publishing Ltd." in 1999, in the process reissuing much of Giraud's "Mœbius" science fiction work.

As Belgian publisher Dupuis had already shown interest, when they serialized "La dernière carte" in their ''Spirou'' magazine in 1983, Charlier Jr. now decided to try his luck at that publishing house in 1992, as Hermann had already done previously with his ''Jeremiah'' for that matter. However, while ''Jeremiah'' has remained with Dupuis ever since, for again unknown reasons the cooperation with ''Blueberry'' did not seem to pan out either. Even though Dupuis did reissue all the ''(Young) Blueberry'' titles of the EDI-3-BD/Novedi era (but none from Alpen Publishers, or indeed any of the other Charlier creations) under its own imprint in their "Repérages" collection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedetheque.com/search/albums?RechCollection=Rep%C3%A9rages&amp;RechEO=1 Bedetheque.com] {{fr icon}}; The "Repérages (French)/Spotlight (Dutch)" collection was conceived by Dupuis with the express intent to differentiate between comics with more adult contents and those with more juvenile, comic contents, for which the publisher was hitherto most well-known. The early acquisition of ''Jeremiah'' was actually a major consideration to proceed in this manner.&lt;/ref&gt; no new titles were released during the equally short 1992-1993 tenure of ''Blueberry'' at that publisher.

====Return to the parent publisher (1993–present)====
{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="Everything was bought back by Dargaud, halfway through [''Marshal Blueberry'']. It was not that bad; At Dargaud, they are more active on the editorial level. During the entire time I was at Humanos, I had not received a single call to start a new project. I profited from it... life profited from it for that matter... If ''Blueberry'' had remained with Humanos, there still would not have been a new album! At Dargaud, the late Guy Vidal became a true series editor-in-chief, active, pugnacious, adhering to continuous series. When I did ask to start, along came ''Mister Blueberry'', followed suit by ''Tombstone'' and ''Geronimo''... I do the best I can. I'm not saying it's all entirely successful. I do recognize that there are some surprising issues at the script or drawing level, but it has the merit of not being routine!"|salign=right|source=—Giraud, 2010, on the return to Dargaud, and on being the sole artist on ''Blueberry''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 2015, pp. 221-222]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Tiring of Giraud's inaction, Philippe Charlier ultimately took matters into his own hand, and had all his father's co-creations return to parent publisher Dargaud at the end of 1993 without apparent objections from Giraud (though he had stipulated an exemption for non-comic ''Blueberry'' art, produced either on personal title and/or for his own publishing houses [[:fr:Aedena|Gentiane/Aedena]], Starwatcher Graphics, and Stardom &amp;ndash; ''see [[#English translations|below]]''), and it is there where ''Blueberry'' has remained ever since. The for Dargaud joyous occasion of now having acquired the copyrights of '''all''' ''Blueberry'' comic incarnations, was reason enough to ask Giraud &amp;ndash; now serving as the sole main series artist &amp;ndash; to embark on a new story-arc, which eventually resulted in the ''OK Corral'' cycle, the last one of the main series as it turned out to be. How thrilled Dargaud was to have reacquired ''Blueberry'' was amply demonstrated &amp;ndash; aside from their decision to revitalize the serialized pre-publication format for ''Blueberry'' as already mentioned &amp;ndash; in the 2000 documentary ''Mister Gir &amp; Mike S. Blueberry'' made on the occasion of the release of "Geronimo l'Apache", in which instances were shown of the considerable marketing efforts the publisher undertook in order to promote the new album &amp;ndash; the documentary therefore itself one such instance &amp;ndash; , among others by having many Parisian metro stations plastered with huge ''Blueberry'' posters. Aside from this, Dargaud made use of the opportunity to clean up the by then muddied release chronology, by formalizing the establishment of the three series and restarting the album numbering for each in reprint runs. Concurrently, all international licenses were renegotiated.

Apart from foreign language publishers and constituting a break in tradition, Dargaud also started to occasionally farm out special, one-time only, series licenses to other Francophone publishers, which besides the aforementioned 2013-2014 all-series "La Collection Blueberry" from Hachette, already included the French book club ''[[:fr:France Loisirs]]'' for its 2003 main series releases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-30641-BD-Blueberry-France-Loisirs.html "''Blueberry France Loisir''"], Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Francophone publisher who was granted a special license for the main series only was the French-Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' who released its "Blueberry Intégrale" in two editions, the fifteen-volume edition of 2009, and the sixteen-volume edition of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-22318-BD-Blueberry-Integrale-Le-Soir-1__10000.html "''Blueberry Intégrale Le Soir (1)''"] and [https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-46881-BD-Blueberry-Integrale-Le-Soir-2__10000.html "''Blueberry Intégrale Le Soir (2)''"], Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''France Loisirs'' release, each volume, save three in the end, collected two of the original albums and was only offered to newspaper readers and subscribers. The three single album volumes (No's 8, 15 and 16) were augmented with new ''Blueberry'' art, featured in a separate section and separately negotiated for with Giraud's own publisher, Mœbius Production.

Jean-Michel Charlier has never witnessed the return of his creations to the parent publisher, nor has he ever mended fences with George Dargaud &amp;ndash; for whose publishing house Charlier had made signature contributions after all &amp;ndash; , and who followed Charlier in death almost to the day one year later on July 18, 1990. To a large extent the publication wanderings of ''Blueberry'' has been mirrored in other European countries as well, particularly in Germany (where the era was referred to as "Der 'heimatlose' Blueberry" &amp;ndash; "The 'homeless' Blueberry"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jürgeit|Jürgeit, 2003, p. 10]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Scandinavian countries (the Danes referring to the era as "Blueberrys Lange March" &amp;ndash; "Blueberry's Long March"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Hjorth-Jørgensen, 1984, title page]]&lt;/ref&gt;), where every publisher change was followed suit by similar changes among local publishers in those territories as well.&lt;ref&gt;Notable exceptions in the era 1979-1992 were Portugal, Spain and Italy, where respective publishers [[:pt:Meribérica]], [[:es:Editorial Grijalbo]] and  Edizioni Nuova Frontiera, held ''Blueberry'' licenses from both Dargaud and Novedi, and in the former two cases from Alpen as well. Grijalbo and Nuova Frontiera lost out to local competitors, when Dargaud renegotiated the ''Blueberry'' licenses in 1993/94, whereas Meribérica lost its one decade later.&lt;/ref&gt; How confusing this era had been, was exemplified by the aforementioned "La longue marche" title, which has been released in French by no less than six publishers in the time period 1980-2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Blueberry-Tome-19-La-longue-marche-24173.html "Blueberry 19: La longue marche"], Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even seven, if one is to include the ''Super As'' serialized magazine publication as well.

Though the 2007 "Apaches" title became the last in the main ''Blueberry'' series, as creating comics became increasingly difficult for Giraud because his eyesight started to fail him in his last years, he did continue to create single-piece ''Blueberry'' art on larger canvases on either commission basis (such as for the aforementioned ''Le Soir'' editions) or under the aegis of Mœbius Production until his own death in 2012, much of which sold for considerable prices from 2005 onward, alongside older original ''Blueberry'' art Giraud still had in his possession, in specialized comic auctions at such auction houses like [[Artcurial]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artvalue.com/auction-results--29359-59--23--------1-GIRAUD-Jean-Artcurial-Briest-Poulain-F-Tajan.htm?MAISONS_PAYS=11&amp;MAISONS_VILLE=457&amp;cp_checked=0 "Giraud Moebius], Artvalue.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hôtel Drouot]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette-drouot.com/static/magazine_ventes_aux_encheres/coup_de_coeur_enchere/050512_moebius.html "Docteur Gir &amp; Mister Moebius"], Gazette-Drouot.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Millon &amp; Associés.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/68043_Jean_Giraud_Moebius_1_Jean_Giraud_Moebius "Jean Giraud Moebius"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; auction catalog.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known English translation of ''Blueberry'' was that of the first title "Fort Navajo", and appeared 18 months after its original 1963 French magazine publication and before its very first book publication in September 1965. The first outing in the series was serialized in syndication through Charlier's own EdiFrance/EdiPresse agency (albeit on behalf of his employer Dargaud and the only ''Blueberry'' title known to have been disseminated in this manner outside Francophone Europe, Spain and Portugal&lt;ref name="stripinfotrivia"&gt;[http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/trivia/946 "Blueberry"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under its original title in the weekly British comic magazine ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', starting its edited and truncated black and white run in issue 15 May 1965 through issue 21 August 1965, fifteen issues in total.&lt;ref name="IPC"&gt;[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/valiant/4050-33913/object-appearances/4005-28524/ "Blueberry appears in 15 issues in this volume."], ComicVine.gamespot.com&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the near-simultaneous and similar publication of the story in Dutch (in full and in color in ''Fix en Fox'' magazine, issues 26&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/279762_Fix_en_Fox__1965_26_Nummer_26 ''Fix en Fox'', issue 26, 1965], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; also first known foreign language publication to feature cover art by Giraud.&lt;/ref&gt;-41, 1965), both actually stand out as the very first known non-French publications of ''Blueberry'', or of any other work by Giraud (but not Charlier) for that matter. However, the growing popularity of the comic elsewhere in Europe from 1967 onward&lt;ref name="stripinfotrivia"/&gt; notwithstanding, the Netherlands included, "Fort Navajo" remained until 1977 the only ''Blueberry'' title translated in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewstringer.blogspot.nl/2012/03/jean-giraud-moebius-1938-2012.html BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics from the Past, Present and Future!]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four English book translations of Blueberry comics were published in Europe for release in the UK in the late seventies by Danish/British joint venture Egmont/[[Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd.|Methuen]], when Egmont, holding an international license at the time, was in the process of releasing the series on a wider, international scale, for Germany and the Scandinavian countries in particular. While Egmont completed the publication of the then existing series in whole for the latter two language areas, publication of the English titles already ceased after volume 4. Parent publisher Dargaud had planned to reissue these titles and more for the North-American market in 1982/83 through their short-lived international (American) branch, but of these, only one was eventually released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/whoswho.aspx?mode=AtoZsearch&amp;id=DARGAUD+PUBLICATIONS Dargaud International Publishing, Ltd.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808070621/http://www.bailsprojects.com/whoswho.aspx?mode=AtoZsearch&amp;id=DARGAUD+PUBLICATIONS |date=August 8, 2016 }}; The failure of Dargaud International Publishing, Ltd. (and others) in the United States and British-Canada, at the time headed by ''Comanche'' writer Greg, was due to the fact that European publishers vastly underestimated the huge differences that existed at the time between the American and European comic worlds, both in spirit and tastes, as well as in practicality. American distributors and comic store keepers for example, were at the time simply not equipped to handle the for them awkward, deviant larger A4 European album format, in which Dargaud's books were executed, including "The Man with the Silver Star". Having coined the failure "spectacular", Giraud later stated in the 1991 interview book by Sadoul (p. 69) that "to this day, Americans are still joking about it".&lt;/ref&gt; That then unnoticed title, "The Man with the Silver Star", has, despite the fact that Giraud's art style had by now fully blossomed into his distinctive own, not been included in later North American collections, resulting in the book becoming an expensive rarity.

{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="There were thousands of professionals who knew my work. That has always amazed me every time I entered some graphics, or animation studio, at Marvel or even at [[George Lucas]]'. Mentioning the name Jean Giraud did not cause any of the present pencillers, colorists or storyboard artists to even bat an eye. Yet, whenever I introduced myself as "Mœbius", all of them jumped up to shake my hand. It was incredible!"|salign=right|source=—Giraud, 1989, on his notoriety as "Mœbius" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 70]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Since then better marketed English translations were published by other companies which included [[Marvel Comics]] (under its [[Epic Comics|Epic]] imprint), [[Catalan Communications|Comcat]], [[Mojo Press]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]], resulting in all kinds of formats and quality—from b/w, American comic book sized budget collections to full color European graphic novel style albums with many extras. Actually this was the first time ''Blueberry'' was published under Giraud's [[pseudonym]], Moebius. As [[Jean-Marc Lofficier|Randy and Jean-Marc Lofficier]], the translator couple for '''all''' these editions, related, "This is quite ironic because Giraud first coined the 'Moebius' pseudonym precisely because he wanted to keep his two bodies of work separate. Yet, the artist recognizes the fact that he has now become better known in this country under his '[[Pen name|nom-de-plume]],' and this is his way of making it official!"&lt;ref name="marvelage"/&gt; In effect, the ploy was more than opportune, as Epic had already started out with the publication of Giraud's better known science fiction work under his pseudonym &amp;ndash; introduced to American readership through ''Heavy Metal'' in the mid-1970s &amp;ndash; in the graphic novel format, and it was only when these were well underway that it was decided to add ''Blueberry'' as well to the array.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Patrick Daniel. "The Wild [French] West", ''[[Comics Scene]]'', issue 9, pp. 8-12, 68, Mt. Morris: Starlog Group, Inc., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; All Giraud/Moebius titles were released by Epic in a for the US relatively modest print run of 20.000 copies per title. To make the project as economically viable as possible, it was decided to collect two of the original ''Blueberry'' titles in one book, to justify the by Americans perceived high price of around US$13, which, excepting the first two titles of the "Iron Horse" story-arc, made the Epic releases in essence "integrals" themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sadoul|Sadoul, 1991, pp. 70-72]]; In comparison, Moebius' 1988 two-part ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' comic book project in cooperation with [[Stan Lee]], was released by Epic in a printing of 200.000 copies each.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was for Epic that Giraud created new ''Blueberry'' book cover art (which he had only done once previously for the first four German book releases by Koralle,&lt;ref&gt;"Der Mann mit dem Silberstern" (1973), "Aufruhr im Westen" (1977), "Der einsame Adler" (1978) and "Der verlorene Reiter" (1978), all issued without ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; nor would he ever again), and to the chagrin of parent publisher Dargaud this art &amp;ndash; as is indeed all outside the main comics proper ''Blueberry'' art, such as magazine covers, art portfolios, posters and the like, that Giraud created in this period of time for Koralle, Les Humanoïdes Associés, as well as his own publishing houses Gentiane, Starwatcher Graphics,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 69]]; Set up by Giraud's first wife Claudine in 1985 in California as the US subsidiary of [[:fr:Aedena|Gentiane/Aedena]], for the express purpose of selling her husbands art work in the United States. The Lofficier couple, whom she met at the 1985 San Diego ComicCon, were hired as editors, which eventually led to the Epic publications. Starwatcher was copyright co-holder of the Epic Moebius graphic novel lines.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent Stardom &amp;ndash; remain outside the legal purview of Dargaud, even after they had reacquired the ''Blueberry'' copyrights in 1993. In practice this means that Dargaud can not use this art at will for their own later publications, such as the 2012 anthology releases,&lt;ref name="integrale"/&gt; without coming to some sort of legal and financial arrangement with the copyright holders &amp;ndash; ''i.e.'' Giraud himself in the vast majority of cases (as of 2012, his heirs) &amp;ndash; , as Dargaud licensees have to do as well on individual basis, and of which the short story "Three Black Birds" is the most glaring one (''see below''). German author Martin Jürgeit (co-author of the below-listed [[#Sources|reference book]]) has confirmed being confronted with this when he served as editor-in-chief for the German-language version of Egmont's earlier mentioned anthology collection. Dead set on having ''all'' available ''Blueberry'' material included in his version, he found himself frequently frustrated in this regard on more than one occasion. He stated as late as 2012, "As things now stand, it is highly unlikely that the vast majority of this material will be included, as Dargaud does not own the copyrights. And it is only the Dargaud copyrighted material we can use for the ''Blueberry-Chroniken'', as we have experienced to our dismay on several occasions," referring among others, aside from "Three Black Birds", to the covers for Epic as well.&lt;ref name="werkausgabe"/&gt;

The Epic publications were very shortly after their initial release collected by American specialty publisher [[Graphitti Designs]] in their "Moebius" collection &amp;ndash; for whom Giraud created new book plate art, also outside the legal purview of Dargaud &amp;ndash; , a deluxe limited edition anthology collection, released in a 1500 copies per volume edition, each volume at least containing two of the Epic releases. The collection, which ran for nine volumes, also contained Giraud's science fiction body of work, that was concurrently released by Epic in a similar manner. Volume ''Moebius #9'', containing "The Lost Dutchman's Mine" and "The Ghost with the Golden Bullets", also included the non-''Blueberry'' westerns "King of the Buffalo" (short), and the other Giraud/Charlier western strip, ''Jim Cutlass'': "Mississippi River". Excepting the 1996 Mojo Press release, no additional ''Blueberry'' comics have been published in English since 1993, and, again excepting the Mojo Press release, no English ''Blueberry'' reprints have seen the light of day either, contrary to his other work as "Moebius".

The Epic collection earned Giraud his [[#Awards|below listed]] American 1991 comic award, augmented with an additional 1997 award nomination for the Mojo Press release, whereas ''Blueberry'' in general had already earned him two American comic awards in 1972 and 1973, long before the series had even come to the attention of North-American readership.

*{{anchor|footnote 1}}&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; According to [http://www.bedetheque.com Bedetheque.com], the French books were until volume 18 published in simultaneous conjuncture with Belgian publisher [[Le Lombard]] who released these for French-Belgium, initially as soft cover editions, contrary to Dargaud who released these from the start as hard cover books. The same also held true for the first three ''Young Blueberry'' titles, then part of the main series. For expedience sake only the French editions from the parent publisher are mentioned. ISBN numbers were not issued until 1975, the Lombard releases actually never receiving any.
*{{anchor|footnote 2}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The 2007 one-shot "Apaches" is an edited book collecting the flashback recollections Blueberry related from "Ombres sur Tombstone" through "Dust" to a journalist while convalescing from a gunshot wound he had sustained in the preceding story, detailing how he, after the war and suffering from a severe case of [[post traumatic stress syndrome]], arrives in the South West in late autumn 1865, and his subsequent dealings with [[Apache]] warrior Goyaałé, before the latter came to national attention as [[Geronimo]]. There it was revealed that it had been Geronimo who had given Blueberry his Native-American nickname "Tsi-Na-Pah" ("Broken Nose"&lt;ref&gt;This appears to be a made-up name as a historical [[Tonto Apache]] chieftain is known to have existed, who went by the exact same nickname, which however was the in Tonto-Apache radically different coined "Chan-deisi".&lt;/ref&gt;). For the book Giraud created new pages and panels to improve the flow of the story, and as such the book is readable as a stand-alone prequel title. Notable are the new, last two pages which shows Blueberry leaving his very first Far West posting, while wearing the outfit, he is first seen in, in "Fort Navajo", his second posting, providing a seamless continuity (even though Giraud ''had'' made a continuity error as one of the panels featured a tombstone engraved with 1881, the year in which the ''OK Corral'' story arc, centered around the historical "[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]" incident, was set). While the French themselves consider the book outside the main series ("Hors-Séries", the "HS" or "0"-volume) due to the prequel nature of the book, it is otherwise universally considered part of the main series as volume 29 in other countries.

*{{anchor|footnote 4}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The failure to publish "La piste des Navajos" in the English language, frustratingly left English readers with a cliffhanger, as it was the resolution of a five volume story arc that started with "Fort Navajo". As of 2017, only foreign language editions are available to them.
*{{anchor|footnote 4}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; While it is above stated by Lofficier that ''Blueberry'' is not about a handsome cowboy who "rides into town, saves the ranch, becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm", the sixth, stand-alone title "The Man with the Silver Star" is ironically exactly that. Moreover, the story was clearly a take on [[Howard Hawk]]'s classic 1959 Western ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', a circumstance not lost on the passionate Western fan Giraud, who confronted Charlier with the similarities, "I have never understood why Charlier has written it. I talked to him about it, but it seemed he was not aware of it; he has never been one for cinema. He must have had unconsciously remembered the movie, and apparently completely suppressed the memory of it. You know, these things happen, and one can not automatically assume plagiarism. As the theme of ''Rio Bravo'' is so incredibly strong, it is hard to forget, even if you have forgotten the movie itself." Giraud paid homage to the movie by having the main cast appear in a few background cameos.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 159]]&lt;/ref&gt; The assertions of Giraud notwithstanding, the possibility of plagiarism allegations might explain why this title was left out by Epic, despite the already mentioned fact that Giraud's art style was by now fully his own. Still, "The Man with the Silver Star" has remained the only ''Blueberry'' title purely patterned after the template as set by the classic American Western genre.
*{{anchor|footnote 6}}&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; As the title already suggested, "The Lost Dutchman's Mine"&lt;ref&gt;"The Lost Dutchman's Mine" diptych is by many international critics considered as Giraud's ''magnum opus'' as far as ''Blueberry'' is concerned, becoming the primary agent for his 1973 Shazam Award, and has been in some countries &amp;ndash; [[:hu:Blueberry (képregény)|Hungary]] and Japan ({{ISBN|9784047280939}}) &amp;ndash; the ''only'' titles translated thusfar, whereas France and other countries have given the two titles preferential treatment by reissuing them as separate "deluxe" anthologies on several occasions ([http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/66553_Blueberry_INT_B6_La_mine_de_lAllemand_perduLe_spectre_aux_balles_dor/showall ''Blueberry'': "INT B6, La mine de l'Allemand perdu/Le spectre aux balles d'or"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions).&lt;/ref&gt; was a take on the real world "[[Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine]] legend", and in the original publications the Lückner and "Prosit" characters were from [[Prussia]] as specifically intended by Charlier, and as indicated by the "Allemand" (French for "German") reference in the French book title, therefore adhering to the actual legend in this respect. Translator Lofficier chose the for Americans familiar-sounding name of the real legend as title for the American book release, but changed the characters to being denizens from the [[Netherlands]], in the process changing the original expletives from German to Dutch in his translations, aside from altering the German name spellings accordingly. Though Lofficier, married to a US citizen, had worked for decades in the US in the publishing world, acquiring an excellent knowledge of American English and idiom, he had made a mistake when he interpreted the moniker "[[Dutch people|Dutch]]" as currently &amp;ndash; ''and'' originally &amp;ndash; understood, too literally &amp;ndash; as in from/of the Netherlands. Being of French descent, Lofficier had not realized that in the United States of the mid-to-late 19th century, the expression "Dutch" has had a different meaning (Charlier, who ''was'' aware of this, had by that time already passed away, and thus unable to set Lofficier straight), as it was by Americans invariably employed to refer to people and language of '''[[Germans|German]]''' descent/origin, due to the massive influx of German speaking immigrants in that period of time. These immigrants referred to themselves as "Deutch" in their own language, and the phonetic similarity is the more commonly accepted rationale for the phenomenon, and it was not until the turn of the century that "Dutch" regained its original meaning. The phenomenon has not applied for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=a1bdd01f59dacbddab4e6bea68b2a54e&amp;action=2&amp;documentId=GALE|CX3436800018&amp;userGroupName=gray02935&amp;jsid=f6ef0c62ec142c368bfc2a12c90b49ea US History in Context]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{anchor|footnote 7}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; In the case of Epic's "Chihuahua Pearl", "Ballad for a Coffin", "Angel Face", "The Ghost Tribe", and "The End of the Trail" book releases, [[Titan Books]] has issued the same, virtually identical books (save for the ISBN numbers and publisher's logo) for the UK market, with a few months delay. The other Epic ''Blueberry'' titles only saw a US release, the Titan editions thereby becoming the last British ''Blueberry'' publications. These editions were released in a relatively modest print run of 6.000 copies per title, as Giraud himself has divulged, though he has added, "Mind you, British readers were delighted; As a matter of fact, they adore [continental] European comics, which we had not quite recognized over here [France] at the time...".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 71]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{anchor|footnote 8}}&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; "Le hors-la-loi" literally translates as "'The one outside the law", in meaning exactly the same as "L'outlaw". France however, is one of the few European countries where the use of [[anglicism]]s is actively discouraged by cultural authorities, resulting in the use of the more laborious expression as the book title.
*{{anchor|footnote 9}}&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Volumes 19-21 were in France and French-Belgium simultaneously released by two different publisher, albeit under the same ISBN number. The French publisher is listed first.
*{{anchor|footnote 10}}&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; After Blueberry's rehabilitation in "Le bout de la piste", Charlier had planned to have him return to the US Army as captain, heading a unit of [[Apache Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#de Bree|de Bree, 1982, p. 39]], also mentioned in the original French version of the [[#The Blueberry biography|Blueberry biography]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Charlier's death, Giraud became of different mind when he embarked on the ''OK Corral'' story arc, turning the hero in to a loafing civilian, because of his new-found wealth and spending his days with poker, as he felt that it would have been too illogical and too implausible for Blueberry to return to the very same organization that had caused him so much grief and injustice.&lt;ref name="stripspeciaalzaak.beA"/&gt;
*{{anchor|footnote 11}}&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Mojo Press published a black and white, American comic book sized budget collection: ''The Blueberry Saga #1: The Confederate Gold'' in 1996. It contains the following stories: "Chihuahua Pearl", "The Half-A-Million Dollar Man", "Ballad for a Coffin", "The Outlaw", "Angel Face". It also featured the first-time book publication worldwide of the 14-page ''Blueberry'' short, "Three Black Birds" &amp;ndash; the year previously released under the same title as a limited edition, 28-sheet mini [[Artist's portfolio|portfolio]] by Stardom, Giraud's own publishing house&lt;ref&gt;[http://blueberrybr.blogspot.nl/2013/09/blueberry-three-black-birds.html "Blueberry: Three Black Birds"] Blueberrybr.blogspot.nl {{pt icon}}; Giraud created "Three Black Birds" originally in black and white and as such it was reprinted in the Mojo Press publication. Two years later though, Giraud himself provided the [[Ink wash painting|ink wash]] coloring for the story when it was reprinted in the western art book ''Blueberry's'' ({{ISBN|2908706024}}), followed by color reprints in the French magazine ''Bodoï'', issue 10, 1998 and the German magazine ''Comixene'', issue 64, 2003. In the latter, Giraud explained his creative thought processes for the coloring in an editorial.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; , which was actually set directly after the events depicted in "Arizona Love", though that title was ''not'' included in the anthology. As the title already implied, the book was coined after the actual, so-called "[[Confederate gold]] myth".
*{{anchor|footnote 12}}&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; There is a chronology gap of eight years between "Arizona Love" and "Mister Blueberry", which was specifically intended by Giraud, "''Mister Blueberry'' takes place eight years later, which leaves room for further romantic speculations. Surely, many readers will ask themselves, what Blueberry has been up to in the intervening time."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Pizolli, 1997, p. 91]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, what the creators had overlooked however, was that they had made a continuity error, by placing the events in "Arizona Love" in 1889 in the opening panel, whereas Giraud clearly had meant 1873, amply demonstrated by him correcting the year in "Three Black Birds". In later reprints corrected to "late 1872", the original year mentioning had European fans initially and erroneously assuming that "Arizona Love" was the first part of the ''OK Corral'' story arc.

Like it was in native France, most countries have seen ''Blueberry'' pre-published in magazine serials. The Portuguese 1969 "Fort Navajo" publication from Editorial Íbis is the earliest known instance of a ''Blueberry'' title to be released directly as album, without prior serialized magazine pre-publication,&lt;ref&gt;[http://geocities.ws/bdnostagia/blueberry.html "Blueberry"], BD Nostalgia {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the 1965 French and 1968 Spanish album releases,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tebeosfera.com/numeros/blueberry_1968_bruguera_1.html "Fort Navajo"] (48 pages, Barcelona:[[Editorial Bruguera|Editorial Bruguera S.A.]], September 1968, {{OCLC|431321701}}; pre-published in the publisher's [https://www.tebeosfera.com/publicaciones/bravo_1968_bruguera.html ''Bravo''] comic magazine, issues 1-11, February/April 1968), Tebeosfera.com {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three of them &amp;ndash; all executed in the hard cover format incidentally, save for the French-Belgian Le Lombard release &amp;ndash; becoming the only available book versions of the story until 1974.

It should be noted that album publication of "Fort Navajo", due the fact that Charlier had chosen to disseminate the title outside the French, Spanish and Portuguese language areas in magazine syndication, has posed problems for publishers in other language countries, especially in Germany and north-west Europe, when ''Blueberry'' broke out in popularity in the late 1960s&amp;ndash;early 1970s, well before the syndication term was to expire in 1974. It is not known why Charlier had chosen this format for "Fort Navajo", as the US derived syndication format was by that time already well on its way out for European comics, after the relative immediate post-war paper shortage was no longer an issue. Since "Fort Navajo" was the first part of a five book story arc, this caused continuity, or rather chronology problems as publishers were not yet able to publish the book in their countries. The respective publishers all went about the conundrum in their own way; in Germany the book was first re-serialized as a magazine publication,&lt;ref&gt;In [[:de:Zack (Zeitschrift)|''Zack'' magazine]], issues 19-23, 1972 (after having been published in ''MickyVision Comix'', issues 47-3, 1968/69), followed by the books "Der Mann mit dem Silberstern" as stop-gap, and "Aufruhr im Westen" ([[:de:Koralle-Verlag|Koralle]], 1973 and 1977 respectively)&lt;/ref&gt; before continuing with the book releases of the subsequent titles; in the Netherlands and Flanders it was decided to push ahead with book publication regardless of "Fort Navajo",&lt;ref&gt;"Dreiging in het westen" (Le Lombard/[[:nl:Uitgeverij Helmond|Helmond]], 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Scandinavian countries it was decided to forego on the publication of the first five titles altogether for the time being, instead opting to start book publication with book six, "L'homme à l'étoile d'argent",&lt;ref&gt;"Mannen med silverstjärnan" (Sweden, [[Semic Press]], 1971); "Manden med sølvstjernen" (Denmark, [[:dk:Interpresse]], 1972); "Mannen med sølvsjternen" (Norway, Romanforlaget, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; leaving publication of the first five titles for a future point in time. No matter what solution was chosen, it became one of the reasons for the messed up book release chronologies for those countries (only aggravated by both the later addition of ''Young'', and ''Marshal Blueberry'' book titles as well as the aforementioned publishing wanderings), confusing readership, especially in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgeit, Martin. "Rückkeht der fehlenden Blueberry-Abenteur", ''The Tombstone Epitaph Nr.1'', p. 1, Berlin: INK Verlag Jurgeit, Krissman &amp; Nobst GbR, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was Finnish publisher [[Sanoma]] that became the first publisher able to release the first other language book edition of the title in 1974, directly after the syndication term had expired, as "Navaho: Väijytys Punaisessa laaksossa" ({{oclc|57920924}}, notice the Finnish adherence to the originally intended series name, by now dropped by the parent publisher), that country's very first ''Blueberry'' book publication, thereby avoiding the conundrum.&lt;ref&gt;Previous 1967 and 1972, Italian and Yugoslav respective releases, were legally and technically magazine publications, therefore falling under the syndication regime ([http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/3069_Blueberry_1_Fort_Navajo/showall ''Blueberry'': "Fort Navajo"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions)&lt;/ref&gt; Nor had the conundrum been an issue for the UK, as book publication only started in 1977.

In the United States, California based distributor Public Square Books (currently known as Zócalo Public Square) imported ''Blueberry'' books from Spanish publisher [[Norma Editorial|Norma Editorial, S.A.]] on behalf of the Spanish speaking part of the country. Having done so in the first half of the 2000s, these books were endowed with American ISBN numbers in the form of a bar code sticker, simply put over the Spanish ISBN number. For example, "Arizona Love" originally carried the Spanish {{ISBN|8484314103}}, but once imported in the US, received the new, American {{ISBN|1594970831}}. Latino-Americans therefore, have been afforded the opportunity to enjoy the then entirety of the ''Blueberry'' series (including the spin-offs), contrary to their English speaking counterparts.

Apart from Europe, the Americas, Japan and Indonesia, the series has been translated on the Indian subcontinent in [[Mizo language|Mizo]] by Mahlua of Cydit Communications, operating out of Aizawl, and in Tamil. It is in the latter language in particular, spoken in the south-eastern part of India, [[Tamil Nadu]], and on the island state of [[Sri Lanka]], that the ''Blueberry'' saga has amassed a large fanbase and where he is dubbed "Captain Tiger" (கேப்டன் டைகர்). The series has been published by Prakash Publishers under their own "[[Lion comics|Lion Muthu Comics]]" imprint. In April 2015, an exclusive collectors edition was published in Tamil, collecting ''Blueberry'' titles 13 through 22 &amp;ndash; with "Arizona Love" added in first time Tamil translation &amp;ndash; in one 540-paged book. This is considered to be a milestone release in the entire Indian comics history, as well as one of the biggest collector editions of ''Blueberry'' comics worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lion-muthucomics.blogspot.in/2015/04/blog-post_24.html lion-muthucomics.blogspot.in]&lt;/ref&gt; although it had already been surpassed by the time of its release by an even more massive, entire main series &amp;ndash; save "Apaches" &amp;ndash; single book anthology of 1456 pages by parent publisher Dargaud in the original language, the year previously.&lt;ref&gt;"Blueberry, L'intégrale", Paris: Dargaud, November 2014, {{ISBN|9782205073898}}; The softcover in a hardboard slipcase book incidentally, features cover art licensed from Epic/Stardom, only the second known instance where Dargaud utilized ''Blueberry'' art that was created outside their own legal purview during the period 1980-1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prequel, intermezzo, and sequel==
A "prequel" series, ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' (''Young Blueberry''), and the "intermezzo" series ''Marshal Blueberry'' have been published as well, with other artists and writers, most famously [[William Vance]] for the latter. Despite dogged efforts on the part of Giraud, the intended ''Blueberry 1900'' sequel did not come to fruition for extraneous reasons.

===Prequel: ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry (Young Blueberry)''===
{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="For purely commercial reasons, Dargaud wanted the adventures of the main heroes of the weekly (''[[Asterix]]'', ''Achille Talon'', ''Tanguy and Laverdure'', etc.) to appear as complete stories in this quarterly. Neither Jean Giraud nor I were particularly interested to have concurrent, both long and short but similarly themed stories, published in two different magazines. But abundant, longtime fan-mail from readers, who gave us their friendship by faithfully following his tumultuous adventures, told me that the Blueberry character posed many irritating enigmas for them. Why did he have a broken nose? Why did he stay in the army as he obviously did not possess the qualities, besides his bravery, befitting a good soldier? And why this ridiculous name Blueberry? Blueberry is English for ''myrtille'': Lieutenant Myrtille, that was not a name for a Western hero! The questions came from all sides. Unfortunately, it was impossible for me to further encumber stories that were already quite heavy. Then the idea struck me to forge out a past for Blueberry through the stories we were asked to do for this ''Superpocket Pilote''. A past in which our readers would find answers to satisfy their legitimate curiosity. The idea excited Giraud, who decided, in order to differentiate between two series, to adopt a more lively style, more edgy, but less convoluted. Thus was born «''La Jeunesse de Blueberry''»."|salign=right|source=—Charlier, on conceiving the ''Young Blueberry'' series.&lt;ref name="jeunesse"&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, pp. 222-223]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A later created prequel series, dealt with Blueberry's early years, during the American Civil War, relating how the racist son of a wealthy plantation owner turned into a Yankee bugler and all the adventures after that. The material for the first three albums, conceived by the original ''Blueberry'' creators, was originally published in the 1968&amp;ndash;1970 [[mass market paperback]] sized ''Super Pocket Pilote'' series,&lt;ref name="pocketpilote"/&gt; as in total nine 16-page short stories, eight of them constituting one story-arc set in the war. The very first short story, "Tonnerre sur la sierra" ("Thunder on the Sierra"), was actually a post-war stand-alone adventure set before the events depicted in "The Lost Dutchman's Mine". With the exception of the very first and very last, "Double jeu" ("Double Cross"), all other shorts were originally published in black and white.

In 1995, Giraud slightly contradicted Charlier's birth account of ''La Jeunesse'' by divulging that he had already created the "Tonnerre sur la sierra" story by himself, before Charlier actually came up with the Civil War approach, "It was I who scripted the first episode of ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry''. It very much resembled a regular series episode, but much smaller. Charlier subsequently presented me with another idea: the one concerning the Civil War. I found it an excellent idea; Writing started right away."&lt;ref name="arthaud"&gt;{{cite news |last=Breuillier |first=Jean-François |date=November 1995 |title=Interview de Jean Giraud |work=''Arthaud'' BD News |issue=1 |pages=2–4 |publisher=Arthaud Grenette |location= [[Grenoble]] | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giraud created his ''La Jeunesse'' art with the smaller digest size format specifically in mind, and adopted therefore a more loose, less "convoluted" art style which allowed him to create his pages more quickly, already applying the revised technique for "Tonnerre sur la sierra". Additionally, it was for these stories that he started to experiment with applying inks in pen &amp;ndash; alongside the brush he had hitherto exclusively employed for the series &amp;ndash; , a technique he would perfect later on as "Mœbius". While the resulting spontaneous art worked out fine for the smaller sized pages of ''Superpocket Pilote'', it did suffer from the enlargement for the hereafter mentioned album releases, when compared to the larger, more detailed pages for the ''Pilote'' main series on which he concurrently continued to work.&lt;ref name="bree64"&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, pp. 64-65]]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the experience gained on the ''La Jeunesse'' shorts served him well, when he had to create  ''Jim Cutlass'' in a hurry a decade later, utilizing a similar technique.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, pp. 70-71]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of "La jeunesse de Blueberry" ("Blueberry's Secret") in 1975, the first album to collect the first three shorts of the Civil War story-arc, came as a surprise to ''Blueberry'' fans. Having left ''Blueberry'' on a cliffhanger with "Angel Face", when Giraud took his extended leave of absence (see [[#Royalties conflict (1974-1979)|above]]), clamor for new ''Blueberry'' titles became such, that publisher Dargaud decided to make the move as a temporary stop-gap solution. For the book publication, the original pages were blown up and by Giraud extended in width,&lt;ref name="jeunesse"/&gt; rearranged, (re-)colored with some panels omitted in the process to fit the then standard album format of 46 pages, when discounting the two disclaimer pages. While the removal of individual panels was regrettable from a graphic art point of view &amp;ndash; as it, besides the missing art, also broke up the integrity of Giraud's carefully designed page lay-outs, especially in "3000 Mustangs"&lt;ref name="bree64"/&gt; &amp;ndash; , it entailed no consequences for the plot of the shorts, save the first one; in "Blueberry's Secret" the in the synopsis mentioned Long Sam had witnessed the murder Blueberry was accused of and therefore able to prove his innocence, but is gunned down before he is able to do so by the real murderer, who in turn is gunned down by Blueberry, leaving Blueberry without any recourse to prove his innocence. However, for the book publication, the two panels which showed the real murderer being killed were cut, causing a discrepancy as it left readers, unfamiliar with the original publication, wondering why Blueberry was so despondent, as, from their point of view, the real killer was still alive.&lt;ref name="bree64"/&gt;

The releases of the two follow-up collection albums, "Un Yankee nommé Blueberry" ("A Yankee Named Blueberry") and "Cavalier bleu" ("The Blue Coats"), four years later (in itself an indication that Dargaud had not planned to do so initially, if only for the substantial editorial effort it took in the pre-computer era to adapt the original digest size for the standard sized comic book), turned out to be in equal measure a stop-gap initiative. Unable to resolve the royalties conflict, which had dragged on for five years, Charlier and Giraud turned their back on the parent publisher, leaving for greener pastures elsewhere and taking ''all'' of Charlier's co-creations with them. Sensing that it might potentially turn out to be a costly defection, the two ''Young Blueberry'' titles were released to make the most of the fervor that had surrounded the return of ''Blueberry'' with "Nez Cassé". For Dargaud it indeed turned out to be a costly affair as the three 1979/80 titles were the last new titles they were able to release for nearly fifteen years, missing out on a period of time in which ''Blueberry'' reached the pinnacle of its popularity &amp;ndash; seeing, besides new titles in the main series, the birth of two spin-off series as well &amp;ndash; , even though the publishing rights of the older book titles remained where they were. As the "Thunder on the Sierra" short numbered 14 pages instead of 16, no editorial cutting was necessary for the third book. Apart from the editorial changes to fit the book format and the creation of new covers for the two additional albums, Giraud also made use of the opportunity to recreate a small number of panels to replace those he had felt unhappy about in hindsight, spread over all three albums.

Dargaud considered their three, original creator's, ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' book titles as part of the main series, until they regained the ''Blueberry'' rights in late 1993, and as such have therefore seen translations in most of the aforementioned languages as well. Apart from the expedited release of the two additional ''La Jeunesse'' titles, Dargaud also undertook a subsequent action in an attempt to further profit from the upsurge in popularity of ''Blueberry'', by releasing the very first six-volume ''Blueberry'' integral edition of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-7098-BD-Blueberry-Rombaldi-Dargaud.html "Blueberry (Rombaldi-Dargaud)"], Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A co-production with French publisher [[:fr:Rombaldi]], each of the six volumes collected four titles of the then existing main series. Rombaldi was brought into the fold to act as an intermediary in order to negotiate a separate license from Novedi to have the then four Novedi main series titles included as well in volumes 5 and 6, though Dargaud performed a copyright infraction by making sure Novedi was not mentioned as copyright holder in the respective colophons. The three ''La Jeunesse'' titles were collected in volume 6. In recognition for their assistance, Rombaldi was retained for similar releases of the two other Dargaud Western series, ''[[:fr:Jonathan Cartland]]'' (see also ''[[#Second change of artist|below]]'') and ''[[:fr:Mac Coy]]'' &amp;ndash; each, like ''Blueberry'', one of the "big five" 1970s Franco-Belgian realistic Western comics&lt;ref name="bigfive"/&gt; &amp;ndash; , combining all of them in one overall, eleven-volume ''Les géants du l'Ouest'' collection, as promoted in contemporary advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rombaldi.info/index.php?page=21&amp;lang=FRA "''Les géants du l'Ouest''"], Rombaldi.info {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990 English language edition of these books by [[Catalan Communications]] in their "ComCat" line, gave track of the changes and presented the left out panels in editorials in which Giraud himself presented clarifications for the choices made. It was in effect American readership that was first afforded a clarification for the discrepancy in the first book and the editorial changes made, before European readers were, in the editorials by Lofficier of the releases. Only these first three books were published in English. The three American albums, again translated by the Lofficier couple, were also, unaltered and unedited, included in the above-mentioned anthology collection from Graphitti Designs. The Graphitti Designs "Young Blueberry" anthology title differed from the others in that it was not printed on high gloss paper, but on matte paper as in the original ComCat publications, indicating that by then inclusion in the Graphitti ''Moebius'' collection was already accounted for and that the original print run of the interior pages was adjusted accordingly.

*{{anchor|footnote 14}}&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; In their haste to release the two follow-up titles, in the process also having to pay "renegade" Giraud for his input, the editorial office of Dargaud made a substantial editorial blunder. As stated, eight of the nine shorts constituted one long story-arc, but Dargaud placed "Chasse à l'homme" ("Manhunt", the fifth short in the story-arc) as the penultimate one in book 3, causing an awful continuity error. Readers, not familiar with the original ''Super Pocket Pilote'' publications, found themselves facing a baffling and inexplicable plot twist, only aggravated by the publisher who in unconvincing and confusing text captions tried to explain the discrepancy away, leaving uninitiated fans at the time erroneously suspecting that not all shorts were being published. In the publisher's defense however, it should be noted that Charlier had confusingly, but unintentionally, given two of his shorts an identical title in French and it is not that much a stretch of the imagination to assume the editors believing that the two stories belonged with each other. Fortunately for the American readership, the correct chronology, pursuant a first correction in a Danish Anthology earlier that year,&lt;ref&gt;''Blueberry i den Amerikanske borgerkrig'', Interpresse, 1990, {{ISBN|8745607222}}, lacking the "Thunder on the Sierra" short.&lt;/ref&gt; was adhered to in the ComCat releases. Ironically, the French themselves, as indeed the rest of Europe, had to wait until 1995 (the Dutch actually beating the French to the punch by one year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/3075_De_jonge_jaren_van_Blueberry_3_Blauwjas ''De jonge jaren van Blueberry'' 3: "Blauwjas"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt;) before the publisher, pursuant regaining the ''Blueberry'' rights, could be bothered to correct the chronology for later reprint runs, after having it allowed to persevere for nearly two decades in numerous prior reprint runs for all language editions, the Danish and American editions excepted.
*{{anchor|footnote 15}}&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Despite the creators being entitled to royalties, Dargaud's ploy to capitalize on the upsurge in popularity of ''Blueberry'' did not sit well with Charlier, who recognized it for what it was. In order to vent his displeasure, Charlier again made use of the exemption clause of his syndication agency, and established the temporary Editions Presses Internationales (EPI) imprint, under which he published a small ''Lieutenant Blueberry Pocket'' series of three outings in 1982, again using Koralle's &amp;ndash; in whose employ he had been shortly before &amp;ndash; infrastructure. Making sure that these three digit-sized releases were technically and legally magazine releases, akin to the ''Super Pocket Pilote'' source publications, all the shorts from Dargaud's two additional albums were reprinted in the series ({{OCLC|474042925}}). The shorts were presented uncut, with a new coloring, but featured the redrawn panels from Giraud. Ironically though, Charlier too failed to correct the chronology. To drive home the point, the pockets also contained Charlier's two ''Redbeard'' shorts, as Dargaud had also employed a similar ploy for that series, as indeed they also had for ''Tanguy et Laverdure'' for that matter. Charlier licensed Koralle to follow suit by establishing the equally temporary Gary Publishing imprint for identical publication in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/index/31652_Luitenant_Blueberry__Strippocket ''Luitenant Blueberry Strippocket''], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes French editions.&lt;/ref&gt; These were actually among the very last known releases by Koralle, as the publisher was already in an advanced state of becoming defunct. That parent company Axel Springer even allowed the publications to go through at this late stage, should be considered another token of goodwill in recognition of Charlier's help in the smooth transition from Koralle to Novedi, as these pockets saw no release in the German home language, or in any other for that matter. Charlier concurrently farmed out a license to Danish publisher Interpresse (then the Novedi licensed ''Blueberry'' publisher) to publish the ''Blueberry'' shorts in their ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' monthly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicwiki.dk/wiki/Jonah_Hex_(serieblad) "Jonah Hex (serieblad)"], Comicwiki.dk {{dk icon}}; published between issues 28-42 in the period 1981-1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Dargaud at the time had license agreements with competitors Oberon and Serieforlaget for the Netherlands and Denmark respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For the Netherlands: '' Yankee'' (1979, {{ISBN|9032002937}}) and ''Blauwjas'' (1979, {{ISBN|9032003003}}). For Denmark: ''En yankee ved navn Blueberry'' (1984, {{OCLC|60898806}}) and ''Blåjakken Blueberry'' (1984, {{OCLC|60898807}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially the first few pages. I think, as we go along, we will build something that is recognizably different from what Giraud has done up until now. Both publisher Novedi and writer Jean-Michel Charlier told me that they want me to make the series my own as soon as possible. That is why it is such a challenge. I'm looking for my own way.

{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="Jean Giraud has scrutinized the first trial studies of Colin Wilson: he supervised most of his drawings.

Ultimately, the most evident part of my work with him was to prevent him constantly wondering how Giraud would have drawn such and such panel in his place. ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' will not replace the series by Jean Giraud, who is absolutely not tired of drawing it. Quite the contrary, it is constantly on his mind! Since he has more or less identified with Blueberry, he is less and less inclined to drop the series.

But this was a special case, a kind of favor from a friend. I like Colin and his wife Janet very much.

We have never cooperated [''on Young Blueberry''], but when I introduced Colin to Charlier, it was already clear to me that he was good.

After "Angel Face" was completed in 1974, Giraud took an extended leave of absence from ''Blueberry'', because he wanted further explore and develop his "Moebius" alter ego, the work he produced as such being published in ''Métal Hurlant'' magazine, in the process revolutionizing the Franco-Belgian world of ''bandes dessinées''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.causeur.fr/pilote-goscinny-mai-68-31599.html |title= La BD fait sa révolution / Comics make their revolution |work= Causeur.fr |first= Thomas |last= Morales |date= February 22, 2015 |accessdate= May 27, 2017 |language= french |archivedate= May 9, 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170509090656/http://www.causeur.fr/pilote-goscinny-mai-68-31599.html |deadurl= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having ended "Angel Face" on a cliffhanger, Giraud's return to ''Blueberry'' five years later with "Broken Nose" became a media event of considerable proportions and demand for ''Blueberry'' reached an all-time high. It was then that the creators decided to revisit the ''Young Blueberry'' adventures as well, which had ended its run in ''Super Pocket Pilote''. However, Giraud was nowhere near able to take on yet another major series himself, as he was still working on his ''Incal'' series as Moebius, besides having embarked on ''Blueberry'' again.&lt;ref name ="ratier285"/&gt;

There actually had been an additional, more prosaic reason as well for the decision to do so. After Giraud had finished "La dernière carte" he, having been very much invested throughout most of his adult life in [[New Age]] beliefs and practices (which included the use of mind-expanding substances&lt;ref name="sadoul"&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991]]; Giraud has never been shy about the subject of mind-expanding substances, frankly admitting their use in numerous interviews and discussing it in-depth in the Sadoul's book.&lt;/ref&gt;), had already left for Tahiti to join the [[commune]] of mystic Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, the latter had set up there. After a stay of nearly two years, Giraud moved to the United States in late 1984 and set up shop firstly in Santa Monica, and subsequently in Venice and Woodland Hills, California. It was in this era that his work was published by Marvel/Epic for the US market.&lt;ref name="bdpa"&gt;[http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detail.cfm?Id=296 "Jean Giraud: Bibliographie, Photo, Biographie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925123136/http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detail.cfm?Id=296 |date=2008-09-25 }}, BDparadiso.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Novedi feared, not entirely unjustified &amp;ndash; as the release lag between the two books had already increased from eighteen months to three years &amp;ndash; , that it endangered the publication regularity of the main series, and resurrecting, or more accurately, creating the ''Young Blueberry'' series, was the back-up strategy they had in mind.&lt;ref name="Svane, 2003, p. 45"&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003]], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Novedi had solid reasons to do so, as any new ''Blueberry'' title in that particular period of time enjoyed an (all-language) European first print run of 500.000 copies &amp;ndash; thus discounting any later reprint run &amp;ndash; , for European standards a very respectable print run.&lt;ref name="novedi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraaf"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilbrink |first=Felix |date=2 April 1982 |title=Tekenaar Jean Giraud "leed" onder zijn succes, maar... |work=[[De Telegraaf]] |publisher=[[Telegraaf Media Groep]] |location= [[Amsterdam]] | language=Dutch}}; in which it is stated that the Dutch first printing of "La tribu fantôme" numbered 30.000; at the time the rule of thumb was that Dutch-language first print runs numbered approximately 10%-20% of that of their French counterparts, reflecting to some extent the relative sizes of the French, and Dutch speaking European populaces. Furthermore, since Dutch first print releases traditionally number in the 5.000-15.000 range for the vast majority of comic titles &amp;ndash; discounting those few blockbuster staples such as ''Asterix'' &amp;ndash; it was also indicative of the immense popularity main series ''Blueberry'' enjoyed at that time.&lt;/ref&gt;

Publisher and creators subsequently embarked on a search for a suitable artist to take on the task. It was then that fate intervened when Giraud, before his departure to Tahiti, discovered the work of the still unknown ex-pat [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]] from New Zealand, who was publishing a science fiction comic series ''Dans l'Ombre du Soleil'' &amp;ndash; for which Wilson did both the writing and the art &amp;ndash; for the French ''Circus'' comic magazine, which featured the character "Raël" (also the first story title) that shared a stunning resemblance with Blueberry. Wilson was actually was a huge Giraud fan himself and had modeled his "Raël" character after a Western hero he had created for the New Zealand fanzine ''Strips'', and who in turn was modeled after Blueberry. Ironically in hindsight, it were the original black &amp; white ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' shorts that introduced Wilson to ''Blueberry'' as some ''Super Pilote Pocket'' issues had somehow found their to way to New Zealand, then a country without a comic tradition to speak of, according to Wilson. His admiration for Franco-Belgian ''bande dessinée'' artists, Giraud in particular, became in 1980 the driving force for Wilson to try his luck as such in Europe, aside from the fact that his native country did not afford any opportunities to become one professionally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, pp. 8-11]]; [[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 49]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Those drawings of Giraud convinced me to leave New Zealand", Wilson reiterated in 1986, "If that's what European comics are like then I wanted to be a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|''Collective'', 1986, p. 31]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was comic artist [[François Corteggiani]] who brought Wilson to the attention of Giraud by sending him a few pages of the "Raël" comic, and who in turn brought them to the attention of his co-worker Charlier (or vice versa as sources are not in concordance with each other).&lt;ref name="ernst"&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, p.12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaware that his work was already brought to the attention of his idol and ''his'' co-worker, Corteggiani arranged Wilson's first face-to-face meeting with them in September 1983 in Paris. "To have a discussion with Giraud, what a chance!", said a delighted, but non-French speaking Wilson, "That's why I immediately said yes to François Corteggiani". Much to his own surprise, Wilson was almost immediately asked if he was interested to take on the new ''Young Blueberry'' series.&lt;ref name="ernst"/&gt; After having accepted, he developed a close and warm working relationship with Charlier, and the Wilson/[[:fr:Janet Gale|Gale]] couple befriended both him and his wife Christine, with household visits back and forth. The Charlier couple not only helped their friends (neither of them French-speaking and staying on a tourist visa in Amsterdam at the time) to settle firstly in Brussels, Belgium, and subsequently in the [[Provence]], France,&lt;ref name="Svane, 2003, p. 46"&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 46]]&lt;/ref&gt; but with practical work details as well, as Wilson later recalled, "Janet and I were tremendously lucky, Charlier was in many respects something of a kind uncle to us. He did not make a fuss about anything. He really stuck out his neck for me by involving me, a virtually unknown young artist, in a success series. I know he could be tough as nails with publishers. We were fortunate though, that he negotiated on our behalf as well, and we profited very much from the deals he struck."&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite news |last=van Oudheusden |first=Peter |date=August–September 2006 |title=Colin Wilson: Tekenaar tussen twee werelden |work=ZoZoLaLa |issue=149 |pages=4–6  |publisher=Stichting Zet.El |location= [[Nijmegen]] | language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was signed for five albums.&lt;ref name="lechat"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lechat |first=Jean-Louis |date=1985 |title=Dossier Wilson: La deuxième jeunesse de Blueberry |work=TinTin |issue=23 |pages=48–49 |publisher=Le Lombard |location= Brussels | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corteggiani himself was yet to leave his mark on the ''La Jeunesse de Blueberry'' series later on. Wilson became the second, and last Charlier artist, after Giraud, whom the author provided with script pages in a timely fashion, once even receiving a page overnighted from Kuwait where the author then was on documentary assignment, just to keep his artist working.&lt;ref name="Svane, 2003, p. 46"/&gt;

After a short apprenticeship (during which he produced ''Blueberry'' study art) to fine tune his art style, already close to that of Giraud, in order to have it move even closer to that of Giraud, embarked with fervor on the project with his first outing "Les démons du Missouri" ("Missouri Demons"), which essentially became the rationale for the ''Young Blueberry'' adventures to become a spin-off series onto their own.&lt;ref name="Svane, 2003, p. 45"/&gt; Working seven days a week for ten to twelve hours, Wilson produced five to six pages a month, using a combination of pen and brush for he inks, just as his idol had done for his ''Jeunesse'' stories and which had become the inspiration for Wilson to abandon the [[Rotring]] technical utensils he had originally used in New-Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, pp. 8, 18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As it had in 1980 when Giraud was working on "La longue marche" with an assistant (see ''[[#Intermezzo: Marshal Blueberry|below]]''), rumors quickly abounded in the tight-knit ''bande dessinée'' community that Giraud intended to abandon ''Blueberry''. This time around however, and unlike 1980, the rumors found their way to the outside world, causing anxiety in the fan community. Despite the publisher's standing policy of releasing comics directly in album format, it was decided to have "Les démons du Missouri" pre-published in the newspaper ''[[France-Soir]]'', one of the largest newspapers in France at the time, in an effort to counteract the growing disquiet. A first for ''Blueberry'' insofar daily newspapers were concerned, black &amp; white publication began at the start of 1985, with Wilson feeding the newspaper with half-pages as he went along. The first half-page was accompanied by an editorial from Charlier, in which he tried to allay the fears of the fans (see ''quotebox''). The format was for good measure repeated in 1987 with Wilson's second outing, "Terreur sur le Kansas" ("Terror over Kansas"), for the same newspaper, but abandoned afterwards when Wilson had become an established  ''Blueberry'' artist himself. ''France-Soir'' saw two half-pages (1b and 2a) from "Terreur sur le Kansas" published that were not incorporated in the album, released later that year, for print technical reasons (see also ''[[#The Blueberry biography|The Blueberry biography]]'' in this regard).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmcharlier.com/blueberry3.html#9 "Les Démons du Missourri - Terreur sur le Kansas"], JMCharlier.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial trepidations of fans, Wilson's ''Blueberry''s were favorably received, achieving print run numbers approximating those of the main series, as well as seeing translations in nearly as many languages, with English being the glaring one of the few exceptions as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/index/948_De_jonge_jaren_van_Blueberry "''De jonge jaren van Blueberry''"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson has divulged that Novedi released the first album in a first French printing of 150.000 copies (Novedi had by then taken over the publication for France as well) and a Dutch first printing of 50.000 copies, a huge step up from the initial French only 12.000 copy release for the "Raël" album. The French edition however, sold out in a matter of weeks, and an additional 20.000 copies followed suit in a hurry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, pp. 12, 18]]&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the main series, the first printing was conservative for the French edition and ample for the Dutch edition.&lt;ref name="Telegraaf"/&gt; It even had a positive side-effect on his science fiction series ''Dans l'Ombre du Soleil'', which saw German, Dutch and Danish translations after he had embarked on ''Blueberry''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/index/316_In_de_schaduw_van_de_zon "''In de schaduw van de zon''"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson though, had to abandon this series in 1989, having added two more titles, because ''Blueberry'' demanded all his attention and energy, aside from the fact that it was the more successful one by far, allowing the couple to move to the Provence.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt; It were not only the fans who were relieved, Wilson too had his trepidations alleviated when he met the fans face-to-face for the first time at several comic convention book signings after the release of the first album, grateful for their gracious reception and acceptance of his ''Blueberry'', even though most of them concurrently ''and'' emphatically expressed their relieve that Giraud would continue to be the artist for the main series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, p. 18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wilson was working on "Terreur sur le Kansas", he was asked by Giraud, who had shortly returned to Europe, to finish up on "Le bout de la piste" as well, as he was pressed for time, preparing to leave for California where he just had set up shop. Wilson did part of the inking of "Le bout de la piste", while his girlfriend Janet Gale, who had followed him from New Zealand, took on the coloring. Giraud himself assigned her the task, being impressed by the work she had done on her fiancé's album. Gale was actually a relative novice, as she only started coloring on her fiancé's ''Dans l'Ombre du Soleil'' series, having been unable to find legitimate employment in Europe due to her visa status.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, pp 13-15]]&lt;/ref&gt; She would continue to color all her future husband's ''Blueberry'' books, as well as several albums from other artists released by Novedi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?auteur=317&amp;sort=strip "Janet Gale"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}, includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Giraud himself was from the moment Wilson took over the series no longer involved creatively, aside from occasionally giving his young colleague some advise, but did receive a "small inventor's fee" per title, as he himself had coined it.&lt;ref name="Sadoul, 1991, p. 163"&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, p. 163]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While several European countries (including outliers like Iceland and Turkey&lt;ref&gt;''NeoBlek'' magazine for Iceland, and ''[[:tr:Doğan Kardeş]]'' magazine for Turkey, though neither country has seen book publications as of 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;) had, no post-original creators title &amp;ndash; discounting the newspaper serialization of the first two Wilson titles &amp;ndash; has seen serialized comic magazine pre-publication in France/French-Belgium itself, where the titles were instead directly released as books. By the time the 1990 "Le raid infernal" was released however, virtually every other country had followed suit due to the demise of the serialized magazine format.&lt;ref name="croa"/&gt;

Like parent publisher Dargaud, publisher Novedi considered the ''Young Blueberry'' books part of the main series at first until 1990, before they were instituted as a separate spin-off series, mostly for the practical reason of wanting to avoid further pollution of release numbering and chronology. Dargaud's stance was adhered to in other European countries, among others in Spain where then regular ''Blueberry'' publisher [[:es:Editorial Grijalbo|Grijalbo/Ediciones Junior]] released their 1988-1996 ''Las aventuras del teniente Blueberry'' eight-volume integral collection, encompassing all hitherto released ''Blueberry'' albums, including those of Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?collectie=4637&amp;sort=collectienr "''Las aventuras del teniente Blueberry''"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dargaud had to do for their previous ''Les géants du l'ouest'' collection, the Spanish had to separately negotiate licenses from Koralle and Novedi for their ''Blueberry'' releases, but unlike the Dargaud release, these publishers were dutifully mentioned as copyright holders in the colophons of the respective volumes. Wilson's "Terreur sur le Kansas" became the first album to be released as a separate ''La Jeunesse'' series title in 1987, as indicated on its back cover. It was therefore not Dargaud who took the initiative for the move, but rather Novedi, due to the fact that Dargaud had lost the publishing rights for new ''Blueberry'' titles, actually missing out on the first five, most successful, titles of the new series as explained. But Dargaud did adopt the format, once these rights had returned to them in late 1993.

Catalan Communications ''had'' planned to publish "Missouri Demons", "Terror over Kansas", and beyond in English as well, as additions to their ''Young Blueberry'' series in the "ComCat" line from 1991 onward (alongside Hermann's ''Comanche'' Western incidentally, another favorite of Wilson),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jordan |first=Gil |last2=Thompson |first2=Kim |authorlink2=Kim Thompson |title=From Europe with Love: An Interview with Catalan's Outspoken Bernd Metz" &amp; "Approaching Euro-Comics: A Comprehensive Guide to the Brave New World of European Graphic Albums |year=March 1989  |publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]]|location=[[Westlake Village, California]] |work=Amazing Heroes |issue=160 |pages=22–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was already indicated on the back covers of the three original ones published in 1989-1990. The former had in effect already received an ISBN number. Publication came to naught however, due to the near concurrent, but otherwise coincidental, demises of both Novedi ''and'' Catalan Communications in late 1989 and 1990 respectively.

====Change of writer====
While Charlier's death in July 1989 did not cause succession problems for the main series as explained, it did not held true for the ''Jeunesse'' series as both Charlier's heir, Philippe Charlier, and the publisher considered Wilson too much of an unexperienced novice to take on the writing of a major series himself, or as he himself had later put it, "I doubt if "Raël" or "Mantell" accounted for anything at Dargaud [sic.] in this regard".&lt;ref name="svane46"&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, pp. 46-48]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the search for a replacement for Charlier, turned out to be a rather tall order, as none of the established names in the Franco-Belgian comic world were found willing to fill the shoes of the legendary Charlier, whereas non-established names were rejected for pretty much the same reasons why Wilson was not considered as replacement. It was then, in order to break the gridlock, that Wilson suggested François Corteggiani as replacement, deeming it "logical", as he assumed Corteggiani to be an admirer of Charlier.&lt;ref name="svane46"/&gt; Corteggiani had been one of the lesser names in the Franco-Belgian comic world, having predominantly written a couple of short-lived humorous comic series and one realistic series, the heavily ''[[The Godfather (film series)|Godfather Trilogy]]'' inspired [[mafia]] saga ''De silence et de sang'' &amp;ndash; which he had abandoned in 1986 after only two volumes, only to take it on again ten years later, piggybacking on his newfound notoriety as ''Blueberry'' writer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?auteur=141 "François Corteggiani"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both critical and commercial success have always eluded Corteggiani, and by the time he was approached by Novedi and Philippe Charlier, he had suspended his own career as a ''bande dessinée'' artist, instead becoming a tenured script writer for the French Disney studios.&lt;ref name="svane46"/&gt; To his credit, Corteggiani refused at first, for the same reason his more established colleagues had already done previously, but eventually conceded on the insistence of Wilson.&lt;ref name="svane46"/&gt; Wilson had personal reasons to do so, as Corteggiani was a personal friend of the Wilson-couple, aside for the practical reason that he was living in the vicinity of the Wilson-couple at the time. When the non-French speaking Wilson couple first arrived in Europe, they met Corteggiani at the annual Italian [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games]] festival. Corteggiani took a shining on the newcomers and took them under his wing. It was Corteggiani, using his vast Franco-Belgian comic world social network, who introduced Wilson to publisher Glénat, resulting in his first European comic series ''Dans l'Ombre du Soleil'', in the process negotiating on behalf of his friend. And as already related, it was Corteggiani who, while keeping tabs on the work of his friend, introduced Wilson's work to the ''Blueberry'' creators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ernst, 1987, pp. 12-13]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson reasoned that by suggesting Cortegianni for a major series, he could return the favor he had provided him a few years earlier, by getting his friend's ''bande dessinée'' career back on track. Actually, he and Wilson had already started their own ''Thunderhawks'' comic series before Charlier died,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/index/1150_Thunderhawks "''Thunderhawks''"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt; an aviation comic set shortly after the first world war in the American South-West, but which had to take a backseat due to the fact that the ''Blueberry'' series took precedence.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt;

Corteggiani's first order of business was to finish up on the script for "Le raid infernal" which was halfway completed by Charlier at the time of his death. This he did to the satisfaction of all parties involved, including Wilson,&lt;ref name="svane46"/&gt; and Corteggiani was retained as the ''Jeunesse'' writer ever since.

The publication of Wilson's fourth album "La poursuite impitoyable" in 1992 was surprisingly still under the Novedi imprint, over a year after the publishing house had ceased to exist. This can only be explained by the fact that Wilson was originally signed for five albums by Novedi,&lt;ref name="lechat"/&gt; and that the [[Receivership|official receivers]] of the defunct publisher wanted the revenues for the legal and financial finalization of the bankruptcy. The album therefore became a posthumous Novedi release. All legal issues were apparently resolved by the time of the publication of the fifth Wilson album, "Trois hommes pour Atlanta" one year later, as it was released by Novedi's successor Alpen Publishers, becoming the only ''Jeunesse'' title they were able to release, before they themselves lost publication rights to Dargaud in late 1993.

No post-original creators editions have seen the day of light in the English language as of 2016, but, like the source series, the ''Young Blueberry'' spin-off series did see translations in numerous languages, the three titles by the original creators and the Wilson outings specifically, but appreciatively less so for the subsequent releases. The latter is amply exemplified by the Corteggiani/Blanc-Dumont versions, which are not that favorably received &amp;ndash; unlike the Wilson versions, whose first three outings were notably well received, in no small part due to the fact that they were still being written by co-creator Charlier &amp;ndash; as indicated by its steadily diminishing popularity; had volume 12 still seen a first-print run of 100.000 copies in France in 2001, by 2015 that number had dwindled to 40.000 (which in France is approaching the cut-off point for a standard comic album being economically viable to become published) when volume 21 was released,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/StripFacts-1601.php#Stripjaarrapport "Stripjaarrapport 2015: lichte daling"], Stripspeciaalzaak.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; aside from the fact that several publishers had foregone the publication of these book titles in their countries altogether. As of 2016, the spin-off series by Corteggiani and Blanc-Dumont remains only published in French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Danish and Italian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/181832_De_jonge_jaren_van_Blueberry_20_Gettysburg ''De jonge jaren van Blueberry'' 20: "Gettysburg"], stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}; includes other language editions.&lt;/ref&gt; a far cry from the nearly two dozen languages the main series had once been published in.

===Intermezzo: ''Marshal Blueberry''===
{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="When Guy Vidal of Humanos brought me into contact with Jean Giraud at the time, he presented me with a story that I liked very much. But Giraud had written the script as a novel. The page division was still lacking, as were the dialogs. Furthermore he had planned to spread the story over two books. I suggested to expand that to three books. After I had finished the first ''Marshal Blueberry'', I did not want to do all the work alone anymore. I did not have the time, nor did I want to do the work, others should have rightfully done. [[Thierry Smolderen]] subsequently worked out the script. But then I procrastinated. Dargaud had bought back ''Blueberry'', Giraud had rejected part of Smolderen's script, altered the page divisions, etcetera. In the end I became fed up with the third book, and threw in the towel."|salign=right|source=—Vance, 1996, on his experiences working on ''Marshal Blueberry''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ledoux, 2003]], p. 66  (quoted from the Winter 1996 ''Sapristi!'', issue 36, magazine interview)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This spin-off series was the second attempt, this time by Alpen Publishers, to further capitalize on the huge popularity both the main, and Wilson's ''Blueberry'' series enjoyed at the time. Written by co-creator Giraud, the series was set around the events depicted in ''The Lost Dutchman's Mine'' and dealt with scrupulous gun runners arming Apaches, thereby instigating an uprising. Chosen by the publisher for the art work was William Vance, an accomplished Belgian comic artist in his own right and renowned for his [[XIII (comics)|''XIII'' comic series]]. Vance, with whom Giraud had virtually no dealings in person, drew the first two outings in the series, but declined afterwards to continue, partly because he was required to finish an album in only four months (in Europe, one year was the typical mean to complete a comic book of 48 pages, but not rarely exceeds this time span in recent decades) and that he was unaccustomed to Giraud's style as script writer. Additionally, even though the first book sold 100.000 copies (while respectable, relatively modest compared to the contemporary print runs of the two other series, they being printed in numbers at the very least double that&lt;ref name="Telegraaf"/&gt;), fans received the book with mixed feelings as Vance's style was a too radical departure to their tastes from that of Giraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Ledoux, 2003, p. 66]]&lt;/ref&gt; This actually was part of the reasons why Wilson's work for ''Young Blueberry'' was so favorably received and partly the reason why Blanc-Dumont's was not. While conceding that he found Vance's particular style "seductive but sometimes artificial" &amp;ndash; having been pleased with the first album, but less so with the second &amp;ndash; , Giraud himself was disappointed and hurt by the defection of a professional like the established Vance for reasons of aesthetics and integrity, as he wanted the series to be executed by only one artist, deeming the defection "disastrous" for the series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 38]]; [[#Sources|Sadoul, 2015, p. 221]]&lt;/ref&gt; The unresolved story cycle lingered in limbo for seven years, before Giraud in person found [[:fr:Michel Rouge]] &amp;ndash; whose style was closer to his &amp;ndash; willing to finish the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Svane|Svane, 2003, pp. 71-72]]&lt;/ref&gt;

That Rouge's style resembled that of Giraud, was hardly a surprise, as Rouge was actually not a stranger to ''Blueberry''. Twenty years earlier, when Rouge was still a quite unknown and aspiring comic artist, Giraud took him on as an apprentice and had him ink pages 15–35 of "La longue marche" in 1980 &amp;ndash; thereby doing for an aspiring artist what Jijé had done for him nearly two decades before that. At the time it gave rise to the rumor that Giraud was planning to abandon his co-creation and that Rouge was groomed to take over the series. Though a rumor, there was a nuanced morsel of truth in it, as Rouge clarified two decades later, "No, he did not want to abandon ''Blueberry'', but rather sought support and perhaps the opportunity to create books, like the ones he is currently doing [''Mister Blueberry'']. At the time, he was already playing with the notion of doing parallel series." Though not ''Blueberry'', Rouge ''did'' take over that other famed contemporary Franco-Belgian western comic series, Hermann's ''Comanche''. Unfortunately, Rouge was not able to regain the popularity that series once enjoyed, when it was still penciled by Hermann, and the series was suspended indefinitely after Rouge had only added five titles to the series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, pp. 68-73]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rouge's words notwithstanding though, and while he has never acted upon it in earnest, Giraud did later admit that there were "temptations" in that period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 39]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intended to become a full-fledged series, the three ''Marshal Blueberry'' titles have remained the only outings in the series, though they too have seen several foreign language publications. Although not in France itself, several European countries have seen serialized magazine pre-publication of the first two titles. The third 2000 title though, was invariably directly released in book format for virtually all countries.&lt;ref name="croa"/&gt; No English language editions were released. Incidentally, in 2013 Giraud returned the favor Vance had provided for his co-creation, when he took on the art work of volume 18 for his ''XIII'' series, and which ''has'' seen English translations.

In the meantime, Alexandro offered him ''Bouncer'', which he naturally accepted.

A third spin-off series, coined '''''Blueberry 1900''''', was conceived by original creator Giraud in the early-1990s, intended as a bonafide sequel series. Set, as the series title already implied, in the era of the [[William McKinley]] presidency, it would not only have featured a 57-year old Blueberry, but his adult son as well, albeit in a minor role. The story line, intended to encompass five books, was to take place around events surrounding the assassination of President McKinley. Pegged for the artwork was French comic artist [[François Boucq]] whom Giraud had met at a comic event in honor of his lifelong friend [[Jean-Claude Mézières]], and concurrently discussed the project with. Actually, Giraud had previously approached Michel Blanc-Dumont, whose "lyric" art work for ''Jonathan Cartland'' he adored, for the project around 1993, then still tentatively called ''Blueberry 20 ans après'' (''Blueberry, 20 years later''). Blanc-Dumont, despite being reciprocally an admirer of Giraud's art and aside from being still invested in his own Western comic, thought the project not suitable for him, deeming the script outline too ''Mœbiusienne'' for his taste, and had already suggested Boucq instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Svane, 2003, p. 53]]&lt;/ref&gt; Boucq showed interest and was enthusiastic about the project, and indeed embarked on the production of pre-publication art studies, but deemed a cycle of five books too much, managing to negotiate it down to a cycle of three books.&lt;ref name="boucq"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vidal |first=Jean-Marc |title=Jodo tire le premier" &amp; "Boucq-berry |year=November 1999 |publisher=LZ Publications|location=Paris |work=BoDoï |issue=24 |pages=36–37 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Weetje-vd-Week/Weetje-vd-Week-126-150.htm#Weetje138 "Onvoltooid project: ''Blueberry 1900'' door François Boucq en Jean Giraud"], Stripspeciaalzaak.be {{nl icon}}; [http://comicwiki.dk/wiki/Blueberry_1900 "''Blueberry 1900''"], ComicWiki.dk {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Philippe Charlier, son of the late Jean-Michel Charlier and proprietor of "JMC Aventures" &amp;ndash; the foundation and legal copyright owner, set up back in 1990 with the specific intent to safeguard the creative integrity and legacy of his father, both in a spiritual as well as a commercial sense, but which had become dormant after the failed experiment at Alpen Publishers&lt;ref name="Giger"/&gt; &amp;ndash; , was nowhere near as enthusiastic as Boucq was. He became increasingly alarmed and downright aghast when reading commentaries, Giraud made in contemporary magazine interviews, clarifying his intentions and premises for the proposed series of a Blueberry residing with the [[Hopi]] tribe, meditating under the influence of mind-expanding substances,&lt;ref name="sadoul"/&gt; while President McKinley was levitating in the [[White House]] due to a Hopi spell. As heir and steward of his father's co-creations and legacy, being the 50% co-owner of the ''Blueberry'' brand, he still had the unequivocal right to veto any and all proposals regarding the trademark ''Blueberry'' and did not hesitate for a moment to exercise his prerogative in this case, going as far as taking Giraud to court, resulting in that the project fell through. As per a horrified Charlier Jr. in a contemporary statement, "The script is unbelievably horrifying. It is an effrontery, constructed out of implausible circumstances. Like in the new [''OK Corral''] story cycle, we find a totally passive Blueberry, only meditating, while the president, enchanted by Indians, is levitating in the White House".&lt;ref name="fueri"/&gt; As he indicated, though he had given his seal of approval in this case, Charlier Jr., also became wary and disapproving of Giraud depicting the former lieutenant as a passive loafer in the ''OK Corral'' story arc, only aggravated from his point of view by the fact that Giraud could not refrain himself from including some elements from Native-American mysticism in "OK Corral" and "Dust" &amp;ndash; though not anywhere near as extensive as he had apparently intended for ''Blueberry 1900''.&lt;ref name="jurg"&gt;[[#Sources|Jürgeit, 2003, p. 12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippe Charlier, conservative by nature like his father, had, unlike his father,&lt;ref name="bree41"/&gt; no patience whatsoever with Giraud's "New Age" predilections (also serving as an additional rationale for his decision to proceed with Alpen Publishers back in 1990, instead of Les Humanoïdes Associés, renowned for its catalog of more adult, "esoteric" comics, like those of Boucq and [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]), particularly for his admitted fondness for mind-expanding substances. It was he (after his father's death), who testified in court, that his father had always "detested" Giraud's work as "Mœbius" and that he considered that work as "treason".&lt;ref name="flip"/&gt; While Philippe was unable to stop the ''OK Corral'' cycle, because of the "longest living survivor" main series covenant Giraud and Charlier Sr. had signed, he was able to stop Giraud in his tracks in court for ''Blueberry 1900'' because it had never been presented by Giraud as a ''main series'' effort, but rather as a '''brand''' expansion (notice the legal difference), and on this Charlier Jr. had veto rights. Reinforced by the for him favorable court ruling, Charlier Jr. was therefore subsequently able to veto Giraud's 1999 scenario outline for a ''Fort Mescalero'' movie, which was to feature Blueberry in extensive substance-induced hallucinatory scenes, besides Giraud's intention to have the ''Jim Cutlass'' series merge with the ''Blueberry'' main series, due to the fact that later volumes of that series also increasingly incorporated likewise scenes, arguing that such a merging would indeed constitute another brand extension.&lt;ref name="fueri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stripspeciaalzaak.be"/&gt;

How far Giraud actually already was in his thinking was exemplified by the inclusion of his art featuring Blueberry with Hopi tribesmen, endowed with the caption "In Hopi Towns",&lt;ref&gt;Actually, after a historical photograph ([http://blueberrybr.blogspot.nl/2013/06/inspiracoes-de-charlier-e-de-giraud.html blueberrybr.blogspot.nl])&lt;/ref&gt; as the interior flyleaf illustration for the regular 1990 "Arizona Love" French book release,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/341542/ comics.org]&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted as such, without the caption, in the last 1991 Graphitti Designs release, ''Moebius #9''. Additionally, Giraud had sneaked in some ''Blueberry 1900'' elements (including floating Washington dignitaries) in the non-''Blueberry'', Native-American themed, short story "The Words of Chief Seattle", which saw English publication in Epic's second ''Blueberry'' book release, "Ballad for a Coffin".

However, Giraud's fascination with [[shamanism]] went even further back than that, when he was introduced by Jodorowsky &amp;ndash; during the failed ''Dune''-project &amp;ndash; in 1974 to the writings of [[Carlos Castaneda]], who had written a series of books that describe his training in shamanism, particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the [[Toltecs]]. The books, narrated in the first person, related his experiences under the tutelage of a [[Yaqui]] "Man of Knowledge" named [[Don Juan Matus]]. Castaneda's writings made a deep and everlasting impression on Giraud, already open to Native-Mexican folk culture due to his three previous extended trips to the country (he had visited the country a third time in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|de Bree, 1982, pp. 22-24]]&lt;/ref&gt; also see ''[[Jean Giraud#Notes|Giraud on Carlos Castaneda]]''), and it did influence his art as "Mœbius", particularly in regard to dream sequences, though he was not quite able to work in such influences in his mainstream ''Blueberry'' comic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Sadoul, 1991, pp. 39-45]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, unbeknownst to writer Charlier, he did already sneak in some Castaneda elements in "Nez Cassé".&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite news  |last=Burns |first=Mal |last2=Friedrich |first2=Mike |title=Gir/Mœbius: Interview met Jean Giraud |date=Winter 1978–1979  |publisher=Uitgeverij De Meulder|location=[[Assen]] |work=Striprofiel |issue=36 |pages=19–21 |language=Dutch}}; Interviewer Friedrich double-checked with Les Humanoïdes Associés publishing editor [[Jean-Pierre Dionnet]], and was told that a Mœbius album did 40,000-50,000 copies per title at the time, contrary to the 10,000 Giraud claimed.&lt;/ref&gt; Castaneda's influence reasserted itself in full in Giraud's later life, having worked in elements more openly after Charlier's death in "Geronimo l'Apache", becoming, as indicated, a major element for ''Blueberry 1900''.

====Ramifications====
Boucq was disappointed with the project falling through, disagreeing with Charlier Jr.'s assessment, "Quite the contrary, depicting him as an old man, forced us to endow him with a special kind of dignity".&lt;ref name="boucq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jurg"/&gt; Yet, for him it turned out to be a blessing in disguise eventually, as it became an inspiration for Jodorowsky (co-creator of Giraud's acclaimed ''Incal'' series, and already a frequent Boucq collaborator), to co-create with him their own acclaimed western comic. ''[[:fr:Bouncer]]'' (published by Les Humanoïdes Associés). And even the fictional "Fort Mescalero" has resurfaced as Blueberry's very first Far West posting in the 2007 prequel book ''Apaches'', aside from the fact that much of what he had envisioned for this project actually turned up in the 2004 ''[[Blueberry (film)|Blueberry]]'' movie. As a warming-up for ''Blueberry 1900'', Boucq and Giraud had already collaborated on a Native-American themed project when they both contributed to the 1995 "Laissé Pour Mort", a to 500 pieces limited CD/Portfolio release from Parisian-based publisher Stardom, Giraud's own publishing house/art gallery, ran at the time by his second wife Isabelle. Later, in 2008, Giraud submitted a "Blueberry-meets-Bouncer" contribution to the to 250 pieces limited "Bouncer" portfolio from short-lived publisher Osidarta, aside from providing a foreword.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/142255_Bouncer_PF1_Bouncer stripINFO.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Charlier Jr.'s vehement resistance, Giraud himself seemed to have never abandoned the notion of doing ''Blueberry 1900'' as was evidenced in a 2008 interview, when he was asked if he would ever return to ''Blueberry'' after he had once stated in a prior magazine interview that he was done with his creation upon the conclusion of the ''OK Corral'' story arc.&lt;ref&gt;''BoDoï'', Hors Séries 15, Paris: LZ Publications, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "Looking back at it," stated Giraud, "I realized that I really wanted to continue ''Blueberry''. This would probably not be the case if I were to re-start a cycle of 5 albums, because I do not think I have the energy left for another ten years of work. Actually, I want to take up the idea of ''Blueberry 1900'' again, which has a very realistic side, sometimes a more crazy one: the Indians were a magical people, that was part of their culture, and I want to stage the collision between our world, through the conquest of the West, and the world of Indians who resist. It is often shown how events took place in a strategic sense, but I wish to plunge into Indian sociology, like it was done in ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', by replacing our materialistic vision of the world, and by explaining the clash of cultures that took place. Of course, there is a certain challenge in doing the story this way, because I might possibly yank the rug from under the feet of the reader. I still have to rework the script and do the page divisions, but I think it will take between 100 and 200 pages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.actuabd.com/Jean-Giraud-Moebius-3-3-Je-veux-continuer-Blueberry#nb3 | title=Jean Giraud – Moebius (3/3): "Je veux continuer Blueberry" | work= Actuabd.com | first=Charles-Louis|last=Detournay|date= 30 October 2008 |accessdate= |language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giraud's death in 2012 ended all notions of a ''Blueberry 1900'' installment, and quite possibly any further installment of the main series as well.

==The Blueberry biography==
{{quote |quote="In my function as literary editor, I also amused myself by mounting a massive hoax. It was meant to expand a bit upon the knowledge of Blueberry's past that I had introduced in the full ''Jeunesse'' stories. As an aside, I humbly apologize to the respectable professors and other eminent historians who have rock solidly believed in it, and who have overwhelmed me with requests for my sources. The idea came to me at the [[National Archives in Washington]], when I was looking for old pictures for a television show. One of them caught my eye on a pile of documents dating from the Civil War. It showed a young, anonymous officer, serving in the cavalry of the Union, who resembled the young Blueberry as drawn by Jean Giraud. It was too beautiful! I could not resist! I acquired a lot of other pictures of the era, representing southern plantations, black slaves in cotton fields, scenes of the Civil War, trains, forts, Mississippi Show Boats ... And, using them as starting point, I wrote the detailed biography of Mike Steve Donovan, alias Blueberry, which can now be read at the start of the album "Ballade pour un cercueil". I mingled many real facts and characters that had really existed into my  imaginary biography. Thanks to the photos brought back from Washington, it became a flagrant truth. To complete this forgery, that amused me immensely, I commissioned my graphic artist Peter Glay for the superb false historical portrait that you can also admire. A detail that should not be lacking in all this pizzazz, the officers represented on Blueberry sides are, in reality, comic artists [[Jean-Marc Reiser]] and [[Jean Tabary]], who were relatively unknown at the time, but who have come a long way since the time they posed as Blue Coats! This hoax worked beyond all hopes: thousands of readers believed in the real existence of Blueberry, following the publication of this false, with authentic photos illustrated, biography. That my victims may forgive me: ''si non è vero è bene trovato!''"|salign=right|source=Charlier, in a latter-day accounting for his ''Blueberry'' biography.&lt;ref name="ratier240"&gt;[[#Sources|Ratier, 2013, pp. 240-243]]; Charlier's Italian proverb translates as "''If not true, then well found!''"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=45%|quote="Blueberry can not die, I have the certainty and proof of that ever since I have read the biography, Charlier has written before he left us. He is such a rich character that people can not imagine him disappearing. According to Jean-Michel, Blueberry has even rubbed shoulders with [[Eliot Ness]]. The history of such a character can not have an ending."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"With that biography, we encumbered ourselves with a mind-boggling task. We had created the possibility to highlight Blueberry in a panoramic manner by concurrently publish several different series, in which he is young, less young and, why not, old eventually. We even could have told the story of his death without ending the series. Blueberry is a particularly intimate life companion. He is part of me, but it should not become an obsession. That is the reason why I have given him the chance to escape me by entrusting him to others. In essence, it has become Blueberry's fate to be condemned to life by his creators."|salign=right|source=—Giraud, on his firm conviction that, due to the biography, ''Blueberry'' is now for the ages, and how it has allowed the ''Blueberry'' universe to expand beyond the boundaries of the main series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bosser|Bosser, 2005, p. 74]]; ''Blueberry: De mijn van Prosit &amp; Het spook van de goudmijn'', p. 4, Castricum: Stichting Sherpa, 2011, {{ISBN|9789089880178}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1974 Charlier had a sixteen-page background article added to "Ballade pour un cercueil" ({{oclc|893750651}}), when the book was first released. The article concerned a fictitious biography of Mike Steve Donovan, alias Mike S. Blueberry, detailing his life from birth to death, and written from a historic, journalistic point of view. When asked about it a decade later, Charlier clarified that once it became clear to him that Blueberry had become the central character of the series he had conceived, he then already postulated in his mind the broad strokes of the complete life and works of his creation, including the reasons for Blueberry's broken nose and odd alias.&lt;ref name="coll22"&gt;[[#Collective|''Collective'', 1986, p. 22]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time "Ballade pour un cercueil" was ready for its book release, Charlier deemed the moment had arrived to entrust his musings to paper. There had been a practical reason as well for this. The story already ran 16 pages over-length and as contemporary printers printed eight double-sided comic book pages on one sheet of print paper, the addition of the 16-page biography was not that much of a bother for their production process.&lt;ref&gt;Previously, "Le spectre aux balles d'or", had run four pages over-length, which, not being a multitude of eight, '''had''' been a bother for the contemporary printer as it resulted in excess paper waste.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ballade pour un cercueil" therefore became one of the first Franco-Belgium comic albums to break the mold of the hitherto standard 48-page count format.

[[File:General Winfield S. Hancock and Generals Francis C. Barlow, David B. Birney, John Gibbon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Charlier's "young, anonymous officer" on the far left, presented as "the only known photo of Blueberry" on page 10 of the biography. The photo actually depicts Union General [[Francis C. Barlow]].]]
Currently somewhat of a staple in European comics, at that time the inclusion of an informative background section in a comic book of that size and wealth of detail was hitherto unheard of and a complete novelty, and what Charlier had not foreseen was that many in the pre-internet era mistook the biography for real, factual history, propagating it as such in other outside media as well.&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands for example, it was the popular science magazine ''Kijk'' of March 1977 (pp. 42-44) where the edited biography was presented to its readership as factual history.&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier, who also was an investigative journalist and a documentary maker with a solid reputation for thorough documentation, had previously already written several, shorter historical Old West background editorials for the 1969-1970 ''Super Pocket Pilote'' series (issues 4-9) as companion pieces for the ''Jeunesse de Blueberry'' shorts, which ''were'' historically accurate &amp;ndash; and, incidentally, working much of the material contained therein, especially the photographs, into the biography for the post-war era&lt;ref name="diligence"&gt;[http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/auteurs1/charlier.htm "Charlier dans Pilote"], BDoubliés.com {{fr icon}}; the eight-page each 1969/70 Western editorials concerned, "La [[American Civil War|guerre civile américaine]]" (issue 4), "Le dernier combat du "[[George Armstrong Custer|colonel Tête Jaune"]]" (issue 5), "Le dernier combat de [[Kintpuash|"Captain" Jack]]" (issue 6), "Géronimo" (issue 7), "La longue marche des [[Nez Perce people|Nez–Percés]]" (issue 8), and "Le plus sanglant vantard de l’ouest [["Wild Bill" Hickok]]" (issue 9), all of which actually implying that Charlier had already done his due diligence long before he wrote the biography.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; , and readers therefore assumed that the biography was likewise.

Still, having written the biography within the historical context '''as postulated in the comic''', fully expecting his readership to understand it as such, Charlier originally had not the intention to perform a prank at the expense of his readers, despite him later presenting it as such in the above statement, mischievously poking fun at the "respectable" and "eminent", but gullible, believers &amp;ndash; and which was in concordance with biographer Ratier's observation of the author "taking liberties" with actual events for dramatic effect,&lt;ref name="Ratier, 2013, p. 205"/&gt; aside from the fact that his "it was meant to" statement also implied his original intent ''and'' the incongruous circumstance that he had already left the employ of Dargaud and ''Pilote'' in 1972 as already mentioned.&lt;ref name="diligence"/&gt; "I have written a fictitious biography on Blueberry, accompanied by photographs found in American archives, and the whole world went for it!", declared a baffled Charlier previously,&lt;ref name="coll22"/&gt; having already stated on an even earlier occasion, "To this very day, because of "Ballade pour un cercueil" in which we gave Blueberry with a photographs illuminated biography, I still receive letters from readers &amp;ndash; not from kids mind you, but from grownups &amp;ndash; asking how on Earth we have managed to track down the real Blueberry. There are people who take it for real fact."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berner|Berner, 2003, p. 26]] (quoted from the April 1978 ''Schtroumpf: Les Cahiers De La Bd'' magazine interview)&lt;/ref&gt; The photos were indeed authentic, though their captions were not. To complete the appearance of a bonafide in-universe biography, a Civil War-era style group portrait, featuring Blueberry and flanked by the by Charlier mentioned comic artists, was included, ostentatiously recently discovered and from the hand of American artist Peter Glay, but in reality created by Pierre Tabary under the pseudonym. Tabary, brother of Jean, was a French book illustrator of some renown himself, also working for ''Pilote'' as illustrator for their magazine editorials at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pabd.free.fr/BLUEBERY/BLUEBERY.HTM Placard ŕ B.D&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ratier240"/&gt; Incidentally, a salient detail was that events, as related in the biography, in Blueberry's life directly upon war's end, but before he arrived in the Far West, eventually became those of ''Jim Cutlass'', the other Giraud/Charlier western.

J.M. Lofficier has translated the biography in English, specifically for inclusion in the Graphitti Designs anthology collection (it was not featured in the Epic editions), published in the fourth volume of the collection, ''Moebius #4''. Lofficier however, took it upon himself to slightly edit Charlier's original text in order to reflect Blueberry's life as featured in the post-1974 publications (despite being reprinted numerous times, not only in French but in other languages as well,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/3055_Blueberry_15_Ballade_voor_een_doodskist/showall stripINFO.be]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlier himself has never revisited his original text again), and as such it is not an entirely faithful translation as some elements were added, whereas some others were omitted, such as the aforementioned notion of Blueberry ultimately heading a unit of Apache scouts.

==Legacy==

===Awards===
The series has received (world) wide recognition in the comics community, and the chief factor for Giraud receiving his first recorded international award in 1972. Listed are only those rewards, the author(s) received specifically for ''Blueberry'', as Giraud in particular received an additional multitude of awards and nominations for his work as "Mœbius" from 1977 onward, including awards encompassing his entire body of works.

* 2000: {{flagicon|Norway}}[[Sproing Award]] for ''Blueberry'': "Geronimo" in the category "Best Translated Strips", Giraud only.
While Giraud has garnered universal praise and acclaim for his work as "Moebius", ''Blueberry'' has always remained his most successful and most recognized work in mainland Europe, despite its artist developing somewhat of a love/hate relationship with his co-creation in later life, which was exemplified by him regularly taking an extended leave of absence from his co-creation. That ''Blueberry'' has always remained his primary source of income, allowing him to fully indulge in his artistic endeavors as Moebius, was admitted as such by Giraud as early as 1979, "If a album of Moebius is released, about 10.000 people are interested. A ''Blueberry'' album sells at least 100.000 copies [in France],"&lt;ref&gt;Frederiks, Hans. "Een gespleten tekenaar...", ''Stripschrift'', issue 135/136, Zeist: Vonk, June 1980, pp. 33-34 {{nl icon}}; Giraud made this remark shortly before the spectacular upsurge in popularity of ''Blueberry'', additionally having stated that he only re-embarked on ''Blueberry'' because he needed the money to buy a house in Paris. In later life, Giraud has watered down the prosaic statement, claiming he only made this comment because he tired of having to explain himself over and over again at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt; and as late as 2005, "''Blueberry'' is in some ways the "sponsor" of Moebius, for years now."&lt;ref&gt;Pasamonik, Didier (16 March 2005).

===Exhibitions===
After Giraud had returned to France pursuant his extended stay in the United States, generic interest in his work steadily grew and resulted in an increasing number of latter-day exhibitions at museums and conventions, featuring his original art. However, due to his international renown as "Mœbius", virtually all of [[Jean Giraud#Exhibitions|these exhibitions]] focused on his work as such, even if ''Blueberry'' art was included in some of them. Nonetheless, at least three such exhibitions were known to have been Western/''Blueberry'' specific.
* {{flagicon|France}}December 1995: «Wanted: Blueberry» exposition at the Arthaud Grenette bookstore, [[Grenoble]], also featuring original ''Blueberry'' art by Colin Wilson. Both he and Jean Giraud attended the opening on 1 December, making themselves also available for book signings. Prior to the opening a promotional leaflet was disseminated by the bookstore ("Arthaud ''BD News''", issue 1, November 1995), featuring a three-page interview with Giraud.&lt;ref name="arthaud"/&gt;
* {{flagicon|France}}19 September-9 October 1996: «Jean Giraud Blueberry» exposition at the Stardom Gallery, Paris, for the occasion of the upcoming release of the "Blueberry's" artbook by Stardom&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Blueberry-HS-Blueberry-s-6818.html "Blueberry's"] (76 pages, Paris:Stardom, March 1997, {{ISBN|2908706024}}), Bedetheque.com {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Giraud's own publishing house/art gallery. The below-mentioned 1997 documentary was the registration of events surrounding the release, including the exhibition.
* {{flagicon|Belgium}}15 January-14 June 2009: «Blueberry» exposition at the Maison de la Bande Dessinée, [[Bruxelles]]&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/90760_Blueberry_SP6_Catalogue_de_lexposition_Blueberry Catalogue de l'exposition Blueberry]", stripINFO.be {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations===
A 2004 film adaptation, ''[[Blueberry (film)|Blueberry]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276830/ IMDB.com Movie (Renegade)]&lt;/ref&gt;([[United States|U.S.]] release title is ''Renegade''), was directed by [[Jan Kounen]] and starred [[Vincent Cassel]] in the lead role, with Giraud himself making a walk-on [[cameo appearance]] in the movie. Many purists were appalled by this film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.fnac.com/a1573159/Blueberry-Edition-Collector-Vincent-Cassel-DVD-Zone-2?PID=3 Blueberry - Edition Collector], [[Fnac]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pettigrew's 2000 documentary is modeled after the template set in this documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|NTWG9rNr0XA|BLUEBERRY'S - JEAN "Moebius" GIRAUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** French SECAM tape release in 1997, included as bonus for the boxed, limited edition of the artbook "Blueberry's" ({{ISBN|2908706024}})
* 2000:{{flagicon|France}}''Mister Gir &amp; Mike S. Blueberry'' –  Documentary by [[Damian Pettigrew]], registering two days in the life of Giraud in October 1999, when he visits his atelier with his family, the offices of Paris publisher Dargaud and the Parisian mega-[[chain store]] [[:fr:Fnac]] for the launch of the ''Blueberry'' album, "Géronimo l'Apache", and when he travels to [[Saint Malo]] for its 1999 comic-book festival, on both occasions executing numerous sketches and watercolors for fans. Throughout the registrations, Giraud comments on his co-creation, and is intercut with additional remarks from Thierry Smolderen, Guy Vidal and Cristian Rossi, commenting on the place of ''Blueberry'' in the Franco-Belgian comic world and in (French) culture in general. In the film's last sequence, Giraud does a spontaneous life-size portrait in real time of Geronimo on a large sheet of glass (Musée de la Bande dessinée d'Angoulême, 55 min.)
** French SECAM tape release in 2000 ({{OCLC|812528584}})
** French 1-disc DVD release in 2011 ({{OCLC|887535650}}), as an augment to Pettigrew's 2010 ''[[Métamœbius]]'' documentary.

In his review of the album, [[Allmusic]]'s Johnny Loftus wrote "The song is likely a coded reference to those obsessed-over [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|joker cards]].

'''Dating game shows''' are [[Game show|television game show]]s that incorporate a [[Dating#Matchmaking systems and services|dating system]] in the form of a game with clear rules. Human [[matchmaking]] is involved only in selecting the game's contestants, who are usually selected more for the amusement value than any concern for their happiness or compatibility. The audience sees only the game; an important feature of all dating game shows is that the contestants have little or no previous knowledge of each other, and are exposed to each other only through the game, which may include viewing a photograph or at least knowing the basic criteria for [[Sawed-off shotgun|saw]] participation (typically participants are not already married).

There have been a number of dating shows aired on television over the years, using a variety of formats and rules. They are presented for the entertainment of the viewers. As the genre progressed, the format developed towards a reality-style show and more into a relationship show then simply finding a mate.

==History==
The dating game show subgenre has its origins in the [[United States]]. The original dating game shows were introduced by [[television producer]] [[Chuck Barris]]. The format of Barris's first dating show, ''[[The Dating Game]]'', which commenced in 1965, put an unmarried man behind a screen to ask questions of three women who are potential mates, or one woman who asked questions of three men. The person behind the screen could hear their answers and voices but not see them during the gameplay, although the audience could see the contestants. The various suitors were able to describe their rivals in uncomplimentary ways, which made the show work well as a general devolution of dignity. Questions were often obviously rigged to get ridiculous responses, or be obvious allusions to features of the participants' private areas.

''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', by contrast, another Barris show, had recently married couples competing to answer questions about each other's preferences. The couple who knew each other the best would win the game; sometimes others got divorced. Once, someone divorced after appearing on ''The Newlywed Game'' got a "second chance" on ''The Dating Game''. Gimmicks were the lifeblood of all such shows, which drew criticisms for instigating disaffection that could not have been effected.

The genre waned for a while but it was later revived by ''The New Dating Game'' and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] version ''[[Blind Date (UK TV series)|Blind Date]]'', and the original shows were popular in [[rerun]]s, unusual for any game show. [[Cable television]] revived some interest in these shows during the 1980s and 1990s, and eventually new shows began to be made along the old concepts. Variations featuring [[LGBT]] contestants began to appear on a few specialty channels.

Other shows focused on the conventional [[wikt:blind date|blind date]], where two people were set up and then captured on video, sometimes with comments or subtitles that made fun of their dating behaviour. ''[[He Said, She Said (game show)|He Said, She Said]]'' focused not on setting up the date, but on comparing the couple's different impressions afterwards, and for their cooperation offering to fund a second date. These resembled the reality shows that began to emerge at about the same time in the 1990s.

A completely new type of dating show merged the format with the [[reality game show]] and produced shows where the emphasis was on realistic actions and tensions, but which used less realistic scenarios than the traditional blind date:
* ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'', where long-standing heterosexual couples were deliberately separated and made to watch each other's mates interacting romantically on and after dates, making extensive use of video which is the only means by which they could communicate on the island.
* ''[[The Fifth Wheel]]'', in which four people, two of one sex and two of another, are allowed to meet and bond to an extent, before a "fifth wheel," a person of one of either gender, but always a heterosexual, enters and attempts to break up the equilibrium.
* ''[[Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?]]'', which actually set up a real marriage, and put women in the situation of vying to marry a millionaire bachelor. The show turned into a major embarrassment for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which aired the series. Soon after the couple married, the husband was found to have a domestic violence record. Female contestant [[Darva Conger]] quickly had the marriage annulled. Charges of [[economic materialism]] and the reinforcing of the [[trophy wife]] stereotype were also levelled against the program.
* ''[[Joe Millionaire]]'', which did likewise, with the twist that the bachelor was reputed to be a millionaire, but was in fact a [[blue collar]] worker, although the cash prize offered by surprise at the end eventually made the deceptive scenario a bit less abusive.
* ''[[The Bachelor (U.S. TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', which commenced in 2002, where a single man got a chance to choose from a pool of 25 women, with eliminations over a period of several weeks; and ''[[The Bachelorette]]'', which reversed the gender roles from ''The Bachelor'', which commenced in 2008. In the first two seasons of ''The Bachelorette'', the last woman eliminated from the dating pool in the previous season of ''The Bachelor'' was given the opportunity to "turn the tables".
* ''[[Baggage (U.S. game show)|Baggage]]'', where contestants increasingly reveal their biggest secrets in the hopes of winning a date; the contestant picks the person they want to go on a date with and then that contestant reveals their one piece of baggage and the competitor decides if they want to date the contestant.

==Commonalities==
Some common threads run through these shows. When participants are removed, it is usually done one at a time to drag out the action and get audience sympathy for specific players. In shows involving couples, there is a substantial incentive to break up any of the existing relationships. In shows involving [[single person|singles]], there is a mismatch of numbers ensuring constant competition. This creates the action, tension and humiliation when someone is rejected. There are also reports of [[mercenary]] practice, that is, members of one sex paid to participate in the game to attain balance of sex ratio.

==Series involving gay and bisexual contestants==
The first gay version of these more realistic shows to receive mainstream attention was ''[[Boy Meets Boy (TV)|Boy Meets Boy]]'', with a format similar to that of ''The Bachelor'' and ''The Bachelorette''. The show featured an unusual plot twist: eight of the men from the show's original dating pool were actually heterosexual men pretending to be homosexual; one important part of the plot was whether the gay contestant would be able to recognize the heterosexual men.

Some gay and straight romances have been sparked on the other [[reality game show]]s, suggesting that they too may really be "dating shows" in disguise. But any social situation has the potential to result in romance, especially work. The first dating show to regularly incorporate bisexual contestants was [[MTV]] series ''[[A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila]]'', which included both male and female contestants vying for the affections of the show's star, internet star [[Tila Tequila]], who is [[bisexuality|bisexual]].

The British series [[Naked Attraction]] has, since its inception in 2016, included gay/lesbian and bisexual contestants, with some players picking from groups of the same gender as themselves, and some bisexual participants choosing from mixed groups. From the second series, the show would occasionally include potential dates who were in the process of transitioning.

==Modern US innovations==
By the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new wave of dating shows began airing in U.S. syndication that were more sexually suggestive than their earlier counterparts, including shows such as ''[[Blind Date (U.S. TV series)|Blind Date]]'', ''[[Elimidate]]'' and ''[[The 5th Wheel]]'', which often pushed boundaries of sexual content allowed on broadcast television. As the 2000s progressed, the ratings for many of these shows began to decline, a situation exacerbated by the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]] in 2004 as production companies out of fear of being imposed with monetary penalties by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for indecent content began self-censoring their dating shows (and many syndicated programs targeted at the 18-49 demographic, in general) to levels in which even profanities typically permissible on television were edited out of episodes.

Since then, the dating game show has virtually died off from television syndication, though cable television networks such as [[VH1]] have continued to air dating shows with content similar to that of the syndicated dating shows of the late 1990s and early 2000s and major over-the-air broadcast networks have tried, often with marginal success, to use dating shows that are less risque compared to those shows. Attempts to revive the dating show in syndication first came in 2011, when ''[[Excused]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Date a Comedian?]]'' both debuted; this was followed in 2012 by [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]'s sale of reruns of the [[Game Show Network]] series ''[[Baggage (TV series)|Baggage]]'' into syndication. All three shows were dropped in September 2013, removing the genre from broadcast syndication for a time. In July 2014, VH1 aired ''[[Dating Naked]]'', modeled on Dutch show ''[[Adam Zkt. Eva]]'', which matches up heterosexual contestants who are nude most of the time.

A sobering caveat of the power of television and romance in combination came when a popular dating variant of the talk show, inviting [[secret admirer]]s to meet on the stage, backfired on ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]''. The admirer was a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] friend of a [[heterosexual]] man who was so outraged after the taping that he later murdered the admirer.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/15/us/national-news-briefs-25-to-50-year-sentence-in-talk-show-slaying.html |title=National News Briefs; 25- to 50-Year Sentence in Talk Show Slaying |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 15, 1999 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secret admirer variant of the talk show has remained popular, it continued be used on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', but with less emotionally loaded surprises, and much more careful checking of the guests' backgrounds and attitudes; occasional episodes of ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'' combine this format, though not always in a direct manner, with reveals of high school classmates who were considered to be unattractive as teenagers reuniting with their former school friends or tormentors as adults, after changing their image to become more physically attractive.

==Criticism==
Like other games, the outcomes of these activities are open to rigging, leading to missed matches and possibly unhappiness among the participants. These programs have also been criticised for complicating [[courtship]] with needless [[observer-expectancy effect|public expectation]]. In spite of this, some programs have produced episodes that portray follow-ups of unions forged therein, possibly with offspring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14369">{{Distinguish|docufiction}}

A '''docudrama''' (or '''documentary drama''') is a [[genre]] of [[Radio programming|radio]] and [[television program]]ming, [[feature film]], and staged theatre, which features [[Drama (film and television)|dramatized]] [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s of actual events. On stage, it is sometimes known as [[documentary theatre]].

In the core elements of its story a docudrama strives to adhere to known historical facts, while allowing a greater or lesser degree of [[Artistic license|dramatic license]] in peripheral details, and where there are gaps in the historical record. [[Dialogue]] may include the actual words of [[Reality|real-life]] persons, as recorded in [[historical document]]s. Docudrama producers sometimes choose to film their reconstructed events in the actual locations in which the historical events occurred.

A docudrama, in which historical fidelity is the keynote, is generally distinguished from a film merely "[[List of films based on actual events|based on true events]]", a term which implies a greater degree of dramatic license; and from the concept of "[[List of historical drama films|historical drama]]", a broader category which may also encompass largely fictionalized action taking place in historical settings or against the backdrop of historical events.

As a [[portmanteau]], ''docudrama'' is sometimes confused with [[docufiction]]. However, unlike docufiction—which is essentially a [[documentary]] filmed in [[Real time (media)|real time]], incorporating some fictional elements—docudrama is filmed at a time subsequent to the events portrayed.

== Characteristics ==
Docudramas tend to demonstrate some or most of the following characteristics
*Representation of actual historical events
*Based on what actually happened 
*Use of literary and narrative techniques to flesh out the bare facts of an event in history to tell a story
*Some degree of license is often taken with minor historical facts for the sake of enhancing the drama

Docudramas are distinct from historical fiction, in which the historical setting is a mere backdrop for a plot involving fictional characters.

== History ==
The impulse to incorporate historical material into literary texts has been an intermittent feature of literature in the west since its earliest days. [[Aristotle]]'s theory of art is based on the use of putatively historical events and characters. Especially after the development of modern mass-produced literature, there have been genres that relied on history or then-current events for material. English [[Renaissance]] drama, for example, developed subgenres specifically devoted to dramatizing recent murders and notorious cases of witchcraft.

However, docudrama as a separate category belongs to the second half of the twentieth century. After [[World War II]], [[Louis de Rochemont]], creator of ''[[The March of Time]]'', became a producer at [[20th Century Fox]]. There he brought the [[newsreel]] aesthetic to films, producing a series of movies based upon real events using a realistic style that became known as [[semidocumentary]]. The films (''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'', ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'', ''[[13 Rue Madeleine]]'') were widely imitated, and the style soon became used even for completely-fictional stories, such as ''[[The Naked City]]''. Perhaps the most significant of the semidocumentary films was ''[[He Walked by Night]]'', based upon serial killer [[Erwin Walker]]. [[Jack Webb]] had a supporting role in the movie and struck up a friendship with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] consultant, Sergeant Marty Wynn. The film and his relationship with Wynn inspired Webb to create what became one of the most famous docudramas in history: ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.

The influence of [[New Journalism]] tended to create a license for authors to treat with literary techniques material that might in an earlier age have been approached in a purely journalistic way. Both [[Truman Capote]] and [[Norman Mailer]] were influenced by this movement, and Capote's ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' is arguably the most famous example of the genre.

== American television ==
Some docudrama examples for [[American television]] include ''[[Brian's Song]]'' (1971), and ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' (1977). ''Brian's Song'' is the biography of [[Brian Piccolo]], a Chicago Bears football player who died at a young age after battling cancer. ''Roots'' depicts the life of a slave and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=docudrama|title= Docudrama |publisher= The Museums of Broadcast Communications |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dreidel''' ({{lang-yi|דרײדל}} ''dreydl'' plural: ''dreydlekh'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dreydlekh]]'' is also a term in [[klezmer]] music&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|סביבון}} ''sevivon'') is a four-sided [[spinning top]], played with during the [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Hanukkah]]. The dreidel is a Jewish variant on the [[teetotum]], a gambling toy found in many European cultures.

Each side of the dreidel bears a letter of the  Hebrew alphabet:
&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;{{Hebrew|נ}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[Nun (letter)|Nun]]),
&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;{{Hebrew|ג}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]]),
&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;{{Hebrew|ה}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[He (letter)|Hei]]),
&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;{{Hebrew|ש}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[Shin (letter)|Shin]]),
which together form the acronym for "{{Hebrew|'''נ'''ס '''ג'''דול '''ה'''יה '''ש'''ם}}" ('''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''ayah '''Sh'''am&amp;nbsp;– "a great miracle happened '''th'''ere"). These letters were originally a mnemonic for the rules of a gambling game played with a dreidel: Nun stands for the [[Yiddish]] word ''nisht'' ("nothing"), Hei stands for ''halb'' ("half"), Gimel for ''gants'' ("all"), and Shin for ''shtel ayn'' ("put in"). In [[Israel]], the fourth side of most dreidels is inscribed with the letter &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;{{Hebrew|פ}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[Pe (letter)|Pei]]) instead, rendering the acronym, {{Hebrew|'''נ'''ס '''ג'''דול '''ה'''יה '''פ'''ה}}, '''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''ayah '''P'''oh''—"A great miracle happened '''h'''ere", referring to the miracle occurring in the Land of Israel.

==Origins==
[[Image:Dreidel 001.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Wooden dreidel]]
According to most scholars, the dreidel developed from an Irish or English top introduced into Germany known as a ''{{lang|la|[[teetotum]]}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kutzik|first1=Jordan|title=Our Favorite Hanukkah Toy Was Actually a Non-Jewish Irish Gambling Game|url=https://forward.com/culture/326379/the-true-history-of-the-dreidel/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215061644/https://forward.com/culture/326379/the-true-history-of-the-dreidel/|archivedate=2017-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabinowitz|first1=Dan|title=Chanukah Customs and sources|url=http://seforim.blogspot.co.uk/2005/12/chanukah-customs-and-sources.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051048/http://seforim.blogspot.co.uk/2005/12/chanukah-customs-and-sources.html|archivedate=2017-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Anat|title=The Weird Ancient History of the Dreidel|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1.631316|accessdate=19 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219045509/https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1.631316|archivedate=19 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golinkin|first1=David|title=The Surprising Origin of the Dreidel |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-origin-of-the-dreidel|work=myjewishlearning.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213084023/https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-origin-of-the-dreidel/|archivedate=2017-12-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfeffer|first1=Rabbi Yehoshua|title=The Chanukah Dreidel and its Halachos|url=http://dinonline.org/2015/12/07/the-chanukah-dreidel-and-its-halachos|website=dinonline.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105226/http://dinonline.org/2015/12/07/the-chanukah-dreidel-and-its-halachos/|archivedate=2017-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was popular around Christmastime&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and dates back to ancient Greek and Roman times.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The teetotum was inscribed with letters denoting the Latin words for “nothing,” “half,” “everything” and “put in.” In German this came to be called a ''{{lang|de|trendel}}'', with German letters for the same concepts. Adapted to the Hebrew alphabet when Jews adopted the game, these letters were replaced by [[Shin (letter)|shin]] (=''{{lang|yi-Latn|shtel arayn}}'', put in); [[Nun (letter)|nun]] (=''{{lang|yi-Latn|nit}}'', not, i.e., nothing); [[gimel]] (=''{{lang|yi-Latn|gants}}'', whole/everything); and [[He (letter)|he]] (=''{{lang|yi-Latn|halb}}'', half). The letters served as a means to recalling the rules of the game.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

This theory states that when the game spread to Jewish communities unfamiliar with Yiddish, the denotations of the Hebrew letters were not understood. As a result, there arose Jewish traditions to explain their assumed meaning. However, in Judaism there are often multiple explanations developed for words.  Some claimed the 4 letters cyphered Babylon, Persia, Greece and the Roman Empire, the four ancient empires that tried to destroy Israel; a [[gematriya]] reading yielded the number 358, identical to the value of the 4 letters used for Moshiach (''[[Messiah]]''). A third popular conjecture had it that the letters abbreviated the words "''{{lang|he-Latn|nes gadol haya sham}}''" (a great miracle happened there), an idea that became attached to dreidels when the game entered into Hanukkah festivities.&lt;ref name="Kutzik"&gt;Jordan Kutzik, [http://forward.com/culture/yiddish-culture/326379/the-true-history-of-the-dreidel/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-3 'The True History of the Dreidel,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060116/http://forward.com/culture/yiddish-culture/326379/the-true-history-of-the-dreidel/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-3 |date=2016-03-04 }}' [[The Forward]] December 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a tradition first documented in 1890,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dreidel Drama|url=http://cdn.yutorah.org/_materials/Source_sheets-513377.pdf|website=yutorah.org|publisher=Yeshiva University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=הירשוביץ|first1=אברהם אליעזר בן איזיק|title=אוצר כל מנהגי ישרון|date=1918|location=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2604&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=95|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=צינר|first1=גבריאל|title=הלכות חנוכה - נטעי גבריאל|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; the game was developed by Jews who illegally studied the [[Torah]] in seclusion as they hid, sometimes in caves, from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] under [[Antiochus IV]]. At the first sign of Seleucids approaching, their [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] would be concealed and be replaced by dreidels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday7.htm | title=Chanukkah | accessdate=27 November 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107165729/http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday7.htm | archivedate=7 January 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/603267/jewish/What-is-a-Dreidel.htm | title=What is a Dreidel? | accessdate=27 November 2015 | author=Benjaminson, Chani | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127212013/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/603267/jewish/What-is-a-Dreidel.htm | archivedate=27 November 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variant names ''{{lang|yi-Latn|goyrl}}'' (destiny) and ''{{lang|yi-Latn|varfl}}'' (a little throw) were also current in Yiddish until [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="Kutzik" /&gt; In the wake of Zionism, the dreidel was renamed  ''{{lang|he-Latn|sevivon}}'' in modern Hebrew, and the letters altered, with ''shin'' generally replaced by [[pe (letter)|pe]]. This yields the reading ''{{lang|he-Latn|nes gadol haya po}}'' (a great miracle happened ''here''.')&lt;ref name="Kutzik" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Yiddish]] word ''{{lang|yi-Latn|dreydl}}'' comes from the word ''{{lang|yi-Latn|dreyen}}'' ("to turn", compare to ''{{lang|de|drehen}}'', meaning the same in German). The [[Hebrew]] word ''{{lang|he-Latn|sevivon}}'' comes from the [[Semitic root]] "[[wikt:סיבוב|SBB]]" ("to turn") and was invented by [[Itamar Ben-Avi]] (the son of [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]) when he was 5 years old. [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]] used a different word, "kirkar" (from the root "KRKR"&amp;nbsp;– "to spin"), in his poems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benyehuda.org/bialik/bia_chds54.html |title=Ben Yehuda organization: Bialik |publisher=Benyehuda.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050522/http://benyehuda.org/bialik/bia_chds54.html |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not adopted into spoken Hebrew.

In the lexicon of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from [[Udmurtia]] and [[Tatarstan]] the local historian A.V. Altyntsev was  fixed several other appellations of a dreidel such as "volchok", "khanuke-volchok", "fargl", "varfl", "dzihe" and "zabavke".&lt;ref&gt;Altyntsev A.V., "The Concept of Love in Ashkenazim of Udmurtia and Tatarstan", Nauka Udmurtii. 2013. № 4 (66), p. 130. (Алтынцев А.В., [http://snioo.ru/images/stories/nu-print/nu4662013.pdf  "Чувство любви в понимании евреев-ашкенази Удмуртии и Татарстана".] Наука Удмуртии. 2013. №4. С. 130: Комментарии.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
Some rabbis ascribe symbolic significance to the markings on the dreidel. One commentary, for example, connects the four letters with the four nations to which the House of Judah was historically subject—[[Babylonia]], [[Persia]], [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yaakov |first=Rabbi |url=http://www.ohr.org.il/yhiy/article.php/1309 |title=Secret of the Dreidel |publisher=Ohr.org.il |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516210032/http://www.ohr.org.il/yhiy/article.php/1309 |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While not mandated (a [[mitzvah]]) for Hanukkah (the only traditional ''{{lang|he-Latn|mitzvot}}'' are lighting candles and saying the full [[hallel]]), spinning the dreidel is a traditional game played during the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/55918/brooklyn-man-wins-dreidel-spinning-contest Brooklyn Man Wins Dreidel Spinning Contest] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523082110/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/55918/brooklyn-man-wins-dreidel-spinning-contest |date=May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules of the game==
Each player begins with an equal number of game pieces (usually 10–15). The game pieces can be any object, such as [[chocolate gelt]], pennies, raisins, etc.
*To start the game, every participant puts one game piece into the center "pot". Every player also puts one piece into the pot at the end of every player's turn.
*Each player spins the dreidel once during their turn. Depending on which side is facing up when it stops spinning, the player whose turn it is gives or takes game pieces from the pot:
**If {{Hebrew|נ}} (''nun'') is facing up, the player does nothing.
**If {{Hebrew|ג}} (''gimel'') is facing up, the player gets everything in the pot.
**If {{Hebrew|ה}} (''hei'') is facing up, the player gets half of the pieces in the pot. If there are an odd number of pieces in the pot, the player takes the half the pot rounded up to the nearest whole number.
**If {{Hebrew|ש}} (''shin'') or {{Hebrew|פ}} (''pe'') is facing up, the player adds one of their game pieces to the pot (sometimes accompanied by the chant "Shin, Shin, put one in"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LeBon|first=Marilee|title=The complete idiot's guide to holiday crafts|year=2001|pages=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qPlFK_yGckC&amp;q=%22shin+put+one+in%22+dreidel&amp;dq=%22shin+put+one+in%22+dreidel|isbn=9780028642000}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In some game versions a Shin results in adding three game pieces to the pot (one for each stem of the Shin).
*If the player is out of pieces, they are either "out" or may ask another player for a "loan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Dreidel/How_To_Play.shtml |title=How to Play |publisher=Myjewishlearning.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209035018/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Dreidel/How_To_Play.shtml |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rules are comparable to the rules for a classic four-sided [[teetotum]], where the letters A, D, N and T form a [[mnemonic]] for the rules of the game, ''{{lang|la|aufer}}'' (take), ''{{lang|la|depone}}'' (put), ''{{lang|la|nihil}}'' (nothing), and ''{{lang|la|totum}}'' (all).  Similarly, the Hebrew letters on a dreidel may be taken as a mnemonic for the game rules in Yiddish. Occasionally, in the United States, the Hebrew letters on the dreidel form an English-language mnemonic about the rules: Hay or "H" for "half;" Gimel or "G" for "get all;" Nun or "N" for "nothing;" and Shin or "S" for "share".

Thomas Robinson and Sujith Vijay have shown that the expected number of spins in a game of dreidel is '''O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''', where n is the number of game pieces each player begins with. The implied constant depends on the number of players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson|first1=Thomas|last2=Vijay|first2=Sujith|title=Dreidel Lasts O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) spins|doi=10.1016/j.aam.2005.05.004|volume=36|journal=Advances in Applied Mathematics|pages=85–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Childhood enjoyment of dreidels has led to interest in collecting them in adulthood.&lt;ref name="forward1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/133206/ |title=Oh Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel: A favorite holiday pastime takes center table |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606012655/http://www.forward.com/articles/133206/ |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish institutions such as the [[Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership]], Yeshiva University Museum and [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanu-El]] in New York, house dreidel collections, as do museums such as the Spinning Top and Yo-Yo Museum in Burlington, Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="forward1"/&gt;

==Tournaments==
Dreidel is now a spoof competitive sport in North America. Major League Dreidel (MLD), founded in New York City in 2007, hosts dreidel tournaments during the holiday of Hanukkah. In MLD tournaments the player with the longest time of spin (TOS) is the winner. MLD is played on a Spinagogue, the official spinning stadium of Major League Dreidel. Pamskee was the 2007 MLD Champion. Virtual Dreidel was the 2008 MLD Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98610612 |title=No Gelt, No Glory: A Dreidel Champion Is Crowned |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106215518/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98610612 |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Major League Dreidel launched a game version of the Spinagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moderntribe.com/judaica/hanukkah/spinagogue/spinagogue |title=Spinagogue |publisher=Moderntribe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301170656/http://www.moderntribe.com/judaica/hanukkah/spinagogue/spinagogue |archivedate=2010-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Duoyi Network was founded by Xu Youzhen, one of China's most well-known game designers since the early 2000s. Before founding Duoyi Network, Xu was the main designer of Fantasy Westward Journey and responsible for the architecture of the core gameplay. He led the development of Dream World and Shenwu as the founder and president of Duoyi Network.

On September 24, 2007, Duoyi released its first PC title Dream World, a 2D turn-based MMORPG. In 2008, Duoyi received the Gold Finger Award from the China Cultural Industry Association for the creation of Dream World&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://game.people.com.cn/GB/48647/139736/141365/8540473.html|title=2008年度中国游戏行业金手指奖--人民网游戏_最权威中文游戏网站--人民网|first=|last=1477|website=game.people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2010, Duoyi released Dream Emperor, a strategy mini-client game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.qq.com/a/20100611/000183.htm|title=客户端网页游戏《梦想帝王》震撼公测_游戏_腾讯网|website=games.qq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Shenwu, a turn-based MMORPG based on the story line of [[Journey to the West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw3.duoyi.com/news/1/lZUxrf.html|title=《神武》快乐公测，超级盛典礼不断：《神武》官网-2010年最新免费网络游戏 回合制网游 绿色免费|website=sw3.duoyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2011, Duoyi launched Tank Force!, an action mobile game that hit no.1 on the App Store Download Chart. In 2012, Duoyi ranked the 40th of “China’s Top 100 Internet Companies” jointly released by Internet Society of China and MIIT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://r.dsnlinks.com/1126/|title=2012 - 中国互联网百强 - 榜上有名|date=13 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Duoyi released Shenwu Mobile, which hit the first on App Store Grossing Chart in China and 9th globally&lt;ref name="yesky.com"/&gt;. Shenwu Mobile remained a top 10 grossing app for over 80 consecutive weeks. Shenwu 2, a major expansion set for both Shenwu PC and Shenwu Mobile, was released on July 3, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw3.duoyi.com/news/1/oMxyFY.html|title=《神武2》今日公测开启 全新内容快乐启航：《神武2》官网-快乐免费回合制网游-2017好玩的网络游戏 绿色免费-多益网络|website=sw3.duoyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11009">A '''background actor''' or  '''extra''' is a [[performer]] in a [[film]], [[television show]], stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging (silent) capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). [[War film]]s and [[epic film]]s often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members (hence the term "cast of thousands"). Likewise, [[grand opera]] can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.

On a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as "atmosphere", "background talent", "background performers", "background artists", "background cast members" or simply "background", while the term "extra" is rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tophollywoodactingcoach.com/2012/01/background_actors_extra_atmosphere/ Background Actors, Extras or Atmosphere?] ''tophollywoodactingcoach'' Published by Ross, Mae; 3-2-1 Acting. Accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as "[[supernumeraries]]". In opera and ballet, they are called either "extras" or "supers".

==Casting==
Casting criteria for background actors depend on the production. It is not entirely true that background cast members require little or no [[acting]] experience, as any type of unrealistic portrayal must include some form of imagination and acting. Punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction also figure prominently for these cast members. Background actors are often selected on short notice, after all other preparations for the shoot have been finalized.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftbWjFvRMZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=extra+actor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Rs_Upa2IoTtigK2mYHYBQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=extra%20actor&amp;f=false|title=The Truth About Being an Extra: How to Become a Good Background Actor|author=Jo Kelly|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several casting agencies specialize only in background work, whilst in the UK the directory ''Contacts'' published annually by [[Spotlight (Casting Services Company)|Spotlight]] lists all accredited agencies and productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/faqs/about/extra|title=How to be an Extra|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMagpie" /&gt; Some agencies charge a registration fee, and some (mostly commercial background casting) will take between 10% and 15% commission from any booked work. Artists may be required to provide a basic one-page A4 sized CV/resume, that states basic personal details and dimensions, any significant skills (e.g. [[stage combat]]), and includes two 8x10 inch photographs on the rear: one head shot; one full body shot.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MMagpie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10557/How-movie-extra.html|title=How to be a movie extra|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek those with a specific "look", such as "high school students" or "affluent senior citizens", consistent with the context of the film. Casting directors may also look for background actors with a special skill for the scene, such as [[rollerblading]], or dancing. A background actor is often expected to bring his or her own wardrobe to the set, although there are also "fittings" for a specific scene or period. A casting director may favor the one who already has the required costume or prop, such as a police uniform, or a musical instrument. On other occasions, where a costume has already been prepared (for example, to fit another actor who is now unavailable), a background actor may be selected as a "costume double" simply because they are the right size to fit it. On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired ''en masse'' with little formality.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

The length of a background actor's employment on a production largely depends on the needs of the director and the scenes being filmed. Some background actors are needed on the set only for a day or two, while others may remain with the film for an extended period. For instance, on [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', a group of 150 "core background actors" was hired to play the ship's passengers, and employed throughout the filming.

==Salary and working conditions==
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2010}}

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the distinction between an actor and an extra is defined by agreements between the actors [[trade union]]s [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union|Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU)]] and [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], and the various commercial trade and production bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bectu.org.uk/get-involved/background-artistes |title=Background Artistes |publisher=BECTU |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These state that once a performer says 13 or more words in any scene, they must become a contracted actor in that production.&lt;ref name="EquityRA" /&gt; Minimum pay rates are defined by UK Government minimum wage regulations, and both BECTU and Equity have agreed rates with each body. However, even on non-union productions an extra's pay is an agreed day-rate for ten hours of production time.&lt;ref name=MMagpie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/make-money-being-a-film-or-tv-extra|title=Make money being a film or TV extra|publisher=Money Magpie|accessdate=1 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730221918/http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/make-money-being-a-film-or-tv-extra|archivedate=30 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All performers under agreement with BECTU/Equity are paid on-going royalties. Hence on many advertisements, which are often shown multiple times and distributed internationally, whilst the extra is paid a contracted day-rate, the largest payment is nominally due from ongoing royalties. Due to the resultant complex calculations from multiple international showings, performers under a union managed agreement are often bought-out of their advertisement royalties with a one-off payment.&lt;ref name="EquityRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equity.org.uk/resource-centre/rates-and-agreements/|title=Rates and Agreements - Members Guide &amp; Pamphlet|publisher=[[Equity (trade union)|Equity]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most major film and television productions used to fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) or [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|AFTRA]].  The two unions have merged into [[SAG-AFTRA]].

SAG-signatory [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|producers]] are allowed to hire non-union background actors after a certain number of SAG performers have been cast; non-union background actors are usually paid the minimum wage. On productions outside of union jurisdiction, payment for background actors is at the discretion of the producers, and ranges from [[Trade Union|union]]-scale rates to "copy and credit" (i.e., no pay). Those producers who do not pay their actors may be in violation of state and federal laws about minimum wage for a job.

Between 1946 and 1992, background actors in film and television were largely represented by the '''Screen Extras Guild.''' SEG was disbanded on 1 June 1992 and transferred its jurisdiction to SAG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1153/is_n8_v115/ai_12624085 Television and movie agreement - collective bargaining agreement; Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers], Monthly Labor Review, August 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The silent film ''[[The Extra Girl]]'' (1923) portrays a small-town girl who comes to [[Hollywood]] and becomes a background actor in her attempt to achieve stardom.

The British television sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' (2005–07) follows the exploits of two professional background actors, Andy and Maggie. They spend most of their time on set looking for a speaking role and a boyfriend, respectively.

In the Hindi [[black comedy]] film ''[[Mithya]]'' (2008), the protagonist is a background actor whose facial similarity to an underworld [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] lands him in trouble.

The Filipino [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[Ekstra]]'' (''The Bit Player'') (2013) centers around the life of a divorcee named Loida Malabanan, whose [[temporary work|odd job]] as a bit player for various acting roles enabled her to send her daughter to college.&lt;ref name=ekstravariety&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/global/the-bit-player-review-toronto-1200607975/|title=Toronto Film Review: ‘The Bit Player’|last=Kuipers|first=Richard|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is a [[social commentary]] on the exploitation and mistreatment of the [[marginalized]] sector in the [[television production]] industry in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ekstra blog"&gt;{{cite blog|url=https://said-fred.blogspot.com/2013/07/ekstra-excellent-paradox.html|title=EKSTRA: An Excellent Paradox|last=Hawson|first=Fred|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekstraINQ&gt;{{cite news|url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/59179/ekstra-the-country-in-miniature|title='Ekstra': The country in miniature|last=Jimenez-David|first=Rina|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=August 19, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekstrarev&gt;{{cite blog|url=https://ilusyonaryo.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/a-review-paper-for-ekstra-2013-a-film-by-jeffrey-jeturian/|title=A review paper for Ekstra (2013): A film by Jeffrey Jeturian|&lt;!--author=migibytes--&gt;|website=ilusyonaryo.com|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese-Hong Kong film ''[[I Am Somebody]]'' (2015) is about extras working at the [[Hengdian World Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/i-am-somebody-review-derek-yee-shanghai-film-festival-1201519295/|title= Film Review: 'I Am Somebody' |first=Maggie |last=Lee |date=17 June 2015 |accessdate=10 October 2015 |work=[[variety.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film preservation''', or '''film restoration''', describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, [[cinematheque]]s, and [[non-profit organization]]s to rescue decaying [[film stock]] and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeck|first=Joanne L.|title=Our Movie Heritage|year=1997|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0813524318|author2=Tom McGreevey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the term "preservation" was synonymous with "duplication" of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of [[image quality|quality]]. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|year=2004|publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation|location=[[San Francisco]]|isbn=0974709905|url=http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film preservation is not to be confused with film [[Revisionism (fictional)|revisionism]], in which long-completed films are subjected to [[outtake]]s never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being [[Film colorization|colorized]] or converted to [[Dolby]] stereo, or minor [[film editing|edits]] and other cosmetic changes being made.

By the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] an ongoing problem, but the discovery that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]", and color film manufactured, in particular, by [[Eastman Kodak]], was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.

90 percent of all American [[silent films]] made before 1929 and 50 percent of American [[sound film]]s made before 1950 are [[lost films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]|title=Film Riches, Cleaned Up for Posterity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/movies/15restore.html|quote=It’s bad enough, to cite a common estimate, that 90 percent of all American silent films and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 appear to have vanished forever.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Houston, P. (1994). Keepers of the frame: the film archives. British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized "moving images" as an integral part of the world's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13139&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO, Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images] at UNESCO.org, 27 October 1980.

==Film decay==
{{see also|Lost film}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nitratedecomp.png|thumb|320px|An extreme example of nitrate decomposition.]] --&gt;
The great majority of films made in the [[silent film|silent]] era are now considered [[lost films|lost]] forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[film base]], which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, "Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Martin|title=Robert A. Harris Presentation on Film Preservation|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/rah.htm|publisher=American WideScreen Museum|date=February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silent film]]s had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now rare silent films has been a high priority amongst [[History of film|film historians]].

Because of the fragility of [[film stock]], proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.

The problem of film decay is not limited to films made on [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced [[Technicolor]]) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original [[film production]]s or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. [[Cellulose acetate film]], which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from "[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|vinegar syndrome]]". The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit color fading, actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause color fading.{{dubious | August 2018 |reason=Vinegar syndrome article says the opposite.|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Film decay as an art form===
In 2002, filmmaker [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]] produced ''[[Decasia]]'', a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was paired together with a soundtrack composed by [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]], and performed by his orchestra.  The footage used was from old newsreel &amp; archive film, and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the [http://www.sc.edu/library/newsfilm/ Fox Movietone Newsfilm Archives] at the [[University of South Carolina]], and the archives of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Preservation through careful storage==
[[File:PackardHumanities Institute, Santa Clarita.jpg|thumb|right|[[Packard Humanities Institute]], Santa Clarita, [[Nitrate film]] Film Vault]]
The "preservation" of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from "restoration", as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.

Film is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures.&lt;ref name="McGreevey, Tom 1997"/&gt; For most film materials, the [[Image Permanence Institute]] finds that storing film media in frozen temperatures, with RH between 30% and 50%, greatly extends its useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums|last=|first=|publisher=The National Film Preservation Foundation|year=2004|isbn=0974709905|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and is a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.

==Preparing a film for preservation and restoration==

In most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the [[original camera negative]] or the ''composite restoration negative'' which is often made from a combination of elements for general screening.

The composite restoration negative is a compilation of duplicated sections of the best remaining material, recombined to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle, while the [[original camera negative]] is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.

In traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a [[fine grain master positive]].

Preservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.

==Film as archival medium==

Film preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |title=twitchfilm.com. Jason Gorber's Cineruminations: 70mm, 4K, and THE MASTER's Split Personality Jason Gorber |access-date=2014-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217215841/http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |archive-date=2014-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65mm.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2012/November-1-2012/Sound-Picture-Restoration.aspx postmagazine.com, Issue: November 1, 2012, Sound &amp; Picture Restoration, By: Christine Bunish]&lt;/ref&gt; 70mm IMAX has a resolution of 18K, which is the upper necessary limit for film capture in full resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Image resolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.

==Digital as archival medium==

Digital scanners {{as of|2014|lc=y}} can capture images as large as 65mm in full resolution.&lt;ref name="postmagazine.com"/&gt; That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film {{as of|2012|lc=y}} ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.

==Digital film preservation==

In the context of film preservation the term "[[digital preservation]]" highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8mm to 70mm in size to digital [[digital media|carriers]], as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to [[Digitizing|digitized]] or [[Born-digital|digitally born]] film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of [[digital curation]] practices. Extensive technical literature on the subject can be found at the online library of the Presto Centre Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prestocentre.org/ Presto Centre Project web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of [[George Eastman House]] Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Usai, Paolo Cherchi (2001) "The death of cinema: history, cultural memory and the digital dark age" British Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the senior curator of [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediation]] of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, Giovanna (2009) "From grain to pixel: the archival life of film in transition." Amsterdam University Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Enticknap, Leo (2012). "Dossier: Materiality and the Archive." The Velvet Light Trap, (70), 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.

==Advancements==
In 1935, New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] and Edison companies, and the world's largest collection of [[D. W. Griffith]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA.org {{!}} The Collection {{!}} Film and Media |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |work=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207232551/http://www.moma.org/collection/depts/film_media/ |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Henri Langlois]] founded the [[Cinémathèque Française]] in Paris, which would become the world's largest international film collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |title=Passion Cinéma |access-date=2006-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627162200/http://www.cinematheque.fr/data/document/expositionpermanente.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of early silent films stored in the [[Library of Congress]], mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on [[paper print|rolls of paper]] submitted as copyright registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/earlymps.html#pape |title=Early Motion Pictures Free of Copyright Restrictions in the Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |date=31 August 2010|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, an [[optical printer]] was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films "showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/about-this-program Library of Congress-LOC Film preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film]] was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |title=Museum History · George Eastman House |publisher=Eastmanhouse.org |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006120017/http://eastmanhouse.org/inc/the_museum/history.php |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Film Institute|url=http://www.afi.com/about/history.aspx|title=History of AFI|publisher=Afi.com|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.

In 1978, [[Dawson City]], [[Yukon Territory]], Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;Kula, S. (1979). Rescued from the Permafrost: The Dawson Collection of Motion Pictures. ''Archivaria,'' No. 8, Summer 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States' [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. (1990, Sept. 3). Expanding Archives: Library of Congress Is Not Just Books. ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Library and Archives Canada]] for transfer to safety stock and archiving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/about-us/preservation/Pages/preservation.aspx The Library and Archives Canada Preservation Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; However, to move such highly flammable material such a distance ultimately required assistance from the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] to make the delivery to [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Bill|title=Dawson City: Frozen Time|date=2016|publisher=KinoLorber|page=1:53:45|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this discovery as well as excerpts of these films can be seen in the 2016 [[documentary film]], ''[[Dawson City: Frozen Time]]''.

Another high-profile restoration by staff at the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[National Film and Television Archive]] is the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection, which consists almost entirely of [[actuality film]]s commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in [[Blackburn]] in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections/about-bfi-national-archive About the BFI National Archive] at British Film Institute official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James Katz]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', and several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films), Michael Thau (''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''), and [[Kevin Brownlow]] (''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' and ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoleon]]'').  Other organizations, such as the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA's work includes such projects as ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' and select [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]/[[Famous Studios]] and [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.

==Studio efforts==
In 1926 [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] asked for [[film studio]]s to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an [[Eastman Kodak]] process, so that "schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Alva| authorlink = Alva Johnston|title=Films Put on Ice for Fans yet Unborn|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 October 1926|quote=Will Hays has sent a call to the motion-picture companies to search their vaults for ancient films of all kinds and for news reels of possible historic interest. The most important of these are to be treated by a process developed in the Eastman laboratories for making films immortal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be ''all'' of them.  In 1986, when [[Ted Turner]] acquired MGM's library (which by then had included [[Warner Bros.]]' pre-1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard| authorlink = Richard Schickel|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story|year=2008|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=076243418X|author2=Perry, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Warner Bros. retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948, in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM's pre-May 1986, and a majority of the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. [[Time Warner]], the current owner of [[Turner Entertainment]], continues this work today.

The cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  His film, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' included a key scene in which many of film pioneer [[Georges Méliès]]' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as "a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd| authorlink =Todd McCarthy|title=Hugo: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hugo/review/263209|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create [[The Film Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors—[[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. In 2006, [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[Alexander Payne]] were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the [[Directors Guild of America]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

By working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or [[censorship|censored]] by the [[Production Code]] in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through ''The Story of Movies'', an educational program claimed to be "used by over 100,000 educators nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storyofmovies.org/common/11041/aboutFoundation.cfm?clientID=11041 About the Foundation] at storyofmovies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of [[digital television]], [[high definition television]] and [[DVD]], film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats.  Meanwhile, the dominance of [[home video]] and ever-present need for [[television broadcasting]] content, especially on [[specialty channel]]s, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.

==Video Aids to Film Preservation==
The group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.

The VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS) grant to the [[Folkstreams]] project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] with video demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Aids to Film Preservation|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/#content|work=Folkstreams|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the [[Creative Commons]] license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution—in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.

==Obstacles in restoration==
Regardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty of the preservation process. Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.

Cost is another obstacle. In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at "several hundred thousand dollars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-foundation.org film-foundation.org FAQ http://www.film-foundation.org/faq]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer "commercially" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.

Demand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Digital restoration steps==

Once a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via [[telecine]] or a [[motion picture film scanner]] to a [[magnetic tape data storage|digital tape]] or [[hard disk drive|disk]], and the audio is synced to create a new [[audio mastering|master]].

The main defects needing restoration:
* Dirt/dust
* Scratches, tears/[[movie projector#Light source|burned frames]]
* Color fade, color change
* Excessive [[film grain]] (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)
* Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)
* Shrinkage&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Linear and "across the web" (width), as well as localized puckering around large (1 to 2) perforation film cement splices, most common in silent and very early sound films. Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged. In the case of inflammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous, as the film can jam in the duplicator and become idle. Some methods of duplication have illumination sources with enough heat to ignite the film if exposed to the light source for a long period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:
&lt;ol type+"1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust.
&lt;li&gt;Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement.
&lt;li&gt;Scan each frame into a digital file.
&lt;li&gt;Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix frame alignment ("jitter" and "weave"), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center.
&lt;li&gt;Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film.
&lt;li&gt;Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames.
&lt;li&gt;Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Photochemical restoration steps ==

Modern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:
# Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternative material in film archives located around the world.
# A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as "key" elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing.
# Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists).
# Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog [[generation loss|duplication artifacts]], such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution.
# All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative).
# From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.
&lt;!-- (This paragraph is practically commentary, please reword to meet Wikipedia standards or remove altogether.)
Another important issue presented is that films of the nineteenth century are deteriorating. Negating internal processes, external factors such as wars and floods could destroy these collections permanently. The argument presented is that if films can be restored and made accessible for public consumption, then active efforts to take advantage of this extraordinary invention should continue. The fact is that at the risk of sounding technology determinist, there will be a solution to the preservation of film and digital format. Cyberspace is developing exponentially one must place it in the context where it is constant to changes in society. For every different medium there has been an exposure of meeting the demands of the audience. If the demands of the audience are to be met then surely a backup of this success is needed and will be sought i.e. an appropriate storage medium. In the next century, film archives may not exist.--&gt;

==Education==

The practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.&lt;ref&gt;Lukow, Gregory. [http://www.amianet.org/sites/all/files/ed_training_careers.pdf "Education Training and Careers in Moving Image Preservation"]. (AMIA, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).

The recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.

'''''Going Steady''''' is a 1979 Israeli film. It is the second in the [[Lemon Popsicle]] film series.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Kronish, Costel Safirman - ''Israeli Film: A Reference Guide'' 2003  p94 0313321442 "Lemon Popsicle ... Inspired by American Graffiti (George Lucas, 1973), the film focuses on the sexual awakening and teenage mores of three 17-year-old boys at a Tel Aviv high school. The film and its popular sequel, Going Steady (1979), turned the young, inexperienced yet talented actors into stars overnight. Both films present a genuine reflection of the anti-Establishment feeling of the time. "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film concerns three teenage boys, Benji (Bentzi), Bobby (Momo), and Huey (Yudale). Benji falls in love with Tammy, in a party he tries to make love with her but she leaves the party. When Benji gets drunk and Yudale's girlfriend tries to sleep with him. And so on...

The game is licensed by the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|England Cricket Board]] and [[Cricket Australia]], and thus will include all the official players of the [[Australian national cricket team]] and the [[England cricket team|England national cricket team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://playcricket2010.com/news/13071-international-cricket-2010-bowls-into-stores-this-friday International Cricket 2010 Bowls into Stores This Friday] from PlayCricket2010.com {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the teams in the game are unlicensed and will not feature the official players of the corresponding teams.

International Cricket also includes an online mode for the consoles it was released on, and a revolutionary Action Cam which provides an on-field view of play, which allows the user to view the game from different aspects on the field, and works with both batting and bowling.

==Improvements from Ashes Cricket 2009==
There is a new tournaments section with four new tournaments based on the big four limited overs contests – World 20 Overs (T20), 20 Overs Super League (T20), Champions Cup (ODI) and World Trophy (ODI). Test cricket is still available, and Test tournaments can be participated in by all teams.

There is an expanded roster of 16 international teams (Including [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda]], [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]], the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]], and [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]) and players can choose between 21 stadiums from around the world, 3 of which are new additions in [[Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium|Dhaka]], [[National Cricket Stadium (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[St George's Oval|Port Elizabeth]].

A new Power Stick feature enables players to gain both 360-degree direction and power control.

A new "sportsmanship rating" feature will allow players to decide on a preferred online opponent, especially for avoiding players who quit matches when losing.&lt;ref name=cg&gt;[http://www.cricketgaming.net/news/exclusive-interview-with-international-cricket-2010-producer/10560/ Exclusive Interview with International Cricket 2010 Producer] from CricketGaming.com, 17 May 2010, retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, the online aspect of the released game has received extensive criticism due to both the poorly designed sportsmanship ratings feature and a bug which causes online games to disconnect, usually after a boundary or a six is hit by a batsman.

People can select to play in different regions around the world, and even their own tournament. Winning tournaments unlocks brand new kit items, and other awards such as bats, pads and other equipment. The AI has been improved with batsmen being able to pick the gaps, computer simulation, and responses are more realistic than before.&lt;ref name=cg/&gt;

==PC and Future Consoles==
The game was released for [[PS3]] and [[Xbox 360]] and major developer [[Codemasters]] said that they wanted to "watch the response of the game with these consoles and decide on the future improvements or other platform releases, should the game do well". The PC version was not released as the Action Cam is not supported by the PC system. Also sales and issues with developer from [[Ashes Cricket 2009]] resulted in a temporary setback regarding the future of games in this line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/sports/internationalcricket2010/news.html?sid=6265217&amp;mode=previews International Cricket 2010 Hands-On] from ''[[GameSpot]]'', 11 June 2010, retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet regulation in Turkey''' is primarily authorized under the Electronic Communications Law (ECL) and the Internet Act and carried out by the [[Information and Communication Technologies Authority]] (ICTA).

[[Internet in Turkey|Turkey's internet]], which has 42.3 million active users, holds a 'Not Free' ranking in [[Freedom House]]'s index.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.orgx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom on the Net 2016|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2016|website=freedomhouse.org|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish government has [[Censorship in Turkey#Blocking of Internet sites|constantly blocked websites]] like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Youtube]] and as of May 2017, [[Wikipedia]] is [[2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey|currently inaccessible]].&lt;ref name="turkeyblocks.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey Blocks: Incident Reports and News|url=https://turkeyblocks.org/reports/|website=turkeyblocks.org|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Twitter's transparency report, Turkey leads in social media censorship.&lt;ref name="turkeyblocks.org1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey leads in social media censorship: new Twitter transparency report|url=https://turkeyblocks.org/2017/03/21/turkey-leads-social-media-censorship-new-twitter-transparency-report/|website=turkeyblocks.org|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulatory authorities ==
[[Turkey]] considers itself a [[Politics of Turkey|democratic country]] with a [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] as the head of the government. Its political system is based on the [[Government of Turkey|separation of powers]]. Specifically, the executive branch consists of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadi|first=Süleyman|title=Türkiye On The Web: A Cultural Warehouse. Turkey at a glance, government and legal system|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sss31/Turkiye/gov-system.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the traditional structure, certain public institutions are formed to regulate and execute specific duties. These institutions are classified as “regulatory authorities (RA)” and some of them have a sector-specific focus; "regulatory and supervisory authorities are established in order to regulate and monitor different types of markets in accordance with the requirements of a functioning market economy."&lt;ref name="Investment Support and Promotion Agency"&gt;{{cite web|last=Investment Support and Promotion Agency|title=Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities|url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/investmentguide/investorsguide/Pages/BusinessEnvironment.aspx|publisher=Investment Support and Promotion Agency|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relevant [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] in Turkey are "the Competition Authority, the Energy Market Regulation Authority, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority, the Information and Communication Technologies Authority, and the Tobacco, Tobacco Products and Alcoholic Beverages Market Regulation Board."&lt;ref name="Investment Support and Promotion Agency"/&gt;

==Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA)==

{{Move portions|Information and Communication Technologies Authority|date=May 2017 |section=yes}}

===History===

The [[Telecommunication]]s Authority was established by means of the [http://www.oib.gov.tr/telekom/telekom_law_4502.htm Law 4502], dated 29 January 2000. This Law addressed the responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport, among others, and "separated policy-making and regulatory functions of the government by establishing an independent telecommunications regulatory body, the Telecommunications Authority, as the first sector specific regulator in Turkey. As a result, regulatory functions of the Ministry of Transport were transferred to the Authority in principle, and the General Directorate of Radiocommunication, a government body in charge of radio frequency management under the Wireless Law (Law 2813, 7 April 1983), was abolished and all of its functions were transferred to the Telecommunications Authority."&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamada|first=Takashi|title=OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform in Turkey-Regulatory Reform in the Telecommunications Industry|date=2002|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development -OECD-|page=9|url=http://www.oecd.org/regreform/1840797.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2008 the Turkish legislature enacted the Law N. 5809, commonly known as the [http://eng.btk.gov.tr/mevzuat/kanunlar/dosyalar/5809.pdf Electronic Communications Law] (ECL). The purpose of this law has been briefly described as "to remove the legislative untidiness, create competition in the sector, lessen the uncertainties for operators and allocate resources to R&amp;D".&lt;ref name=ICTA&gt;{{cite web|last=ICTA|first=Information and Communications Technologies Authority|title=About the Establishment|url=http://eng.btk.gov.tr/kurum_hakkinda/kurulus/index.php|publisher=ICTA|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electronic Communications Law attributed to the Ministry of Transportation, Maritime Affairs and Communications the policy making authority in the field of electronic communications (article 5).  The regulation function was given to the Telecommunications Authority (article 6).

Following article 65(3) of the Law N. 5809, the name of the Authority was changed from "Telecommunications Authority" to "Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA)".

=== Organization of the ICTA ===

Based on ECL, ICTA's structure consists of 4 Vice Presidents, 17 departments, 5 offices, a Legal Consulting Office, and the Telecommunication Communications Presidency with 5 departments.&lt;ref name="ICTA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTA ORGANISATION CHART"&gt;{{cite web|last=ICTA|first=Information and Communication Authority|title=Organisation Chart|url=http://eng.btk.gov.tr/kurum_hakkinda/kurulus/organizasyon_semasi.php|publisher=ICTA|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

ICTA is attributed responsibilities about information technologies by the ECL. Among them, regulation of a dispute resolution system for domain names, e-signature, and a registered e-mail system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Republic of Turkey|title=cybersecurity|url=http://www.cybersecurity.gov.tr/|work=Turkish cybersecurity web page|publisher=ICTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now-defunct [[Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication]] (TIB) was affiliated with ICTA which has a particular focus on telecommunications and Internet regulation.  PTC was established by Law No. 5397.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication|title=Internet Regulation|url=http://m.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-2-information.html|work=Information about PTC|publisher=PTC|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTC is organized directly under ICTA and it consists of a Law Department, a Technical Management Department, an Information Systems Department, an Administration Department and an Internet Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication|title=The Structure of the Presidency|url=http://tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-7-the_structure_of_the_presidency.html|publisher=PTC|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law No. 5651, known as the Internet Act (IA), was enacted on 4 May 2007.&lt;ref name="WIPO LAW 5651"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Intellectual Property Organization|first=WIPO|title=Overview, Law N. 5651, Turkey|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11035|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The purpose of this law has been described by the PTC as follows: "There are 2 reasons for the law to be brought out. The first reason; determining the liability and the responsibility of collective use providers, access providers, location providers and content providers which are the main actors of the Internet. The other reason is to determine the procedures and fundamentals related to the specific crimes committed over the Internet and fighting these through content, location and access providers."&lt;ref name="PTC REGULATIONS INTERNET"&gt;{{cite web|last=Presidency of Telecommunication, communication|first=PTC|title=Information about the regulations of the content of the Internet|url=http://m.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-47-information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet.html|publisher=PTC|accessdate=22 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140322223329/http://m.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-47-information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet.html|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IA reorganized the duties of the PTC. These included publications that are made on the Internet environment and the law regarding fight against committed crimes by these publications. Accordingly, to implement these tasks the Internet Department has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WIPO|title=IA|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11035;http://www.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-2-information.html|work=Turkish IA|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turkish Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication|title=Information for Content Regulation|url=http://www.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-47-information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet.html.|work=explanation on IA|publisher=PTC|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet law ==
Internet content regulation is implemented by the PTC (ECL Art. 6/g, 13). Content regulation is governed by the Law No. 5651.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2016)011-e|title=Opinion on Law  No. 5651 on Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Combating Crimes Committed by Means of Such Publication ("The Internet Law")|last=|first=|date=June 10–11, 2016|website=venice.coe.int|publisher=Venice Commission|access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2014, the Turkish Parliament passed "an omnibus bill including new regulations on Internet usage which gives more power to the country’s national telecommunications authority".&lt;ref name="Anadolu Agency"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anadolu Agency|title=Turkey’s general assembly ratifies Internet bill|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/s/293504--turkey-s-general-assembly-ratifies-internet-bill|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=Anadolu Agency|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This bill implies modifications of the Internet Act (IA) and, of some of the provisions about Internet content regulation and the authority of the PTC.

There are secondary regulations such as ordinances enacted based on the IA as well. Secondary regulations elaborate upon the provisions, of the IA, about Internet content regulation. These are namely; ordinance on the procedures about granting business certificate for the host provider and access provider, ordinance on the procedures for regulating the content of online publications.

== Content regulation ==

=== Responsibilities of the content provider and the host provider ===

Internet content regulation is governed by IA. According to the Act the main responsibility is placed on the content provider. As a rule content provider is not responsible for the linked content provided by another. However, if this content is obviously supported by the content provider he shall be responsible under general provisions (Act No. 5651 Art. 4).&lt;ref name="PTC information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication|first=PTC|title=Information about the regulations of the content of the Internet|url=http://www.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-47-information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet.html|publisher=PTC|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the host provider is not responsible for supervising the legality of the content. Nevertheless, the host provider is responsible for taking out the content when notified according to the IA. The host provider is also required to save the traffic information for the period which will be determined by the ordinance (between 1–2 years). The host provider shall present the information demanded by PTC and take the precautions instructed by the PTC.&lt;ref name=MONDAQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehmet Gun &amp; Partners|title=Turkey: "Turkish Restrictions On The Internet"; The Highly Debated New Law In Turkey Enters Into Force And Is Subsequently Amended|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/298574/Telecommunications+Mobile+Cable+Communications/Turkish+Restrictions+On+The+Internet+The+Highly+Debated+New+Law+In+Turkey+Enters+Into+Force+And+Is+Subsequently+Amended|publisher=Mondaq, Connecting Knowledge and People|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the new version of the IA, the hosting service provider is sanctioned with monetary fines instead of imprisonment, as it was stated in the previous legislation (Act No. 5651 Art. 5).

=== Board of access providers ===

With the modifications to the Internet Act, a board of access providers was established. The board was given legal personality and is headquartered in [[Ankara]]. The board consists of the operators (service providers and other operators rendering Internet access services) which are authorized as per the ECL. The Board is designed to be self-sponsored.
The Board is required to execute the decisions for prevention of access, excluding decisions that might have to be based on the category of crimes enumerated in Art. 8. These enumerated crimes are; inducement for committing suicide, sexual abuse of children, facilitation of drug abuse, providing detrimental drugs, obscenity, prostitution, providing place and opportunity for gambling, and crimes against [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (defined by the Law No. 5816). Information related to the crimes against Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, may be found in the External Links section of this article.

According to Art 8, in case of sufficient suspicion a decision for prevention to access, may be rendered by the judge, during the investigation phase for these enumerated crimes. If the circumstances require an express decision, the public prosecutor would also be entitled to render a decision to prevent access with a condition to present the decision to the judge in 24 hours for approval. However, the decision would promptly be revoked by the public prosecutor unless it is approved by the judge. If the suspect is found innocent at the conclusion of the judicial hearing, the decision for prevention of access shall be deemed invalid (Act No. 5651 Art. 8/1).

If the Content Provider or the Hosting Provider of the publication is located outside Turkey and involves certain enumerated crimes mentioned above the PTC shall render the decision for prevention on its own initiative. PTC shall also be entitled to render a decision for prevention in case of sexual abuse of the children, obscenity and prostitution disregarding the location of CP or HP (Act No. 5651 Art. 8/2).

Protection for intrusion upon seclusion and infringement of personal rights

Individuals or legal persons claiming infringement of personal rights are entitled to apply to CP or to HP (when access to CP is not possible). In these situations they can legally inform and warn the CP or HP about the infringement. CP or HP must reply to the application within 24 hours. The claimant is also entitled to a direct application to the court without warning the CP or HP. According to the new version of IA, the judge will render its decision only aiming the portion infringing personal rights and not the whole web site. However, if the judge deems necessary for the protection of the personal rights he can render a decision including whole content on the web site. The judge shall render his decision within 24 hours (Act No. 5651 Art. 9).

=== Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication’s authority and judicial control ===

In addition to these, the Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication (PTC) will be the competent authority if the content of the publication intrudes upon an individual's private affairs (intrusion upon seclusion). In this circumstance, PTC shall take initiative upon the individual’s request. The request for prevention should include satisfactory information about how the individual's private affairs were intruded, and his credentials (Act No. 5651 Art. 9).

The individual seeking for the prevention of the content is required to submit his official demand to the Court in 24 hours. The Court shall render its decision in 48 hours stating its opinion if the content does in fact constitute intrusion upon private affairs/seclusion. Noncompliance to these time limits shall automatically conclude the invalidation of PTC’s decision for prevention. According to the IA article 9/A/8 if individual's life is in peril, the President himself is entitled to render a decision for prevention. However, in this case an objection shall be submitted to the Court (Law No. 5651 Art. 9/A/5).

== Arguments supporting the Internet Act ==

=== Protection of privacy, reputation, and availability of judicial process ===

As one of the arguments in support of the IA the government addressed the protection of privacy. In a declaration, the Transportation, Maritime and Communication Minister Lutfi Elvan mentioned that “we want to protect individual rights and liberties. We want to protect and guarantee the right to privacy. In that regard, the existing bill did not respond to the needs of the people”.&lt;ref name="AK PARTY"&gt;{{cite web|last=AK Party, Justice and Development Party|title=Turkey’s internet law in line with developed countries|url=http://www.akparti.org.tr/english/haberler/turkeys-internet-law-in-line-with-developed-countries/59391#1|publisher=AK Party|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister Elvan has also mentioned that the bill by protecting privacy, protects the violation of personal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=TRT English|title=Turkey's President ratifies controversial Internet Bill|url=http://www.trtenglish.com/en/newsdetail.aspx/en/newsDetail.aspx?HaberKodu=851cb970-012e-4325-bbdc-e90bac3ea621|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=TRT English|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another declaration the Prime Minister himself mentions that the new Internet law does not stipulate any censorship, and it is a measure against blackmailing, immorality, and the threat against people's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Justice and Development Party|title=speech on IA|url=http://www.akparti.org.tr/english/haberler/internet-law-to-protect-against-blackmail/59642|work=Prime Minister's speech|publisher=Akparti|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a memorandum the government also mentioned that
“In the event of a breach of ‘a person’s privacy,’ such as illegal wiretapping and the sharing of personal data without consent, in order to prevent irreversible damage that could be caused by the “time lag” between the complaint of the individual and the decision of the court, the bill will make it possible to implement a temporary prevention of access. When an individual raises a complaint, the Presidency of Telecommunication and Communications will send the request to the Union of Access Providers, which will block the URL within the next four hours as a preventive measure.“The complainant should also file his request to the penal court of peace within 24 hours and the decision of the court should be given within the next 48 hours. If the decision of the court is not in favor of the complainant, the restriction on access to the URL will be removed by the Union. Unless a decision by the court is delivered to the Union within 48 hours, the restriction will be automatically removed.”&lt;ref name="Yell Ali"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yell Ali|title=Turkey’s Internet Bill - Law No. 5651|url=http://www.yellali.com/news/article/49/turkey-s-internet-bill-law-no-5651|accessdate=April 2, 2014|newspaper=Yell Ali|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compared regulation with UK ===

In response to criticism, Turkey's Communications minister defended Turkey's blocking of content by pointing to regulations in the UK. He specifically pointed to the [[Internet Watch Foundation]]'s blacklist of websites hosting child pornography and criminal activity to defend the restrictions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anadolu Agency|title=Turkey: UK has its own Internet restrictions|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/s/290446--turkey-uk-has-its-own-internet-restrictions|accessdate=April 2, 2014|newspaper=Anadolu Agency|date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facilitation of protective interim measures for personal rights ===

It is also declared by the government that implementation of the prevention of access decisions are facilitated by the requirement of stipulating a legal responsibility to operators for preserving traffic information up to 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaman Politika|title=Başbakanlık, internet yasası için bilgi notu yayınladı|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/politika_basbakanlik-internet-yasasi-icin-bilgi-notu-yayinladi_2199182.html|accessdate=April 2, 2014|newspaper=Zaman Politika}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Government also mentions that new codification will be helpful for preventing victimization from online defamatory content in an efficient and swift way. And the final decision is to be rendered by the court. However, the initiative of the PTC  is designed as a tool for an interim measure to protect the individual’s personal rights from defamation till the court renders its decision. Since a defamatory content can spread very swiftly because of the nature of the Internet in the time gap till the court renders its decision.&lt;ref name="Yell Ali"/&gt;

=== Availability of partial prevention ===

According to the new version, only the infringing content will be able to be removed instead of the whole content provided on the web site&lt;ref name=bozbel&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozbel|first=Savas|title=savas bozbel's blog|url=http://bozbel.wordpress.com/|work=comments on IA|publisher=savas bozbel wordpress|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusion of private sector in regulatory regime ===

According to the code The Board consists of the operators (service providers and other operators rendering Internet access services) which are authorized according to ECL.

=== Replacing imprisonment with monetary fines ===

Unlike the previous version, the new version of the IA includes monetary fines instead of imprisonment.&lt;ref name=worldbulletin&gt;{{cite news|last=worldbulletin|title=the explanation of ICTA|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/general/128960/turkeys-communication-authority-defends-new-internet-bill|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=worldbulletin.net|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against the Internet Act ==

=== Freedom of expression ===

Opponents to the IA have criticized it heavily. They mention that government is willing to place a censorship on freedom of expression on the Internet. They blame the government for using democratic tools for implementing censorship on Internet. They allege that Internet law does not regulate wiretapping or personal data. It regulates the prevention of access to online content under certain circumstances. However, opponents mention their concern about these issues.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=Turkey passes law tightening control of internet|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26062038|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=BBC web site|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Today'szaman|title=Turkish public unhappy about government's media interference, Internet law|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-341140-turkish-public-unhappy-about-governments-media-interference-internet-law.html|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=Today's zaman|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Opponents also criticized the TCB’s authority for implementing a decision for prevention when the personal rights are involved in the online content. They mention that this regulation places a huge power on TCB.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; However government explains that TCB’s decision will be lifted automatically if the court does not approve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haberturk|title=yeni-internet-duzenlemesi-aciklamasi|url=http://ekonomi.haberturk.com/teknoloji/haber/921803-yeni-internet-duzenlemesi-aciklamasi|work=haberturk web site|publisher=haberturk|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act also attracted international attention. US and EU communicated their concerns about IA.  President Obama also talked to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan about the IA and its influence&lt;ref name="nytimes crack"&gt;{{cite news|last=Editorial board|title=Turkey's internet crackdown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/opinion/turkeys-internet-crackdown.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=NY times|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinikoglu|first=Batu|title=Evaluating the Regulation of Access to  Online Content in Turkey in the Context of Freedom of Speech|journal=Journal of International Commercial Law and Technology|year=2014|volume=9|issue=1|pages=36–55|url=http://www.jiclt.com/index.php/jiclt/article/view/199|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erikkson|first=Johan|author2=Giampiero Giacomello|title=Who controls the Internet?

=== Financial burden on operators ===

Opponents also mention that the establishment of the Board of access providers will place an economic burden since the Board is stipulated to be self-sponsored.&lt;ref&gt;savas bozbel&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs are of the opinion that implementing the legal responsibilities arising from IA may cause small-scale companies a serious problem. They also express that after IA these firms may prefer to operate outside Turkey. They indicated their concerns about the anticompetitive environment;&lt;ref name=bozbel /&gt;&lt;ref name=mervekara&gt;{{cite web|last=Kara|first=Merve|title=internet yasası küçük hosting sirketleri için büyük bir test niteliğinde olacak|url=http://www.webrazzi.com/2014/02/13/internet-yasasi-kucuk-hosting-sirketleri/|work=IA is a test for small scale hosting firms|publisher=webrazzi|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safe Internet ==

Other than IA another regulation that attracted public attention was Safe Internet (SI). SI is setting up an optional, free and on-demand service for families to protect their children from detrimental content. SI present options. Users have alternatives such as family and children profiles and they can opt in or opt out of the service at any time with their consent. These profiles are also created by a board of academicians from various backgrounds such as pedagogy, psychology, law, sociology.&lt;ref name=safebtk&gt;{{cite web|last=Turkish Information and Communications Technologies Authority|title=public announcement on safe internet|url=http://www.btk.gov.tr/basin_bultenleri/dosyalar/Basin_Bulteni_Guvenli_Internet_21-11-2012.pdf|work=BTK|publisher=BTK web site|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of SI is to provide the safe, effective and right use of Internet which is spreading at a fast speed. To this end raising awareness in general of the society, individually of the children, families and educators, together with the most effective and useful methods of safe use of Internet and raise consciousness towards the dangerous aspects that the Internet contains. People in Turkey and around the world are being educated about the general trends of the Internet use and information about similar useful statistics are given&lt;ref name=safetcp&gt;{{cite web|last=Turkish Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication|title=information on safe internet|url=http://www.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-141-what_is_safer_internet_service_.html|work=safe internet|publisher=PTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the 2014 modifications to the 2007 Internet Act ==

As mentioned above, in February 2014, the Turkish government passed an omnibus law that included provisions that modify the Internet Act of 2007.

This modifications have had impact, considering that they have been described, as a restriction over free speech. Following, there are some commentaries that expose the reaction to the 2014's Internet Act modifications:

* The Law has been described as tightening control of the [[Internet]], while raising concerns over [[free speech]]. It has been said that this law will enable authorities to rapidly block access to webpages, without necessarily counting with a Court order. It has also been commented, that although Turkey has been seeking becoming a member of the [[European Union]] for decades, this law raises concerns and fears of the country shifting further away from EU norms.&lt;ref name=REUTERS&gt;{{cite news|last=Tattersall|first=Nick|title=UPDATE 1-Turkey's Gul approves law tightening Internet controls|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/turkey-government-idUSL6N0LN45920140218|accessdate=April 2, 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The intention of this law has been addressed as "to help protect Mr. Erdogan (Turkey's Prime Minister) and his allies from a widening corruption scandal by tightening government control of the Internet. It would allow the authorities, without a court order, to block web pages under the guise of protecting personal privacy, and to collect users’ browsing histories." Apparently, the "new law is a transparent effort to prevent social media and other sites from reporting on a corruption scandal that reportedly involves bid-rigging and money laundering."&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=NY Times|title=Turkey's Internet Crackdown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/opinion/turkeys-internet-crackdown.html|accessdate=April 2, 2014|newspaper=NY Times|date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Companies like [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]] were banned, in March 2014, by the Turkish government. "The Turkish government reinforced its heavily criticised clampdown on social media on Thursday, blocking YouTube a week after it restricted access to the micro-blogging platform Twitter. The latest curbs came hours after an audio recording of a high-level security meeting was leaked on the video-sharing website. According to Turkish media reports, the decision to block YouTube was taken by Turkey’s telecommunications authority (TİB) as a “precautionary administrative measure.” In February, Turkey passed a much criticised new internet law that allows the telecommunications regulator to block websites without a court order. Turkey previously banned YouTube in 2007, but lifted the ban three years later.&lt;ref name="THE GUARDIAN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|title=Turkey blocks YouTube amid 'national security' concerns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan|accessdate=April 2, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All [[Wikipedia]] sites were effectively blocked in April 2017 by an administrative measure issued in purported accordance with law 5651, expected to be ratified by a subsequent court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://turkeyblocks.org/2017/04/29/wikipedia-blocked-turkey/|title=Wikipedia blocked in Turkey|last=Editorial|date=2017-04-29|website=Turkey Blocks|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jazz''' is a [[music genre]] that originated in the [[African-American]] communities of [[New Orleans]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/jazz/learn/historyculture/history_early.htm|title=Jazz Origins in New Orleans – New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in [[blues]] and [[ragtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbg.ac.at/ges/people/wagnleitner/usa3/nov26frame.htm |title="The Jazz Book": A Map of Jazz Styles |last=Germuska |first=Joe |publisher=WNUR-FM, Northwestern University |via=[[University of Salzburg]] |access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=On the Instrumental Origins of Jazz |last=Roth |first=Russell |journal=[[American Quarterly]] |issn=0003-0678 |date=1952 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=305–16 |doi=10.2307/3031415|jstor=3031415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1920s [[Jazz Age]], jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[popular music]]al styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and [[European-American]] musical parentage with a performance orientation.&lt;ref name="Hennessey"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_jazz_to_swing_black_jazz_musicians.html?id=nvskngEACAAJ |last=Hennessey |first=Thomas |title=From Jazz to Swing: Black Jazz Musicians and Their Music, 1917–1935 |type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=[[Northwestern University]] |year=1973 |pages=470–473 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz is characterized by [[swung note|swing]] and [[blue note]]s, [[Call and response (music)|call and response vocals]], [[polyrhythm]]s and [[improvisation]]. Jazz has roots in [[Music of Africa|West African cultural and musical expression]], and in [[African-American music|African-American music traditions]] including [[blues]] and [[ragtime]], as well as European military band music.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Jean (1993) ''America's Musical Landscape''. Brown and Benchmark. {{ISBN|0697125165}}. pp. 228, 233&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Larry, and Christopher Waterman. [http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2008/08/20080812212457eaifas0.7410852.html#axzz3QeZKNVtc "Popular Jazz and Swing: America's Original Art Form."] IIP Digital. Oxford University Press, 26 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French [[quadrille]]s, [[biguine]], ragtime and [[blues]] with collective [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[improvisation]]. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented [[Swing (music)|swing]] [[big band]]s, [[Kansas City jazz]], a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and [[Gypsy jazz]] (a style that emphasized [[Bal-musette|musette]] waltzes) were the prominent styles. [[Bebop]] emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. [[Cool jazz]] developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.

The 1950s saw the emergence of [[free jazz]], which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, [[hard bop]] emerged, which introduced influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. [[Modal jazz]] developed in the late 1950s, using the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. [[Jazz fusion|Jazz-rock fusion]] appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with [[rock music]]'s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called [[smooth jazz]] became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as [[Latin jazz|Latin]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]].

{{Main|Jazz (word)}}
[[File:EubieBlake.jpg|thumb|right|American jazz composer, lyricist, and pianist [[Eubie Blake]] made an early contribution to the genre's etymology]]

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition pour Jazz, oil on cardboard, 73 x 73 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1915, ''[[Composition for "Jazz"]]'' from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York]]

The origin of the [[jazz (word)|word ''jazz'']] has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to ''jasm'', a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning "pep, energy".&lt;ref name="baseball" /&gt; The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'' in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a ''jazz ball'' "because it wobbles and you simply can't do anything with it".&lt;ref name="baseball"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Wilton| first1=Dave|title=The baseball origin of 'jazz'|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/04/jazz-baseball/|accessdate=20 June 2016|work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune.''&lt;ref name=CDT&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.omf.paris-sorbonne.fr/IMG/pdf/1915_article_Seagrove.pdf |title=Blues is Jazz and Jazz Is Blues |last=Seagrove |first=Gordon |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]] |format=PDF |date=July 11, 1915 |accessdate=November 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130130212/http://www.omf.paris-sorbonne.fr/IMG/pdf/1915_article_Seagrove.pdf |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |via=[[Paris-Sorbonne University]] }} Archived at Observatoire Musical Français, [[Paris-Sorbonne University]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916 ''Times-Picayune'' article about "jas bands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benjamin Zimmer|author-link=Benjamin Zimmer| title="Jazz": A Tale of Three Cities|url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1876/|website=Word Routes|publisher=The Visual Thesaurus|date=June 8, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with NPR, musician [[Eubie Blake]] offered his recollections of the original slang connotations of the term, saying: "When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'.  It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/03/19/470879654/the-musical-that-ushered-in-the-jazz-age-gets-its-own-musical "The Musical That Ushered In The Jazz Age Gets Its Own Musical", ''NPR Music'', March 19, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The American Dialect Society named it the [[word of the year|Word of the Twentieth Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americandialect.org/1999_words_of_the_year_word_of_the_1990s_word_of_the_20th_century|title=1999 Words of the Year, Word of the 1990s, Word of the 20th Century, Word of the Millennium|date=13 January 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from [[ragtime]] to the [[rock music|rock]]-infused [[Jazz fusion|fusion]]. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic [[Joachim-Ernst Berendt]] argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader,&lt;ref name="Joachim E. Berendt 1981. Page 371"&gt;Joachim E. Berendt. ''The Jazz Book: From Ragtime to Fusion and Beyond''. Translated by H. and B. Bredigkeit with Dan Morgenstern. 1981. Lawrence Hill Books, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; defining jazz as a "form of [[art music]] which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music"&lt;ref name="Berendt1964"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berendt|first=Joachim Ernst|title=The New Jazz Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjgYAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 August 2013|year=1964|publisher=P. Owen|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a "special relationship to time defined as 'swing{{'"}}. Jazz involves "a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role" and contains a "sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician".&lt;ref name="Joachim E. Berendt 1981. Page 371"/&gt; In the opinion of [[Robert Christgau]], "most of us would say that inventing meaning while letting loose is the essence and promise of jazz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Christgau| first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=October 28, 1986|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv10-86.php| title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: "it is music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', and being open to different musical possibilities".&lt;ref name="Elsdon" /&gt; Krin Gibbard argued that "jazz is a construct" which designates "a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Cooke, Mervyn |author2=Horn, David G. |title=The Cambridge companion to jazz|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521663885|pages=1, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to commentators who have argued for excluding types of jazz, musicians are sometimes reluctant to define the music they play. [[Duke Ellington]], one of jazz's most famous figures, said, "It's all music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Luebbers| first=Johannes| date=September 8, 2008|title=It's All Music|journal=Resonate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements and issues==

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Jazz improvisation}}

Although jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it contains many subgenres, [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] is one of its key elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as [[blues]], a form of folk music which arose in part from the [[work song]]s and [[field holler]]s of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. [[Classical music]] performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the [[sheet music|musical score]], with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer.&lt;ref&gt;Giddins 1998, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Giddins 1998, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early [[Dixieland]], a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising [[countermelodies]]. In the [[Swing music|swing]] era of the 1920s–'40s, [[big bands]] relied more on [[arrangements]] which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the [[bebop]] era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the song was improvised. [[Modal jazz]] abandoned [[chord progressions]] to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a [[rhythm section]] of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the song structure and complement the soloist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ Jazz Drum Lessons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027050049/http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/jazz-drums/jazz-drumming/ |date=2010-10-27 }} – Drumbook.org&lt;/ref&gt; In [[avant-garde jazz|avant-garde]] and [[free jazz]], the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.

===Tradition and race===
Since the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a "tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form".&lt;ref name="Elsdon"&gt;In [http://www.fzmw.de/2003/2003_12.htm Review of ''The Cambridge Companion to Jazz''] by Peter Elsdon, ''FZMw (Frankfurt Journal of Musicology)'' No. 6, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An alternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/music/features/19/12/jazz.html |title=Jazz Inc.: The bottom line threatens the creative line in corporate America's approach to music |accessdate=2001-07-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010720153446/http://www.metrotimes.com/music/features/19/12/jazz.html |archivedate=2001-07-20 |df= }} by Andrew Gilbert, ''[[Metro Times]]'', December 23, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; By avoiding the creation of norms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.&lt;ref name="Elsdon" /&gt;

[[Women in jazz|Female jazz performers and composers]] have contributed throughout jazz history. Although [[Betty Carter]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Adelaide Hall]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Abbey Lincoln]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Dinah Washington]], and [[Ethel Waters]] were recognized for their vocal talent, women received less recognition for their accomplishments as bandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists. This group includes pianist [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] and songwriters [[Irene Higginbotham]] and [[Dorothy Fields]]. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early 1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano.&lt;ref name=Murph&gt;{{cite web|title = NPR's Jazz Profiles: Women In Jazz, Part 1|url = https://www.npr.org/programs/jazzprofiles/archive/women_1.html|website =NPR |accessdate= 2015-04-24 |first= John |last= Murph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II, many [[all-female bands]] replaced them.&lt;ref name=Murph /&gt; [[The International Sweethearts of Rhythm]], which was founded in 1937, was a popular band that became the first all-female integrated band in the U.S. and the first to travel with the [[USO]], touring Europe in 1945. Women were members of the big bands of [[Woody Herman]] and [[Gerald Wilson]]. From the 1950s onwards many women jazz instrumentalists became prominent, some sustaining lengthy careers. Over the decades, some of the most distinctive improvisers, composers and bandleaders in jazz have been women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Placksin |first= Sally |title = Jazzwomen: 1900 to the Present, their words, lives, and music |location=London |date=1985 |publisher= Pluto Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1866, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had brought nearly 400,000 Africans to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/|title=How Many Slaves Landed in the U.S.? |website =The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross |date=3 January 2013|publisher=PBS|deadurl = no  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921182328/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/ |archivedate=September 21, 2015|last = Gates|first = Henry Louis, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves came largely from [[West Africa]] and the greater [[Congo River]] basin and brought strong musical traditions with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The African traditions primarily use a single-line melody and [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, and the rhythms have a [[cross-beat|counter-metric]] structure and reflect African speech patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeVeaux|first=Scott|date=1991|title=Constructing the Jazz Tradition: Jazz Historiography|jstor=3041812|journal=Black American Literature Forum|volume=25|issue=3|pages=525–560|doi=10.2307/3041812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1885 account says that they were making strange music (Creole) on an equally strange variety of 'instruments'—washboards, washtubs, jugs, boxes beaten with sticks or bones and a drum made by stretching skin over a flour-barrel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=XlwvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT4079&amp;lpg=PT4079&amp;dq=dry+goods+box+beaten+with+sticks+or+bones+made+by+stretching+skin+over+a+flour+barrel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I5xu9Pcl8S&amp;sig=uJrUMcul5ugYRO51hq44qaQeHFA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI5crl8YjYAhUDVhoKHTY2Aa8Q6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dry%20goods%20box%20beaten%20with%20sticks%20or%20bones%20made%20by%20stretching%20skin%20over%20a%20flour%20barrel&amp;f=false Hearn, Lafcadio, ''Delphi Complete Works of Lafcadio Hearn''], Volume 19 of Delphi Series Eight, Delphi Classics, 2017, {{ISBN|1786560909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavish festivals featuring African-based dances to drums were organized on Sundays at ''Place Congo'', or [[Congo Square]], in New Orleans until 1843.&lt;ref&gt;"The primary instrument for a cultural music expression was a long narrow African drum. It came in various sized from three to eight feet long and had previously been banned in the South by whites. Other instruments used were the triangle, a jawbone, and early ancestors to the banjo. Many types of dances were performed in Congo Square, including the 'flat-footed-shuffle' and the 'Bamboula.'" [http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/congo-square-soul-new-orleans African American Registry.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202083601/http://aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/congo-square-soul-new-orleans |date=2014-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are historical accounts of other music and dance gatherings elsewhere in the southern United States. [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] said of percussive slave music:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Usually such music was associated with annual festivals, when the year's crop was harvested and several days were set aside for celebration. As late as 1861, a traveler in North Carolina saw dancers dressed in costumes that included horned headdresses and cow tails and heard music provided by a sheepskin-covered "gumbo box", apparently a frame drum; triangles and jawbones furnished the auxiliary percussion. There are quite a few [accounts] from the southeastern states and Louisiana dating from the period 1820–1850. Some of the earliest [Mississippi] Delta settlers came from the vicinity of New Orleans, where drumming was never actively discouraged for very long and homemade drums were used to accompany public dancing until the outbreak of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Palmer|first = Robert |date=1981|page = 37|title = Deep Blues|location = New York|publisher = Viking Penguin|isbn = 978-0670495115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another influence came from the harmonic style of [[hymn]]s of the church, which black slaves had learned and incorporated into their own music as [[spirituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=14–17, 27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[origins of the blues]] are undocumented, though they can be seen as the secular counterpart of the spirituals. However, as [[Gerhard Kubik]] points out, whereas the spirituals are [[homophonic]], rural blues and early jazz "was largely based on concepts of [[heterophony]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 112).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virginia Minstrels, 1843.jpg|thumb|right|The blackface [[Virginia Minstrels]] in 1843, featuring tambourine, fiddle, banjo and [[Bones (instrument)|bones]]]]
During the early 19th century an increasing number of black musicians learned to play European instruments, particularly the violin, which they used to parody European dance music in their own [[cakewalk]] dances. In turn, European-American [[minstrel show]] performers in [[blackface]] popularized the music internationally, combining [[syncopation]] with European harmonic accompaniment. In the mid-1800s the white New Orleans composer [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]] adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other Caribbean islands into piano salon music. New Orleans was the main nexus between the Afro-Caribbean and African-American cultures.

===African rhythmic retention===
{{See also|Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony}}

The "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]" outlawed drumming by slaves, which meant that African drumming traditions were not preserved in North America, unlike in Cuba, Haiti, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. African-based rhythmic patterns were retained in the United States in large part through "body rhythms" such as stomping, clapping, and [[Juba dance|patting juba dancing]].&lt;ref name= palmer39&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1981|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of jazz historian [[Ernest Borneman]], what preceded New Orleans jazz before 1890 was "Afro-Latin music", similar to what was played in the Caribbean at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Borneman, Ernest (1969: 104). Jazz and the Creole Tradition." ''Jazz Research'' I: 99–112.&lt;/ref&gt; A three-stroke pattern known in Cuban music as [[tresillo (rhythm)|''tresillo'']] is a fundamental rhythmic figure heard in many different slave musics of the Caribbean, as well as the [[Afro-Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]] folk dances performed in New Orleans [[Congo Square]] and Gottschalk's compositions (for example "Souvenirs From Havana" (1859)). Tresillo (shown below) is the most basic and most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic [[cell (music)|cell]] in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]] and the music of the [[African Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned (2008: 124, 287). ''The World that made New Orleans: from Spanish silver to Congo Square''. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1556529589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peñalosa|2010|pp=38–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tresillo]] is heard prominently in New Orleans [[second line (parades)|second line]] music and in other forms of popular music from that city from the turn of the 20th century to present.&lt;ref&gt;Wynton Marsalis states that [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] is the New Orleans "[[clave (rhythm)|clave]]." "Wynton Marsalis part 2." ''60 Minutes''. CBS News (June 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; "By and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns survived in jazz ... because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions," jazz historian [[Gunther Schuller]] observed. "Some survived, others were discarded as the Europeanization progressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-Civil War period (after 1865), African Americans were able to obtain surplus military bass drums, snare drums and fifes, and an original African-American drum and fife music emerged, featuring tresillo and related syncopated rhythmic figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 52). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean counterparts, expressing a uniquely African-American sensibility. "The snare and bass drummers played syncopated [[cross beat|cross-rhythms]]," observed the writer Robert Palmer, speculating that "this tradition must have dated back to the latter half of the nineteenth century, and it could have not have developed in the first place if there hadn't been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured."&lt;ref name= palmer39/&gt;

==="Spanish tinge"—the Afro-Cuban rhythmic influence===
[[African-American music]] began incorporating [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythmic motifs in the 19th century when the [[habanera (music)|habanera]] (Cuban [[contradanza]]) gained international popularity.&lt;ref&gt;"[Afro]-Latin rhythms have been absorbed into black American styles far more consistently than into white popular music, despite Latin music's popularity among whites" (Roberts 1979: 41).&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians from [[Havana]] and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City. [[John Storm Roberts]] states that the musical genre habanera "reached the U.S. twenty years before the first rag was published."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm (1999: 12) ''Latin Jazz''. New York: Schirmer Books.&lt;/ref&gt; For the more than quarter-century in which the [[cakewalk]], [[ragtime]], and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm (1999: 16) ''Latin Jazz''. New York: Schirmer Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically based on an African motif (1803).&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, Peter (2009: 67). ''Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of African-American music, the ''habanera rhythm'' (also known as ''congo'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Manuel, Peter (2009: 69). ''Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''tango-congo'',&lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo (2003: 5).

Petaluma, California: Sher Music. {{ISBN|0961470194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be thought of as a combination of [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] and the [[beat (music)|backbeat]] (shown below).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peñalosa|2010|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The habanera was the first of many Cuban music genres which enjoyed periods of popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo-based rhythms in African-American music.

New Orleans native [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]]'s piano piece "Ojos Criollos (Danse Cubaine)" (1860) was influenced by the composer's studies in Cuba: the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned (2008: 125). ''The World that made New Orleans: from Spanish silver to Congo Square''. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1556529589}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gottschalk's symphonic work "A Night in the Tropics" (1859), the tresillo variant [[cinquillo]] (shown below) appears extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned (2008:125). ''Cuba and its Music; From the First Drums to the Mambo.'' Chicago: Chicago Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers.

Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, [[Wynton Marsalis]] observes that [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] is the New Orleans "clave", a Spanish word meaning 'code' or 'key', as in the key to a puzzle, or mystery.&lt;ref&gt;"Wynton Marsalis part 2." ''60 Minutes''. CBS News (June 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Although technically the pattern is only half a [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]], Marsalis makes the point that the single-celled figure is the [[bell pattern|guide-pattern]] of New Orleans music. [[Jelly Roll Morton]] called the rhythmic figure the ''[[Spanish tinge]]'' and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Morton, Jelly Roll (1938: Library of Congress Recording) ''The Complete Recordings By Alan Lomax''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ragtime===
{{Main|Ragtime}}
[[File:Scott Joplin 19072.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Scott Joplin]] in 1903]]
The abolition of [[slavery]] in 1865 led to new opportunities for the education of freed African Americans. Although strict segregation limited employment opportunities for most blacks, many were able to find work in entertainment. Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances, [[minstrel show]]s, and in [[vaudeville]], during which time many marching bands were formed. Black pianists played in bars, clubs, and brothels, as [[ragtime]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=28, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnx.org/content/m10878/latest/|title=Ragtime|accessdate=October 18, 2007|author=Catherine Schmidt-Jones|year=2006|publisher=Connexions }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ragtime appeared as sheet music, popularized by African-American musicians such as the entertainer [[Ernest Hogan]], whose hit songs appeared in 1895. Two years later, [[Vess Ossman]] recorded a medley of these songs as a [[banjo]] solo known as "Rag Time Medley".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/firstragtimerecords.html|title=The First Ragtime Records (1897–1903)|accessdate=October 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1897, the white composer [[William Krell|William H. Krell]] published his "[[Mississippi Rag]]" as the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece, and [[Tom Turpin]] published his "Harlem Rag", the first rag published by an African-American.

The classically trained pianist [[Scott Joplin]] produced his "[[Original Rags]]" in 1898 and, in 1899, had an international hit with "[[Maple Leaf Rag]]", a multi-[[strain (music)|strain]] ragtime [[march (music)|march]] with four parts that feature recurring themes and a bass line with copious [[seventh chord]]s. Its structure was the basis for many other rags, and the [[syncopation]]s in the right hand, especially in the transition between the first and second strain, were novel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Paul, David W. Megill, and Maurice Gerow. ''Jazz''. 11th edn. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2009, pp. 328–331.&lt;/ref&gt; The last four measures of [[Scott Joplin]]'s "[[Maple Leaf Rag]]" (1899) are shown below.

African-based rhythmic patterns such as [[tresillo]] and its variants, the habanera rhythm and [[cinquillo]], are heard in the ragtime compositions of [[Scott Joplin|Joplin]], [[Tom Turpin|Turpin]], and others. Joplin's "Solace" (1909) is generally considered to be within the habanera genre:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen, Bill (2008: 8). ''Habaneras, Maxixies &amp; Tangos The Syncopated Piano Music of Latin America''. Mel Bay. {{ISBN|0786676353}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of the pianist's hands play in a syncopated fashion, completely abandoning any sense of a [[March (music)|march]] rhythm. [[Ned Sublette]] postulates that the tresillo/habanera rhythm "found its way into ragtime and the cakewalk,"&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned (2008:155). ''Cuba and its Music; From the First Drums to the Mambo.'' Chicago: Chicago Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Roberts suggests that "the habanera influence may have been part of what freed black music from ragtime's European bass."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm (1999: 40).

The African use of pentatonic scales contributed to the development of [[blue note]]s in blues and jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Kubik explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the rural blues of the Deep South are ''stylistically'' an extension and merger of basically two broad accompanied song-style traditions in the west central Sudanic belt:
* A strongly Arabic/Islamic song style, as found for example among the [[Hausa people|Hausa]]. It is characterized by melisma, wavy intonation, pitch instabilities within a pentatonic framework, and a declamatory voice.
* An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of pentatonic song composition, often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter, but with notable off-beat accents (1999: 94).&lt;ref&gt;Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 96).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====W. C. Handy: early published blues====
[[File:WC Handy age 19 handyphoto10.jpg|thumb|right|upright|W. C. Handy at 19, 1892]]
[[W. C. Handy]] became intrigued by the folk blues of the Deep South whilst traveling through the Mississippi Delta. In this folk blues form, the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range, sounding like a field holler, and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed, like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents, functioning as another "voice".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1981: 46).&lt;/ref&gt; Handy and his band members were formally trained African-American musicians who had not grown up with the blues, yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form.

Handy wrote about his adopting of the blues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ... , and I carried this device into my melody as well.&lt;ref name="Handy, Father 1941, p. 99"&gt;Handy, Father (1941), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The publication of his "[[The Memphis Blues|Memphis Blues]]" sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but "more like a cakewalk"&lt;ref&gt;Schuller (1968: 66, 145n.).&lt;/ref&gt;). This composition, as well as his later "[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]" and others, included the habanera rhythm,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;W. C. Handy, ''Father of the Blues: An Autobiography'', edited by [[Arna Bontemps]]: foreword by Abbe Niles. Macmillan Company, New York; (1941), pp. 99, 100 (no ISBN in this first printing).&lt;/ref&gt; and would become [[jazz standard]]s. Handy's music career began in the pre-jazz era and contributed to the codification of jazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music.

====Within the context of Western harmony====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The blues form which is ubiquitous in jazz is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the [[twelve-bar blues]] progression is the most common. Basic blues progressionions are based on the I, IV and V chords (often called the "one", "four" and "five" chords). An important part of the sound are the microtonal [[blue note]]s which, for expressive purposes, are sung or played flattened (thus "between" the notes on a piano), or gradually "bent" (minor third to major third) in relation to the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the [[major scale]]. The blue notes opened up an entirely new approach to Western harmony, ultimately leading to a high level of harmonic complexity in jazz.

===New Orleans===
{{Main|Dixieland}}
[[File:Bolden band.gif|thumb|left|[[Buddy Bolden|The Bolden Band]] around 1905]]

The music of New Orleans had a profound effect on the creation of early jazz. In New Orleans, slaves could practice practice elements of their culture such as voodoo and playing drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/music/musichistory/jazzbirthplace.html |title=Birthplace of Jazz |website=www.neworleansonline.com|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many early jazz musicians played in the bars and brothels of the red-light district around Basin Street called [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=47, 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to dance bands, there were marching bands which played at lavish funerals (later called [[jazz funeral]]s). The instruments used by marching bands and dance bands became the instruments of jazz: brass, drums, and reeds tuned in the European 12-tone scale. Small bands contained a combination of self-taught and formally educated musicians, many from the funeral procession tradition. These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south. Beginning in 1914, [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] and African-American musicians played in [[vaudeville]] shows which carried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U.S.&lt;ref name=creoleorch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/creole.html|title=Original Creole Orchestra|accessdate=October 23, 2007|publisher=The Red Hot Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Orleans, a white bandleader named [[Papa Jack Laine]] integrated blacks and whites in his marching band. He was known as "the father of white jazz" because of the many top players he employed, such as including [[George Brunies]], [[Sharkey Bonano]], and future members of the [[Original Dixieland Jass Band]]. During the early 1900s, jazz was mostly done in African-American and [[mulatto]] communities due to segregation laws. Storyville brought jazz to a wider audience through tourists who visited the port city of New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/jazz/learn/historyculture/jazz-map.htm|title=Jazz Neighborhoods }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many jazz musicians from African-American communities were hired to perform in bars and brothels. These included [[Buddy Bolden]] and [[Jelly Roll Morton]] in addition to those from other communities, such as [[Lorenzo Tio]] and [[Alcide Nunez]]. [[Louis Armstrong]] started his career in Storyville&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storyvillelife.com/eksempel-side/ |title=The characters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found success in Chicago Storyville was shut down by the U.S. government in 1917.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.wm.edu/americanstudies/370/2001/sp3/legend_of_storyville.htm |title=The Legend of Storyville |date=6 May 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506062223/http://web.wm.edu/americanstudies/370/2001/sp3/legend_of_storyville.htm |archivedate=May 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syncopation====

Cornetist Buddy Bolden played in New Orleans from 1895 to 1906. No recordings by him exist. His band is credited with creating the big four: the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/classroom/rhythmicinnovations.htm |title=Marsalis, Wynton (2000: DVD n.1).

Afro-Creole pianist Jelly Roll Morton began his career in Storyville. Beginning in 1904, he toured with vaudeville shows to southern cities, Chicago, and New York City. In 1905, he composed "[[Jelly Roll Blues]]", which became the first jazz arrangement in print when it was published in 1915. In introduced more musicians to the New Orleans style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=38, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton considered the tresillo/habanera, which he called the [[Spanish tinge]], an essential ingredient of jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm 1979. ''The Latin Tinge: The impact of Latin American music on the United States''. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now in one of my earliest tunes, "New Orleans Blues," you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can't manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

An excerpt of "New Orleans Blues" is shown below. In the excerpt, the left hand plays the tresillo rhythm, while the right hand plays variations on cinquillo.

Morton was a crucial innovator in the evolution from the early jazz form known as ragtime to [[jazz piano]], and could perform pieces in either style; in 1938, Morton made a series of recordings for the Library of Congress in which he demonstrated the difference between the two styles. Morton's solos, however, were still close to ragtime, and were not merely improvisations over chord changes as in later jazz, but his use of the blues was of equal importance.

(2000: 61). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th edn.&lt;/ref&gt; Swing is the most important and enduring African-based rhythmic technique used in jazz. An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is: "if you don't feel it, you'll never know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music'' states that swing is: "An intangible rhythmic momentum in jazz...Swing defies analysis; claims to its presence may inspire arguments." The dictionary does nonetheless provide the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat contrasted with duple subdivisions:&lt;ref&gt;''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1986: 818).&lt;/ref&gt; swing superimposes six subdivisions of the beat over a basic pulse structure or four subdivisions. This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in African-American music than in Afro-Caribbean music. One aspect of swing, which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics, places strokes in-between the triple and duple-pulse "grids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenwood |first1=David Peñalosa; Peter|last2=collaborator|last3=editor|title=The Clave Matrix: Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins |date=2009 |publisher=Bembe Books |location=Redway, CA |isbn=978-1886502802 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Orleans brass bands are a lasting influence, contributing horn players to the world of professional jazz with the distinct sound of the city whilst helping black children escape poverty. The leader of New Orleans' [[Camelia Brass Band]], D'Jalma Ganier, taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet; Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing, and then expand it. Like Jelly Roll Morton, Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime's stiffness in favor of swung notes. Armstrong, perhaps more than any other musician, codified the rhythmic technique of swing in jazz and broadened the jazz solo vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gridley |first1=Mark C. |title=Jazz Styles: History &amp; Analysis |date=2000 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0130212276 |pages=72–73 |edition=7th |url=http://www.biblio.com/9780130212276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regions===
In the northeastern United States, a "hot" style of playing ragtime had developed, notably [[James Reese Europe]]'s symphonic [[Clef Club]] orchestra in New York City, which played a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in 1912.&lt;ref name=hellfighters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/hellfighters.html|title=Jim Europe's 369th Infantry "Hellfighters" Band|accessdate=October 24, 2007|author=Floyd Levin|year=1911|publisher=The Red Hot Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baltimore rag style of [[Eubie Blake]] influenced [[James P.

In Ohio and elsewhere in the midwest the major influence was ragtime, until about 1919. Around 1912, when the four-string banjo and saxophone came in, musicians began to improvise the melody line, but the harmony and rhythm remained unchanged. A contemporary account states that blues could only be heard in jazz in the gut-bucket cabarets, which were generally looked down upon by the Black middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1968: 67).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1920 to 1933, [[Prohibition in the United States]] banned the sale of alcoholic drinks, resulting in illicit speakeasies which became lively venues of the "Jazz Age", hosting popular music, dance songs, novelty songs, and show tunes. Jazz began to get a reputation as immoral, and many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old cultural values by promoting the decadent values of the Roaring 20s. [[Henry van Dyke]] of Princeton University wrote, "... it is not music at all. It's merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion."&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears, but the villagers had used pots and pans; another story claimed that the fatal heart attack of a celebrated conductor was caused by jazz.&lt;ref name="ward"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Geoffrey C. |last2=Burns |first2=Ken |title=Jazz: A History of America's Music |year=2002 |publisher=Alfred A.

In 1919, [[Kid Ory]]'s Original Creole Jazz Band of musicians from New Orleans began playing in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where in 1922 they became the first black jazz band of New Orleans origin to make recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/ory.html|title=Kid Ory|accessdate=October 29, 2007| publisher=The Red Hot Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, [[Bessie Smith]] made her first recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/bessie.html|title=Bessie Smith|accessdate=October 29, 2007| publisher=The Red Hot Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was developing "[[Hot Jazz]]", and [[Joe "King" Oliver|King Oliver]] joined [[Bill Johnson (double-bassist)|Bill Johnson]]. Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.

Despite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco. He signed a contract with [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white component, hiring white musicians such as [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], and [[Joe Venuti]]. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. [[Olin Downes]], reviewing the concert in ''The New York Times'', wrote, "This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form. ... His first theme ... is no mere dance-tune ... it is an idea, or several ideas, correlated and combined in varying and contrasting rhythms that immediately intrigue the listener."&lt;ref name="Downes"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Downes |first1=Olin |title=A Concert of Jazz |work=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1924 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Whiteman's band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, including [[Fred Waring]], [[Jean Goldkette]], and [[Nathaniel Shilkret]]. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a "rhetoric of domestication" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read "white") a previously inchoate (read "black") kind of music.&lt;ref name="Dunkel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=Mario |title=W. C. Handy, Abbe Niles, and (Auto)biographical Positioning in the Whiteman Era |journal=Popular Music and Society |date=2015 |volume=38:2 |pages=122–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louis_Armstrong_restored.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louis Armstrong]] began his career in New Orleans and became one of jazz's most recognizable performers.]]

Whiteman's success caused blacks to follow suit, including [[Earl Hines]] (who opened in The Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago in 1928), [[Duke Ellington]] (who opened at the [[Cotton Club]] in Harlem in 1927), [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Claude Hopkins]], and [[Don Redman]], with Henderson and Redman developing the "talking to one another" formula for "hot" Swing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=82–83, 100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as featured soloist. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young [[Coleman Hawkins]]), sounded "stiff, stodgy," with "jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of "Mandy, Make Up Your Mind" by [[George W. Meyer]] and Arthur Johnston (top), compared with Armstrong's solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schuller|1968|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong's solos were a significant factor in making jazz a true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson's group, Armstrong formed his [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five|Hot Five]] band, where he popularized [[scat singing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooke|1999|pp=56–59, 78–79, 66–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swing in the 1920s and 1930s===
{{Main|Swing music|1930s in jazz}}
[[File:BennyGoodmanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|left|Benny Goodman (1943)]]

The 1930s belonged to popular [[swing (music)|swing]] big bands, in which some virtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing the "big" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers [[Count Basie]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Jimmy Dorsey|Jimmy]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Harry James]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Artie Shaw]]. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to "solo" and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex "important" music.

Over time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist [[Teddy Wilson]], vibraphonist [[Lionel Hampton]] and guitarist [[Charlie Christian]] to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]] marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as "jumping the blues" or [[jump blues]] used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on [[boogie woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] from the 1930s.

===The influence of Duke Ellington===
[[File:Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club (1943)]]

While swing was reaching the height of its popularity, [[Duke Ellington]] spent the late 1920s and 1930s developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and [[musical form]] with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became [[hit single|hits]], and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van de Leur |first=Walter |chapter=12 "Seldom seen, but always heard": Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington |title=The Cambridge Companion to Duke Ellington |editor-last=Green |editor-first=Edward |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=1316194132 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellington called his music "American Music" rather than jazz and liked to describe those who impressed him as "beyond category."&lt;ref name="Tucker-1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes "He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music. He claimed there were only two types of music, 'good' and 'bad' ... And he embraced a phrase coined by his colleague Billy Strayhorn – 'beyond category' – as a liberating principle."&lt;/ref&gt; These included many musicians from his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most popular jazz orchestras in the history of jazz. He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals, such as "Jeep's Blues" for [[Johnny Hodges]], "Concerto for Cootie" for [[Cootie Williams]] (which later became "[[Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me]]" with [[Bob Russell (songwriter)|Bob Russell]]'s lyrics), and "The Mooche" for [[Tricky Sam Nanton]] and [[Bubber Miley]]. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as [[Juan Tizol]]'s "[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]" and "[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]", which brought the "Spanish Tinge" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |title=Jazz Musicians – Duke Ellington |publisher=Theory Jazz |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233432/http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html |archivedate=September 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings of European jazz===
As only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], who visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences' interest in jazz, as well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Wynn |editor-first1=Neil A.|title=Cross the Water Blues: African American music in Europe |date=2007 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1604735468 |page=67 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period.

British jazz began with a [[Original Dixieland Jass Band#London tour|tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919]]. In 1926, [[Fred Elizalde]] and His Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras, and jazz instrumentalists became numerous.&lt;ref name="Godolt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Godbolt |first1=Jim |title=A History of Jazz in Britain 1919–1950 |date=2010 |publisher=Northway |location=London |isbn=978-0955788819 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This style entered full swing in France with the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]], which began in 1934. Much of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well-trained; in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since his style was also a fusion of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson | first=Jeffrey |title=Making Jazz French: The Reception of Jazz Music in Paris, 1927-1934 |journal=French Historical Studies | year=2002 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=149–170 |doi=10.1215/00161071-25-1-149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] popularized [[gypsy jazz]], a mix of 1930s American swing, French dance hall "[[Bal-musette|musette]]", and Eastern European folk with a languid, seductive feel; the main instruments were steel stringed guitar, violin, and double bass. Solos pass from one player to another as guitar and bass form the rhythm section. Some researchers believe [[Eddie Lang]] and [[Joe Venuti]] pioneered the guitar-violin partnership characteristic of the genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/edlango.html|title=Ed Lang and his Orchestra |accessdate=March 28, 2008 |website=redhotjazz.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was brought to France after they had been heard live or on [[Okeh Records]] in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Crow |title=Jazz Anecdotes |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war jazz ==
{{see also|1940s in jazz|1950s in jazz|1960s in jazz|1970s in jazz}}
The outbreak of [[World War II]] marked a turning point for jazz. The swing-era jazz of the previous decade had challenged other popular music as being representative of the nation's culture, with big bands reaching the height of the style's success by the early 1940s; swing acts and big bands traveled with U.S. military overseas to Europe, where it also became popular.&lt;ref name="Burchett"/&gt; Stateside, however, the war presented difficulties for the big-band format: conscription shortened the number of musicians available; the military's need for [[shellac]] (commonly used for pressing [[gramophone records]]) limited record production; a shortage of rubber (also due to the war effort) discouraged bands from touring via road travel; and a demand by the musicians' union for a commercial recording ban limited music distribution between 1942 and 1944.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Mark|last2=Jackson|first2=Travis|year=2015|title=Jazz: Grove Music Essentials|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0190268719|chapter=7. Traditional and Modern Jazz in the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the big bands who were deprived of experienced musicians because of the war effort began to enlist young players who were below the age for conscription, as was the case with saxophonist [[Stan Getz]]'s entry in a band as a teenager.&lt;ref name="Trynka"/&gt; This coincided with a nationwide resurgence in the Dixieland style of pre-swing jazz; performers such as clarinetist [[George Lewis (clarinetist)|George Lewis]], cornetist [[Bill Davison]], and trombonist [[Turk Murphy]] were hailed by conservative jazz critics as more authentic than the big bands.&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; Elsewhere, with the limitations on recording, small groups of young musicians developed a more uptempo, improvisational style of jazz,&lt;ref name="Burchett"/&gt; collaborating and experimenting with new ideas for melodic development, rhythmic language, and [[harmonic substitution]], during informal, late-night jam sessions hosted in small clubs and apartments. Key figures in this development were largely based in New York and included pianists [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Bud Powell]], drummers [[Max Roach]] and [[Kenny Clarke]], saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]], and trumpeter [[Dizzy Gillespie]].&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; This musical development became known as [[bebop]].&lt;ref name="Burchett"/&gt;

Bebop and subsequent post-war jazz developments featured [[Bebop scale|a wider set of notes]], played in more complex [[Melodic pattern|patterns]] and at faster tempos than previous jazz.&lt;ref name="Trynka"&gt;{{cite book|pages=45, 48–49|last=Trynka|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Trynka|title=The Sax &amp; Brass Book|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2003|isbn=0879307374}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Clive James]], bebop was "the post-war musical development which tried to ensure that jazz would no longer be the spontaneous sound of joy ... Students of race relations in America are generally agreed that the exponents of post-war jazz were determined, with good reason, to present themselves as challenging artists rather than tame entertainers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Clive|authorlink=Clive James|page=163|title=Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts|publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]]|year=2007|isbn=0393061167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the war marked "a revival of the spirit of experimentation and musical pluralism under which it had been conceived", along with "the beginning of a decline in the popularity of jazz music in America", according to American academic Michael H. Burchett.&lt;ref name="Burchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchett|first=Michael H.|year=2015|editor-last=Ciment|editor-first=James|title=Postwar America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317462351|chapter=Jazz|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of bebop and the end of the swing era after the war, jazz lost its cachet as [[pop music]]. Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers; these included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Dick Haymes]], and [[Doris Day]].&lt;ref name="Trynka"/&gt; Older musicians who still performed their pre-war jazz, such as Armstrong and Ellington, were gradually viewed in the mainstream as passé. Other younger performers, such as singer [[Big Joe Turner]] and saxophonist [[Louis Jordan]], who were discouraged by bebop's increasing complexity pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, [[jump blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Burchett"/&gt; Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable songs for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences' purview. "The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences", Burchett said. "The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its artistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz."&lt;ref name="Burchett"/&gt; During its swing period, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to [[Paul Trynka]], this changed in the post-war years:

{{quote|Suddenly jazz was no longer straightforward. There was bebop and its variants, there was the last gasp of swing, there were strange new brews like the [[progressive jazz]] of [[Stan Kenton]], and there was a completely new phenomenon called revivalism – the rediscovery of jazz from the past, either on old records or performed live by ageing players brought out of retirement. From now on it was no good saying that you liked jazz, you had to specify what kind of jazz. And that it the way it has been ever since, only more so. Today, the word 'jazz' is virtually meaningless without further definition.&lt;ref name="Trynka"/&gt;}}

===Bebop===
{{Main|Bebop}}
{{See also|List of bebop musicians}}
In the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music." The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]], pianists [[Bud Powell]] and [[Thelonious Monk]], trumpeters [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Clifford Brown]], and drummer [[Max Roach]]. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.

Composer [[Gunther Schuller]] wrote, "In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Schuller November 14, 1972. Dance, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dizzy Gillespie wrote. "People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.&lt;ref&gt;Dance p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the [[ride cymbal]] was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Samuel A. 1995"&gt;Floyd, Samuel A., Jr. (1995). ''The Power of Black Music: Interpreting its history from Africa to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; bebop also uses "passing" chords, [[substitute chord]]s, and [[altered chord]]s. New forms of [[chromaticism]] and [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant [[tritone]] (or "flatted fifth") interval became the "most important interval of bebop"&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book'', 1981, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era songs and reused with a new and more complex melody and/or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but often infused with ii-V motion) and 'rhythm changes' (I-VI-ii-V) – the chords to the 1930s pop standard "[[I Got Rhythm]]." Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.

The harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing "Cherokee" at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. "I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used...and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it...I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive."&lt;ref name="Kubik"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kubik |first1=Gerhard |title=Bebop: A Case in Point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices |journal=Black Music Research Journal |date=22 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Kubik]] postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|African-related tonal sensibilities]] rather than 20th-century Western classical music. "Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices."&lt;ref name="Kubik" /&gt;

Samuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Samuel A. 1995"/&gt; Kubik wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;While for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western "serious" music, from [[Claude Debussy]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to [[African-American music]] several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions&lt;ref&gt;Kubik (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed filled with "racing, nervous phrases".&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.

===Afro-Cuban jazz (cu-bop)===
{{Main|Afro-Cuban jazz}}
[[File:Machito and his sister Graciella Grillo.jpg|thumb|upright|Machito (maracas) and his sister Graciella Grillo (claves)]]

====Machito and Mario Bauza====
The general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was "Tanga" (1943), composed by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauza]] and recorded by [[Machito]] and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. "Tanga" began as a spontaneous [[descarga]] (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.&lt;ref&gt;In 1992 Bauza recorded "Tanga" in the expanded form of an Afro-Cuban suite, consisting of five movements. ''Mario Bauza and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra''. Messidor CD (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the birth of [[Afro-Cuban jazz]]. The use of clave brought the African ''timeline'', or ''[[bell pattern|key pattern]]'', into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African [[cross beat|cross-rhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peñalosa|2010|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic "one" is always understood to be "one". If the progression begins on the "three-side" of clave, it is said to be in ''3-2 clave'' (shown below). If the progression begins on the "two-side", its in ''2-3 clave''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peñalosa|2010|pp=131–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo====
[[File:Dizzy Gillespie playing horn 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Dizzy Gillespie, 1955]]
[[Mario Bauzá]] introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer [[Chano Pozo]]. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. "[[Manteca (song)|Manteca]]" (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal [[guajeo]]s (Afro-Cuban [[ostinato]]s) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: "If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Dizzy Gillespie, with Al|title=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie|year=1985|publisher=Da Capo Press| location=New York|isbn=978-0306802362|page=77|title-link=To Be or Not to Bop: Memoirs of Dizzy Gillespie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge gave "Manteca" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal "Tanga" of a few years earlier.

Gillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, ''cu-bop'' also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of "Manteca", "[[A Night in Tunisia]]", "Tin Tin Deo", and "[[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|On Green Dolphin Street]]".

====African cross-rhythm====
[[File:Mongo Santamaria 1969.JPG|thumb|upright|Mongo Santamaria (1969)]]
Cuban percussionist [[Mongo Santamaria]] first recorded his composition "[[Afro Blue]]" in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;"Afro Blue", ''Afro Roots'' (Mongo Santamaria) Prestige CD 24018-2 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
"Afro Blue" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) [[cross-rhythm]], or [[hemiola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peñalosa|2010|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of {{music|time|12|8}}, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2).

The following example shows the original [[ostinato]] "Afro Blue" bass line. The cross noteheads indicate the main [[Beat music|beats]] (not bass notes).

    \new Staff &lt;&lt;
       \new voice \relative c {

           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g4. g g g }
       }
   &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

When [[John Coltrane]] covered "Afro Blue" in 1963, he inverted the metric hierarchy, interpreting the tune as a {{music|time|3|4}} [[jazz waltz]] with duple cross-beats superimposed (2:3). Originally a B{{music|flat}} [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of "Afro Blue."

Perhaps the most respected [[Afro-cuban jazz]] combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist [[Cal Tjader]]'s band. Tjader had [[Mongo Santamaria]], [[Armando Peraza]], and [[Willie Bobo]] on his early recording dates.

===Dixieland revival===
In the late 1940s, there was a revival of [[Dixieland]], harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as [[Bob Crosby]]'s Bobcats, [[Max Kaminsky (musician)|Max Kaminsky]], [[Eddie Condon]], and [[Wild Bill Davison]].&lt;ref name="Collier, 1978"&gt;Collier, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the [[Lu Watters]] band, [[Conrad Janis]], and [[Ward Kimball]] and his [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]] Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.&lt;ref name="Collier, 1978"/&gt;

===Cool jazz and West Coast jazz===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{main|Cool jazz}}
[[File:JATP 1955.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Jazz at the Philharmonic announcement, 1956]]

In 1944, jazz impresario [[Norman Granz]] organized the first [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] concert in Los Angeles, which helped make a star of [[Nat "King" Cole]] and [[Les Paul]]. In 1946, he founded [[Clef Records|Clef]], discovering Canadian jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]] in 1949 and merging Clef with his new label [[Verve Records|Verve]] in 1956, which advanced the career of [[Ella Fitzgerald]].

By the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was replaced with a tendency toward calm and smoothness with the sounds of [[cool jazz]], which favored long, linear melodic lines. It emerged in New York City and dominated jazz in the first half of the 1950s. The starting point an album of 1949 and 1950 singles released as the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (1957) by a nonet led by [[Miles Davis]]. Cool jazz recordings by musicians such as [[Chet Baker]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Stan Getz]], the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], and [[Gerry Mulligan]] usually had a lighter sound that avoided the aggressive tempos and harmonic abstraction of bebop.

Cool jazz became strongly identified with [[West Coast jazz]] as exemplified by Chet Baker, [[Mel Tormé]], and [[Anita O'Day]]. But it also resonated in Europe, especially Scandinavia, where baritone saxophonist [[Lars Gullin]] and pianist [[Bengt Hallberg]] emerged. The theoretical underpinnings of cool jazz were laid out by the Chicago pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], and its influence stretches into  the development of [[bossa nova]], [[modal jazz]], and free jazz.

===Hard bop===
{{Main|Hard bop}}
Hard bop is an extension of bebop (or "bop") music which incorporates influences from blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel, especially in saxophone and piano playing. Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. Miles Davis' 1954 performance of "Walkin'" at the first [[Newport Jazz Festival]] announced the style to the jazz world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natambu|first1=Kofi|title=Miles Davis: A New Revolution in Sound|journal=Black Renaissance/Renaissance Noire |date=2014|volume=2|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quintet Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, led by [[Art Blakey|Blakey]] and featuring pianist [[Horace Silver]] and trumpeter [[Clifford Brown]], were leaders in the hard bop movement with Davis.

===Modal jazz===
{{Main|Modal jazz}}
Modal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given [[chord progression]], but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale),"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained pianist [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]].

The modal theory stems from a work by [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, ''Kind of Blue'' was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yudkin|first1=Jeremy|title=The Naming of Names: "Flamenco Sketches" or "All Blues"? Identifying the Last Two Tracks on Miles Davis's Classic Album Kind of Blue|journal=Musical Quarterly|date=2012|volume=95|issue=1|pages=15–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I didn't write out the music for ''Kind of Blue'', but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,"&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Miles (1989: 234). ''The Autobiography''. New York: Touchstone.&lt;/ref&gt; recalled Davis. The track "So What" has only two chords: [[dominant seventh chord|D-7]] and E{{music|b}}-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other innovators in this style include [[Jackie McLean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litweiler|1984|pp=120–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two of the musicians who had also played on ''Kind of Blue'': John Coltrane and Bill Evans.

By the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz had been using modes for at least a decade, as much of it borrowed from Cuban popular dance forms which are structured around multiple ostinatos with only a few chords. A case in point is [[Mario Bauza]]'s "Tanga" (1943), the first Afro-Cuban jazz piece. Machito's Afro-Cubans recorded modal tunes in the 1940s, featuring jazz soloists such as [[Howard McGhee]], [[Brew Moore]], Charlie Parker, and [[Flip Phillips]]. However, there is no evidence that Davis or other mainstream jazz musicians were influenced by the use of modes in Afro-Cuban jazz, or other branches of [[Latin jazz]].{{clarify|those soloists played, but were not influenced? Or the other way round?|date=October 2013}}

===Free jazz===
{{Main|Free jazz}}
[[File:John Coltrane 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|John Coltrane, 1963]]
Free jazz, and the related form of [[avant-garde jazz]], broke through into an open space of "free tonality" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of [[world music]] from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Berendt. ''The Jazz Book''. 1981. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist [[Charles Mingus]] is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.

The first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of [[Ornette Coleman]] (whose 1960 album ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation]]'' coined the term) and [[Cecil Taylor]]. In the 1960s, exponents included [[Albert Ayler]], [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Don Cherry]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]], [[Steve Lacy]], [[Michael Mantler]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Roswell Rudd]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Tchicai]]. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist [[Gary Peacock]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]], a rhythm section honed with [[Cecil Taylor]] as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic ''Chasin' the 'Trane'', which ''Down Beat'' magazine panned as "anti-jazz". On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new [[Impulse! Records]] in 1960 and turning it into "the house that Trane built", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably [[Archie Shepp]], who often played with trumpeter [[Bill Dixon]], who organized the 4-day "October Revolution in Jazz" in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.

A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], utilization of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's [[sheets of sound]]. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom.  The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'' and ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'' (both June 1965), ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'' (July 1965), ''[[Sun Ship]]'' (August 1965), and ''[[First Meditations]]'' (September 1965).

In June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. [[Dave Liebman]] later called it "the torch that lit the free jazz thing.".  After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965.  While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.

====Free jazz in Europe====
[[File:Peter-broetzmann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Peter Brötzmann]] is a key figure in European free jazz.]]

Free jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, [[Steve Lacy]], and [[Eric Dolphy]] spent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as [[Michael Mantler]] and [[John Tchicai]] traveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand. European contemporary jazz was shaped by [[Peter Broetzmann]], [[John Surman]], [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Zbigniew Namysłowski]], [[Tomasz Stanko]], [[Lars Gullin]], [[Joe Harriott]], [[Albert Mangelsdorff]], [[Kenny Wheeler]], [[Graham Collier]], [[Michael Garrick]] and [[Mike Westbrook]]. They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage.

Since the 1960s, creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. Following the work of drummer [[Han Bennink]] and pianist [[Misha Mengelberg]], musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form (melody, rhythm, a famous song) is found  Jazz critic [[Kevin Whitehead]] documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book ''New Dutch Swing''. Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism. British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Stuart |title=Is Jazz Dead? Or Has it Moved to a New Address? |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin jazz===
{{Main|Latin jazz}}
Latin jazz is the term used to describe jazz which employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be Afro-Latin jazz, as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] and Brazilian jazz.

In the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as "Latin tunes", with no distinction between a Cuban [[son montuno]] and a Brazilian [[bossa nova]]. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley's ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a "Latin bass figure."&lt;ref&gt;Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 444). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban [[tumbao]] while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as "Manteca", "On Green Dolphin Street" and "Song for My Father" have a "Latin" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth "Latin" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like [[Cal Tjader]] tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of "A Night in Tunisia", pianist [[Vince Guaraldi]] soloed through the entire form over an authentic [[mambo (music)|mambo]].&lt;ref&gt;Tjader, Cal (1959). ''Monterey Concerts''. Prestige CD. ASIN: B000000ZCY.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Afro-Cuban jazz====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{Main|Afro-Cuban jazz}}
Afro-Cuban jazz often uses Afro-Cuban instruments such as [[conga]]s, [[timbales]], [[güiro]], and [[claves]], combined with piano, double bass, etc. Afro-Cuban jazz began with Machito's Afro-Cubans in the early 1940s, but took off and entered the mainstream in the late 1940s when bebop musicians such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Billy Taylor]] began experimenting with Cuban rhythms. [[Mongo Santamaria]] and [[Cal Tjader]] further refined the genre in the late 1950s.

Although a great deal of Cuban-based Latin jazz is modal, Latin jazz is not always modal: it can be as harmonically expansive as post-bop jazz. For example, [[Tito Puente]] recorded an arrangement of "Giant Steps" done to an Afro-Cuban [[guaguancó]]. A Latin jazz piece may momentarily contract harmonically, as in the case of a percussion solo over a one or two-chord piano guajeo.

=====Guajeos=====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[Guajeo]] is the name for the typical Afro-Cuban ostinato melodies which are commonly used motifs in Latin jazz compositions. They originated in the genre known as [[son (music)|son]]. Guajeos provide a rhythmic and melodic framework that may be varied within certain parameters, whilst still maintaining a repetitive – and thus "danceable" – structure. Most guajeos are rhythmically based on [[clave (rhythm)]].

Guajeos are one of the most important elements of the vocabulary of Afro-Cuban [[descarga]] (jazz-inspired instrumental jams), providing a means of tension and resolution and a sense of forward momentum, within a relatively simple harmonic structure. The use of multiple, contrapuntal guajeos in Latin jazz facilitates simultaneous collective improvisation based on theme variation. In a way, this polyphonic texture is reminiscent of the original New Orleans style of jazz.

=====Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance=====
For most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both [[salsa (music)|salsa]] dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass).&lt;ref&gt;Andy Gonzalez interviewed by Larry Birnbaum. Ed. Boggs, Vernon W. (1992: 297–298). ''Salsiology; Afro-Cuban Music and the Evolution of Salsa in New York City''. New York: Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0-313-28468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1974–1976, they were members of one of [[Eddie Palmieri]]'s most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.

This occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba&lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo (2003). ''Cubano Be, Cubano Bop: One Hundred Years of Jazz in Cuba'', p. 59. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books. {{ISBN|1-58834-147-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Cuban band of this new wave was [[Irakere]]. Their "Chékere-son" (1976) introduced a style of "Cubanized" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker's composition "Billie's Bounce", jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Kevin (2007) "History and Discography of Irakere". [http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/history-and-discography-of-irakere ''Timba.com''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as [[timba]].

====Afro-Brazilian jazz====
[[File:Naná Vasconcelos.jpg|thumb|upright|Naná Vasconcelos playing the Afro-Brazilian [[Berimbau]]]]

Brazilian jazz such as [[bossa nova]] is derived from [[samba]], with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related term jazz-samba describes an adaptation of street samba into jazz.

The bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians [[João Gilberto]] and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]] and was made popular by [[Elizete Cardoso]]'s recording of "[[Chega de Saudade]]" on the ''[[Canção do Amor Demais]]'' LP. Gilberto's initial releases, and the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', achieved significant popularity in [[Latin America]]; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by [[Charlie Byrd]] and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova's popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963's ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'', numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.

Brazilian percussionists such as [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Naná Vasconcelos]] also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yanow|first=Scott|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p36965/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Airto Moreira|publisher=AllMusic|date=August 5, 1941|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6300/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Robert|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6DF123BF93BA15755C0A964948260|title=Jazz Festival – A Study Of Folk-Jazz Fusion – Review|publisher=''New York Times''|date=1982-06-28|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-bop===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{Main|Post-bop}}
[[File:Bill Evans.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Bill Evans at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] with [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]] on bass and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums, July 13, 1978]]
Post-bop jazz is a form of small-combo jazz derived from earlier bop styles. The genre's origins lie in seminal work by John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Bill Evans, Charles Mingus, [[Wayne Shorter]], and [[Herbie Hancock]]. Generally, the term post-bop is taken to mean jazz from the mid-sixties onwards that assimilates influences from [[hard bop]], [[modal jazz]], the [[avant-garde jazz|avant-garde]] and free jazz, without necessarily being immediately identifiable as any of the above.

Much post-bop was recorded for [[Blue Note Records]]. Key albums include ''[[Speak No Evil]]'' by Shorter; ''[[The Real McCoy (album)|The Real McCoy]]'' by [[McCoy Tyner]]; ''[[Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)|Maiden Voyage]]'' by Hancock; ''[[Miles Smiles]]'' by Davis; and ''[[Search for the New Land]]'' by [[Lee Morgan]] (an artist who is not typically associated with the post-bop genre). Most post-bop artists worked in other genres as well, with a particularly strong overlap with the earlier [[hard bop]].

===Soul jazz===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{Main|Soul jazz}}
Soul jazz was a development of [[hard bop]] which incorporated strong influences from [[blues]], [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[rhythm and blues]] to create music for small groups, often the [[organ trio]] of [[Hammond organ]], drummer and tenor saxophonist. Unlike [[hard bop]], soul jazz generally emphasized repetitive [[Groove (music)|grooves]] and melodic hooks, and [[improvisation]]s were often less complex than in other jazz styles. It often had a steadier "funk" style groove, which was different from the swing rhythms typical of much hard bop.

[[Horace Silver]] had a large influence on the soul jazz style, with songs that used funky and often [[Gospel music|gospel]]-based piano [[Vamp (music)|vamps]]. Important soul jazz organists included [[Jimmy McGriff]], [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] and [[Johnny Hammond Smith]], and influential tenor [[saxophone]] players included [[Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]].

===African-inspired===
[[File:Randy Weston.jpg|thumb|upright|Randy Weston]]

====Themes====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
There was a resurgence of interest in jazz and other forms of African-American cultural expression during the [[Black Arts Movement]] and [[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] period of the 1960s and 1970s. African themes became popular, and many new jazz compositions were given African-related titles: "Black Nile" ([[Wayne Shorter]]), "Blue Nile" ([[Alice Coltrane]]), "Obirin African" ([[Art Blakey]]), "Zambia" ([[Lee Morgan]]), "Appointment in Ghana" ([[Jackie McLean]]), "Marabi" ([[Cannonball Adderley]]), "Yoruba" ([[Hubert Laws]]), and many more. Pianist [[Randy Weston]]'s music incorporated African elements, such as in the large-scale suite "Uhuru Africa" (with the participation of poet [[Langston Hughes]]) and "Highlife: Music From the New African Nations." Both Weston and saxophonist [[Stanley Turrentine]] covered the Nigerian [[Bobby Benson]]'s piece "Niger Mambo", which features Afro-Caribbean and jazz elements within a West African [[Highlife]] style. Some musicians, including [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Hubert Laws]], and [[Wayne Shorter]], began using African instruments such as [[kalimbas]], bells, beaded [[gourds]] and other instruments which were not traditional to jazz.

====Rhythm====
During this period, there was an increased use of the typical African 12/8 [[cross beat|cross-rhythmic]] structure in jazz. [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "Succotash" on ''[[Inventions and Dimensions]]'' (1963) is an open-ended modal {{music|time|12|8}} improvised jam, in which Hancock's pattern of attack-points, rather than the pattern of pitches, is the primary focus of his improvisations, accompanied by [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, percussionist Osvaldo Martinez playing a traditional Afro-Cuban chekeré part and [[Willie Bobo]] playing an [[Abakuá]] bell pattern on a snare drum with brushes.

The first [[jazz standard]] composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African {{music|time|12|8}} cross-rhythm was [[Wayne Shorter]]'s "[[Footprints (composition)|Footprints]]" (1967).&lt;ref&gt;"Footprints" ''Miles Smiles'' (Miles Davis). Columbia CD (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; On the version recorded on ''Miles Smiles'' by [[Miles Davis]], the bass switches to a {{music|time|4|4}} [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] figure at 2:20. "Footprints" is not, however, a [[Latin jazz]] tune: African rhythmic structures are accessed directly by [[Ron Carter]] (bass) and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] (drums) via the rhythmic sensibilities of [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]. Throughout the piece, the four beats, whether sounded or not, are maintained as the temporal referent. The following example shows the {{music|time|12|8}} and {{music|time|4|4}} forms of the bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main [[beat music|beats]] (not bass notes), where one ordinarily taps their foot to "keep time."

       } &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt; }
&lt;/score&gt;

====Pentatonic scales====
The use of [[pentatonic scale]]s was another trend associated with Africa. The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of ''pentatonic'' song composition, often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter, but with notable off-beat accents ... reaches back perhaps thousands of years to early West African sorgum agriculturalists—Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 95). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McCoy Tyner]] perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos,&lt;ref&gt;Gridley, Mark C. (2000: 270). ''Jazz Styles: History and Analysis'', 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Map showing distribution of harmony in Africa. Jones, A.M. (1959). ''Studies in African Music.'' Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by [[Joe Henderson]] on [[Horace Silver]]'s "African Queen" (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levine|1995|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz pianist, theorist, and educator [[Mark Levine (musician)|Mark Levine]] refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the ''V pentatonic scale''.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Mark (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''. Petaluma, CA: Sher Music. ASIN: B004532DEE&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:I IV V pentatonic.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|C pentatonic scale beginning on the I (C pentatonic), IV (F pentatonic), and V (G pentatonic) steps of the scale.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}&lt;!--the text above says the fifth step of a pentatonic scale, but this shows the fifth step of the C major diatonic scale--&gt;]]

Levine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II-V-I jazz progression.&lt;ref&gt;Levine (1989: 127).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis' "Tune Up." The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II-V-I progression.&lt;ref&gt;After Mark Levine (1989: 127). ''The Jazz Piano Book''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:II V I.tiff|thumb|center|upright=2.05|V pentatonic scale over II-V-I chord progression.]]

Accordingly, John Coltrane's "[[Giant Steps]]" (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied [[Nicolas Slonimsky]]'s ''Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns'', which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of "Giant Steps".&lt;ref&gt;Bair, Jeff (2003: 5).

===Jazz fusion===
{{Main|Jazz fusion}}
[[File:Miles Davis 24.jpg|thumb|right|Fusion trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] in 1989]]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.

According to [[AllMusic]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with [[hard bop]] and did not want to play strictly [[free jazz|avant-garde music]], the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore: Fusion|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Miles Davis' new directions====
In 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer [[Teo Macero]], this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of [[ambient music]].

As Davis recalls:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The music I was really listening to in 1968 was [[James Brown]], the great guitar player [[Jimi Hendrix]], and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, "[[Dance to the Music (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Dance to the Music]]", [[Sly and the Family Stone]] ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded ''In a Silent Way'' I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Miles, with Quincy Troupe (1989: 298) ''The Autobiography''. New York: Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two contributors to ''In a Silent Way'' also joined organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]] to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: [[Emergency! (album)|''Emergency!'']] by [[The Tony Williams Lifetime]].

====Psychedelic-jazz====

=====Herbie Hancock=====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Pianist Herbie Hancock (a Davis alumnus) released four albums in the short-lived (1970–1973) psychedelic-jazz subgenre: ''[[Mwandishi]]'' (1972), ''[[Crossings (Herbie Hancock album)|Crossings]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]'' (1973). The rhythmic background was a mix of rock, funk, and African-type textures.

Musicians who had previously worked with Davis formed the four most influential fusion groups: [[Weather Report]] and [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] emerged in 1971 and were soon followed by [[Return to Forever]] and [[The Headhunters]].

=====Weather Report=====
[[Weather Report]]'s self-titled electronic and psychedelic ''[[Weather Report (1971 album)|Weather Report]]'' debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group's members (including percussionist [[Airto Moreira]]), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing [[soprano saxophone]], and with no [[synthesizer]]s involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which [[Joe Zawinul]] and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favour of continuous rhythm and movement – but took the music further. To emphasise the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece "Milky Way", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedalled the instrument. ''[[Down Beat]]'' described the album as "music beyond category", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls that year.

[[Weather Report]]'s subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.&lt;ref&gt;Dan, Morgenstern (1971). ''Down Beat'' May 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jazz-rock====
Although some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, [[Distortion (music)|"fuzz" pedals]], [[wah-wah pedal]]s and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, [[Eddie Harris]], keyboardists [[Joe Zawinul]], [[Chick Corea]], and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]], drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)]], violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], guitarists [[Larry Coryell]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], and [[Frank Zappa]], saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]]. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band [[Casiopea]] released over thirty fusion albums.

According to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, "just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same" with albums such as Williams' ''[[Emergency! (album)|Emergency!]]'' (1970) and Davis' ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975), which Nicholson said "suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before." This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre "mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio" at the end of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=614|last1=Harrison|first1=Max|last2=Thacker|first2=Eric|last3=Nicholson|first3=Stuart|title=The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism|year=2000|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=978-0720118223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz-funk===
{{Main|Jazz-funk}}
By the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong [[beat (music)|back beat]] ([[Groove (music)|groove]]), electrified sounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |title=Free Jazz-Funk Music: Album, Track and Artist Charts |accessdate=2010-11-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920131709/http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}, ''Rhapsody Online&amp;nbsp;— Rhapsody.com'' (October 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and, often, the presence of electronic [[analog synthesizers]]. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican [[reggae]], notably Kingston bandleader [[Sonny Bradshaw]]. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong [[Musical improvisation#Jazz improvisation|jazz improvisation]] to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz [[riff]]s and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |title=Explore: Jazz-Funk |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019041451/http://allmusic.com/explore/style/d202 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples are Herbie Hancock's [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]] band and Miles Davis' ''[[On the Corner]]'' album, which, in 1972, began Davis' foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for [[rock and roll|rock]] and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the [[timbre]]s of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the ''[[musique concrète]]'' approach that Davis and producer [[Teo Macero]] had begun to explore in the late 1960s.

===Traditionalism in the 1980s===
{{main|1980s in jazz}}
[[File:Wynton Marsalis 2009 09 13.jpg|thumb|right|Wynton Marsalis]]

The 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]] emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]], as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]]); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.

For example, several musicians who had been prominent in the [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including [[Chick Corea]] and [[Herbie Hancock]]. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, [[Bill Evans]], [[Joe Henderson]], and [[Stan Getz]]. Even the 1980s music of [[Miles Davis]], although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognisably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.

The emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians' groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of [[Betty Carter]] and [[The Jazz Messengers|Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers]] retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as [[hard bop]] and [[bebop]]. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as [[Valery Ponomarev]] and [[Bobby Watson]], [[Dennis Irwin]] and [[James Williams (musician)|James Williams]].
In the 1980s, in addition to [[Wynton Marsalis|Wynton]] and [[Branford Marsalis]], the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as [[Donald Brown (musician)|Donald Brown]], [[Mulgrew Miller]], and later, Benny Green, bassists such as [[Charles Fambrough]], [[Lonnie Plaxico]] (and later, [[Peter Washington]] and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as [[Bill Pierce (saxophonist)|Bill Pierce]], [[Donald Harrison]] and later [[Javon Jackson]] and [[Terence Blanchard]] emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in the 1990s and 2000s.

The young Jazz Messengers' contemporaries, including [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Marcus Roberts]], [[Wallace Roney]] and [[Mark Whitfield]] were also influenced by [[Wynton Marsalis]]'s emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and early recordings of the first [[Miles Davis]] quintet. This group of "Young Lions" sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.&lt;ref name="Guilliatt, Richard"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Guilliatt |first1=Richard |title=Jazz: The Young Lions' Roar |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-13/entertainment/ca-1495_1_lincoln-center-jazz-orchestra|website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=14 January 2018 |date=13 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Betty Carter]]'s rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni [[Benny Green (pianist)|Benny Green]], [[Branford Marsalis]] and [[Ralph Peterson Jr.]], as well as [[Kenny Washington (musician)|Kenny Washington]], [[Lewis Nash]], [[Curtis Lundy]], [[Cyrus Chestnut]], [[Mark Shim]], [[Craig Handy]], Greg Hutchinson and [[Marc Cary]], [[Taurus Mateen]] and [[Geri Allen]].

[[Out of the Blue (American band)|O.T.B.]] ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as [[Kenny Garrett]], [[Steve Wilson (jazz musician)|Steve Wilson]], [[Kenny Davis (musician)|Kenny Davis]], [[Renee Rosnes]], [[Ralph Peterson Jr.]], [[Billy Drummond]], and [[Robert Hurst (musician)|Robert Hurst]].&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott |title=Out of the Blue |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/out-of-the-blue-mn0000419825/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar reaction{{Vague|date=January 2018}} took place against free jazz. According to [[Ted Gioia]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. [[Cecil Taylor]] played duets in concert with [[Mary Lou Williams]], and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or [[Don Pullen]] may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/jazz-blog/2008/2/27/where-did-our-revolution-go-part-three |title=Where Did Our Revolution Go?

Pianist [[Keith Jarrett]]—whose bands of the 1970s had played only original compositions with prominent free jazz elements—established his so-called 'Standards Trio' in 1983, which, although also occasionally exploring collective improvisation, has primarily performed and recorded jazz standards. Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.

In 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative [[John Conyers Jr.]] to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating "jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated." It passed in the House on September 23, 1987 and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.&lt;ref name=HR57&gt;HR-57 Center [http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html HR-57 Center for the Preservation of Jazz and Blues, with the six-point mandate.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918100538/http://www.hr57.org/hconres57.html |date=2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smooth jazz===
{{Main|Smooth jazz}}
[[File:David Sanborn 2008 2.jpg|thumb|upright|David Sanborn, 2008]]

In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called "pop fusion" or "smooth jazz" became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in "[[quiet storm]]" time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including [[Al Jarreau]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Sade Adu|Sade]], as well as saxophonists including [[Grover Washington Jr.]], [[Kenny G]], [[Kirk Whalum]], [[Boney James]], and [[David Sanborn]]. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90–105 [[beats per minute]]), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and [[legato]] electric guitar are popular).

In his ''[[Newsweek]]'' article "The Problem With Jazz Criticism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion: The Problem With Jazz Criticism|author=Stanley Crouch|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/58477|website=Newsweek|date=June 5, 2003|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Crouch]] considers Miles Davis' playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz. Critic Aaron J. West has countered the often negative perceptions of smooth jazz, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc9722/|title=Caught Between Jazz and Pop: The Contested Origins, Criticism, Performance Practice, and Reception of Smooth Jazz|website=Digital.library.unt.edu|date=October 23, 2010|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Acid jazz, nu jazz and jazz rap===

[[Acid jazz]] developed in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by [[jazz-funk]] and [[electronic music|electronic dance music]]. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including [[Sampling (music)]] or a live DJ cutting and [[scratching]]), but it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic considers [[Roy Ayers]] "one of the prophets of acid jazz."&lt;ref name="Ginell"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ginell |first1=Richard S. |title=Roy Ayers |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-ayers-mn0000345168/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nu jazz]] is influenced by jazz harmony and melodies, and there are usually no improvisational aspects. It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz [[house music|house]] (as exemplified by [[Saint Germain (musician)|St Germain]], [[Jazzanova]], and [[Fila Brazillia]]) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, [[The Cinematic Orchestra]], [[Kobol (band)|Kobol]] and the Norwegian "future jazz" style pioneered by [[Bugge Wesseltoft]], [[Jaga Jazzist]], and [[Nils Petter Molvær]]).

[[Jazz rap]] developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into [[hip hop]]. In 1988, [[Gang Starr]] released the debut single "Words I Manifest", which sampled [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s 1962 "Night in Tunisia", and [[Stetsasonic]] released "Talkin' All That Jazz", which sampled [[Lonnie Liston Smith]]. Gang Starr's debut LP ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'' (1989) and their 1990 track "Jazz Thing" sampled [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Ramsey Lewis]]. The groups which made up the [[Native Tongues Posse]] tended toward jazzy releases: these include the [[Jungle Brothers]]' debut ''[[Straight Out the Jungle]]'' (1988), and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Low End Theory]]'' (1991). Rap duo [[Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth]] incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut ''[[Mecca and the Soul Brother]]''. Rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s [[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1|Jazzmatazz]] series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.

Although jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer [[Easy Mo Bee]]. Davis' ex-bandmate [[Herbie Hancock]] also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album ''[[Dis Is Da Drum]]'' in 1994.

===Punk jazz and jazzcore===
[[File:John Zorn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Zorn]] performing in 2006]]
The relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with [[post-punk]] in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz. In London, [[the Pop Group]] began to mix free jazz and dub reggae into their brand of punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Lang, ''Perfect Sound Forever'', February 1999. {{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/Perfect/popgroup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420123739/http://www.furious.com/perfect/popgroup.html |archivedate=1999-04-20 |df= }} Access date: November 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, [[No Wave]] took direct inspiration from both free jazz and punk. Examples of this style include [[Lydia Lunch]]'s ''Queen of Siam'',&lt;ref name=bangs&gt;Bangs, Lester. "Free Jazz / Punk Rock". ''Musician Magazine'', 1979. [http://www.notbored.org/bangs.html] Access date: July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Gray, the work of [[James Chance and the Contortions]] (who mixed [[Soul music|Soul]] with free jazz and [[punk rock|punk]])&lt;ref name=bangs/&gt; and the [[Lounge Lizards]]&lt;ref name=bangs/&gt; (the first group to call themselves "[[punk jazz]]").

[[John Zorn]] took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock, and incorporated this into free jazz with the release of the ''[[Spy vs Spy (album)|Spy vs. Spy]]'' album in 1986, a collection of [[Ornette Coleman]] tunes done in the contemporary [[thrashcore]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/~goblin/8zorn.html |title="House Of Zorn", Goblin Archives, at |website=Sonic.net |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019024244/http://sonic.net/~goblin/8zorn.html |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Sonny Sharrock]], [[Peter Brötzmann]], [[Bill Laswell]], and [[Ronald Shannon Jackson]] recorded the first album under the name [[Last Exit (free jazz band)|Last Exit]], a similarly aggressive blend of thrash and free jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveears.com/asp/reviews.asp?albumID=4193&amp;bhcp=1 |title=Progressive Ears Album Reviews |website=Progressiveears.com |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145159/http://www.progressiveears.com/asp/reviews.asp?albumID=4193&amp;bhcp=1 |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These developments are the origins of ''jazzcore'', the fusion of free jazz with [[hardcore punk]].

===M-Base===
{{Main| M-Base}}
[[File:Steve Coleman 1611.JPG|thumb|Steve Coleman in Paris, July 2004]]
The [[M-Base]] movement started in the 1980s, when a loose collective of young African-American musicians in New York which included [[Steve Coleman]], [[Greg Osby]], and [[Gary Thomas (musician)|Gary Thomas]] developed a complex but grooving&lt;ref&gt;"... circular and highly complex polymetric patterns which preserve their danceable character of popular Funk-rhythms despite their internal complexity and asymmetries ..." (Musicologist and musician Ekkehard Jost, Sozialgeschichte des Jazz, 2003, p. 377)&lt;/ref&gt; sound.

In the 1990s, most M-Base participants turned to more conventional music, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued developing his music in accordance with the M-Base concept.&lt;ref name="allaboutjazz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=5820|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805045312/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=5820|dead-url=no|archive-date=2010-08-05|title=All About Jazz|first=All About|last=Jazz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman's audience decreased, but his music and concepts influenced many musicians, according to pianist Vijay Iver and critic Ben Ratlifff of ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Larry|title=A Saxophonist's Reverberant Sound|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703302604575294532527380178|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=11 June 2010|quote=It's hard to overstate [Coleman's] influence. He's affected more than one generation, as much as anyone since John Coltrane ... It's not just that you can connect the dots by playing seven or 11 beats.

He has contributed an equal amount to the history of the music. He deserves to be placed in the pantheon of pioneering artists." (Source: Larry Blumenfeld, ''A Saxophonist's Reverberant Sound'', June 11, 2010, ''The Wall Street Journal'') In September 2014, Coleman was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship (a.k.a.

===1990s–present===
Since the 1990s, jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates, but rather a wide range of styles and genres are popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[The Bad Plus]] have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists [[Greg Osby]] and [[Charles Gayle]], while others, such as [[James Carter (musician)|James Carter]], have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.

[[Harry Connick Jr.]] began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was ten years old.&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=John|title=Harry Connick, Jr|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-connick-jr-mn0000949259/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist [[Ellis Marsalis Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]].&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{Cite episode| title =Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr.| series =Finding Your Roots| first =Henry| last =Louis Gates Jr. (host)| network =PBS| date =July 17, 2010| season =1| number =1|type=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', which sold over two million copies.&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt; Crossover success has also been achieved by [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], and [[Jamie Cullum]].

A number of players who usually perform in largely [[straight-ahead jazz|straight-ahead]] settings have emerged since the 1990s, including pianists [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]] and [[Vijay Iyer]], guitarist [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]], vibraphonist [[Stefon Harris]], trumpeters [[Roy Hargrove]] and [[Terence Blanchard]], saxophonists [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] and [[Joshua Redman]], clarinetist [[Ken Peplowski]] and bassist [[Christian McBride]].

Although [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include [[Pat Metheny]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]], [[John Scofield]] and the Swedish group [[Esbjörn Svensson Trio|e.s.t.]] Since the beginning of the 90s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that didn't necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Stuart. “Jazztronica: A Brief History of the Future of Jazz.” JazzTimes, 3 Jan. 2003, jazztimes.com/features/jazztronica-a-brief-history-of-the-future-of-jazz/.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Squarepusher]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Flying Lotus]] and sub genres like [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], Drum n' Bass, Jungle and [[Techno]] ended up incorporating a lot of these elements.&lt;ref&gt;Kalouti, Noor, et al. “6 Genre-Bending Artists Fusing Jazz with Electronic Music – Soundfly.” Soundfly, 11 July 2016, flypaper.soundfly.com/discovery/nu-jazz-6-artists-fuse-jazz-electronic-music/&lt;/ref&gt;  Squarepusher being cited as one big influence for jazz performers drummer [[Mark Guiliana]] and pianist [[Brad Mehldau]], showing the correlations between jazz and electronic music are a two way street.&lt;ref&gt; Larkin, Cormac. “Who Can Keep up with Mark Guiliana?” The Irish Times, The Irish Times, 13 Oct. 2015, http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/who-can-keep-up-with-mark-guiliana-1.2385618. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Ken Burns]]'s documentary ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' was premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], featuring [[Wynton Marsalis]] and other experts reviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time. It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.

The mid-2010s have seen an increasing influence of R&amp;B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, [[Kendrick Lamar]] released his third studio album, ''[[To Pimp a Butterfly]]''. The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]]&lt;ref name="booklet"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=To Pimp a Butterfly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits |publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist [[Kamasi Washington]] released his nearly three-hour long debut, ''[[The Epic (album)|The Epic]]''. Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&amp;B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Russell Warfield|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/18781/reviews/4148955|title=The Epic|website=drownedinsound.com|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet.

Another internet-aided trend of 2010's jazz is that of extreme [[reharmonization]], inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as [[Art Tatum]], as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans. Supergroup [[Snarky Puppy]] has adopted this trend and has allowed for players like [[Cory Henry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Hochman|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhochman/2018/05/15/grammy-winning-keyboardist-cory-henry-on-inspiration-and-funky-improvisation/#72e76b0738ce|title=Grammy-Winning Keyboardist Cory Henry On Inspiration And Funky Improvisation|date=May 15, 2018|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing. [[YouTube]] phenomenon [[Jacob Collier]] also gained recognition for his ability to play an incredibly large number of instruments and his ability to use [[microtones]], advanced polyrhythms, and blend a spectrum of genres in his largely homemade production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Bailey|url=http://www.afr.com/lifestyle/arts-and-entertainment/music/jacob-collier-review-youtuber-gets-gen-y-into-jazz-20180501-h0zhx1|title=Jacob Collier review: Youtuber gets Gen Y into jazz|date=May 1, 2018|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Dieter Wassmann''' (1841–1898) is a fictitious artist and sewerage engineer, purportedly from [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]], in east-central [[Germany]]. He is the creation of the American-born artist and writer [[Jeff Wassmann]].  As a result of the widespread dissemination of his work, Johann Dieter Wassmann is sometimes mistakenly cited as a lesser-known figure among late-19th-century European artists; he is most often identified as an early purveyor of the [[Dada]] and [[Surrealist]] movements and has become closely associated with several notable artists of the first half of the 20th century, including [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Eugène Atget]] and [[Joseph Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;Negrini, Paolo.

==Overview==
According to his fictitious biography, Johann Dieter Wassmann was born in Leipzig, where he witnessed the [[industrial revolution]] rapidly alter the once agrarian, guild-based and perhaps idealized [[Electorate of Saxony]]. In portraying his character as fearful of a less humanitarian world—ill at ease with the changing roles of science, medicine, religion, education, [[cosmology]] and time—the artist challenges the viewer to share in the conflicts and anxieties of this ubiquitous thinker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wassmannfoundation.com/ Wassmann Foundation]  Retrieved October 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A pivotal event in the author's narrative is [[Napoleon]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] (1813), recalled first-hand by the character's father.  The artist uses Napoleon's rise metaphorically to represent the onslaught of the modern era and his defeat at Leipzig as hope all was not lost of the [[Romantic era]].

The construction of Johann Dieter Wassmann trades heavily on the aesthetic philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s notion of [[suspension of disbelief]] to justify the use of certain fantastic or non-realistic elements. Coleridge asserts that if the author can bring a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader/viewer will withhold judgement on any improbability that might normally render the story doubtful, a contention the artist is reliant on for his audience to fully engage.&lt;ref&gt;Tomko, Michael. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/vic/summary/v049/49.2tomko.html "Politics, Performance, and Coleridge's 'Suspension of Disbelief',"] ''Victorian Studies'', Volume 49, Number 2, Winter 2007.  Retrieved October 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a sewerage engineer, we see Johann Dieter Wassmann participate in the development of a more modern and scientific approach to the control of [[infectious disease]] in cities including [[Hanover]], [[Göteborg]], [[Dresden]], [[Mexico City]] and [[Sydney]]. As a lecturer at the [[University of Leipzig]], we experience him prompting students to fully explore the creative process, concerned as he is at the decline of [[liberal education]]. But Wassmann's lasting legacy is found in his private devotion to his art.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley.

==Biography==
[[File:Arteriae Pelvis, Abdomimis, et Pectoris, 1883 F.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Johann Dieter Wassmann (Jeff Wassmann), ''Arteriae Pelvis, Abdomimis, et Pectoris, 1883'' (2002), 70 x 55.5 x 8 cm.]]

Johann Dieter Wassmann is born into a long line of carpenters on April 2, 1841, the son of August and Maria Wassmann.  The youngest of five children to survive into adulthood, he is brought up in the [[Lutheran]] creed.  After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolutions of 1848]], the family flees from Leipzig to [[Weimar]].  A bout with [[rheumatic fever]] forces Johann to delay the start of his schooling until the age of eight.  As a cabinetmaker in Weimar, his father's clients soon include [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Franz Liszt]], among others, in what becomes a [[Grand Tour]] through 19th-century Germany's music, art, literary and academic elites.&lt;ref&gt;Stombock, M. [http://www.wassmannfoundation.com/section03print.htm "A Carpenter's Tale"] MuseumZeitraum Leipzig. Retrieved October 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Johann goes on to attend the University of Leipzig before joining an engineering practice, specializing in the emerging field of [[Sewage|sewerage management]].&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, H. [http://www.sewerhistory.org/articles/whregion/germany/Seeger.pdf  "The history of German waste water treatment,"]  ''European Water Management'', Volume 2, Number 5, 1999,  pp. 51-56. Retrieved October 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 34 he is offered a teaching post in Leipzig.  In 1881, six years into his post, Johann sets out to challenge his engineering students through construction of boxed assemblage works enigmatically addressing medical and scientific themes that he feels go unresolved through traditional lecture practices.  After an extended display at a [[Dresden]] clinic, they become known as the "Dresden Boxes."  These works build on the tradition of German [[wunderkammern]] and 17th-century Dutch perspective boxes, but display a stripped down aesthetic, precise, but refined.

Through his extensive travels in his private practice, Johann is exposed to the best and worst 19th-century urban development has to offer.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, S. (et al). [http://www.sewerhistory.org/articles/whregion/copenhagen/0010007.pdf  "Historical overview of the Copenhagen sewerage system,"] ''Water Practice &amp; Technology'', Volume 1, Number 1. Retrieved October 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  His growing angst at what he sees as the encroachment of modernity causes him to begin a second, more personal series of boxes, escaping into a romanticized view of a pre-modern Saxony, much of it set in the ancient wood of [[Goethe]] and amidst the hopeful spectre of the American [[Transcendentalist]] authors [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].  By this point Johann is comfortably married with three children, so the intent of this second stage of boxes is largely private: they are mostly shared with family.

In September 1889, an academic conference in [[Potsdam]] brings Johann together with the physicist [[Max Planck]] in what results in a seismic shift in Johann's thinking.  From here onwards he outright rejects his boxed works of recent years, brandishing them reactionary and "[[Biedermeier]]," before moving on to a third and final phase of work, the start of his "early Modern" period.

Johann comes to realize his angst is born not in the [[modernity]] of the 19th century, but in the earlier reaches of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] he was so recently praising.  As the Newtonian perception of a clockwork universe merges with the force of [[social Darwinism]] he recognizes that the rising mantra of "progress" has now split the world into two distinct entities: time and space.  If he is to return to a unified field of time and space he knows his only choice is not to look back, but to move forward into the modern—into the unknown.

Planck is presenting a paper at the conference on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], the subject of his recent doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html "Max Planck - Biographical Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901-1921,"] Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1967. Retrieved October 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first to call himself a [[Theoretical physicist|"theoretical" physicist]], Planck opens his lecture in Potsdam with the revelation that, "My original decision to devote myself to science was a direct result of the discovery... that the laws of human reasoning coincide with the laws governing the sequences of the impressions we receive from the world around us; that, therefore, pure reasoning can enable man to gain an insight into the mechanism of the world."  He concludes by expressing a belief that physical laws allow him to presuppose that the "... outside world is something independent from man, something absolute, and the quest for the laws which apply to this absolute appeared... as the most sublime pursuit in life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?page=mplanck&amp;project=planck "Who was Max Planck?"] European Space Agency. Retrieved October 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Planck, Johann discovers a friend and colleague dedicated to the pursuit of a non-Newtonian world-view in which the linear nature of [[absolute time and space]] will dissolve into one of a multidimensional universe free of the strictures of past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Minkowski, Hermann|year=1909|title=[[s:de:Raum und Zeit (Minkowski)|Raum und Zeit]]|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|volume=10|pages=75–88}}
*Various English translations on Wikisource: [[s:Space and Time|Space and Time]].&lt;/ref&gt; Johann's remaining years will be spent expressing these early modern notions through his beloved boxes and an emerging interest in photography.

Planck soon introduces Johann to the writings of [[Ernst Mach]], particularly ''Analysis of Sensations'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst. [https://archive.org/details/analysisofsensat00mach ''The Analysis of Sensations'' (1886)], William, C.M. (trans.), Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Company, 1914.  Retrieved October 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here Johann finds Mach arguing that all knowledge is derived from sensation.  Mach credits his philosophical awakening to reading, at age fifteen, his father's copy of [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] ''[[Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. [https://archive.org/details/kantsprolegomen00carugoog ''Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics'' (1783)], Carus, Dr. Paul (trans.), Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Company, 1912. Retrieved October 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  "The book made at the time a powerful and ineffaceable impression upon me, the like of which I never afterwards experienced in any of my philosophical reading. Some two or three years later the superfluity of the role played by “the thing in itself” abruptly dawned upon me. On a bright summer day in the open air, the world with my ego suddenly appeared to me as one coherent mass of sensations, only more strongly coherent in the ego. Although the actual working out of this thought did not occur until a later period, yet this moment was decisive for my whole view."&lt;ref&gt;Pojman, Paul. [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/ernst-mach "Ernst Mach"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Retrieved October 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

All scientific investigation is a result of the experience, or "sensation," of the observer, Mach argues—later a determining factor in the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]].  But in the more immediate term, Mach has laid the groundwork for [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[History of special relativity|special theory of relativity]], published in 1905.

Much like [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] fictional 1920s character [[Leonard Zelig]], Johann Dieter Wassmann finds himself caught up in this cacophony of ideas, theories and movements, allowing him to take an active part in one of the great revolutions of the modern era.

Amongst the cacophony is the advent of photography.  Throughout the 1890s, Johann continues to expand the visual vocabulary of his assemblage works, but he also begins to experiment with the latent image, using both a bulky glass-plate [[view camera]], as well as several of the newly developed hand-held roll-film cameras. Over an eight-year period he documents the landscapes, streetscapes, architecture and interiors of eastern Germany, in a style that extends beyond the topographic traditions of the day. These photographic works provide the missing link between the meticulous, but still largely prescriptive street imagery of mid-19th-century photographer [[Charles Marville]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael.

Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Johann discreetly anticipates what vast potential the photographic arts holds for the coming age.

Until the modern era catches up with him, that is.  On January 6, 1898, Johann slips on ice while boarding a tram in Leipzig; his right leg is crushed, requiring amputation. He dies of a streptococcal infection on March 18, 1898, two weeks shy of his 57th birthday.

The vast trove of artworks Johann has amassed travels to [[Washington, D.C.]] with family members in 1910, but remains in storage through two wars with Germany.  Only in 1969 is the [[Wassmann Foundation]] established, with the works slowly coming to prominence in the years since.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, S. [http://www.wassmannfoundation.com/section04print.htm  "Bleeding Napoleon-The Art of Johann Dieter Wassmann"] Wassmann Foundation. Retrieved October 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

This elaborate fiction allows Johann Dieter Wassmann to escape the conceptual and physical boundaries of the art of his time, making him a pioneer of German modernism, his work emerging as a long lost precursor to the modern art methods and movements we now know as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[collage]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].

==Historical perspective==
[[File:Dasein (Being), 1897 F.jpg|thumb|250px|Johann Dieter Wassmann (Jeff Wassmann), ''Dasein (Being), 1897'', (2003). 48 x 26 x 7 cm.]]

Johann Dieter Wassmann is part of a long history of artistic pseudonyms and hoaxes. [[Rrose Sélavy]] was just one of the pseudonyms used by the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Fair, S.S. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/travel/tmagazine/25TALK-ZURICH.html "Gaga for Dada,"] ''New York Times'', September 25, 2005.  Retrieved September 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jeff Wassmann's adopted home of Australia, [[Ern Malley]] was the creation of writers [[James McAuley]] and [[Harold Stewart]]. The 1944 Ern Malley affair, as it is known, remains Australia's most celebrated literary hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Peter.

Retrieved September 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, the artist [[Walid Raad]] began constructing elaborate fictions chronicling the contemporary history of his native Lebanon, signing his work The Atlas Group and presenting it as a body of collective scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/04/arts/design/04chan.html  "Mixing Fact and Fiction to Open Up Larger Reality,'] ''New York Times'', March 4, 2006. Retrieved September 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, a New York-based art collective known as the [[Bruce High Quality Foundation]] has seen considerable critical and commercial success.  In November 2013, a silkscreen by these anonymous artists, "Hooverville," depicting the New York skyline with hobos, was auctioned for $425,000 at [[Sotheby's]] New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/nov-2013-contemporary-evening-n09037/lot.2.html Sotheby's sale, 13 November 2013] Sotheby's. Retrieved September 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an artistic intervention known as [[culture jamming]], Wassmann has also intertwined his work with contemporary literary conceits.  In 2006, [[Rohan Kriwaczek]] created a sensation with his publication of ''[[An Incomplete History of the Art of the Funerary Violin]]'' ([[Overlook Press]]), which purported to trace the lost history of the funerary violin. Shortly before publication, the book was exposed to the ''[[New York Times]]'' as a hoax by a book buyer at [[Prairie Lights]] Books in [[Iowa City, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, Julie.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/books/04viol.html "British Author Espies a Funerary Violin Vacuum and So Fills It,"]  ''New York Times'', October 4, 2006.  Retrieved October 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Wassmann stepped in to confuse matters further by using an additional character, a German curator, to defend Kriwaczek in online literary blogs and discussion pages, claiming that as a child in Leipzig, August Wassmann (the character's father) had known one of the funerary violinists Kriwaczek cites, further proof of the funerary violin. Wassmann had been sent an advance copy of the book by the owner of Prairie Lights Books, Jim Harris, allowing him to comment with apparent authority on the book's contents prior to publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theoverlookpress.blogspot.com/2006_10_01_archive.html "Tonight: McNally Robinson's, Halloween, Funerary Violin &amp; Rohan Kriwaczek,"] Overlook Press blog, October 31, 2006.  Retrieved October 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
The character of Johann Dieter Wassmann was launched under the supposed auspices of the fictitious Wassmann Foundation, Washington, D.C. in the solo exhibition ''Bleeding Napoleon'' at the [[Melbourne International Arts Festival]] 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/04/1064988452601.html "Best of the fest,"] ''Melbourne Age'', October 5, 2003.  Retrieved September 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the artist has created a rival institution vying to have the works of Johann Dieter Wassmann repatriated to Germany: MuseumZeitraum Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Blouin [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25977/early-modern-works-returning-to-germany/ "Early Modern Works Returning to Germany,"] ArtInfo, Nov. 1, 2007.  Retrieved October 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Johann Dieter Wassmann is best known through a long-running Google [[Adwords]] campaign in the ''New York Times''. The ads, with politically charged entendres such as ''The Wassmann Foundation - art &amp; philanthropy - forging a better tomorrow'', have received over nineteen million page-views in the newspaper's online Arts section. ''[[Art in America|Art in America's]]'' Washington, D.C. correspondent, James Mahoney, has written, {{cquote|Such visionaries as Herr Wassmann will not only endure, they will prevail, I'm more than certain.}}

As the Wassmann Foundation and related characters have evolved, the project has come to function on three distinct levels. Firstly, the artist endeavours to scrutinise the ever-increasing presence of artist, curator and art institution alike, as [[brand]]s. In establishing his own artist, curators and institutions as wholly fictitious, the contemporary artist is free to explore these roles as pure brand, existent for no other purpose than critical assessment.

Secondly, the artist argues that the unresolved angst of our current age is the culmination of the mistakes of modernity. We catch a glimpse of this angst, as expressed by the sewerage engineer protagonist, before losing clarity to the mounting failures of the 20th and now 21st-centuries, distorting our anxieties beyond recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Gideon (ed.), [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136961/how-we-got-here  "How We Got Here—The Rise of the Modern Order,"] ''Foreign Affairs'', January/February 2012.  Retrieved October 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, on a third level, the project points up a certain paradox created by the proliferation of the worldwide-web: in a mass society, the individual grows in importance, rather than diminishes.

For artists and individuals in what were formerly the planet's outer reaches, Wassmann has seen the web democratize access to the structures and machinations of power to an extent previously unimagined. He contends that little more than 25 years after the art world discovered there was an outside and a periphery, they suddenly find it is gone. In a [[postcolonial]]/internet age, there is only the center to be fought over and for the artist, the ensuing chaos to decipher. Where once the internet merely informed the political process, Wassmann has argued that the internet would, and now has developed the immense capability of wholly transforming political process. While projects such as Wassmann's function on a relatively benign level, he believes the realigned power structures they allude to allow individuals outside the arts to masterfully, and often frighteningly, alter the real world irretrievably.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Colorado]], Kevin has been a ventriloquist nearly all his life.  Kevin started ventriloquism when he was 9 years old, after his parents gave him a pull-string dummy for [[Christmas]].  Having no formal training, he taught himself the art of ventriloquism over a 4-year period.  He developed his technique from [[parrots]].  It intrigued him that parrots could speak so clearly without the use of lips.  Kevin later re-learned how to speak all together with the use of his tongue and his throat. Kevin was introduced to the stage by his grandfather Harley Noles, who performed magic shows throughout Colorado. He told Kevin, “If you get good enough, you can open for my show.” At the age of 13, he performed in his grandfather's show with a 5 minute act with a wooden puppet (Raymond), that his grandfather made for him.

During his college days, Johnson taught and entertained youth at a local church where he found a receptive audience for his humor.  Upon graduation from [[college]] in El Cajon, California, Johnson started performing at the [[San Diego Zoo]] in 1994. He then auditioned at [[Legoland California]] to pursue his art full-time, and in February 1999, Johnson got the spot and was performing three to four 20-minute shows each day at the Legoland Playtown Theater. Legoland California nominated him for the Big E Awards through IAAPA and won the honor of “Best Male Performer” in 2004 and 2006. Kevin is the only known performer to be recognized twice. IAAPA is the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, and includes attractions from over 90 countries.
 
Kevin is mostly recognized from his 2006 appearance on [[NBC]]’s primetime show ''[[America's Got Talent]]''. He performed his signature "[[Godzilla]] Theater" performance, during which his voice and the voices of his puppets are out of synchronization with their mouth movements. He had developed a different version of his performance specifically for the semi-finals, in which he also exchanges voices with his puppets and simulates echos, but didn't get enough audience votes to advance to the finals.

In February 2007, Kevin appeared on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] for the show's second "Ventriloquist Week". Starting in 2008, Johnson has started doing shows on board the [[Disney Cruise Line]] ship, "The Disney Magic." These shows last about 45 minutes and feature Clyde and Matilda, along with another puppet that is much more human like, whose name is Harley.
He has recently finished a nine-year run at San Diego’s Legoland California Theme Park where he performed 8,824 shows. He is currently performing during the Summer Nights at [[Busch Gardens Tampa]].Kevin also performs every Tuesday at the Lawrence Welk Resort in [[Escondido, California]], performing a 40 minute show alongside magician Anthony the Magic in a show entitled "The Comedy and Magic Show".
  
=== Clyde and Matilda ===
Clyde and Matilda are his signature puppets.  In 1983, Johnson was introduced to Clyde the [[Buzzard]] in his native state of Colorado, and performed his first "real" show with his grandfather. Nearly 10 years later, in 1991, Kevin was introduced to Matilda the [[Cockatoo]]. After adding Matilda to Clyde he performed as a trio.

==Family==
Johnson is married and lives in nearby [[Temecula, California|Temecula]] with his wife Cherie and their five children. Including the fabulous Cameron Johnson.

'''Les Légions Noires''' (also known as '''The Black Legions''' in English, or simply abbreviated to '''LLN''') was an avant-garde group of French underground [[black metal]] musicians and their bands, centered mostly around the city of [[Brest, France|Brest]], in [[Britanny]]. The bands involved limited their releases to very small numbers (often just enough to get to the other circle members), and distributed them among friends and close workers.

== History ==
Possibly the circle was formed in the late 1980s, early 1990s, in response to the supposed Norwegian "[[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Helvete and the 'Black Circle'|Black Metal Inner Circle]]". According to a 2005 series in ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine on the history of black metal, "A bunch of [[corpsepaint]]ed characters, rumoured to be drawn from such acts as [[Mütiilation]], Torgeist and [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]] named themselves the 'Black Legions' as a tribute to the so-called 'Black Mafia' Norwegian BM heroes [[Darkthrone]] and [[Burzum]], who were supposedly ready to terrorize Christians a couple of years before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Regarding their influences, Wlad Drakksteim of Vlad Tepes referred, in an interview with ''Petrified'' magazine, to [[Hellhammer]] and especially [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]: "Every True Black Metal Horde should play in old Bathory style."&lt;ref name=petrified&gt;{{cite journal

With Euronymous death MAYHEM is definitely dead and it's better like that as it will help Black Metal to return to darkness. [Euronymous] must be in peace now so I don't complain [lament?] him. And about Varg Vikernes (BURZUM) I don't have any opinion. WE have OUR opinions and he certainly knows them so..."&lt;ref name=kill_yourself&gt;{{cite journal

The best-known bands of the LLN are Mütiilation (the one-man band formed by [[William Roussel]], also known as Meyhna'ch), Belketre, Torgeist, and Vlad Tepes.

Vlad Tepes have been outspoken in the goals of their black metal: "We are Black Legions of Satan, we are the immortal warriors of Black imperial blood. We are here to pervert christian worms and they shall face the Black holocaust. It's near!"&lt;ref name=kill_yourself/&gt;

While none of the bands involved in Les Légions Noires released any new material from 1998 to 2014, Belketre released a new EP entitled ''Ryan Èvn-A'' in 2015. It is unclear if the bands were inactive during that time or simply preferred not to release their material to the public.

'''People who walk across [[Australia]]''' can walk from either of the [[Extreme points of Australia|geographical extremes]] of the continent, or from directly opposed cities on opposite shores. The western-most geographical extreme of Australia is [[Steep Point, Western Australia|Steep Point]], whereas the eastern-most extreme is [[Cape Byron]]. Similarly, the northern-most geographical extreme is [[Cape York Peninsula]], and the southern-most is the [[South East Cape]]. The distance between the east and west [[as the crow flies]] is {{convert|4030|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|3685|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south*. The western-most capital city in Australia is [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and the eastern-most capital city is [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]]. The northern-most city is [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and the southern to the southern-most city is [[Hobart]].

Walkers who choose to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] Australia can follow the [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]] for large sections of their journey. Of the people who have successfully circumambulated the continent, it took a range of 365–601 days to complete. Distances involved are in the vicinity of {{convert|14,300|km|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="circum1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Deborah DeWilliam's Town Itinerary|url=http://www.walkaroundoz.org.au/townitinerary.pdf|date=16 June 2004|accessdate=2011-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219053718/http://walkaroundoz.org.au/townitinerary.pdf|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to 17,000&amp;nbsp;km depending on the route taken.

Only six people are known to have completed solo unaccompanied circumnavigations, passing through all mainland states and territories, without a support vehicle. These include Aidan de Brune, Nobby Young, Colin Ricketts, Andrew 'Cad' Cadigan, Scott Loxely, Mike Pauly and Terra Roam.

===Robert Burke===
{{main|Robert O'Hara Burke}}

Robert O'Hara Burke was an Irish soldier and police officer, who achieved fame as an Australian explorer. He was the leader of the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]], which was the first expedition to cross Australia from south to north. The expedition left [[Melbourne]] on 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. Burke, along with William Wills, John King and Charley Gray, reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. Upon returning, the expedition was weakened by starvation and exposure, and was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Burke died at a place now called Burke's Waterhole on [[Cooper Creek]] in [[South Australia]]. The exact date of Burke's death is uncertain, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.&lt;ref name = "burke"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Robert O'Hara Burke (1820/1 - 1861)|url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Explorers/VEE_Officers/burke.htm|date=|accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Wills===
{{main|William John Wills}}

William Wills was a member of the famous [[Victorian Exploring Expedition]]. He was originally appointed as third-in-command, surveyor, astronomical and meteorological observer of the expedition in July 1860 on a salary of £300 a year. The expedition left [[Melbourne]] on 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. They reached Menindee on 16 October 1860 where Landells resigned following an argument with Burke, where Wills was promoted to second-in-command. Burke, along with William Wills, John King and Charley Gray, reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. Upon returning, the expedition was weakened by starvation and exposure, and was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Wills died alone at a place called Breerily Waterhole on Cooper Creek in South Australia while waiting for rescue. Burke died soon after. The exact date of their deaths is unknown, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.&lt;ref name = "wills1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=William John Wills (1834-1861)|url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Explorers/VEE_Officers/wills.htm|date=|accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John King===
{{main|John King (explorer)}}

John King was an Irish soldier who achieved fame as an Australian explorer. He was responsible for the welfare of the [[camels]] used during the [[Burke and Wills expedition]] who reached the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. King was the sole survivor of the four men of the expedition, and survived with the help of [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] until he was found on 15 September by [[Edwin James Welch|Edwin Welch]] - the surveyor in Alfred William Howitt's Victorian Contingent Party. King returned to [[Melbourne]] and was hailed as a hero. King never fully recovered from the expedition, and died prematurely of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] on 15 January 1872 aged 33.&lt;ref name = "king1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=John King (1838-1872)|url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Explorers/Expedition_Assistants/king.htm|date=|accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aidan De Brune===
{{main|Aidan de Brune}}
Aidan De Brune was a pseudonym of Herbert Charles Cull, who was born in London in 1874. He married in 1907, but in 1910 he left his wife and infant son Lionel, arriving in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], in October 1910. He travelled across to Sydney and worked for the Sydney Daily Mail.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Amateur Tramp&lt;/i&gt; by Colin Choat, {{ISBN|9780646989372}}, Project Gutenberg Australia, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=One day I wandered into Mr. Gay's offices and announced that I proposed to walk around Australia—and would he pay for articles on the trip? Mr. Gay was blunt. First he told me exactly how many kinds of fools I was to think of such a trip, then came to an agreement with business-like promptitude. Within a few hours I had gathered together what I thought necessary for an 11,000 miles trip, and had left Sydney. Two and a half years later I came to Sydney again, having in the meantime visited nearly every port on the extensive coastline. More to the point, I had proved possible a trip quite a number of Sydney wise-heads had declared to be sheer suicide. |author=Aidan De Brune|source=&lt;ref name="debrune1"&gt;{{Citation | author1=de Brune, Aidan | title=Record diary of a walk around Australia | publication-date=1924 | publisher=Aidan de Brune | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37494704 | accessdate=20 March 2018 }}

===Bob and Bill Mossel, Sue Thompson, Annabel Douglas-Hill and Sharka Dolak===

This walk was undertaken to raise funds for the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] and partly followed in the steps of the [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke &amp; Wills ''Victorian Exploring Expedition'']], camping at some of the Burke &amp; Wills expedition's dig trees. It is the first documented crossing of the Australian continent entirely by foot and first by a woman. A feature-length movie ''Feet Across Australia'' was shown on national television and attracted paying audiences at many venues in Australia. 1973 was a very wet season and mud was a major problem on the [[Birdsville Track]]. Food was buried along the route in advance, otherwise all equipment was carried by the 5 team members with a small handcart. A camel from [[Arkaroola|Arkaroola Sanctuary]] was briefly part of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theislanderonline.com.au/story/1723329/feet-across-australia-forty-years-on-from-a-four-month-trek/ |date=22 August 2013 |title=Feet across Australia: forty years on from a four-month trek |first=Catherine |last=Murphy |accessdate=26 February 2018 |newspaper=[[The Islander (Australian newspaper)|The Islander]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no support team accompanying the walkers.

===Dave Kunst===
{{main|Dave Kunst}}
Dave Kunst is the first person verified to have walked around the Earth. Kunst's trek began 20 June 1970 and ended 5 October 1974 (the dates in the table reflect his arrival and departure from Australia).&lt;ref name = "kunst1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=World Walk Travel Adventure|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~earthwalker1/|date=|accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "kunst2"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=This Day in History: American circumnavigates the globe on foot|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/american-circumnavigates-the-globe-on-foot|date=|accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their travels, the brothers collected donations to [[UNICEF]]. Unfortunately, John (Dave's brother who was also walking with him) was killed when bandits shot him in the mountains of [[Afghanistan]] in October 1972. Dave was also shot in the chest during the same attack, but survived by playing dead. After spending 4 months recovering from his injuries, Dave resumed his journey along with his brother Pete, from the spot where John was killed. As they continued their travels, Dave and Pete were denied access to the [[USSR]], so they flew from [[India]] to Australia. Pete returned home during the Australia-leg of the trek, where Dave continued on alone, by this time on his 3rd mule. Unfortunately, the mule died and Dave was left hauling his wagon of supplies himself. He was on the verge of abandoning his supplies, when he fortuitously met Jenni Samuel, a schoolteacher from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. She helped pull his wagon with her car, while he walked alongside. Dave returned to Australia for a year after completing his journey. Jenni and Dave later married and are still together as of 2008.

===Dennis Bartell===
Denis Bartell became the first person to walk across the [[Simpson Desert]] unassisted in 1984, whilst walking across Australia from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to [[Gulf St Vincent]].&lt;ref name=bartell1&gt;{{cite web|title=Desert Walker: Gulf to Gulf|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/desert-walker-gulf/clip1/|publisher=National Film and Sound Archive|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the 'French Line' - a route taken by the CGG surveyor Roy Elkins 21 years prior who also completed the walk but with the assistance of a support crew.&lt;ref name=bartell2&gt;{{cite web|title=Birdsville or Bust|url=http://www.simpsondesert.fl.net.au/birds/|publisher=Simpson Desert French Line|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his achievement, he was named the [[Australian Geographic Society Adventure Awards|Australian Geographic's Adventurer of the Year]] in 1995.&lt;ref name = "aotya"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=AG Society Adventure Awards|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/society/adventure-awards-ag-society.htm|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steven Newman===

He travelled south along "The Track" through Alice Springs, Coober Pedy, Adelaide, and on to Melbourne. He concluded in Melbourne on 20 June 1986, before proceeding onto [[Vancouver]] for his American leg of the journey.

Steven later published a book documenting his journey in 1989 called 'Worldwalk'. The handmade cart he used to cross the deserts was named 'Roo' and is currently on display at a museum in the USA. His backpack 'Clinger' and the tattered boots he wore across Australia were temporarily displayed in the [[Smithsonian]] after his record-setting solo walk around the world was completed. The 1989 [[Guinness Book of World Records]] has a large photo of Steve wearing his 'Clinger' and pulling the 'Roo' and in the Australian outback.

===Roger Scott===
Roger Scott departed from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] for [[Dover, Tasmania|Dover]] on 6 August 1988, raising funds for the Top End Life Education Centre and the NT Spastics Association.&lt;ref name=scott1&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott ready to trek|newspaper=NT News|page=3|date=4 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; He walked via Kununurra and Halls Creek, arriving at the [[Eyre Bird Observatory]] on the southern coast of South Australia on 22 September 1988 where he encountered [[Ffyona Campbell]] on her walk across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|1991|p=202.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then proceeded on to [[Adelaide]], before catching a flight to [[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]] and walking to Dover.

===Andrew Harper===
In 1999, Andrew Harper followed the Tropic of Capricorn from west to east accompanied by [http://www.capricornexpedition.com three camels to carry his supplies]. The desert sections of his journey represented pure desert travel as he did not follow any roads or tracks enabling him to keep as true to the TOC as possible. This included traverses of the Little Sandy, Gibson and Simpson Deserts. The expedition was a fundraising walk for the [http://www.flyingdoctor.net Royal Flying Doctor Service] and as recognition for his achievement, he was admitted as a Fellow to the [http://www.rgs.org Royal Geographical Society].

The first section was a 1,250km "warm up" lap around Tasmania carrying a backpack. The following 3 sections Terra pushed a custom built barrow she designed and named Dory, with a carrying capacity of 200L for the outback. When Terra reached the east coast she switched back to a backpack for the remaining distance to get away from roads and take the scenic tracks and paths through national parks, state forests and beaches. Not all her breaks were planned, when a truck driver tried running her down from behind on the Barkley Highway she took time off to recover from the trauma and adjusted her route to leave that region. When injuries to her feet and pelvic imbalance were beginning to cause blackouts she took a 6-month break for rehab and after a fall broke and dislocated her ankle only 900km from completing her lap she was forced to take another 6 months off. Longest walking day was 67km, outback average was 45km/day, east coast average was 20km/day. 20 pairs of shoes including 5 pairs of thongs for 2,500km because she couldn't afford shoes. Hottest day was 45'C, coldest night was -5'C, most water drunk in one day was 10L. Terra walked through 2 cyclones, 2 floods, an earthquake, fires, fly plague, heatwaves and a blizzard, faced death threats from a stalker, fought off a wild dog attack and survived attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/terraroam&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/terraroams&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://terraroamsearth.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5848">'''Mundane science fiction''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[hard science fiction]] which is characterized by its setting on Earth or within the [[solar system]], and a lack of [[interstellar travel]], [[intergalactic travel]] or human contact with [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].&lt;ref name=dwalter&gt;{{cite news |last=Walter |first=Damien |date=2 May 2008 |title=The really exciting science fiction is boring |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/02/thereallyexcitingsciencefi |newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mundane science fiction movement, inspired by an idea of [[Julian Todd]], was founded in 2004 during the [[Clarion workshop]] by novelist [[Geoff Ryman]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Geoff Ryman: The Mundane Fantastic: Interview excerpts | work = [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] | publisher = | date = January 2006 | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/01Ryman.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | title=How sci-fi moves with the times | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/7948058.stm | date= 18 March 2009 | newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs of the movement were later codified as the Mundane Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://orionmagazine.org/article/instead-of-suns-the-earth1/ | title=Instead of Suns, the Earth | first=Christopher | last =Cokinos | magazine=Orion Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ryman has contrasted mundane science fiction with most science fiction through the desire of teenagers to leave their parents' homes.&lt;ref name="thirdstar"&gt;"Take the Third Star on the Left and on til Morning" by Geoff Ryman, ''[[New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryman sees too much of regular science fiction being based on an "adolescent desire to run away from our world". However, Ryman notes that humans are not truly considered grown-up until they "create a new home of their own", which is what mundane science fiction aims to do.&lt;ref name="thirdstar"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Mundane science fiction focuses on stories set on or near the Earth, with a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; It rarely involves [[interstellar travel]] or communication with alien civilization. The genre's writers believe that [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drives]], the use of [[worm holes]], and other forms of [[faster-than-light]] travel are [[science fantasy|scientific fantasies]] rather than serious speculation about a possible future.  According to them, unfounded speculation about interstellar travel can lead to an illusion of a universe abundant with planets as hospitable to life as Earth, which encourages wasteful attitude to the abundance on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Controversial SciFi Realist Tells io9 Why Warp Drives Suck | website=io9 | first=Anders | last=Charlie Jane | date=14 December 2007 | url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/334172/controversial-scifi-realist-tells-io9-why-warp-drives-suck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have not uncovered any evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Although absence of evidence is not necessarily [[evidence of absence]], Mundane science fiction writers believe it's unlikely that [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien intelligence]] will overcome the physical constraints on interstellar travel any better than we can. As such, Mundane science fiction writers imagine a future on Earth and within the solar system and believe it's highly unlikely that intelligent life survives elsewhere in this [[solar system]].

Alternative universes, parallel worlds, magic and the supernatural, time travel and teleportation are similarly avoided in mundane science fiction.

==Publications==
In 2007 the magazine ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' devoted an issue to the subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ttapress.com/439/interzone-216-published-on-8th-may/ |title=Interzone 216 published on 8th May |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=3 May 2008 |publisher= TTA Press |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 short story collection ''When It Changed: Science Into Fiction'', edited by Ryman, is a collection of mundane science fiction stories, each written by a science fiction author with advice from a scientist, and with an endnote by that scientist explaining the plausibility of the story.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Material World (radio programme)|Material World]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 28 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the 1992 novel ''[[China Mountain Zhang]]'' noted that the story's world, while different, felt ordinary and believable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/15/books/science-fiction.html |title=Science Fiction |last=Jonas |first=Gerald |date=March 15, 1992 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[music industry]], a '''music publisher''' (or '''publishing company''') is responsible for ensuring the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s receive payment when their [[musical composition|composition]]s are used commercially. Through an agreement called a [[publishing contract]], a songwriter or composer "assigns" the [[copyright]] of their composition to a publishing company. In return, the company licenses compositions, helps monitor where compositions are used, collects [[royalties]] and distributes them to the composers. They also secure commissions for music and promote existing compositions to [[recording artist]]s, film and television.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web | title = What is music publishing? | url = http://www.mpaonline.org.uk/FAQ | publisher = music publishers association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyrights owned and administered by publishing companies are one of the most important forms of [[intellectual property]] in the music industry. (The other is the copyright on a [[master recording]] which is typically owned by a [[record company]]) Publishing companies play a central role in managing this vital asset.

==The music publisher's role==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}

Successful songwriters and composers have a relationship with a publishing company defined by a [[publishing contract]].  Publishers also sometimes provide substantial advances against future income. In return, the publishing company receives a percentage, which can be as high as 50% and varies for different kinds of royalty.

There are several types of royalty: [[Royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] derive from the sale of recorded music, such as CDs or digital downloads. These royalties are paid to publishers by [[record companies]] (through the [[Harry Fox Agency]] as well as through [http://www.amermechrights.com American Mechanical Rights Agency] in the U.S.). [[Royalties#Performance royalties|Performance royalties]] are collected by [[performance rights organization]]s such as [[SESAC]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[ASCAP]] or [[PRS_for_Music|PRS]] and are paid by radio stations and others who broadcast recorded music; and are paid by venues, event organizers for live performances of the compositions. [[Royalties#Synchronization royalties|Synchronization royalties]] are required when a composition is used in a film or television soundtrack. These royalties typically pass through the hands of a music publisher before they reach the composer.

Publishers also work to link up new songs by songwriters with suitable [[recording artist]]s to record them and to place writers' songs in other media such as movie [[soundtrack]]s and commercials. They will typically also handle [[copyright registration]] and "ownership" matters for the composer. Music print publishers also supervise the issue of [[songbook]]s and [[sheet music]] by their artists.

==Publishing disputes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Traditionally, music publishing royalties are split seventy/thirty, with thirty percent going to the publisher (as payment for their services) and the rest going to the songwriter &amp;ndash; or songwriters, as the case may be. Other arrangements have been made in the past, and continue to be; some better for the writers, some better for the publishers. Occasionally a recording artist will ask for a co-writer's credit on a song (thus sharing in both the artist and publishing royalties) in exchange for selecting it to perform, particularly if the writer is not well known. Sometimes an artist's manager or producer will expect a co-credit or share of the publishing (as with [[Norman Petty]] and [[Phil Spector]]), and occasionally a publisher will insist on writer's credit (as [[Morris Levy]] did with several of his acts); these practices are listed in ascending order of scrupulousness, as regarded by the music industry.

The most unscrupulous type of music publisher is the [[songshark]], who does little if any real "legwork" or promotion on behalf of songwriters. Songsharks make their profit not on royalties from sales, but by charging inexperienced writers for "services" (some real, such as [[demo (music)|demo]] recording or [[musical arrangement|musical arranging]], some fictional, such as "audition" or "review" fees) a legitimate publisher would provide without cost to the writer, as part of their job. (By comparison, a bona fide publisher who charges admission to a workshop for writers, where songs may be auditioned or reviewed, isn't wrong to do so.)

Rock-n-roll pioneer [[Buddy Holly]] split with longtime manager Norman Petty over publishing matters in late 1958, as did the [[The Buckinghams|Buckinghams]] with producer [[James William Guercio]] almost a decade later. [[John Fogerty]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] was sued by his former publisher [[Saul Zaentz]] (who'd also served as his manager) over a later Fogerty song that sounded slightly like a CCR song Zaentz published. (Fogerty won in court.)

Several bands and artists own (or later purchase) their own publishing, and start their own companies, with or without help from an outside agent. The sale or loss of publishing ownership can be devastating to a given artist or writer, financially and emotionally. R&amp;B legend [[Little Richard]] was largely cheated on his music publishing and copyrights, as were many performers. [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]] of [[The Beach Boys]] were crushed to learn that [[Murry Wilson]] (father to three of the Beach Boys, Love's uncle, and the band's music publisher) had sold their company [[Sea of Tunes]] to [[A&amp;M Records]] during 1969 for a fraction of what it was worth &amp;ndash; or earned in the following years.

A large factor in the [[Beatles]]' breakup was when their publisher [[Dick James]] sold his share of [[Northern Songs]], the company they'd formed with him in 1963 (then taken public in 1967, with shares trading on the [[London Stock Exchange]]), to Britain's Associated TeleVision ([[Associated TeleVision|ATV]]) in 1969. Neither the Beatles nor managers [[Lee Eastman]] and [[Allen Klein]] were able to prevent ATV from becoming majority stockholders in Northern Songs, whose assets included virtually all the group's song copyrights. Losing control of the company, [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] elected to sell their share of Northern Songs (and thus their own copyrights), while retaining their writer's royalties. ([[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] retained minority holdings in the company.)

The '''New Zealand Music Hall of Fame''' is a figurative [[hall of fame]] dedicated to noteworthy musicians from [[New Zealand]].

The hall was created in 2007 by [[Recorded Music NZ]] (then known as the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ)) and the [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/apra/news/article.cfm?o_id=600562&amp;objectid=10460505 |title=NZ to get its own Music Hall of Fame |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]] |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two inductions are made into the hall each year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amplifier.co.nz/news/31764/rianz_and_apra_announce_joint_new_zealand_music_hall_of_fame.html;jsessionid=5692E32A5AB20F48FA8C53A5A38C0896 |title=RIANZ and APRA announce joint New Zealand Music Hall of Fame |publisher=Amplifier |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one at the [[APRA Silver Scroll]] Awards, decided by APRA, and the other is the winner of the Legacy Award at the [[New Zealand Music Awards]] (NZMA), picked by Recorded Music NZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apra.co.nz/apra-awards/new-zealand-music-hall-of-fame/inductees.aspx |title=New Zealand Music Hall of Fame&gt;Inductees |publisher=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]] |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall of Fame has plans to hold a gala dinner to induct larger numbers of artists.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY|url=http://www.musichall.co.nz/home/about-nz-music/|website=NZ Music Hall of Fame|publisher=NZ Music Hall of Fame Trust|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|September 2016}}, 20 inductions have been made into the hall, five of which include women. [[The Exponents]] frontman [[Jordan Luck]] has been inducted twice, first as the inaugural inductee at the [[2007 APRA Silver Scroll Awards]] and again with his band [[The Exponents]] at the [[2015 New Zealand Music Awards]]. The most recent Recorded Music NZ inductee was [[Bic Runga]], who was inducted at the [[2016 New Zealand Music Awards]], while most recent APRA inductee was indie rock band [[The Clean]] who was be inducted at the [[2017 APRA Silver Scroll Awards]].

== Eligibility ==

To be eligible for induction in to the Hall of Fame, the artist must have released a work or achieve another significant professional milestone at least 20 years prior. They must also have shown musical excellence in their career. Also considered is the significance and influence and the impact of the artist's work on New Zealand music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELIGIBILITY|url=http://www.musichall.co.nz/home/about-nz-music/nomination-process/|website=NZ Music Hall of Fame|publisher=NZ Music Hall of Fame Trust|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award ==

Both the APRA and the Recorded Music NZ inductees receive a frame certificate to mark their induction as well as the Hall of Fame "soundshell", created by sculptor Jim Wheeler. The Recorded Music Inductees also receive the Legacy Award which is represented as a platinum Tui trophy.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

== Controversy ==

In  August 2017, [[Salmonella Dub]] allegedly turned down the opportunity to be the 2017 Legacy Award winner and Hall of Fame inductee at the [[2017 New Zealand Music Awards]]. The band requested that Wellington post-punk band Beat Rhythm Fashion perform as part of the induction ceremony, however, it was claimed that the award organisers turned down the request, saying that Beat Rhythm Fashion was "too obscure" for the broad television audience of the music awards. Salmonella Dub then turned down the Hall of Fame entry.&lt;ref name="salmonella"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dub snub! Salmonella Dub turn down Hall of Fame over clash with organisers|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/95623048/dub-snub-salmonella-dub-turn-down-hall-of-fame-over-clash-with-organisers|website=Stuff|publisher=Fairfax|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, there was no confirmation of this from the Hall of Fame organisers nor independent sources.

Indie rock band [[The Clean]] have also twice turned down the opportunity to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Band member Robert Scott explained, "We feel we are outside the industry, and in the past we were shunned and dismissed and it seems like by saying yes we would be forgiving the industry for that."&lt;ref name="salmonella"/&gt;

Modern scholarship takes the view that Aesop probably did not compose all of the fables attributed to him;&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, “Introduction,” in George Stade (Consulting Editorial Director), ''Aesop’s Fables.''  New York:  Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, (2005).  Produced and published in conjunction with Fine Creative Media, Inc. (New York) Michael J. Fine, President and Publisher.  See pp. xiii–xv and xxv–xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, a few are known to have first been used before Aesop lived, while the first record we have of many others is from well over a millennium after his time. Traditionally, Aesop's fables were arranged alphabetically, which is not helpful to the reader.&lt;ref name="Aesop"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=n2LlrCeYl7gC&amp;pg=PR33&amp;lpg=PR33&amp;dq=perry+index+aesop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iiVqyMpXVJ&amp;sig=4xs9Rc5bJ9mP-bFzHa4kQYwvLwY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-0ijT7qhIoS42gWIuIGeBA&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=perry%20index&amp;f=false |accessdate= 2 May 2012 |title= Aesop's Fables |author= Aesop |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2002 |isbn= 0-19-160628-6 |pages=xxxii–xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; B. E. Perry listed them by language (Greek then Latin), chronologically, by source, and then alphabetically; the Spanish scholar [[Francisco Rodríguez Adrados]] created a similar system.&lt;ref name="Aesop"/&gt; This system also does not help the casual reader, but is the best for scholarly purposes.&lt;ref name="Aesop"/&gt;

Ben Edwin Perry (1892–1968) was a professor of classics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] from 1924 to 1960. He was author of ''Studies in the Text History of the Life and Fables of Aesop'' and many other books. His ''Aesopica'' ("A Series of Texts Relating to Aesop Or Ascribed to Him Or Closely Connected with the Literal Tradition that Bears His Name") has become the definitive edition of all fables reputed to be by Aesop, with fables arranged by earliest known source. His index of fables has been used as a reference system by later authors.&lt;ref&gt;According to Laura Gibbs for instance, it is "the most comprehensive and reliable system currently available." {{cite book|last=Gibbs|first=Laura |title=Aesop's Fables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20758">'''Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address''' was a speech delivered by [[Pope Pius XII]] over [[Vatican Radio]] on [[Christmas]] 1942. It is notable for its denunciation of the extermination of people on the basis of race, and followed the commencement of the Nazi ''[[Final Solution]]'' program to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The significance of the denunciation is a matter of scholarly debate.

==Background==
The 1942 Christmas Address by Pope Pius XII was made shortly after the war had turned decisively against [[Nazi Germany]]. Hitler had broken his alliance with [[Stalin]] and advanced into the Soviet Union, although his army [[Battle of Stalingrad|in Stalingrad]] had been surrounded, decimated, starved and was about to surrender, precipitating disaster on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Following decisive victories in North Africa, the Pacific and the air war in Northern Europe, the war had turned in favour of the Allies. From May 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe - the ''[[Final Solution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' : "World War Two - German-occupied Europe"&lt;/ref&gt; The brutalization of the Catholic Church in Poland had been underway for three years.

The Catholic Church had been offering condemnations of Nazi racism since the earliest days of the Nazi movement. The 1942 Christmas address is significant for the light it throws on the ongoing scholarly debate around the war time policies of Pius XII in response to what would later be termed [[The Holocaust]] (the systematic murder of Europe's Jews by the Nazis). Pius' cautious approach has been a subject of controversy. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, his "strongest statement against genocide was regarded as inadequate by the Allies, though in Germany he was regarded as an Allied sympathizer who had violated his own policy of neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica: "Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars".&lt;/ref&gt; According to concentration camp prisoner, [[Father Jean Bernard]] of Luxembourg, treatment of clergy imprisoned in the [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp]] worsened when Pope Pius or the German bishops were critical of Hitler or the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/rychlak/00934.html ''The Priests of Dachau''] by [[Ronald Rychlak]]; InsideCatholic.com; 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Popes served through the Nazi period: [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922-1939) and [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). In 1933, Pius signed a [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat with Germany]] - hoping to protect the rights of Catholics under the Nazi government. The terms of the Treaty were not kept by Hitler. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "From 1933 to 1936 [Pius XI] wrote several protests against the Third Reich, and his attitude toward fascist Italy changed dramatically after Nazi racial policies were introduced into Italy in 1938." Pius XI delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new totalitarian creeds from a Catholic perspective: against Italian Fascism [[Non abbiamo bisogno]] (1931; ''We Do Not Need to Acquaint You''); against Nazism [[Mit brennender Sorge]] (1937; "With Deep Anxiety") and against atheistic Communism [[Divini redemptoris]] (1937; "Divine Redeemer"). He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Francaise movement and anti-Semitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica : ''Pius XI''&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli (future Pius XII), made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its "ideology of race".&lt;ref name="spectator.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027155520/http://www.spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |archivedate=2008-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cardinal Pacelli, Pope Pius XII had assisted Pius XI, draft the ''Mit Brennender Sorge'' encyclical, a powerful critique of Nazi ideology. Pius XI also commissioned an encyclical demonstrating the incompatibility of Catholicism and racism: [[Humani generis unitas]] ("The Unity of the Human Race"). Following his death however, the less confrontational Pius XII did not issue the encyclical, fearing it would antagonize Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany at a time where he hoped to act as an impartial peace broker.&lt;ref name="Pius XII-Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Pius XII: Biography, Papacy, &amp; Facts: Early Pontificate | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher=Britannica.com | accessdate=December 6, 2017 | author=Coppa, Frank J.| authorlink = Frank J. Coppa | date=April 28, 2005 | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pius-XII#ref838123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Europe on the brink of war, Pius XI died on 10 February 1939 and [[Cardinal Pacelli]] was elected to succeed him as Pope Pius XII. As [[Vatican Secretary of State]], Pacelli had been a critic of Nazism and the Nazi Government was the only government not to send a representative to his coronation.&lt;ref name="spectator.org"/&gt; Pius, a cautious diplomat, pursued the course of diplomacy to attempt to convince European leaders to avoid war.&lt;ref name="Pius XII-Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"&gt;http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pius XII-Britannica"/&gt;

Following the outbreak of war, Pius followed Vatican precedent and pursued a policy of "impartiality". Despite this official policy, Pius passed intelligence to the Allies and made a series of general condemnations of racism and genocide through the course of the war.&lt;ref name="Pius XII-Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yadvashem.org"/&gt; and chose diplomacy to assist the persecuted during the war&lt;ref name="Pius XII-Britannica"/&gt; For this he was scorned by Hitler as a "Jew lover"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust Vatican hopes secret files exonerate 'Hitler's pope']; Dalya Alberge; [[The Observer]]; 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and a blackmailer on his back, whom he believed constricted his ally Mussolini and leaked confidential German correspondence to the world&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hitler's Table Talk]] 1941-1944'': "Religion in Eastern Territories", Cameron &amp; Stevens, Enigma Books pp. 269, 671&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely posthumously (and controversially), Pius has been criticized for not "doing enough" to prevent the Holocaust - and by others of being "silent" in the face of it. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', depictions of the Pope as anti-Semitic or indifferent to the Nazi Holocaust lack "credible substantiation". Upon the death of Pius XII in 1958, he was praised by world leaders for his wartime leadership, with the Israeli Foreign Minister [[Golda Meir]] saying: "When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace."&lt;ref name="spectator.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236599&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholarly critic of the legacy of Pius XII has been [[Michael Phayer]] (author of ''The Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965'' (2000)). He has written that the Catholic Church possessed a specific knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] that rivaled that of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied governments]].&lt;ref name="p4445"&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican possessed information on the systematic nature of deportations and atrocities, compiled from its own diplomatic corps in Eastern Europe, from Catholic bishops in Germany, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe, from ordinary Catholics, priests, and laity, from the [[Polish government-in-exile]], the foreign diplomats to the Holy See, and various Jews and Jewish organizations.&lt;ref name="p4445"/&gt; A variety of historians have comprehensively examined the data received by the Vatican, which "covered not just the activity of mobile killing squads but every aspect of the Nazis' murdering process".&lt;ref name="p4445"/&gt;

However, according to Phayer, until 1942, Cardinal Secretary of State [[Luigi Maglione]] had repeatedly and publicly stated that the Vatican was "unable to confirm atrocity reports".&lt;ref name="p46"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer wrote: "regarding Maglione's oft-repeated rejoinder to the effect that something could not be confirmed, it must be noted that he never took steps to confirm the many reports of atrocities that flowed to his office. Had Pope Pius wished to do so, he could have assembled a comprehensive picture of the genocidal crimes of the Nazis".&lt;ref name="p47"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Messages to the effect that the pope was losing his "[[moral authority]]" due to the failure to condemn Nazi atrocities poured in from diplomats accredited to the Vatican from the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, Belgium, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Allies condemned the genocide of the Jews on 17 December 1942 in the [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations]], which&amp;mdash;according to Phayer&amp;mdash;"must have sent the Holy See scurrying to play catch-up".&lt;ref name="p50"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII refused to endorse the Joint Declaration, as urged by [[Harold Tittmann]], his US ambassador, and indeed, his own speech would be "not as bluntly stated as the United Nations' declaration earlier that month".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 51, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

A defender of Pius, the eminent historian of the Holocaust, [[Martin Gilbert]] portrays Vatican policy in the lead up to the 1942 Christmas message with a very different emphasis: "In his first encyclical as Pope, Pius XII specifically rejected Nazism and expressly mentioned the Jews, noting that in the Catholic Church there is "neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 3,28.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Mueller, commented that the encyclical was "directed exclusively against Germany." So outspoken was it that the Royal Air Force and the French air force dropped 88,000 copies of it over Germany. One strong piece of evidence that [[David Dalin|Dalin]] produces against the concept of "Hitler's Pope" is the audience granted by Pius XII in March 1940 to the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the only senior Nazi official to visit the Vatican during his papacy. After Ribbentrop rebuked the Pope for "siding" with the Allies, the Pope responded by reading from a long list of German atrocities and religious persecution against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, which Germany had occupied six months earlier. The New York Times, under the headline "JEWS' RIGHTS DEFENDED," wrote on March 14, 1940: "The Pontiff, in the burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution, also came to the defense of the Jews in Germany and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope ''Hitler's Pope?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016021235/http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope |date=2013-10-16 }} by Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1942 Christmas address was 26 pages and over 5000 words long and took more than 45 minutes to deliver.&lt;ref name="rr3"/&gt; The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society.&lt;ref name="rr3"/&gt; According to Rittner and Roth, "always one to choose words carefully, Pius wrote several drafts before he had crafted exactly what he wanted to say on that particular Christmas Eve".&lt;ref name="rr3"&gt;Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer wrote that the speech was "crafted to fit the circumstances as he saw them&amp;mdash;that is to say, he addressed principles and omitted particulars".&lt;ref name="p53"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius' death in 2008, the German Pope [[Benedict XVI]] recalled that the Pope's voice had been "broken by emotion" as he "deplored the situation" with a "clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20081009_50-pio-xii_en.html Vatican Archive - Homily by Pope Benedict XVI]; 9 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope addressed the issues of racial persecutions in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanity owes this vow to those hundreds of thousands who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline&lt;ref name="p53"/&gt; [also translated: "marked down for death or gradual extinction"]&lt;ref name="rr3"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rittner and Roth described these as the "pivotal words that remain one of the key flashpoints in the Holocaust-related controversy that continues to swirl around him" came near the end of the speech.&lt;ref name="rr3"/&gt; Phayer, Rittner and Roth see it as significant that Pius XII, did not address the perpetrators or victims by name.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rr4"/&gt; Nor did he mention Jews or antisemitism.&lt;ref name="rr4"/&gt;

== Contemporary reception==
The immediate reaction to the speech was generally positive, with the exception of the Nazis and Jewish victims in Poland.&lt;ref name="p56"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomatic criticism of the Vatican's "moral authority" essentially ceased for an entire year, until the deportations of the Italian Jews began in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial called Pius XII a "lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent".&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 25 December 1942. "The Pope's Verdict." p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The editorial's rhetoric mimics another ''New York Times'' editorial about Pius XII's previous Christmas address, which called the pope "a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas" in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 25 December 1941. "The Pope's Message." p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} Phayer's survey of global news sources notes that every paper that covered the speech did so in a positive light, although none of them considered it front page news.&lt;ref name="p58"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Tittmann pressured Pius XII in their diplomatic meetings to go further in his public statements, but privately wired the State Department that "taken as a whole, the message may be regarded as an arraignment of totalitarianism. Furthermore, the reference to the persecution of the Jews and mass deportations is unmistakeable".&lt;ref name="p57"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech elicited the strongest reaction in the [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop of Utrecht, [[Johannes de Jong]] saw the address as a signal for Catholics to publicly confront Nazism.&lt;ref name="p60"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A later pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops claimed to be "following a path indicated by our Holy Father, the Pope" and quoted the address: "The Church would be untrue to herself, ceasing to be a mother, if she turned a deaf ear to children's anguished cries".&lt;ref name="p60"/&gt; However, unlike the Christmas address, the Dutch letter went farther and "named names".&lt;ref name="p60"/&gt;

Others were more guarded in their reactions. Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin agreed that the address referred to Jews, but considered it not specific enough.&lt;ref name="p58"/&gt; Catholic Poles believed that the address referred to them alone and wished that the pope had identified the Germans as the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London remained dissatisfied with the address, wishing for a "more trenchant papal condemnation" that named the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="p63"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German government expressed displeasure at the Christmas address and boycotted the pope's [[Christmas eve]] liturgy.&lt;ref name="p63"/&gt; According to [[Pinchas Lapide]]'s ''[[Three Popes and the Jews]]'', on 27 December 1942 the department [[Prague]] of the [[RSHA]] reported the following about the Christmas broadcast that "The Pope has repudiated the National-Socialist New European Order.... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals."&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, 1980, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Phayer claims he attempted to assuage the German ambassador, [[Diego von Bergen]], by pulling him aside and assuring him that his remarks were intended for the Soviets and Stalin rather than the Germans.&lt;ref name="p63"/&gt;

Phayer argues that contemporaries and scholars have viewed the speech differently because "we know that the pope would not take up the matter again, but contemporaries did not know that this would be the case. In fact, to assert that Pope Pius himself intended this to be his one and only statement is incorrect".&lt;ref name="p43"/&gt;

==Scholarly interpretation==
According to Rittner and Roth, the speech remains a "lightning rod in debates about [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pius XII and the Holocaust]]", and its interpretation remains "unsettled and unsettling".&lt;ref name="rr4"&gt;Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the eminent Holocaust historian, Sir [[Martin Gilbert]], the Reich Security Main Office  calling Pius a "mouthpiece" of the Jews in response to his Christmas address, is clear evidence that Pius was one who raised his voice for the victims of Nazi terror.&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler's Pope?'' by Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06&lt;/ref&gt; This is a view shared by scholars such as [[David Dalin]] (author of ''[[The Myth of Hitler's Pope]]: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews From the Nazis'').

Phayer agrees that the 1942 speech did denounce genocide, but argues that "it is still not clear ''whose'' genocide or ''which'' genocide he was referring to, and we can do no more than speculate as to ''why'' he spoke out".&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2008, p. xii"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer states that "although the word genocide would not be coined until 1944, Pius XII denounced what we now commonly understand as genocide".&lt;ref name="p42"/&gt; In 2000, Phayer wrote that "Pope Pius's radio talk contained twenty-seven words about the Holocaust out of twenty-six pages of text".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; While Phayer's views of the speech changed between 2000 and 2008 ("Pius did speak out"), his dismal assessment of the "Vatican's essential passivity in collecting and disseminating genocide information" did not.&lt;ref name="p42"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer states that his change of views came after he was invited by [[Michael Marrus]] to participate in a [[University of Toronto]] conference about the Holocaust and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2008, p. xii"/&gt; Phayer cites the address as evidence of the "adaptability rather than uniform rigidity at the Vatican in the middle of the Holocaust years. The Holy See was in search of a new path for papal policy".&lt;ref name="p43"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that historians (himself included) have been "too dismissive of the 1942 address" although he agrees that "Pius never spoke out again".&lt;ref name="p43"/&gt;

There were an estimated 150,000 prostitutes in Malaysia in 2014 and that the country's [[sex trade]] generated US$963 million.&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.malaysiandigest.com/features/522410-prostitution-in-malaysia-a-taboo-subject-that-is-surprisingly-big-business.html |title=Prostitution In Malaysia: A Taboo Subject That Is Surprisingly Big Business |last= |first= |date= 10 October 2014 |website= Malaysian Digest |publisher= |access-date= 28 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For 200 years, except in wartime, prostitution was only apparent in small areas of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Ipoh]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[Kuantan]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]], serving loggers, tin miners and sailors.&lt;ref name="asianc"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://asiancorrespondent.com/2015/07/kuala-lumpur-prostitution-malaysia/#QOB3p530ZA1f6QKW.97 |title= Why Kuala Lumpur could be on its way to becoming the sex capital of Asia |last= Hunter |first= Murray |date= 28 July 2015 |website= Asian Correspondent |publisher= |access-date= 28 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] in the [[Second World War]], the Japanese set up a number of [[brothels]] for their troops to "prevent the rape of local women by Japanese soldiers, to limit anti-Japanese resistance in the occupied area, to protect the soldiers from venereal disease and to avoid international disgrace". Many local women between 17 and 28 were forced to work in the brothels, employed as what were euphemistically termed "[[comfort women]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/4269 |title= Researcher details shattered lives of local comfort women |last=  |first= |date= 11 Aug 2001 |website= Malaysiakini |publisher= |access-date= 28 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting at the end of the 20th century, prostitution has spread over the rest of Malaysia, particularly in the form of [[Massage parlor|massage parlours]].&lt;ref name="asianc" /&gt;

Originally the prostitutes were locals, but there has been an influx of foreign sex workers over the last 10 years. Prostitutes from [[China]], [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]] now outnumber locals.&lt;ref name="asianc" /&gt;

In 2012, the Anti-Vice, Gambling and Secret Societies divisions of the police arrested 12,234 prostitutes throughout the country, of which 9,830 were foreign nationals, including 5,165 Chinese, 2,009 Thais and 1,418 Indonesians.&lt;ref name="digest" /&gt;

==Legal situation==
There are no federal laws against prostitution but there are laws against related activities. Section 372 of the Penal Code criminalises soliciting in any place and living on the earnings of a [[prostitute]].&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; The latter is applied against those who run brothels.&lt;ref name="procon" /&gt;

The Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 adds an offence of exposing another person to the risk of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Local health regulations prevent health and beauty establishments (which includes massage parlours) from employing sex-workers.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Various other laws such as those against [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] are also used against sex-workers.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

===Kelantan===
The Sharia Criminal Offences Act, which brings [[Sharia law]] into force,&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; is in effect in Kelantan.&lt;ref name="ind" /&gt; Sharia law allows fines and public whipping or caning for "any woman who prostitutes herself".&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; Buying of sex is also forbidden.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; However Deputy [[Prime Minister]] [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi|Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]] suggests this may only apply to [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name="ind" /&gt;

==Kuala Lumpur==
Kuala Lumpur has a number of [[red-light districts]] where [[street prostitution]], massage parlours and brothels can be found.&lt;ref name="asianc" /&gt;

The most upmarket, and probably the best known, is [[Bukit Bintang]]. More downmarket is the RLD at [[Lorong Haji Taib]] where Indian, Chinese, and local prostitutes operate. Close by is the [[Chow Kit]] area where [[transgender]] prostitutes ply at night.&lt;ref name="asianc" /&gt;

Jalan Alor, Jalan Hicks, and Jalan Thamibipilly in the [[Brickfields]] area are red-light districts. Street walkers operate around [[Jalan Petaling]].&lt;ref name="asianc" /&gt;

In the [[Klang Valley]], Chinese, Vietnamese, Thais, and Cambodians work as Guest Relations Officers (GROs) in the [[karaoke]] and Japanese bars. After being brought a few drinks they will negotiate a price for sex. Indonesians work as [[dancers]]/prostitutes in the [[Dangdut]] Pubs. African prostitutes try to pick up customers outside nightclubs in Bukit Bintang, [[Jalan Sultan Ismail]], and [[Jalan Imbi]]. There are also a number of [[escort agencies]].&lt;ref name="asianc" /&gt;

==Stations==

===Radio Universidad de Costa Rica===

[[File:Studio 1 of Radio Universidad de Costa Rica, 5 August 2016.jpg|thumb|The main recording studio (sometimes called studio 1 internally) of Radio Universidad de Costa Rica, on 5 August 2016.]]

This station (the first radio station of the [[University of Costa Rica]]) started broadcasting on 29 November 1949, thus shortly after the [[Costa Rican Civil War|Costa Rican Civil War of 1948]] and the subsequent second republic (See [[:Es:Junta Fundadora de la Segunda República|Junta Fundadora de la Segunda República]] {{Es icon}}). At that time, however, it broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|amplitude modulation]] and had a different name, since abbreviated "TIUCR".&lt;ref name="Historia-de-radio" /&gt;

===Radio U===

The frequency of this channel was first used for repeating broadcasts of the older channel "Radio Universidad de Costa Rica"; until it started it own broadcasts on 22 April 1996.&lt;ref name="Historia-de-radio" /&gt; At that time, Carlos Morales was the director of "Radioemisoras UCR" and wanted to receive more student participation on its radio stations. In its early years, multiple programs made by university students emerged on Radio U.&lt;ref name="Historia-de-radio" /&gt;

===Radio 870 UCR===

Started broadcasting songs and micro-broadcasts in 2008; and subsequently broadcasting live on 4 May 2009.&lt;ref name="Historia-de-radio" /&gt;

==Hi-jacking of August 2015==

On 25 August 2015, at 3:30PM ([[Central Time Zone|local time (CST)]]) a group of students and workers of the [[University of Costa Rica]] entered the three emission cabins of the three respective stations. The take-over lasted 1 hour. The hi-jackers were unsatisfied due to an agreement between the government and the rectors of Costa Rica's five universities to augment a Special Fund for Higher Education (Spanish: FEES) by 7,38%.&lt;ref name="Estudiantes-entraron"&gt;

[[File:Youths Playing Red Rover.jpg|thumb|Youths playing the game]]
'''Red rover''' (also known as '''forcing the city gates''' and '''octopus tag''') is a [[game]] played primarily by [[children]] on [[playgrounds]]. This 19th-century children's group game (requiring 10+ players)&lt;ref name="ROVEABOUT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Rover: A Traditional Favorite Outdoor Game|url=http://grandparents.about.com/od/projectsactivities/qt/Red_Rover.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to have originated in the [[United Kingdom]] and then spread to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].

== Game ==
The game is played between two lines of players (usually called the "East" or "West" team, although this does not relate to the actual relative location of the teams), usually positioned approximately thirty feet apart with hands or arms linked together. The game starts when the first team, in this example the "East" team, calls a player out, by saying or singing a line like "Red rover, red rover, send [player on opposite team] right over", or "Red rover, red rover, let [player on opposite team] come over", or even "Red rover, red rover, I call [player on opposite team] over".

The immediate goal for the person called is to run to the other line and break the "East" team's chain (formed by the linking of hands). If the player called fails to break the chain, they join the "East" team. However, if the player successfully breaks the chain, they may select either of the two "links" broken by the successful run, and take them to join the "West" team. The "West" team then calls out "Red rover" for a player on the "East" team, and play continues. The game needs five people to play at least, although this would be a very short game.

When only one player is left on a team, they also must try and break through a link. If they do not succeed, then the opposing team wins. Otherwise, they are able to get a player back for their team.&lt;ref name="ROVEABOUT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameskidsplay.net/games/strength_games/redrover.htm |title=Red Rover |publisher=Gameskidsplay.net |date=2007-01-28 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia and other former USSR countries, this game has been known as "[[:ru:Детские игры#Вожатый-вожатый, подай пионера! («Али-баба» или «Разрывные цепи»)|Ali Baba]]", in Hungary as "Adj, király, katonát!" (Give, King, soldier!)&lt;ref&gt;As explained on [http://www.lurkovilag.hu/index.php?c=1724 this link] in Hungarian&lt;/ref&gt; and in Serbia as "Јелечкиње, барјачкиње" (''jelečkinje, barjačkinje'', i.e., city crier and flag bearer).&lt;ref&gt;As explained on [http://www.opanak.rs/decje-igre-nekad-kako-smo-se-igrali-jurki-trulih-kobila-jeleckinje-barjackinje-i-ostalih-igara/2/ this link] in Serbian&lt;/ref&gt; 

In New Zealand and Australia a variation of this game is called "Bullrush" which starts with two chasers that tag players running from one end to another adding more players to their team by catching the runners.&lt;ref&gt;As explained in [https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/26271/bullrush-2009 this link] &lt;/ref&gt;
red
In Romania, the game is known as "Țara, țara vrem ostași" (Country, country we want soldiers).&lt;ref&gt;Explanation in romanian on [http://activitateafara.ro/ghid-de-activitati-afara/jocurile-copilariei/tara-tara-vrem-ostasi/ this link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Czech Republic, the game is known as "Král vysílá své vojsko" (The king sends out his army), with the difference that each team chooses which of its members will attempt to break the other team's line, rather than sending the member called by the other team.&lt;ref&gt;As explained on [https://www.woodcraft.cz/index.php?right=infostudna_hry&amp;action=detail&amp;id=127&amp;sid= this link] in Czech&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14614">'''Sports Phone''' was a telephone service in the United States that allowed users to hear sports scores and information. The service was launched in 1972, and after initially failing it was relaunched three years later. The service gained a following, and by 1981 had hit a peak of 50 million calls in a year. Sports Phone began in New York City, but expanded to offer programming in numerous other locations, including Chicago and Detroit. The rise of [[sports radio]] stations and [[News ticker|score tickers]] on television broadcasts helped reduce the popularity of Sports Phone, before an increase in Internet usage led to its demise in 2000.

Callers to Sports Phone heard messages of one minute or less, with up to 30 scores provided in a given update. In addition to scores, the service's programming included news and interviews, along with a sports trivia game. Some information was recorded specifically for certain markets. The announcers for Sports Phone included future broadcasters of several franchises in the major U.S. sports leagues.

==History==
Sports Phone was first introduced on November 1, 1972, after a month of service testing. The original owner was [[New York Telephone]] employee Jack Goodfellow. Customers were charged 10 cents per one-minute phone call, with New York Telephone the recipient of all charges and a fee from Sports Phone for each call. Goodfellow's intention was for the service to make money from advertisements included with the service's updates, but the business model proved unsuccessful. In 1973, Air Time Inc., a media entity, purchased rights to the service. New York Telephone later allowed for information service operators to retain part of the call fees, and Sports Phone was relaunched in 1975.&lt;ref name="thing"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLessio|first=Joe|title=That Was a Thing: Sports Phone, the 1980s Way to Get Real-Time Scores|publisher=Grantland|date=February 24, 2015|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/that-was-a-thing-sports-phone-the-1980s-way-to-get-real-time-scores/|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service used multiple telephone numbers, including at least one alternate number, but the most well-known was 976-1313. Future broadcaster John Giannone claimed that, among New York City sports enthusiasts, "Everyone 45 and over can recite" the number.&lt;ref name="call"&gt;{{cite news|last=Best|first=Neil|title=Remembering Sports Phone and 976-1313: When sports info was a phone call away|work=Newsday|date=July 31, 2015|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/media/remembering-sports-phone-and-976-1313-when-sports-info-was-a-phone-call-away-1.10695116|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, Sports Phone was receiving an average of 65,000 calls daily. It appealed strongly to sports bettors, as it allowed users to access updates on games from the West Coast of the U.S., which frequently ended after broadcasts of television news programs.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The service experienced a record period of activity in 1977, as the [[New York Mets]] were completing a trade with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in which [[Tom Seaver]] was sent to the Reds. Sports Phone had 600,000 callers over a three-day span.&lt;ref name="big"&gt;{{cite news|last=Calabria|first=Pat|title=Sports Phone does big business|work=The Bulletin|date=July 25, 1982|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19820725&amp;id=BpxTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5IYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3735,3747590|page=D3|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in Sports Phone's usage continued in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Daily call figures moved up to around 100,000 in 1979, with peaks of three times that figure on some weekend days when college or pro football games were being held.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; By 1981, New York Telephone was making $3&amp;nbsp;million from Sports Phone over a year; 50 million calls were made to Sports Phone that year; the only Dial-it service that received more activity was the one for [[off-track betting]].&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; The service expanded to markets outside New York City as well. In 1977, Sports Phone introduced a line with updates that focused on Chicago; two years later, Detroit received its own line.&lt;ref name="line"&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=Jack|title=Sports Phone on Line: Please Deposit 50 Cents|work=The Boston Globe|date=June 26, 1988|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey and Buffalo were later added as markets with their own numbers.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Daily call numbers in Chicago had hit around 65,000 by 1984, although they reportedly peaked at 175,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brogan|first=Dan|title=C'mon, ring their bell: Knowing the scores is Sports Phone's calling|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 19, 1984|page=E14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports Phone had competition in the field by 1983, as a three-year-old national rival service, Dial-It, was receiving approximately 350,000 calls weekly.&lt;ref name="score"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Lidz|first=Franz|title=If You Don't Know the Score, Sports Phone Services Will Give it to You|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=April 25, 1983|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1983/04/25/643779/if-you-dont-know-the-score-sports-phone-services-will-give-it-to-you|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, Sports Phone's business model had changed, as its parent company, Phone Programs, was earning 2 cents per call from New York Telephone and making more than $1&amp;nbsp;million in revenue; this replaced a previous model in which Sports Phone received payments from [[AT&amp;T]] before the [[breakup of the Bell System]]. Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans had updates that were aimed at those markets by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Blauner|first=Peter|title=Sports Fix|magazine=New York|date=January 7, 1985|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17YBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls to Sports Phone numbers cost 50 cents by 1986. The service was facing increasing competition nationally from providers such as JD's National Score Phone, Dial Sports, and a line from ''[[USA Today]]''. Sports Phone indicated that it planned to increase call lengths to 90 seconds following the beginning of the football schedule; this matched the time of Dial Sports' calls, which cost customers 10 cents less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wernie|first=Bradford|title=Sports Phone Services Score With Results-Hungry Fans|work=Crain's Detroit Business|date=August 11, 1986|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radio station dedicated to [[Sports radio|sports programming]], [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], debuted in New York City in 1987. The initial concept for the station included score updates every 15 minutes, which were inspired by Sports Phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=French|first1=Alex|last2=Kahn|first2=Howie|title=The Sound and the Fury|publisher=Grantland|date=July 11, 2012|url=http://grantland.com/features/don-imus-mike-mad-dog-fall-rise-first-all-sports-talk-station-wfan/|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFAN positioned itself to compete against Sports Phone for the attention of the service's callers. One of the station's first promotional advertisements contained the line "We just made Sports Phone old news."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Sports Phone employee Cory Eisner said, "We knew right away (WFAN) was going to come after us."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; At the same time that sports radio was reducing the service's business, it was affected by an increase in the use of [[pager]]s by sports bettors and a rise in number blocks by businesses in the New York City region.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Television stations also moved to provide scores to viewers, as both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] added periodic score updates to their pro football telecasts.&lt;ref name="line"/&gt;

A Boston-area number was introduced in 1988, to coincide with the [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks]] heavyweight championship fight. Services were also provided to the Cleveland and Phoenix markets, but proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="line"/&gt; By 1990, Sports Phone had received nearly one billion calls over the service's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kanner|first=Bernice|title=Hot Lines|magazine=New York|date=September 24, 1990|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmeBLxJqbN8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, though, cable television sports stations were providing score updates. In future years, the Internet would offer scores and news in real time. Caller activity at Sports Phone fell to 1,000 or less daily. The service's last general manager, radio broadcaster [[Don La Greca]], said of Sports Phone's decline, "Technology that helped us update then became available to the general public, and so there was no reason to have us."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The service was shut down in 2000.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

==Programming==
In the earliest incarnation of Sports Phone, each one-minute call allowed the caller to hear 46 seconds of sports scores. The remaining 14 seconds of the call were taken up by two commercials, each of which lasted seven seconds.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; When the service was reintroduced in 1975, the length of a call fell to between 57 and 58 seconds.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; The reduction in time allowed customers to hang up within 60 seconds, the length of a message unit as defined by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name="score"/&gt; Recordings were not extended in cases when the announcers had not finished reciting scores; as many as 30 game scores could be fit into the required time frame. Updated score readings were usually done approximately once every 10 to 15 minutes through the conclusion of a night's sports events.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; For Sundays in which pro football was being played, the rate was much quicker, with just two minutes between updates. Sports Phone announcers initially received scores through [[ticker tape]], but later placed employees in press boxes at events for quicker reporting times.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Reporters who cooperated with Sports Phone by providing updates were paid at a rate of $20 per night; alternatively, staffers at Sports Phone would place calls into press boxes seeking updates.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Employees also sought to record interviews with players, which were incorporated in Sports Phone's updates. Some interviews were recorded on-site, while others were done by announcers at the service's headquarters; the latter approach was used in 1976 by [[Howie Rose]], who interviewed hockey player [[Darryl Sittler]] after he had posted a 10-point game.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; 

Sports Phone had various kinds of filler programming that it aired during days, when there were generally fewer sporting events to report on than nights. In the beginning, updates in the daytime were recorded less frequently than during the night, at 30-minute intervals. Along with updates on baseball games that were in progress, announcers incorporated news and editorial content, in addition to interviews.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; During the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]], when Sports Phone was suffering from a lack of content, the service reported the results of a fictional best-of-seven series between the [[1961 New York Yankees season|1961 New York Yankees]] and [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 New York Mets]], which was simulated with the [[Strat-O-Matic]] tabletop game. According to announcer [[Mike Walczewski]], the series led to a 400 percent spike in Sports Phone's call volume.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; By 1982, daytime updates had been sped up to occur about every 15 minutes. Other information that the service provided included statistics, [[harness racing]] results, and listings of [[pitcher]]s in upcoming baseball games. One other type of programming that gained a following was a sports trivia game known as the "Quickie Quiz".&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; An announcer asked a trivia question during an update, and callers contacted a different phone number to answer.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Winners were given 15 seconds of air time on a Sports Phone update to discuss a topic of their choice.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;

Some content was added in certain locations' updates to appeal to the local markets. Different sports were mentioned in updates, along with reports on teams of local interest.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; This included listings of golf course and tennis court wait times as well.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The New York City operations center handled updates for multiple cities in the southern part of the U.S.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

As the popularity of Sports Phone started to decline, a new feature was launched that provided more detailed play-by-play information on games. Customers were charged 99 cents per minute for the calls, which did not have the regular service's time limit. La Greca once provided three consecutive hours of baseball play-by-play to one caller; the announcer stated that the target market for the play-by-play line was "the degenerate gambler."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; In the final years of Sports Phone's existence, announcers often obtained score information on the Internet before recording updates.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;

==Announcers==
Writer Joe DeLessio described Sports Phone as "a launching pad for young voices looking to break into broadcasting."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The employees who announced updates for the service included future television broadcasters of the Mets and [[New York Yankees]] baseball clubs, and the [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]].&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; La Greca, after beginning his career at Sports Phone, became a radio broadcaster for the [[New York Rangers]] and an [[ESPN Radio]] host in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=Imus, Mike and the Mad Dog, &amp; Doris from Rego Park: The Groundbreaking History of WFAN|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2013|pages=107–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTYFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|isbn=978-1-60078-828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mets announcer [[Howie Rose]], who began working for Sports Phone in 1975, likened his position to "anchoring the ''CBS Evening News''".&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

A steady stream of announcers at the service's New York City operations came from [[Fordham University]]. Future Yankees television announcer [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]] and [[New York Giants]] radio voice [[Bob Papa]] were among the Fordham attendees who later announced for Sports Phone.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Some Sports Phone announcers who provided updates to southern locations, including Papa, applied pseudonyms in an effort "to sound less ethnic."&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

'''The Nitro Girls''' were a dance team in [[World Championship Wrestling]]. Their initial function was to dance and entertain the live crowds during commercial breaks.&lt;ref name=reveal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2005/726/stacy_keibler_824.shtml |title=Revealing Stacy Keibler Interview |accessdate=2008-03-14 |date=July 26, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513133222/http://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2005/726/stacy_keibler_824.shtml |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Nitro Girls were formed in 1997 by [[Kimberly Page]] at [[Eric Bischoff]]'s request and made their debut on July 14 in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Their main focus was to entertain the live fans during the [[Television advertisements|commercials]] of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''.&lt;ref name=reveal/&gt; They also regularly performed in short segments on the show.

During the Nitro Girls’ opening dance routine on the October 6, 1997 edition of ''WCW Monday Nitro'' from the [[Target Center]] in [[Minneapolis]], one of Chae’s nipples [[Wardrobe malfunction|accidentally popped out of her top]]. Cameras cut to a wide shot of the dancers.

The Nitro Girls filmed their own [[pay-per-view]], dubbed "The Nitro Girls Swimsuit Calendar Special" which aired on August 3, 1999&lt;ref name="nt99episode"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Monday Nitro|series= WCW Monday Nitro|serieslink= WCW Monday Nitro|station= TNT (TV channel)|airdate= 1999-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later released on home video. The pay-per-view is currently one of the few pay-per-view events not made available for streaming on the [[WWE Network]] service.

In late 1999, the group held a competition to find a new member.&lt;ref name=reveal/&gt;&lt;ref name=skye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20000107/ai_n11738606|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220231216/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20000107/ai_n11738606|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 20, 2007|title='Skye' is no limit for new WCW Nitro Girl|author=Maria Blackburn|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=January 7, 2000|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, [[Stacy Keibler]] defeated 300 other girls for a spot on the dance troupe and $10,000.&lt;ref name=skye/&gt; Her winning routine was watched by 4.4 million viewers.&lt;ref name=skye/&gt;

The Nitro Girls also made appearances at WCW promotional events and were featured in the WCW produced film ''[[Ready to Rumble]]''. As the group became more and more involved in storylines, it slowly dissolved, but never officially broke up until 2001 when WCW was sold to [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].

==Involvement in storylines==
In October, 1999 [[Kimberly Page]] began to appear with husband and wrestler [[Diamond Dallas Page]]. At [[Halloween Havoc (1999)|Halloween Havoc, 1999]] she claimed Ric Flair spanked her 14 times after she was going to drug his son David Flair in a hotel room. Diamond Dallas Page wrestled Ric Flair in a strap match. On the November 1, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro Kimberly quit the group as a result of her husband being injured by David Flair, she then ran him over with her car. 

After Kimberly left, the Nitro Girls began to [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] &lt;ref name=skye/&gt; with each other, [[Spice_(wrestler)|Spice]] feuded with A.C. Jazz over the new leadership position and won.&lt;ref name=skye/&gt; After Jazz left the group, Tygress attempted to gain control.&lt;ref name=skye/&gt; 

By early 2000 the Nitro Girls broke up and began to go their own way within WCW. Kimberly Page joined [[The New Blood]]. [[Sharmell Sullivan]] became Paisley, a valet for The Artist, and later went to the WWE. [[Stacy Keibler]], the final member to join the group, began appearing as Miss Hancock the manager for the tag team Standards and Practices before going to the WWE.

==Diversity 5==
Several former Nitro Girls formed a pop music group called Diversity 5: [[Teri Byrne]] (Fyre), Melissa Bellin (Spice), [[Sharmell Sullivan]] (Storm), Chae An (Chae) and Vanessa Sanchez (Tygress). When Sharmell went to the [[WWE|WWF]] for the first time, Chiquita Anderson (Chiquita) replaced her. The D5 group released one cd single (I Promise/Shake Me Up) in 2001, but by the following year the group bottomed out when they appeared on the [[FOX]] reality show ''[[30 Seconds to Fame]]'' on October 31, 2002 and were promptly voted off.

"'''To Set It Right'''" is the 21st episode of the American military drama television series ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', produced for broadcast on [[NBC]]. Written by [[Lee Erwin (writer)|Lee Erwin]], and featuring a guest cast that included [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Don Marshall (actor)|Don Marshall]], [[Woody Strode]] and the acting debut of [[Nichelle Nichols]]. The series followed the lives of the [[United States Marine Corps]] stationed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]]. In this episode, after a racially driven altercation between Cpl. Peter Devlin ([[Dennis Hopper]]) and Pvt. Ernest Cameron ([[Don Marshall (actor)|Don Marshall]]), Lt. William Rice ([[Gary Lockwood]]) attempts to settle their issues by first arranging a boxing match, and then forcing them to work together on a march. Following protests by [[the Pentagon]], who had previously aided the production of the series, the network refused to air the episode.

==Production==
''The Lieutenant'' was developed in conjunction with the Pentagon; but following a series of plot points featuring in the series that concerned officials there, relations were strained.{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=85}} They were concerned with the plot of "To Set It Right", and warned the producers that the airing of the episode that this could result in the production no longer being able to use the equipment and extras provided by the marines for free. In response, Roddenberry informed the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], who attempted to pressure the network to air the episode.{{sfn |Gross|Altman| 2016| p=62}} The assistance of the Pentagon was withdrawn,{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=85}} and the series was officially cancelled a week later.{{sfn |Gross|Altman| 2016| p=62}}

==Reception==
Donald Bogle wrote of the episode in his 2001 book ''Primetime Blues: African Americans on Network Television'', saying that the episode "lost its nerve and ultimately undermined the feelings - the very strong, modern Black perspective - of its character Cameron". This resulted in the character appearing to be "one more angry young negro with unjustified racial hostility". However, Bogle praised the interactions between Rice and Norma and said that this was a better articulation of the problems faced by Cameron than those explained by the actual character.{{sfn |Bogle| 2001| p=105}} Bogle felt that although "To Set It Right" sought to address racial issues, it wanted to avoid upsetting its main viewers.{{sfn |Bogle| 2001| p=106}}

A videotape of the episode is in the collection of the [[Paley Center for Media]] in New York, contributed to the center by Gene Roddenberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=john&amp;p=423&amp;item=T78:0377|title=Lieutenant, The: To Set It Right (TV)|publisher=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trina Vond'ray Jeffrie''' (born June 2, 1962) is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]] and [[actress]]. She is best known for her alter ego ''Sister Cantaloupe.''

==Biography==

Jeffrie has been a professional comedian for more than twenty years. Jeffrie came from a broken and troubled home life. Due to her mother's illnesses Jeffrie was raised by her aunts and various other relatives. She began her career in the churches doing skits and joining her church choir. After her mother's death Jeffrie's tried to deal with the situation and eventually tried to commit suicide. She rallied and became more ingrained into the church scene.&lt;ref name="Jeffrie's Biography"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffrie|first=Trina|title=Trina Jeffrie Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sister-cantaloupe-mn0000746194|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sister Cantaloupe==
[[File:Sister Cantaloupe.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Trina Jeffrie as Sister Cantaloupe]]
Sister Cantaloupe is depicted by Jeffrie as a product of the church. She is a church big mouth and gossip that usually utilizes a cellphone to talk on during her live performances while wearing attire associated with church going women. Jeffrie likens Cantaloupe to one of the former [[Carol Burnett]] characters in which Burnett plays an old meddling woman. According to Jeffrie she got the name for Sister Cantaloupe after being asked what her character would be called. She said she looked over at a fruit bowl and saw a cantaloupe and that's how it came to be. Cantaloupe has made appearances with such notables as the Rhema Conferences and the Bobby Jones Show. She released her first album, Go! Cantaloupe! Go! in 1996, and followed it with 1999's Laffin Out Loud With The Lord.&lt;ref name="The Birth of Sister Cantaloupe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cantaloupe|first=Sister|title=Jeffrie's explains Cantaloupe|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sister-cantaloupe-mn0000746194|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

A [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] serial killer in a [[bondage suit]] is running amok in [[Palm City, San Diego|Palm City]], murdering stage actresses who moonlight as [[BDSM]] prostitutes. Assigned to the case are Detectives Lisa Ryder and Harry Shine, who are under pressure to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible in order to appease the ruthless Mayor Angela Harris. As the duo's investigation progresses, they uncover a number of different suspects, including a misogynist fellow officer named Willy Scalia, a [[cross-dressing]] mayor's aide named Devon McClain, a charitable preacher named Reverend Dimsdale, and a professional photographer named Michael Walker.

Lisa begins dating Michael in secret, which leads to her suspension from the force when mounting circumstantial evidence points towards him being "Zipperface". After a warrant is put out for Michael's arrest, he and Lisa go to confront Reverend Dimsdale, having realized that he is in some way connected to all of Zipperface's victims, possibly acting as a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] for the sex workers who he was supposed to be helping find God. The two discover the reverend dead from a slit throat, and question one of his prostitutes, who informs them that Dimsdale had earlier called her, begging her not to go to her appointment with a new "John".

Lisa and Michael follow the directions that the prostitute had been given to an abandoned warehouse that contains Zipperface's sex dungeon, unaware that they are being tailed by Detective Shine. Zipperface wounds Michael and attempts to strangle Lisa, but she is saved when Michael recovers and stabs Zipperface with his own machete, incapacitating him long enough for Shine to arrive with both backup and Mayor Harris. Zipperface is unmasked to reveal that he is the mayor's husband, Brewster. After her husband rants about how feelings of [[emasculation]] drove him to dominate and eventually murder prostitutes, the distraught Mayor Harris, realizing that her political career is now over, pulls out a gun and shoots Brewster.

== Reception ==

''Zipperface'' was heavily criticized by ''[[TV Guide]]'', which condemned it as a cross between "female exploitation and [[Feminism|feminist]]-bashing" that was "low-grade in all departments, not just [[Identity politics|gender politics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tvguide.com/movies/zipperface/review/129436/|title = ''Zipperface''|publisher = ''[[TV Guide]]''|website = tvguide.com|accessdate = 19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was similarly derided by Todd Martin of Horror News, who wrote, "Not only is it unoriginal and poorly-written, it also has some of the worst acting I have seen in a very long time and is just a mighty bad movie in general in every conceivable way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/97733/film-review-zipperface-1992/|title = Film Review: ''Zipperface'' (1992)|last = Martin|first = Todd|publisher = Horror News|date = 30 April 2015|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
