The {{nihongo|'''Arimine Dam'''|有峰ダム|Arimine Damu}} is located in [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]], [[Toyama Prefecture]], [[Japan]] built upon the Wada River.  The two bends in the middle of the dam is the most defining feature.  The '''Arimine Lake''' is an [[artificial lake]] that was created by construction of the dam.

==History==
The tributaries of the [[Jōganji River]] were found to be very attractive for hydroelectric power in the early 20th century due to their high flow and mountainous geography.  This caught the attention of the electric utility of the time, the [[Etchū Province|Etchu]] Electric Power Company, and for the purpose of electricity built a dam on the [[Wada River]].  At around the same time the [[Toyama Prefecture]] was considering a dam for purposes of flood control and irrigation.  Construction of a prefecture managed dam began before [[World War II]] but the start of the war halted construction.  Later, the [[Hokuriku Electric Power Company]] inherited the unfinished dam due to restructuring of the power companies.  The plans changed to make the primary purpose of the dam electricity production and was finished in the 50s.  It now contributes to electric power as well as irrigation and flood control.

==Biography==
Dr. Arthur Nozik received his bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the Cornell University in 1959, and he earned his PhD from Yale University in 1967. In 1967, he discovered a new transparent conductor (Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;X. Wu, P. Sheldon, T.J. Coutts, D.H. Rose,
and H. Moutinho; [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.42 ''Application of Cd2SnO4Transparent Conducting Oxides in CdS/CdTe''] Introduction, p2&lt;/ref&gt;
Thin-Film Devices, which helped develop new applications for solar energy devices. Then he did research on quantization effects in semiconductor quantum dots,  for the Allied Chemical Corporation and the American Cyanamid Corporation. He then worked as a group leader of Photoelectrochemistry from 1974 to 1978. He worked in both these places until 1978, when he joined the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). He has published a little over 150 research papers related to solar cell, quantum dot, semiconductor, silicon solar cells. He has been an editor of The Journal of Physical Chemistry since 1993 and served as Senior Editor. He has reviewed numerous papers for various scientific magazines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/research_fellows/nozik.html National Renewable Energy Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nozik, Arthur J. (1996) Martin Karplus Editorial Note, ''J. Phys. Chem.'', 100 (7), pp 2457–2457&lt;/ref&gt;

==His research includes the following==
*The effects of size quantization on semiconductor nanocrystals
*The nanostructures of quantum dots, wells and how well they can convert solar photons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/19256/page1/ MIT Technology Review: ''Silicon Nanocrystals for Superefficient Solar Cells'']&lt;/ref&gt;

is a chemical-like system that usually consists of objects, called molecules, that interact according to rules resembling chemical reaction rules. Artificial chemistries are created and studied in order to understand fundamental properties of chemical systems, including prebiotic evolution, as well as for developing chemical computing systems. Artificial chemistry is a field within computer science wherein chemical reactions—often biochemical ones—are computer-simulated, yielding insights on evolution, self-assembly, and other biochemical phenomena. The field does not use actual chemicals, and should not be confused with either synthetic chemistry or computational chemistry. Rather, bits of information are used to represent the starting molecules, and the end products are examined along with the processes that led to them. The field originated in [[artificial life]] but has shown to be a versatile method with applications in many fields such as [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]].

An artificial chemistry is defined in general as a triple (S,R,A). In some cases it is sufficient to define it as a tuple (S,I).

*S is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of possible molecules S={s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}, where n is the number of elements in the set, possibly infinite.
*R is a set of [[arity|n-ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on the molecules in S, the reaction rules R={r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}. Each rule r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is written like a chemical reaction a+b+c-&gt;a*+b*+c*. Note here that r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are operators, as opposed to +.
*A is an [[algorithm]] describing how to apply the rules R to a [[subset]] P&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;S.
*I are the interaction rules of the molecules in S.

==Types of artificial chemistries==

* depending on the space of possible molecules
** finite
** infinite
* depending on the type of reactions
** catalytic systems
** reactive systems
** inhibitive systems
* depending on the space topology
** well stirred reactor
** topologically arranged (1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional)

==Important concepts==
* The field is heavily reliant on mathematics, to include mathematical modeling. It in fact relies more on a mathematics background than a chemistry background.
* Organizations: An organization is a set of molecules that is closed and self-maintaining. As such, it is a set that does not create anything outside itself, and such that any molecule inside the set can be generated within the set.
* Closed sets
* Self-maintaining sets
* Hasse diagram of organizations

==History of artificial chemistries==

Artificial chemistries emerged as a sub-field of [[artificial life]], in particular from [[strong artificial life]]. The idea behind this field was that if one wanted to build something alive, it had to be done by a combination of non-living entities. For instance, a cell is itself alive, and yet is a combination of non-living molecules. Artificial chemistry enlists, among others, researchers that believe in an extreme bottom-up approach to artificial life. In artificial life, bits of information were used to represent bacteria or members of a species, each of which moved, multiplied, or died in computer simulations. In artificial chemistry  bits of information are used to represent starting molecules capable of reacting with one another. The field has pertained to artificial intelligence by virtue of the fact that, over billions of years, non-living matter evolved into primordial life forms which in turn evolved into intelligent life forms.

==Important contributors==

The first reference about Artificial Chemistries come from a Technical paper written by [[John McCaskill]]
.&lt;ref&gt;J.S.McCaskill. Polymer chemistry on tape: A computational model for emergent genetics. Technical report, MPI for Biophysical Chemistry, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Fontana]] working with [[Leo Buss]] then took up the work developing the [[AlChemy model]]
&lt;ref&gt;W. Fontana. Algorithmic chemistry. In C. G. Langton, C. Taylor, J. D. Farmer, and S. Rasmussen, editors, Artificial Life II, pages 159–210. Westview Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name="FB1994"&gt;W. Fontana and L. Buss. “The arrival of the fittest”: Toward a theory of biological organization. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 56(1):1–64, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
The model was presented at the second International Conference of Artificial Life.
In his first papers he presented the concept of [[organization]], as a set of molecules that is algebraically closed and self-maintaining.
This concept was further developed by Dittrich and Speroni di Fenizio into a theory of chemical organizations
&lt;ref&gt;P. Dittrich, P. Speroni di Fenizio. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-006-9130-8 Chemical Organization Theory]. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2007) 69: 1199:1231.&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;P. Speroni di Fenizio. Chemical Organization Theory. PhD thesis, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main schools of artificial chemistries have been in Japan and Germany.
In Japan the main researchers have been [[Takashi Ikegami]]
,&lt;ref&gt;T. Ikegami and T. Hashimoto. Active mutation in self-reproducing networks of machines and tapes. Artificial Life, 2(3):305–318, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], it was [[Wolfgang Banzhaf]], who, together with his students [[Peter Dittrich]] and [[Jens Ziegler]], developed various artificial chemistry models.
Their 2001 paper 'Artificial Chemistries - A Review' &lt;ref name="DZB2001" /&gt; became a standard in the field.
[[Jens Ziegler]], as part of his PhD thesis, proved that an artificial chemistry could be used to control a small Khepera robot
.&lt;ref&gt;J.Ziegler and W.Banzhaf. Evolving control metabolisms for a robot. ArtificialLife, 7(2):171–190, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other models, [[Peter Dittrich]] developed the [[Seceder model]] which is able to explain group formation in society through some simple rules. Since then he became a professor in [[Jena]] where he investigates artificial chemistries as a way to define a general theory of [[constructive dynamical system]]s.

==Applications of artificial chemistries==

Artificial Chemistries are often used in the study of protobiology, in trying to bridge the gap between [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].
A further motivation to study artificial chemistries is the interest in constructive dynamical systems. Yasuhiro Suzuki has modeled various systems such as membrane systems, signaling pathways (P53), ecosystems, and enzyme systems by using his method, abstract rewriting system on multisets (ARMS).

[[File:Reliure bibliothèque de la Pléiade.jpg|thumb|A book of the ''[[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]''. The thinness of bible paper allows books with a large number of pages to remain fairly compact.]]

'''Bible paper''', also known as scritta paper, is a thin grade of [[paper]] used for printing [[book]]s which have a large number of pages, such as a [[dictionary]]. Technically it is called ''lightweight offset paper'' and is a type of [[woodfree uncoated paper]]. This paper grade often contains [[cotton]] or [[linen]] fibres to increase its strength in spite of its thinness.

It is used for making [[Bible]]s, [[encyclopedia]]s and [[Dictionary|dictionaries]]; as well as some fiction books such as the ones published by the ''[[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]''. The ''[[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' is also known for using Bible paper (an essayist from ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to it as "wispy [[cigarette paper]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/books/review/08donadio.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Keeper of the Canon]&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''The Canadian Environmental Law Association''' (CELA) is a [[non-profit]], public interest organization established in 1970 to use existing [[laws]] to protect the environment and to advocate environmental law reforms.  It is also a free legal advisory clinic for the public, and will act at hearings and in courts on behalf of citizens or citizens' groups who are otherwise unable to afford legal assistance. Funded by [[Legal Aid]] [[Ontario]], CELA is one of 79 community legal clinics located across Ontario, 15 of which offer services in specialized areas of the law. CELA also undertakes additional educational and law reform projects funded by [[government]] and [[private foundations]].  CELA was established at the same time as its sister organization the [[Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy]], which does not offer Legal Aid services but focuses on policy related to emerging and neglected environmental issues.

An '''electric vehicle charging station''', also called '''EV charging station''', '''electric recharging point''', '''charging point''', '''charge point''', '''ECS''' (Electronic Charging Station) and '''EVSE''' (electric vehicle supply equipment), is an element in an infrastructure that supplies [[electric energy]] for the recharging of [[electric vehicle]]s, such as [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s, including [[electric car]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s and [[plug-in hybrid]]s. At home or work, some electric vehicles have onboard converters that can plug into a standard electrical outlet or a high-capacity appliance outlet. Others either require or can use a charging station that provides electrical conversion, monitoring, or safety functionality. These stations are also needed when traveling, and many support faster charging at higher [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]] than are available from residential EVSEs. Public charging stations are typically on-street facilities provided by electric utility companies or located at retail shopping centers and operated by many private companies.

Charging stations provide one or a range of heavy duty or special connectors that conform to the variety of competing standards.  Common rapid charging standards include the [[Combined Charging System]], [[CHAdeMO]], and the [[Tesla Supercharger]].

{{As of|2018|August}}, there were 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/reports/14198-utilities-states-work-together-to-expand-ev-charging-infrastructure/|title=Utilities, states work together to expand EV charging infrastructure - Daily Energy Insider|date=2018-08-13|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==
[[File:Seattle City Light Superintendent Gordon Vickery with prototype electric car, 1973 (34772918810).jpg|thumb|upright|Charging station with [[NEMA connector]] for electric [[AMC Gremlin]] used by [[Seattle City Light]] in 1973]]

Charging stations fall into four basic contexts:

# Residential charging stations: An EV owner plugs in when he or she returns home, and the car recharges overnight.  A home charging station usually has no user authentication, no metering, and may require wiring a dedicated circuit.  Some portable chargers can also be wall mounted as charging stations.
# Charging while parked (including public charging stations) – a commercial venture for a fee or free, offered in partnership with the owners of the parking lot. This charging may be slow or high speed and encourages EV owners to recharge their cars while they take advantage of nearby facilities. It can include parking stations, parking at malls, small centers, and train stations (or for a business's own employees).
# Fast charging at public charging stations &gt;40&amp;nbsp;kW, delivering over 60&amp;nbsp;miles (100&amp;nbsp;km) of range in 10–30 minutes. These chargers may be at rest stops to allow for longer distance trips. They may also be used regularly by commuters in metropolitan areas, and for charging while parked for shorter or longer periods. Common examples are [[CHAdeMO]] (a company that designs and sells standardized chargers), SAE [[Combined Charging System]], and [[Tesla Supercharger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fleetcarma.com/dc-fast-charging-guide/ |title=A Simple Guide to DC Fast Charging|author=|work=Fleetcarma.com |accessdate=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Battery swaps or charges in under 15 minutes. A specified target for [[CARB]] credits for a zero-emission vehicle is adding 200&amp;nbsp;miles to its range in under 15 minutes. In 2014, this was not possible for charging electric vehicles, but it is achievable with EV battery swaps and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. It intends to match the refueling expectations of regular drivers.

Battery capacity and the capability of handling faster charging are both increasing, and methods of charging have needed to change and improve. New options have also been introduced (on a small scale, including mobile charging stations and charging via [[inductive charging]] mats). The differing needs and solutions of various manufacturers has slowed the emergence of standard charging methods, and &lt;span&gt;in 2015, there is a strong recognition of the need for standardization.&lt;/span&gt;

===Safety===

Although the rechargeable electric vehicles and equipment can be recharged from a domestic [[wall socket]], a charging station is usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and has additional current or connection sensing  mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.

There are two main types of safety sensor:
* [[Current sensor]]s which monitor the power consumed, and maintain the connection only if the demand is within a predetermined range. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can readily provide an option for suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* Additional physical "sensor wires" which provide a [[feedback]] signal such as specified by the undermentioned [[SAE J1772]] and [[IEC 62196]] schemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.

Until 2013, there was an issue where [[ECOtality#Charging stations|Blink chargers]] were overheating and causing damage to both charger and car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/honda-fit-ev-overheats-blink-charger-126246.html|title=Honda Fit EV|work=PluginCars.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colbytrudeau.com/2012/12/30/dont-blink/|title=Don’t Blink… – A Perfect Fit|work=A Perfect Fit|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The solution employed by the company was to reduce the maximum current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/20/ecotality-trying-to-fix-charging-station-problems-by-reducing-po/|title=Ecotality trying to fix charging station problems by reducing power|author=Danny King|work=Autoblog|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
The US based [[SAE International|SAE]] defines Level 1 charging as using a standard 120&amp;nbsp;volt [[Volts alternating current|AC]] house outlet to charge an electric vehicle. This will take a long time to fully charge the car but if only used to commute or travel short distances, a full charge is not needed or can be done overnight.&lt;ref name="Plug In America"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pluginamerica.org/understanding-electric-vehicle-charging/|title=Understanding Electric Vehicle Charging - Plug In America|date=2011-01-31|work=Plug In America|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

240&amp;nbsp;volt [[alternating current|AC]] charging is known as Level 2 charging. Level 2 charging is similar to household appliances such as [[clothes drier]]s. Level 2 chargers range from chargers installed in consumer garages, to relatively slow public chargers. They can charge an electric car battery in 4–6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evtown.org/about-ev-town/ev-charging/charging-levels.html|title=Levels of Charging - EVTown|last=Administrator|website=www.evtown.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Level 2 chargers are often placed at destinations so that drivers can charge their car while at work or shopping. Level 2 home chargers are best for drivers who use their vehicles more often or require more flexibility. In many countries outside of North and South America, this is the standard household voltage.

Level 3 charging, also known as DC fast charging, supports charging up to 500&amp;nbsp;volts. The organization [[CHAdeMO]] is working to standardize fast chargers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chademo.com/about-us/what-is-fast-charging/|title=What is Fast Charging – Chademo Association|website=www.chademo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Level 3 chargers use a 480 V plug delivering 62.5 [[kW]] (peak power can be as much as 120 kW and is varied across the charge. The [[Tesla Supercharger]] is the most ubiquitous in the United States.{{when?|date=September 2018}} For a [[Tesla Model S|Tesla Model S 75]], a supercharger can add around {{convert|170|miles|km|abbr=in|round=5|order=flip}} of range in about 30 minutes or a full charge in around 75 minutes.&lt;ref name="Plug In America"/&gt; As of April 2018, Tesla reports that they have 1,210 supercharging stations and is continuously expanding the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/supercharger|title=Supercharger {{!}} Tesla|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another standards organization, The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], defines charging in ''[[IEC 62196#Charging modes|modes]]'' (IEC 62196).
* ''Mode 1'' – slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or [[three-phase]])
* ''Mode 2'' – slow charging from a regular socket but with some EV specific protection arrangement (e.g., the [[Park &amp; Charge]] or the PARVE systems)
* ''Mode 3'' – slow or fast charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (e.g., [[SAE J1772]] and [[IEC 62196]])
* ''Mode 4'' – [[Charging station#Fast charging|fast charging]] using some special charger technology such as [[CHAdeMO]]

There are three connection ''cases'':
* ''Case A'' is any charger connected to the mains (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.
* ''Case B'' is an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable which can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle – usually mode 3.
* ''Case C'' is a dedicated charging station with DC supply to the vehicle. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge-station such as in mode 4.

There are four plug ''types'':
* ''Type 1'' – single-phase vehicle coupler – reflecting the [[SAE J1772]]/2009 automotive plug specifications
* ''Type 2'' – single- and three-phase vehicle coupler – reflecting the [[IEC 62196#Type 2: VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2|VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2]] plug specifications
* ''Type 3'' – single- and three-phase vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters – reflecting the [[EV Plug Alliance]] proposal
* ''Type 4'' – fast charge coupler – for special systems such as [[CHAdeMO]]

For [[Combined Charging System]] (CCS) DC charging which requires PLC (Powerline Communications), two extra connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to connect high voltage DC charging stations to the battery of the vehicle. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of Combo 1 or Combo 2 style inlets is normally standardised on a per-country basis, so that public charging providers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2 style vehicle inlets for CCS.

==Residential charging==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

===Mode 1: Domestic socket and extension cord===
{{multiple image

 |align     = right
 |width     = 225
 |image1    = Mode1.JPG
 |image2    = Mode2.JPG
 |image3    = Mode3.JPG

 |caption3  = '''Mode 3 :''' Fixed, dedicated circuit-socket
 |caption4  = '''Mode 4 :''' DC Connection
}}

The vehicle is connected to the power grid through standard socket-outlets present in residences, which depending on the country are usually rated at around 10 A. To use mode 1, the electrical installation must comply with the safety regulations and must have an earthing system, a circuit breaker to protect against overload and an earth leakage protection. The sockets have blanking devices to prevent accidental contacts.

The first limitation is the available power, to avoid risks of:
* Heating of the socket and cables following intensive use for several hours at or near the maximum power (which varies from 8 to 20&amp;nbsp;A depending on the country).
* Fire or electric injury risks if the electrical installation is obsolete or if certain protective devices are absent.
The second limitation is related to the installation's power management.
* As the charging socket shares a feeder from the switchboard with other sockets (no dedicated circuit) if the sum of consumptions exceeds the protection limit (in general 16&amp;nbsp;A), the circuit-breaker will trip, stopping the charging.

===Mode 2: Domestic socket and cable with a protection device===

The vehicle is connected to the main power grid via household socket-outlets. Charging is done via a single-phase or three-phase network and installation of an earthing cable. A protection device is built into the cable. This solution is more expensive than Mode 1 due to the specificity of the cable.

===Mode 3: Specific socket on a dedicated circuit===

The vehicle is connected directly to the electrical network via specific socket and plug and a dedicated circuit. A control and protection function is also installed permanently in the installation. This is the only charging mode that meets the applicable standards regulating electrical installations.{{which|date=April 2018}} It also allows [[load shedding]] so that electrical household appliances can be operated during vehicle charging or on the contrary optimise the electric vehicle charging time.

===Mode 4: Direct current (DC) connection for fast recharging===

The electric vehicle is connected to the main power grid through an external charger. Control and protection functions and the vehicle charging cable are installed permanently in the installation.

Charging stations for electric vehicles may not need much new [[infrastructure]] in developed countries, less than delivering a new alternative fuel over a new network.&lt;ref name="calcars.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/976.html |title=Plug-In 2008: Company News: GM/V2Green/Coulomb/Google/HEVT/PlugInSupply |date=2008-07-28 |publisher=[[CalCars]] |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous [[electrical grid]] and home recharging is an option. For example, polls have shown that more than half of homeowners in the United States have access to a plug to charge their cars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Also most driving is local over short distances which reduces the need for charging mid-trip. In the USA, for example, 78% of commutes are less than {{convert|40|mi}} round-trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, longer drives between cities and towns require a network of public charging stations or another method to extend the range of electric vehicles beyond the normal daily commute. One challenge in such infrastructure is the level of demand: an isolated station along a busy highway may see hundreds of customers per hour if every passing electric vehicle has to stop there to complete the trip. In the first half of the 20th century, internal combustion vehicles faced a similar infrastructure problem.

===Charging time===
[[File:2014 BYD E6.jpg|thumb|[[BYD e6]]. Recharging in 15 Minutes to 80 Percent]]
[[File:BSVAG Solaris Urbino 12 electric "EMIL" Hauptbahnhof.jpg|thumb|[[Solaris Urbino]] 12 electric, [[battery electric bus]], inductive charging station]]

The charging time depends on the battery capacity and the charging power. In simple terms, the time rate of charge depends on the [[charging level]] used, and the charging level depends on the voltage handling of the batteries and charger electronics in the car. The US based [[SAE International|SAE]] defines Level 1 (household 120 [[Volts alternating current|VAC]]) as the slowest, Level 2 (upgraded household 240 VAC) in the middle and Level 3 (super charging, 480 [[Volts direct current|VDC]] or higher) as the fastest. Level 3 charge time can be as fast as 30 minutes for an 80% charge, although there has been serious industry competition about whose standard should be widely adopted. Charge time can be calculated using the formula: ''Charging Time [h] = Battery Capacity [kWh] / Charging Power [kW]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.homechargingstations.com/buy-ev-home-charging-station/ |title=Guide to buy the right EV home charging station |publisher=Home Charging Stations |location=US |date=2018-01-03 |access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery capacity of a fully charged electric vehicle from electric vehicle automakers (such as Nissan) is about 20&amp;nbsp;kWh, providing it with an electrical autonomy of about 100 miles. [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] initially released their Model S with battery capacities of 40&amp;nbsp;kWh, 60&amp;nbsp;kWh and 85&amp;nbsp;kWh with the latter having an estimated range of approximately 480&amp;nbsp;km; as of January 2018 they have two models, 75&amp;nbsp;kWh and 100&amp;nbsp;kWh. Plug in hybrid vehicles have capacity of roughly 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;kWh, for an electrical autonomy of 20 to 40 kilometers, but the gasoline engine ensures the full autonomy of a conventional vehicle.

As the electric-only autonomy is still limited, the vehicle has to be charged every two or three days on average. In practice, drivers plug in their vehicles each night, thus starting each day with a full charge.

For normal charging (up to 7.4&amp;nbsp;kW), car manufacturers have built a battery charger into the car. A charging cable is used to connect it to the electrical network to supply 230&amp;nbsp;volt AC current. For quicker charging (22&amp;nbsp;kW, even 43&amp;nbsp;kW and more), manufacturers have chosen two solutions:
* Use the vehicle's built-in charger, designed to charge from 3 to 43&amp;nbsp;kW at 230&amp;nbsp;V single-phase or 400&amp;nbsp;V three-phase.
* Use an external charger, which converts AC current into DC current and charges the vehicle at 50&amp;nbsp;kW (e.g. [[Nissan Leaf]]) or more (e.g. 120-135&amp;nbsp;kW [[Tesla Model S]]).

The user finds charging an electric vehicle as simple as connecting a normal electrical appliance; however to ensure that this operation takes place in complete safety, the charging system must perform several safety functions and dialogue with the vehicle during connection and charging.

=== Costs ===
Tesla currently gives the owners of its Model S and Model X cars a supercharging credit that gives 400 kWh for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/supercharger|title=Supercharger {{!}} Tesla|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that credit is used, drivers using Tesla Superchargers have to pay per kWh. The price ranges from $0.06 to $0.26 per kWh in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/support/supercharging|title=Supercharging|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of Tesla superchargers is that they are only usable by Tesla vehicles. Other charging networks are available for non-Tesla vehicles. The Blink network of chargers has both Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers and charges separate rates for members and non members. Their prices range from $0.39 to $0.69 per kWh for members and $0.49 to $0.79 per kWh for non members, depending on location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blinkcharging.com/ev-charging-fee|title=Electric Vehicle Charging {{!}} United States {{!}} Blink CarCharging|website=Electric Vehicle Charging {{!}} United States {{!}} Blink CarCharging|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ChargePoint network has free chargers and paid chargers that drivers activate with a free membership card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chargepoint.com/support/driver-faq/|title=Driver FAQ|website=ChargePoint|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paid charging stations' prices are based on local rates (similarly to Blink). Other networks use similar payment methods as typical gas stations, in which one pays with cash or a credit card per kWh of electricity.

==Deployment of public charging stations==
{{details|topic=the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government|electric vehicle network}}
Currently charging stations are being installed by public authorities, commercial enterprises and some major employers in order to stimulate the market for vehicles that use alternative fuels to gasoline and diesel fuels. For this reason, most charge stations are currently either provided gratis or accessible to members of certain groups without significant charge (e.g. activated by a free "membership card" or by a digital "day code").

===Locations===
Charging stations can be found and will be needed where there is on-street parking, at [[taxi stand]]s, in [[parking lot]]s (at places of employment, hotels, airports, [[shopping center]]s, [[convenience shop]]s, [[fast food restaurant]]s, [[coffeehouse]]s etc.), as well as in the workplaces, in driveways and [[garage (house)|garages]] at home. Existing [[filling station]]s may also incorporate charging stations. {{asof|2017}}, charging stations have been criticized for being inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow&lt;!--50kW--&gt;; thus reducing EV expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://cleantechnica.com/2017/07/22/tesla-superchargers-vs-ugh/ |title=Tesla Superchargers vs … Ugh |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |work=CleanTechnica |date=22 July 2017 |accessdate=23 July 2017 |quote=needs to be done to make a charging network or just individual charging stations adequate for EV drivers .. plenty of complaints about such inaccessible charging stations .. it can take what seems like ages to actually find the station because of how invisible it is .. some charging stations are down 50% of the time ..

{{Main|Electric vehicle network}}
Electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into many agreements and ventures to promote and provide [[electric vehicle network]]s of public charging stations.

The [[EV Plug Alliance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evplugalliance.org/|title=EVPlug Alliance|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an association of 21 European manufacturers which proposes an alternative connecting solution. The project is to impose an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] norm and to adopt a European standard for the connection solution with sockets and plugs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Members ([[Schneider Electric]], Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) argue that the system is safer because they use shutters. General consensus is that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 already have taken care of safety by making parts non-live when touchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mennekes.in/in/latest0.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=883&amp;cHash=143015f2385ea4fe930d04795b919cce|title=MENNEKES – Plugs for the world: The solution for Europe: type 2 charging sockets with or without shutter|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEC6216-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEC61851-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feud===
Reports emerged in late July 2013 of a significant conflict between the companies responsible for the two types of charging plugs. The Japanese-developed [[CHAdeMO]] standard is favored by [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Toyota]], while the Society of Automotive Engineers’ (SAE) International [[SAE J1772|J1772]] Combo standard is backed by [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA]], [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford]], [[Volkswagen]], and [[BMW]]. Both are direct-current quick-charging systems designed to charge the battery of an electric vehicle to 80 percent in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are completely incompatible. In light of an ongoing feud between the two groups, experts in the field warned that the momentum of the electric vehicle market will be severely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EV market threatened by spat over charger standards|url=http://grist.org/news/ev-market-threatened-by-spat-over-charger-standards/?sub_email=sundaybottle%40hotmail.com|work=Grist.org|publisher=Grist Magazine, Inc|accessdate=2013-07-29|author=John Upton|date=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Julia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charger standards fight confuses electric vehicle buyers, puts car company investments at risk|url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059984950|work=ClimateWire|publisher=E&amp;E Publishing, LL|accessdate=2013-07-29|author=Juliet Pyper|date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fast charging, however and whenever it gets built out, is going to be key for the development of a mainstream market for plug-in electric vehicles. The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.&lt;ref name="Julia" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of September 16, 2013, a standard does not exist in Australia for charging connectors. Australia’s first fast-DC charging stations follow the Japanese CHAdeMO standard.&lt;ref name="Tom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Setting the standard: Australia must choose an electric car charging norm|url=http://theconversation.com/setting-the-standard-australia-must-choose-an-electric-car-charging-norm-16277|accessdate=2013-09-16|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=2013-09-16|author=Thomas Bräunl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EV charging station signs===
In the United States, the standard charging station sign is defined in the Federal Highway Administration's ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices'' (MUTCD) 2009 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MUTCD 2009 Edition, Original, dated December 2009 (PDF) – FHWA MUTCD|url = http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/pdf_index.htm|website = mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov|accessdate=2015-06-02}} - See two examples of "D9-11b  Electric Vehicle Charging" and "D9-11bP Electric Vehicle Charging" at "Figure 2I-1. General Service Signs and Plaques", page 301, Sect. 2I.02&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, FHWA released interim MUTCD approval for charging station signs located on public roads governed by MUTCD standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MUTCD – Regulatory Signs for Electric Vehicle Charging and Parking Facilities Memorandum – FHWA MUTCD|url = http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/policy/rsevcpfmemo/|website = mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov|accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an open source, public domain European charge station sign proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evinfra.org|title=ニキビが出来やすいクセ、食べ物紹介ブログ|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716164911/http://evinfra.org/|archivedate=2015-07-16|df=}}{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Block heater power supplies===
In colder areas such as Finland, some northern US states and Canada there already exists some infrastructure for public power outlets provided primarily for use by [[block heater]]s and set with [[circuit breaker]]s that prevent large current draws for other uses. These can sometimes be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|publisher=[[Manitoba Hydro]]
|quote=Manitobans' experience with cold weather and plugging in their vehicles will help ease the transition to adopting PEVs. In some circumstances, the existing infrastructure used to power vehicle block heaters in the winter can also be used to provide limited charging for PEVs. However, some existing electrical outlets may not be suitable for PEV charging. Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all. If a parking stall is not specifically designated for PEV use, we recommend that you consult with the parking lot or building manager to ensure it can provide adequate power to your vehicle.

==Battery swapping==
A battery swapping (or switching) station is a place at which a vehicle's discharged battery or battery pack can be immediately swapped for a fully charged one, eliminating the delay involved in waiting for the vehicle's battery to charge.

Battery swapping is common in warehouses using electric [[forklift truck]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://us.simplenewz.com/industrial-electrical-vehicle-stalwarts-head-out-on-the-road--2009-03-08--ars-technica--30.672.7| title=Industrial electrical vehicle stalwarts head out on the road| access-date=2010-10-24| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716072151/http://us.simplenewz.com/industrial-electrical-vehicle-stalwarts-head-out-on-the-road--2009-03-08--ars-technica--30.672.7#| archive-date=2011-07-16| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896, in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. It was first put into practice between 1910 and 1924, by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]], through the GeVeCo battery service, and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by [[General Electric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trucking’s Eclipsed Electric Age|url=https://lostannalsoftransport.wordpress.com/tag/geveco/|website=The Lost Annals of Transport|publisher=William B. Cassidy|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through the use of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.

Beginning in 1917, a similar successful service was operated in [[Chicago]] for owners of [[Milburn Electric]] cars, who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.&lt;ref name=HistEV&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]], and [[London]]| year = 2000| pages= 153–162| publisher =[[Rutgers University Press]]| isbn=0-8135-2809-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid battery replacement system was implemented to keep running 50 electric buses at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.bit.edu.cn/NewsEvents/BITNews/16059.htm|title=BIT Attends the Delivery Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games -Alternative Fuel Vehicles|date=2008-07-18|publisher=Beijing Institute of Technology |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] have been involved with integrating battery switch technology with their electric vehicles to extend driving range.&lt;ref name=SwapModelS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/04/29/report-mitsubishi-working-on-battery-swapping-for-transit-buses/ |title=Mitsubishi working on battery swapping for transit buses, Better Place not involved}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a battery switch station, the driver does not need to get out of the car while the battery is swapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-solution-switch-stations |title=Better Place.

However, electric vehicle manufacturers working on battery switch technology have not standardized on battery access, attachment, dimension, location, or type.

In 2013, [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] announced a proprietary charging station service to support owners of Tesla vehicles. A network of [[Tesla Supercharger]] stations was supposed to support both battery pack swaps for the Model S, along with the more-widespread [[fast charger|fast charging]] capability for both the Model S and the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]].&lt;ref name=ya20130621&gt;{{cite news |last=Siler| first=Steve| title=Tesla launches battery-swapping service for two-minute recharging |url=http://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/tesla-launches-battery-swapping-two-minute-recharging-115343291. |accessdate=2013-06-23 |newspaper=Yahoo Autos |date=2013-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svmn20130621&gt;{{cite news |last=Green|first=Catherine |title=Tesla shows off its battery-swapping station: 90 seconds and less than $100 |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23511079/tesla-shows-off-its-battery-swapping-station-90 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |newspaper=Silicon Valley Mercury News |date=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tesla has abandoned their battery swap initiatives in favor of rapidly expanding fast-charging stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-shuts-down-battery-swap-program-for-superchargers/|title=Tesla shuts down battery swap program in favor of Superchargers, for now|website=www.teslarati.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision has driven Tesla to be a market-leader in fast charging stations, amounting to 1,210 stations worldwide, as of April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/supercharger|title=Supercharger {{!}} Tesla|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following benefits are claimed for battery swapping:
* Fast battery swapping under five minutes.&lt;ref name=JP240311/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swapping01/&gt;
* Unlimited driving range where there are battery switch stations available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.com/uploads/ckfinder/images/CaliforniaDeployment290x301.png |title=Better Place, California Battery Switch Station Deployment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205080914/http://www.betterplace.com/uploads/ckfinder/images/CaliforniaDeployment290x301.png |archivedate=2010-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The driver does not own the battery in the car, transferring costs over the battery, battery life, maintenance, capital cost, quality, technology, and warranty to the battery switch station company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metrikminute.com/lithium-ion-israel/ | title=Lithium Ion Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about {{USD|850}} million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Fewer than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars had been deployed in Israel and only around 400 units in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/business/global/israeli-electric-car-company-files-for-liquidation.html?_r=0|title=Israeli Venture Meant to Serve Electric Cars Is Ending Its Run|author=Isabel Kershner|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPost052613&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Death-of-Better-Place-Electric-car-co-to-dissolve-314380|title=Death of Better Place: Electric car co. to dissolve |author=Niv Elis|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date=2013-05-26 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Better Place's business model, the company owned the batteries, so the court liquidator had to decide what to do with customers who did not have ownership of the battery and risked being left with a useless car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000846696&amp;fid=1725 |title=Better Place CEO: A missed opportunity |author=Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu |work=[[Globes]] |date=2013-05-26 |accessdate=2013-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609030158/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000846696&amp;fid=1725 |archivedate=2013-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Tesla supercharger}}
[[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] designed its [[Tesla Model S|Model S]] to allow fast battery swapping.&lt;ref name=SwapModelS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/09/27/report-tesla-model-s-being-designed-with-battery-swaps-in-mind/|title=REPORT: Tesla Model S was designed with battery swaps in mind|author=Sebastian Blanco |publisher=[[Autoblog Green]]|date=2009-09-27|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Tesla announced its goal of deploying a battery swapping station in each of its [[Supercharger network|supercharging stations]]. At a demonstration event, Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S took just over 90 seconds, about half the time it takes to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event.&lt;ref name=Swapping01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/06/21/tesla-90-second-battery-swap-tech-coming-this-year/|title=Tesla 90-Second Battery Swap Tech Coming This Year|author=Mark Rogowsky|work=[[Forbes]] |date=2013-06-21|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swapping02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/06/model2-20130621.html|title=Tesla Motors demonstrates battery swap in the Model S|author= |work=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2013-06-21|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stations were planned to be deployed along [[Interstate 5 in California]] because, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. Those stations were to be followed by ones on the [[Washington, DC]] to [[Boston]] corridor. Elon Musk said the service would be offered for the price of about {{convert|15|USgal}} of gasoline at the current local rate, around {{USD|60}} to {{USD|80}} at June 2013 prices. Owners could pick up their battery pack fully charged on the return trip, which was included in the swap fee. Tesla would also offer the option to keep the pack received on the swap and pay the price difference if the battery received was newer, or to receive the original pack back from Tesla for a transport fee. Pricing had not been determined.&lt;ref name=Swapping01/&gt;

In June 2015, Musk indicated that Tesla was likely to abandon its plans to build a network of swap stations. He told his company's shareholders that, despite inviting all Model S owners in the California area to try out the one existing facility, at [[Harris Ranch]], only four or five people had done so. Consequently, it was unlikely that the concept was worth expanding.&lt;ref name="r&amp;t"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorokanich|first1=Robert|date=2015-06-10|title=Musk: Tesla "unlikely" to pursue battery swapping stations|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/news/a25872/elon-musk-tesla-battery-swap/|journal=Road &amp; Track|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Gogoro Energy Network

[[Gogoro]] has announced their intention to launch the Gogoro Energy Network in 2015. The network is built on the idea of distributed GoStations which will serve as battery swapping locations for Gogoro's Smartscooters.

;BattSwap
BattSwap is a new European start-up with battery swap solution. It has a working prototype covered by seed funding received from European angels. Swap station takes only 30 seconds to make a complete swap and is 10x cheaper than Tesla supercharger to build.

=== Voltia ===
Voltia (formerly Greenway Operator) designed and runs proprietary battery swapping stations (BSS) in Slovakia for switching the batteries in [[light commercial vehicle]]s.  The stations have been in successful commercial operation since 2012.

Voltia's BSS are drive up/drive in station, with a house for a number of batteries to be charged simultaneously. The structure allows drivers to pull up and, using a hydraulic lift, switch their used battery with a new, fully charged one in under 7 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Voltia Group|title=The GreenWay business model|date=2015-06-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpjM89SNQYY&amp;t=15s|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A computer system notifies drivers where to dock their old battery and which new one to take.

The batteries come in a variety of sizes (40-90kWh), which offer different useful ranges (160–270&amp;nbsp;km).

;Criticism
{{See also|Open hardware}}
These battery swapping solution have been criticized for being proprietary. By creating a monopoly regarding the ownership of the batteries and the patent protected technologies the companies split up the market and decrease the chances of a wider usage of battery swapping.&lt;ref name=Criticism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-57590471-48/tesla-battery-swap-a-dead-end/|title=Tesla battery swap a dead end|author= |work= |date=2013-06-21|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart grid communication===
Recharging a large battery pack presents a high load on the electrical grid, but this can be scheduled for periods of reduced load or reduced electricity costs. In order to schedule the recharging, either the charging station or the vehicle can communicate with the [[smart grid]]. Some plug-in vehicles allow the vehicle operator to control recharging through a web interface or smartphone app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-motors-introduces-free-app-model-s-sedan-126356.html |title=Tesla Motors Introduces Mobile App for Model S Sedan |date=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a [[vehicle-to-grid]] scenario the vehicle battery can supply energy to the grid at periods of peak demand. This requires additional communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle electronics. [[SAE International]] is developing a range of standards for energy transfer to and from the grid including SAE J2847/1 "Communication between Plug-in Vehicles and the Utility Grid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/smartgrid/sae-standards-activities-phev.pdf |title=SAE Ground Vehicle Standards Status of work – PHEV + |date=January 2010 |publisher=[[SAE International]] |pages=1–7 |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO and IEC are also developing a similar series of standards known as ISO/IEC 15118: "Road vehicles -- Vehicle to grid communication interface".

===Renewable electricity and RE charging stations===
{{See also|Solar-charged vehicle}}

Charging stations are usually connected to the [[electrical grid]], which often means that their electricity originates from [[fossil-fuel power station]]s or [[nuclear power plant]]s. [[Solar power]] is also suitable for electric vehicles. Nidec Industrial Solutions has designed a system that can be powered by either the grid or renewable energy sources like PV (50-320&amp;nbsp;kW). [[SolarCity]] is marketing its solar energy systems along with electric car charging installations. The company has announced a partnership with [[Rabobank]] to make electric car charging available for free to owners of [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] vehicles traveling on [[U.S. Route 101|Highway 101]] between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Other cars that can make use of same charging technology are welcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solarcity-installs-electric-car-chargers-along-cal-highway/|title=SolarCity Installs Electric Car Chargers Along Cal Highway|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;`

====SPARC station====
The SPARC (Solar Powered Automotive ReCharging Station) uses a single custom fabricated [[monocrystalline]] [[solar panel]] capable of producing 2.7&amp;nbsp;kW of peak power to charge pure electric or plug-in hybrid to 80% capacity without drawing electricity from the local grid.  Plans for the SPARC include a non-grid tied system as well as redundancy for tying to the grid through a renewable power plan.  This supports their claim for net-zero driving of electric vehicles.

====E-Move charging station====
The E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76&amp;nbsp;kWp of solar power. With further refinements, the designers are hoping to generate about 2000&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity from the panels over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-tech-e-move-charging-station-fuels-just-about-everything-with-solar-energy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021746/http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-tech-e-move-charging-station-fuels-just-about-everything-with-solar-energy/ |archivedate=2013-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concentrator photovoltaics''' ('''CPV''') (also known as Concentration Photovoltaics) is a [[photovoltaic]] technology that generates electricity from sunlight. Contrary to conventional [[photovoltaic system]]s, it uses [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[curved mirror]]s to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, [[multi-junction]] (MJ) [[solar cells]]. In addition, CPV systems often use [[solar tracker]]s and sometimes a cooling system to further increase their efficiency.&lt;ref name="IEA-roadmap-PV-2014" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of high [[insolation]]. This sort of solar technology can be thus used in smaller areas.

Systems using '''high-concentration photovoltaics''' ('''HCPV''') especially have the potential to become competitive in the near future. They possess the highest efficiency of all existing PV technologies, and a smaller photovoltaic array also reduces the [[balance of system]] costs. Currently, CPV is not used in the PV rooftop segment and is far less common than conventional PV systems. For regions with a high annual direct normal irradiance of 2000 [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) per square meter or more, the [[levelized cost of electricity]] is in the range of $0.08–$0.15 per kWh and installation cost for a 10-megawatt CPV power plant was identified to lie between €1.40–€2.20 (~$1.50-$2.30) per [[watt-peak]] (W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Current-status-FHI-NREL-2015" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

In 2016, cumulative CPV installations reached 350 [[megawatt]]s (MW), less than 0.2% of the global installed capacity of 230,000 MW.&lt;ref name="IEA-roadmap-PV-2014" /&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;ref name="Current-status-FHI-NREL-2015" /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-PR-2014" /&gt;{{rp|21}} Commercial HCPV systems reached instantaneous ("spot") efficiencies of up to 42% under standard test conditions (with concentration levels above 400) &lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-PR-2014" /&gt;{{rp|26}} and the [[International Energy Agency]] sees potential to increase the efficiency of this technology to 50% by the mid-2020s.&lt;ref name="IEA-roadmap-PV-2014" /&gt;{{rp|28}} As of December 2014, the best lab cell efficiency for concentrator MJ-cells reached 46% (four or more junctions). Under outdoor, operating conditions, CPV module efficiencies have exceeded 33% ("one third of a sun").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=G.

HCPV directly competes with [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) as both technologies are suited best for areas with high direct normal irradiance, which are also known as the [[Sun Belt]] region in the United States and the [[Golden Banana]] in Southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-PR-2014" /&gt;{{rp|26}} CPV and CSP are often confused with one another, despite being intrinsically different technologies from the start: CPV uses the [[photovoltaic effect]] to directly generate electricity from sunlight, while CSP – often called ''concentrated solar thermal'' – uses the heat from the sun's radiation in order to make steam to drive a turbine, that then produces electricity using a generator. Currently, CSP is [[Concentrated solar power#Deployment around the world|more common]] than CPV.&lt;ref&gt;PV-insider.com [http://news.pv-insider.com/concentrated-pv/how-cpv-trumps-csp-high-dni-locations How CPV trumps CSP in high DNI locations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122062102/http://news.pv-insider.com/concentrated-pv/how-cpv-trumps-csp-high-dni-locations |date=2014-11-22 }}, 14 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Research into concentrator photovoltaics has taken place since the mid 1970s, initially spurred on by the energy shock from a mideast oil embargo. [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in Albuquerque, New Mexico was the site for most of the early work, with the first modern-like photovoltaic concentrating system produced there late in the decade. Their first system was a linear-trough concentrator system that used a point focus [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] [[Fresnel lens]] focusing on water-cooled silicon cells and two axis tracking. Cell cooling with a passive heat sink and use of silicone-on-glass Fresnel lenses was demonstrated in 1979 by the [[Ramón Areces]] Project at the [http://www.ies.upm.es/| Institute of Solar Energy] of the [[Technical University of Madrid]].  The 350&amp;nbsp;kW SOLERAS project in Saudi Arabia—the largest until many years later—was constructed by Sandia/[[Martin Marietta]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Sala"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-68798-6?no-access=true#page=14 |title=Past Experiences and New Challenges of PV Concentrators, G Sala and A Luque, Springer Series in Optical Sciences 130, 1, (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycrisis.co.uk/apollo2/concentrators/promise.pdf |title=The Promise of Concentrators, R M Swanson, Prog. Photovolt. Res. Appl. 8, 93-111 (2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and development continued through the 1980s and 1990s without significant industry interest.  Improvements in cell efficiency were soon recognized as essential to making the technology economical.  However the improvements to Si-based cell technologies used by both concentrators and flat PV failed to favor the system-level economics of CPV.   The introduction of III-V [[Multi-junction solar cell]]s starting in the early 2000s has since provided a clear [[Product differentiation|differentiator]].  MJ cell efficiencies have improved from 34% (3-junctions) to 46% (4-junctions) at research-scale production levels.&lt;ref name="Current-status-FHI-NREL-2015" /&gt;{{rp|14}} A substantial number of multi-MW CPV projects have also been commissioned worldwide since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpvconsortium.org/projects&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

Modern CPV systems operate most efficiently in highly concentrated sunlight (i.e. concentration levels equivalent to hundreds of suns), as long as the solar cell is kept cool through the use of [[heat sinks]].  Diffuse light, which occurs in cloudy and overcast conditions, cannot be highly concentrated using conventional optical components only (i.e. macroscopic lenses and mirrors). Filtered light, which occurs in hazy or polluted conditions, has spectral variations which produce mismatches between the electrical currents generated within the series-connected junctions of spectrally "tuned" [[Multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) photovoltaic cells]].&lt;ref name="CPVideal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024814002347 |title=Analysis of the spectral variations on the performance of high concentrator photovoltaic modules operating under different real climate conditions, E.F. Fernandez et.al., Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2014.04.026 | volume=127 |journal=Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells |pages=179-187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These CPV features lead to rapid decreases in power output when atmospheric conditions are less than ideal.

To produce equal or greater energy per rated watt than conventional PV systems, CPV systems must be located in areas that receive plentiful [[Direct insolation|direct sunlight]]. This is typically specified as average DNI greater than 5.5-6 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day or 2000kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr.  Otherwise, evaluations of annualized DNI vs. GNI/GHI irradiance data have concluded that conventional PV should still perform better over time than presently available CPV technology in most regions of the world (see for example &lt;ref name="CPVfeas"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23317000.2014.971982 |title=Feasibility of Concentrated Photovoltaic Systems (CPV) in Various United States Geographic Locations, Jin Ho Jo et.al., Energy Technology and Policy, 2014 | doi=10.1080/23317000.2014.971982 | volume=1 |issue=1 |journal=Energy Technology &amp; Policy |pages=84–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Ongoing research and development ==

[[File:International CPV-x Conference - Historical Participation Statistics.svg|thumb|International CPV-x Conference - Historical Participation Statistics.  Data Source - CPV-x Proceedings]]

CPV research and development has been pursued in over 20 countries for more than a decade.  The annual CPV-x conference series has served as a primary networking and exchange forum between university, government lab, and industry participants.  Government agencies have also continued to encourage a number of specific technology thrusts.      

[[ARPA-E]] announced a first round of R&amp;D funding in late 2015 for the MOSAIC Program (Microscale Optimized Solar-cell Arrays with Integrated Concentration) to further combat the location and expense challenges of existing CPV technology.   As stated in the program description:  "MOSAIC projects are grouped into three categories: complete systems that cost effectively integrate micro-CPV for regions such as sunny areas of the U.S. southwest that have high Direct Normal Incident (DNI) solar radiation;  complete systems that apply to regions, such as areas of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest, that have low DNI solar radiation or high diffuse solar radiation; and concepts that seek partial solutions to technology challenges."&lt;ref name="MOSAIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arpa-e.energy.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/MOSAIC_Project_Descriptions.pdf |title=MOSAIC Project Descriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the CPVMATCH Program (Concentrating PhotoVoltaic Modules using Advanced Technologies and Cells for Highest efficiencies) aims "to bring practical performance of HCPV modules closer to theoretical limits".  Efficiency goals achievable by 2019 are identified as 48% for cells and 40% for modules at &gt;800x concentration.&lt;ref name="CPVMatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpvmatch.eu |title=CPVMatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) extended its support in 2017 for further commercialization of the HCPV technology developed by Raygen.&lt;ref name="ARENA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arena.gov.au/projects/raygen-resources-pv-ultra/ |title=ARENA Raygen}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Their 250kW dense array receivers are the most powerful CPV receivers thus far created,  with demonstrated PV efficiency of 40.4% and include usable heat co-generation.&lt;ref name="Raygen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raygen.com/technology.html |title=RayGen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optical design ==

The design of macroscopic sunlight concentrators for CPV introduces a very specific optical design problem, with features that makes it different from any other optical design. It has to be efficient, suitable for mass production, capable of high concentration, insensitive to manufacturing and mounting inaccuracies, and capable of providing uniform illumination of the cell. All these reasons make [[nonimaging optics]]&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"&gt;Roland Winston et al.,, ''Nonimaging Optics'', Academic Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0127597515}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most suitable for CPV.

For very low concentrations, the wide [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angles]] of nonimaging optics avoid the need for active solar tracking. For [[#Medium concentration CPV|medium]] and [[#High concentration photovoltaics (HCPV)|high]] concentrations, a wide acceptance angle can be seen as a measure of how tolerant the optic is to imperfections in the whole system. It is vital to start with a wide acceptance angle since it must be able to accommodate tracking errors, movements of the system due to wind, imperfectly manufactured optics, imperfectly assembled components, finite stiffness of the supporting structure or its deformation due to aging, among other factors. All of these reduce the initial acceptance angle and, after they are all factored in, the system must still be able to capture the finite angular aperture of sunlight.

== Efficiency ==

{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}

[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|320px|Reported records of [[solar cell efficiency]] since 1975. As of December 2014, best lab cell efficiency reached 46% (for &lt;span style="color: #7C317C;"&gt;&amp;#8865;&lt;/span&gt; [[multi-junction]] concentrator, 4+ junctions).]]

All CPV systems have a concentrating optic and a [[solar cell]]. Generally, active [[solar tracking]] is necessary. Low-concentration systems often have a simple booster reflector, which can increase solar electric output by over 30% from that of non-concentrator PV systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Andrews, Nabeil Alazzam, and Joshua M.

[[Semiconductor]] properties allow solar cells to operate more efficiently in concentrated light, as long as the cell [[Junction temperature]] is kept cool by suitable [[heat sink]]s. Efficiency of [[multi-junction photovoltaic cell]]s developed in research is upward of 44% today, with the potential to approach 50% in the coming years.&lt;ref name="NREL-CPV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/43208.pdf |title=Opportunities and Challenges for Development of a Mature Concentrating Photovoltaic Power Industry | author= S.

== {{anchor|Types}} Types ==

CPV systems are categorized according to the amount of their solar concentration, measured in "suns" (the square of the [[magnification]]).

=== Low concentration PV (LCPV) ===

[[File:LCPV Lensing.jpg|thumbnail|An example of a Low Concentration PV Cell's surface, showing the glass [[Lens (optics)|lensing]]]]

Low concentration PV are systems with a solar concentration of 2–100 suns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/technology-platforms/pdf/photovoltaics.pdf A Strategic Research Agenda for Photovoltaic Solar Energy Technology] ''Photovoltaic technology platform''&lt;/ref&gt; For economic reasons, conventional or modified silicon solar cells are typically used, and, at these concentrations, the heat [[flux]] is low enough that the cells do not need to be actively cooled. There is now modeling and experimental evidence that standard solar modules do not need any modification, tracking or cooling if the concentration level is low and yet still have increased output of 35% or more.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Rob W.; Pollard, Andrew; Pearce, Joshua M., "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2013.6744136 Photovoltaic system performance enhancement with non-tracking planar concentrators: Experimental results and BDRF based modelling]," Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), 2013 IEEE 39th, pp.0229,0234, 16–21 June 2013. {{DOI|10.1109/PVSC.2013.6744136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medium concentration PV ===

From concentrations of 100 to 300 suns, the CPV systems require two-axis solar tracking and cooling (whether passive or active), which makes them more complex.

[[File:HCPV Cell from Fotrousi Electronics.jpg|thumb|A 10×10 mm HCPV solar cell]]

=== High concentration photovoltaics (HCPV) ===

High concentration photovoltaics (HCPV) systems employ concentrating optics consisting of dish reflectors or fresnel lenses that concentrate sunlight to intensities of 1,000 suns or more.&lt;ref name="NREL-CPV" /&gt; The solar cells require high-capacity heat sinks to prevent thermal destruction and to manage temperature related electrical performance and life expectancy losses. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling will reduce the overall [[Solar cell efficiency|conversion efficiency]] and economy. [[Multi-junction solar cell]]s are currently favored over single junction cells, as they are more efficient and have a lower temperature coefficient (less loss in efficiency with an increase in temperature). The efficiency of both cell types rises with increased concentration; multi-junction efficiency rises faster.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Multi-junction solar cells, originally designed for non-concentrating [[Solar panels on spacecraft|PV on space-based satellites]], have been re-designed due to the high-current density encountered with CPV (typically 8 A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 500 suns). Though the cost of multi-junction solar cells is roughly 100 times that of conventional silicon cells of the same area, the small cell area employed makes the relative costs of cells in each system comparable and the system economics favor the multi-junction cells. Multi-junction cell efficiency has now reached 44% in production cells.

The 44% value given above is for a specific set of conditions known as "standard test conditions". These include a specific spectrum, an incident optical power of 850 W/m², and a cell temperature of 25&amp;nbsp;°C. In a concentrating system, the cell will typically operate under conditions of variable spectrum, lower optical power, and higher temperature. The optics needed to concentrate the light have limited efficiency themselves, in the range of 75–90%. Taking these factors into account, a solar module incorporating a 44% multi-junction cell might deliver a DC efficiency around 36%. Under similar conditions, a crystalline silicon module would deliver an efficiency of less than 18%.

When high concentration is needed (500–1000 times), as occurs in the case of high efficiency multi-junction solar cells, it is likely that it will be crucial for commercial success at the system level to achieve such concentration with a sufficient acceptance angle. This allows tolerance in mass production of all components, relaxes the module assembling and system installation, and decreasing the cost of structural elements. Since the main goal of CPV is to make solar energy inexpensive, there can be used only a few surfaces. Decreasing the number of elements and achieving high acceptance angle, can be relaxed optical and mechanical requirements, such as accuracy of the optical surfaces profiles, the module assembling, the installation, the supporting structure, etc. To this end, improvements in sunshape modelling at the system design stage may lead to higher system efficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |authors=Cole, IR, Betts, TR, Gottschalg, R| year=2012 |title=Solar profiles and spectral modeling for CPV simulations |journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics |volume=2 |issue=1 | pages=62–67 |ISSN=2156-3381 |doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2011.2177445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Installations ==
Concentrator photovoltaics technology has established its presence in the solar industry over the last several years. The first CPV power plant that exceeded 1&amp;nbsp;MW-level was commissioned in Spain in 2006. By the end of 2015, the number of CPV power plants around the world accounted for a total installed capacity of 350&amp;nbsp;MW.  Field data collected over the past six years is also starting to benchmark the prospects for long-term system reliability.

The emerging CPV segment has comprised ~0.1% of the fast-growing utility market for PV installations over the past decade.  Unfortunately, by the end of 2015, the near term outlook for CPV industry growth has faded with closure of all of the largest CPV manufacturing facilities: including those of Suncore, Soitec, Amonix, and Solfocus.  Nevertheless, the growth outlook for the overall PV industry continues to appear strong.&lt;ref name="Current-status-FHI-NREL-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-PR-2014" /&gt;

== Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal ==

'''Concentrator photovoltaics and thermal''' ('''CPVT'''), also sometimes called '''combined heat and power solar''' ('''CHAPS''') or hybrid thermal CPV, is a [[cogeneration]] or [[micro CHP|micro cogeneration]] technology used in the field of concentrator photovoltaics that produces usable heat and electricity within the same system. CPVT at high concentrations of over 100 suns (HCPVT) utilizes similar components as HCPV, including dual-axis tracking and [[multi-junction photovoltaic cell]]s. A fluid actively cools the integrated thermal–photovoltaic receiver, and simultaneously transports the collected heat.

Typically, one or more receivers and a [[heat exchanger]] operate within a closed thermal loop. To maintain efficient overall operation and avoid damage from [[thermal runaway]], the demand for heat from the secondary side of the exchanger must be consistently high. Under such optimal operating conditions, collection efficiencies exceeding 70% (up to ~35% electric, ~40% thermal for HCPVT) are anticipated. Net operating efficiencies may be substantially lower depending on how well a system is engineered to match the demands of the particular thermal application.

The maximum temperature of CPVT systems is typically too low alone to power a boiler for additional steam-based cogeneration of electricity. Such systems may be economical to power lower temperature applications having a constant high heat demand. The heat may be employed in [[district heating]], [[water heating]] and [[solar cooling|air conditioning]], [[desalination]] or [[process heat]]. For applications having lower or intermittent heat demand, a system may be augmented with a switchable heat dump to the external environment in order to maintain reliable electrical output and safeguard cell life, despite the resulting reduction in net operating efficiency.

HCPVT active cooling enables the use of much higher power thermal–photovoltaic receiver units, generating typically 1–100 kilowatts electric, as compared to HCPV systems that mostly rely upon passive cooling of single ~20W cells. Such high-power receivers utilize dense arrays of cells mounted on a high-efficiency [[heat sink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azurspace.com/index.php/en/products/products-cpv/cpv-dense-array-module |title=ADAM (Advanced Dense Array Module)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimizing the number of individual receiver units is a simplification that should ultimately yield improvement in the overall balance of system costs, manufacturability, maintainability/upgradeability, and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Bazovsky, ''Chapter 18: Reliability Design Considerations''. In: Reliability Theory and Practice, 1963 (reprinted 2004), Pages 176-185, {{ISBN|978-0486438672}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=September 2015}}

[[Image:CFD Photovoltaic Free Convection Heat Sink Design.gif|thumb|center|400px|This 240 x 80&amp;nbsp;mm 1,000 suns CPV heat sink design thermal animation, was created using high resolution [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] analysis, and shows temperature contoured heat sink surface and flow trajectories as predicted.]]

===Reliability requirements===
The maximum operating temperatures (T&lt;sub&gt;max cell&lt;/sub&gt;) of CPVT systems are limited to less than approximately 100–125&amp;nbsp;°C on account of the intrinsic reliability limitation of their multi-junction PV cells. This contrasts to [[Concentrating Solar Power|CSP]] and other [[Cogeneration|CHP]] systems which may be designed to function at temperatures in excess of several hundred degrees. More specifically, the multi-junction photovoltaic cells are fabricated from a layering of thin-film [[Template:III-V compounds|III-V semiconductor materials]] having intrinsic lifetimes during CPV operation that rapidly decrease with an [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius]]-type temperature dependence. The system receiver must therefore provide for highly efficient and uniform cell cooling, where an ideal receiver would provide T&lt;sub&gt;max coolant&lt;/sub&gt; ~ T&lt;sub&gt;max cell&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition to material and design limitations in receiver heat-transfer performance, numerous extrinsic factors, such as the frequent system thermal cycling, further reduce the practical T&lt;sub&gt;max coolant&lt;/sub&gt; compatible with long system life to below about 80&amp;nbsp;°C.

The higher capital costs, lesser standardization, and added engineering &amp; operational complexities (in comparison to zero and low-concentration PV technologies) make demonstrations of system reliability and long-life performance critical challenges for the first generation of CPV and CPVT technologies. Performance certification testing standards (e.g. [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62108, [[Underwriters Labs|UL]] 8703, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62789, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62670) include stress conditions that may be useful to uncover some predominantly infant and early life (&lt;1–2 year) [[Failure modes of electronics|failure modes]] at the system, module, and sub-component levels. However, such standardized tests – as typically performed on only a small sampling of units – are generally incapable to evaluate comprehensive long-term (10 to 25 or more years) lifetimes for each unique CPVT system design and application under its broader range of actual operating conditions. Long-life performance of these complex systems is therefore assessed in the field, and is improved through aggressive product development cycles which are guided by the results of [[Accelerated aging|accelerated component/system aging]], enhanced performance monitoring diagnostics, and [[failure analysis]]. Significant growth in the deployment of CPV and CPVT can be anticipated once the long-term performance and reliability concerns are better addressed to build confidence in system bankability.&lt;ref name="example web reference"&gt;[http://energy.globaldata.com/media-center/press-releases/power-and-resources/global-concentrated-photovoltaic-cumulative-installations-to-achieve-more-than-1-gigawatt-capacity-by-2020-says-globaldata Concentrated Photovoltaics Update 2014], GlobalData Market Research Report&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demonstration projects===
The economics of a mature CPVT industry is anticipated to be competitive, despite the large recent cost reductions and gradual efficiency improvements for conventional silicon PV (which can be installed alongside conventional CSP to provide for similar electrical+thermal generation capabilities).&lt;ref name="Current-status-FHI-NREL-2015" /&gt;  CPVT may currently be economical for niche markets having all of the following application characteristics:
* high solar direct normal incidence (DNI)
* tight space constraints for placement of a solar collector array
* high and constant demand for low-temperature (&lt;80&amp;nbsp;°C) heat
* high cost of grid electricity
* access to backup sources of power or cost-efficient storage (electrical and thermal)

Utilization of a [[power purchase agreement]] (PPA), government assistance programs, and innovative financing schemes are also helping potential manufacturers and users to mitigate the risks of early CPVT technology adoption.

CPVT equipment offerings ranging from low (LCPVT) to high (HCPVT) concentration are now being deployed by several [[Startup company|startup ventures]]. As such, longer-term viability of the technical and/or business approach being pursued by any individual system provider is typically speculative. Notably, the [[minimum viable product]]s of startups can vary widely in their attention to [[reliability engineering]].  Nevertheless, the following incomplete compilation is offered to assist with the identification of some early industry trends.

LCPVT systems at ~14x concentration using reflective trough concentrators, and receiver pipes clad with silicon cells having dense interconnects, have been assembled by Cogenra with a claimed 75% efficiency (~15-20% electric, 60% thermal).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cogenra.com/ |title=Cogenra, acquired by Sunpower 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Several such systems are in operation for more than 5 years as of 2015,  and similar systems are being produced by Absolicon &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.absolicon.com/ |title=Absolicon Solar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Idhelio &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idhelio.com/ |title=Idhelio}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 10x and 50x concentration, respectively.

HCPVT offerings at over 700x concentration have more recently emerged, and may be classified into three power tiers.  Third tier systems are distributed generators consisting of large arrays of ~20W single-cell receiver/collector units, similar to those previously pioneered by Amonix and SolFocus for HCPV.  Second tier systems utilize localized dense-arrays of cells that produce 1-100&amp;nbsp;kW of electrical power output per receiver/generator unit.  First tier systems exceed 100&amp;nbsp;kW of electrical output and are most aggressive in targeting the utility market.

Several HCPVT system providers are listed in the following table.  Nearly all are early demonstration systems which have been in service for under 5 years as of 2015.  Collected thermal power is typically 1.5x-2x the rated electrical power.

[[Oceania]] is a [[region]] centered on the [[island]]s of the tropical [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the term, see Douglas &amp; Ballard (2008) ''Foreign bodies: Oceania and the science of race 1750–1940''&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptions of what constitutes Oceania vary, with it being defined in various ways, often [[geopolitics|geopolitically]] or [[geography|geographically]]. In the geopolitical conception used by the [[United Nations geoscheme|United Nations]], [[International Olympic Committee]], and many atlases, the Oceanic region includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not the Malay Archipelago or Indonesian New Guinea.&lt;ref name="unsd-m49"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#oceania |title=United Nations Statistics Division – Countries of Oceania |publisher=Millenniumindicators.un.org |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlas of Canada Web Master |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/world/referencemap_image_view |title=The Atlas of Canada – The World – Continents |publisher=Atlas.nrcan.gc.ca |date=2004-08-17 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/en/content/National-Olympic-Committees/ ''Current IOC members''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002233312/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/National-Olympic-Committees/ |date=2009-10-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes used more specifically to denote Australasia as a geographic [[continent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557382/Ocean%C3%ADa.html |title=Encarta Mexico "Oceanía" |publisher=Mx.encarta.msn.com |accessdate=2009-04-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx8MK156?url=http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557382/Ocean%C3%ADa.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E.

or biogeographically as a synonym for either the [[Australasian ecozone]] ([[Wallacea]] and [[Australasia]]) or the Pacific ecozone (Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia apart either from New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Udvardy. 1975. ''A classification of the biogeographical provinces of the world''&lt;/ref&gt; or from mainland New Guinea&lt;ref&gt;Steadman. 2006. ''Extinction &amp; biogeography of tropical Pacific birds''&lt;/ref&gt;).

Although [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] belong to the Commonwealth of Australia and are inhabited, they are nearer [[Indonesia]] than the Australian mainland, and are commonly associated with Asia instead of Oceania.

'''Dragontrail''', manufactured by [[Asahi Glass Co.]], is an [[alkali]]-[[aluminosilicate]] sheet glass engineered for a combination of thinness, lightness and damage-resistance, similar to [[Corning Inc.|Corning]]'s [[Gorilla Glass]].  The material's primary properties are its strength, allowing thin glass without fragility; its high scratch resistance; and its hardness{{spaced ndash}} with a [[Vickers hardness test]] rating of 595 to 673.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dragontrail.agc.com/catalog/AGC_Dragontrail_en.pdf |title = Dragontrail |publisher = Asahi Glass Co. |page = 2 |accessdate = 4 August 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130228040523/http://dragontrail.agc.com/catalog/AGC_Dragontrail_en.pdf |archivedate = 28 February 2013 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual linearized gravity==

The dual formulations of linearized gravity are described by a mixed Young symmetry tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_{D-3} \mu}&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called dual graviton, in any spacetime dimension ''D'' &gt; 4 with the following characters:&lt;ref name="Bekaert" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_{D-3} \mu} = T_{[\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_{D-3}] \mu},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{[\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_{D-3} \mu]} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
where square brackets show antisymmetrization.

For 5-D spacetime, the spin-2 dual graviton is described by the [[Curtright field]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;. The symmetry properties imply that
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = T_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma}+T_{[\beta\gamma]\alpha}+T_{[\gamma\alpha ]\beta} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian action for the spin-2 dual graviton &lt;math&gt;T_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2\mu}&lt;/math&gt; in 5-D spacetime, the [[Curtright field]], becomes&lt;ref name="Bekaert" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\cal L}_{\rm dual}=-\frac{1}{12}\left(F_{[\alpha\beta\gamma]\delta}F^{[\alpha\beta\gamma]\delta}-3F_{[\alpha\beta\xi]}{}^{\xi}F^{[\alpha\beta\lambda]}{}_{\lambda}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;F_{[\alpha\beta\gamma]\delta}=\partial_{\alpha} T_{[\beta\gamma ]\delta}+\partial_{\beta}T_{[\gamma\alpha]\delta} +\partial_{\gamma}T_{[\alpha\beta]\delta},&lt;/math&gt; 
and the gauge symmetry of the [[Curtright field]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{\sigma,\alpha} T_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma}=2(\partial_{[\alpha} \sigma_{\beta]\gamma} +\partial_{[\alpha}\alpha_{\beta]\gamma}-\partial_{\gamma}\alpha_{\alpha\beta}).&lt;/math&gt; 
The dual [[Riemann curvature tensor]] of the dual graviton is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Bekaert" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{[\alpha\beta\delta][\varepsilon\gamma]}\equiv\frac{1}{2}
 (\partial_{\varepsilon}F_{[\alpha\beta\delta]\gamma}-\partial_{\gamma}F_{[\alpha\beta\delta]\varepsilon}),&lt;/math&gt;
and the dual [[Ricci curvature]] tensor and [[scalar curvature]] of the dual graviton become, respectively 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma}= g^{\varepsilon\delta} E_{[\alpha\beta\delta][\varepsilon\gamma]},&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\alpha}=g^{\beta\gamma}E_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt; 
They fulfill the following Bianchi identities
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\alpha}(E^{[\alpha\beta]\gamma}+g^{\gamma[\alpha}E^{\beta]})= 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the 5-D spacetime metric.

==Dual graviton coupling with BF theory==

Dual gravitons have interaction with topological [[BF model]] in ''D'' = 5 through the following Lagrangian action&lt;ref name="Bizdadea"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\rm L} = \int d^{5}x( {\cal L}_{\rm dual} + {\cal L}_{\rm BF}).&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;{\cal L}_{\rm BF}=Tr[\mathbf{B}\wedge \mathbf{F}]&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\equiv d\mathbf{A} \sim R_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[curvature form]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} \equiv e^{a} \wedge e^{b} &lt;/math&gt; is the background field.

In principle, it should similarly be coupled to a BF model of gravity as the linearized Einstein–Hilbert action in ''D'' &gt; 4:
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\rm BF} = \int d^{5}x {\cal L}_{\rm BF} \sim S_{\rm EH} = {1 \over 2} \int \mathrm{d}^5x R \sqrt{-g}.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g=\det(g_{\mu\nu})&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of the [[metric tensor]] matrix, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci scalar]].

==Dual gravitoelectromagnetism==

In similar manner while we define [[gravitomagnetic]] and gravitoelectic for the graviton, we can define electric and magnetic fields for the dual graviton.&lt;ref name="Henneaux"&gt;

[[File:NIGU_Strain_tower.JPG|thumb|Electric power is transmitted on [[Overhead power line|overhead lines]] like these, and also on underground [[high-voltage cable]]s]]

The '''electric power industry''' covers the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]] and [[electricity retailing|sale]] of [[electric power]] to the general public and industry. The commercial distribution of electric power started in 1882 when electricity was produced for [[electric lighting]]. In the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry. Once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable and economical electric power has become an essential aspect for normal operation of all elements of developed economies.

By the middle of the 20th century, electricity was seen as a "[[natural monopoly]]", only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically-integrated companies provide all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure.

Since the 1990s, many regions have opened up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive [[electricity market]]. While such markets can be abusively [[market manipulation|manipulated]] with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since [[return on investment|returns on investment]] are not as easy to find.

&lt;!--==Overview==--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Onderstation 110 kV Bolsward 01.JPG|thumb|right|Bolsward Substation, the Netherlands]]
[[File:Romanian electric power transmission lines.jpg|thumb|right|Transmission lines in [[Romania]] of which the nearest is a Phase Transposition Tower]]
Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an [[electrolytic cell]] since [[Alessandro Volta]] developed the [[voltaic pile]] in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the [[United States]], [[Thomas Edison]] developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed [[direct current]] electricity.

The world's first public electricity supply was provided in late 1881, when the streets of the [[Surrey]] town of [[Godalming]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] were lit with electric light. This system was powered from a water wheel on the [[River Wey]], which drove a Siemens [[alternator]] that supplied a number of [[arc lamps]] within the town. This supply scheme also provided electricity to a number of shops and premises to light 34 incandescent Swan light bulbs.

Additionally, Robert Hammond, in December 1881, demonstrated the new electric light in the [[Sussex]] town of [[Brighton]] in the UK for a trial period. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. Thus the Hammond Electricity Supply Co. was launched. Whilst the Godalming and Holborn Viaduct Schemes closed after a few years the Brighton Scheme continued on, and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day.

In early 1882, Edison opened the world’s first steam-powered electricity generating station at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]], where he had entered into an agreement with the City Corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting. In time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light. The method of supply was direct current (DC).

It was later on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the [[Pearl Street Power Station]] in [[New York City]] and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the [[voltage]] reduces the [[current (electricity)|current]] and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the [[electric shock|danger from direct contact]] and increases the required [[Electrical insulation|insulation]] thickness. Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison's system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.&lt;ref name=shock&gt;[[Shock and Awe: The Story of Electricity]] - 2. The Age of Invention&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid to late 1880s saw the introduction of [[alternating current]] (AC) systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that [[transformer]]s, installed at [[power station]]s, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local [[Electrical substation|substations]] could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. This made it more economical to distribute power over long distances. Generators (such as [[hydroelectric]] sites) could be located far from the loads. AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the [[War of Currents]]. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out.&lt;ref name=shock/&gt;

[[File:Pylône haute tension.JPG|thumb|upright|left|High tension line in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada]]
The AC power system used today developed rapidly, backed by industrialists such as [[George Westinghouse]] with [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]], [[Galileo Ferraris]], [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]], [[Lucien Gaulard]], John Dixon Gibbs, [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]], [[William Stanley, Jr.]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and others contributed to this field.

While [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current.

==Market reform==
The business model behind the electric utility has changed over the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with [[electricity generation|generators]] and [[electricity retailing|retailers]] trading electricity in a similar manner to [[share (finance)|share]]s and [[currency]]. As [[deregulation]] continues further, utilities are driven to sell their [[asset]]s as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the [[futures market|futures]] and [[spot market]]s and other financial arrangements. Even [[globalization]] with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the [[United Kingdom|UK’s]] [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], the largest private electric utility in the world, bought [[New England]]’s electric system for $3.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/35-27154.htm SEC filing dated March 15, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1997, seven of the 12 Regional Electric Companies (RECs) in England and Wales were bought by U.S. energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privatizationbarometer.com/PUB/RD/1/9/3/ElectricityChronology.pdf "Electricity companies in the United Kingdom - a brief chronology," Electricity Association, 30 June 2003 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in [[space flight]]; aeroderivative [[gas turbine]]s used in [[jet aircraft]]; solar engineering and [[photovoltaic]] systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.&lt;ref name="Distributed Generation"&gt;Borberly, A. and Kreider, J. F. (2001). Distributed Generation: The Power Paradigm for the New Millennium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. 400 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity is expected to see growing [[energy demand|demand]] in the future. The [[Information Revolution]] is highly reliant on electric power. Other growth areas include emerging new electricity-exclusive technologies, developments in space conditioning, [[industrial process]]es, and [[transportation]] (for example  [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[locomotive]]s).&lt;ref name="Distributed Generation"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes. These are [[electricity generation]] such as a [[power station]], [[electric power transmission]], [[electricity distribution]] and [[electricity retailing]]. In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a [[natural monopoly]]. The industry is generally heavily [[regulation|regulated]], often with [[price control]]s and is frequently [[government-owned corporation|government-owned and operated]]. However, the modern trend has been growing deregulation in at least the latter two processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-bumpy-road-to-energy-deregulation  | title = The Bumpy Road to Energy Deregulation
  | publisher = EnPowered  | date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and state of market reform of the [[electricity market]] often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure, or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end-users of electricity may opt for more costly [[green electricity]].

==Generation==
[[File:Greater Cape Town 12.02.2007 16-41-31.2007 16-41-33.JPG|thumb|The [[Athlone Power Station]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]]]
{{Main|Electricity generation|Energy development}}
All forms of electricity generation have positive and negative aspects. [[Technology]] will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a [[market economy]], the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources. It is not clear yet which form can best meet the necessary energy demands or which process can best solve the demand for electricity.  There are indications that [[renewable energy]] and [[distributed generation]] are becoming more viable in economic terms.  A diverse mix of generation sources reduces the risks of electricity price spikes.

== World electricity industries ==
{{see also|List of electricity sectors}}
The organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country.  In some places, all electric power generation, transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization.  Other regions have private or investor-owned utility companies, city or municipally owned companies, [[Utility cooperative|cooperative]] companies owned by their own customers, or combinations. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system.

'''Fibrominn''', located in [[Benson, Minnesota]], is the first [[power plant]] in the [[United States]] designed to burn [[poultry litter]] as its main source of fuel. It is producing 55 [[megawatts]] of electric power and burning turkey [[manure]] combined with wood chips. All of the energy is purchased by  [[Xcel Energy]]. The plant was developed by Fibrowatt LLC, part of the Homeland Renewable Energy Group, which was set up by the management team which built the world's first three poultry-litter-fueled power plants (in the UK).  Construction began in 2005 and the plant began operating in 2007. Grand opening ceremonies were held on 12 October 2007 and 13 October 2007.  The plant is now owned by [[ContourGlobal]], LP.

'''GDiesel''' is a 100% drop-in alternative [[Diesel fuel]] that is manufactured by [[Reno, Nevada]]-based  Advanced Refining Concepts (ARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedrefiningconcepts.com Corporate website]&lt;/ref&gt;   This new type of Diesel results from an innovative way of combining conventional [[Ultra-low-sulfur diesel|ultra-low-sulfur Diesel]] and [[natural gas]]&amp;nbsp;— hence the "G" in the name. It burns far cleaner and significantly improves performance, delivering 10 percent or better improvement in fuel economy, depending on the application.

The inventor of GDiesel® is Dr. Rudolf W. Gunnerman,&lt;ref&gt;Honorary doctorate only&lt;/ref&gt; who has a 40-year background in the development and marketing of energy- and fuel-related technologies.  His last venture, Sulfco, which provided an ultrasound and hydrogen peroxide for efficient desulfurization and also promised cheaper fuel, wound up bankrupt after many years of positive press releases that success was just around the corner. His son Peter is the partner and director of Advanced Refining Concepts.  The firm's ClearRefining® process is relatively simple, beginning with the standard ultra-low sulfur Diesel fuel that one would buy at any filling station. This feedstock is first pressurized in a steel tank to less than 10 pounds per square inch (69&amp;nbsp;kPa) and heated to about 250° F, much lower levels than those required during typical refinery processes. Natural gas, the same material used for cooking and heating, is piped into the tank of Diesel fuel, and the resulting mixture then swirls up and through a wheel-shaped filter wrapped with four different metal [[Catalysis|catalysts]]&amp;nbsp;— cobalt, among others.

In August 2010, GDiesel received formal certification as an “[[alternative fuel]]” from the [[Nevada Division of Environmental Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h475FQE1Jo5U0Lb0uvp8ulaE383wD9HPF0TG5 Nevada OKs natural gas-diesel alt fuel combination] Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndep.nv.gov/docs_10/gdiesel.pdf Nevada Government Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuel is produced at the company’s [[McCarran, Nevada]],&lt;ref&gt;McCarran, Nevada is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) about 13&amp;nbsp;km east of Sparks, Nevada, along [[Interstate 80]], [[ZIP code]] 89434.&lt;/ref&gt; facility in which natural gas is combined with standard Diesel fuel and is then circulated through four different metal catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedrefiningconcepts.com/clear_refining.html Corporate website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the fuel was featured in publications such as ''Diesel World'' and ''[[Motor Trend]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2925">The '''Hausner ratio''' is a number that is correlated to the [[flowability]] of a [[powder (substance)|powder]] or [[granular material]]. It is named after the engineer Henry H. Hausner (1900–1995).&lt;ref&gt;Beddow, J. K. 1995. "Professor Dr. Henry H. Hausner, 1900–1995." Particle &amp; Particle Systems Characterization 12: 213. {{doi|10.1002/ppsc.19950120411}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podczeck, Fridun &amp; Brian E. Jones, eds. 2007. ''Pharmaceutical Capsules''. London: Pharmaceutical Press, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hausner ratio is calculated by the formula

::&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\rho_T}{\rho_B}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; is the freely settled [[bulk density]] of the powder, and &lt;math&gt;\rho_T&lt;/math&gt; is the tapped bulk density of the powder. The Hausner ratio is not an absolute property of a material; its value can vary depending on the methodology used to determine it.

The Hausner ratio is used in a wide variety of industries &lt;ref&gt;R.O. Grey and J.K. Beddow (1969) "On the Hausner Ratio and its relationship to some properties of metal powders" ''Powder Technology'', Vol.2, No.6, pp 323-326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Q. Li ''et al.'' (2004) "Interparticle van der Waals force in powder flowability and compactibility"  ''International Journal of Pharmaceutics'', Vol.280, Iss.1-2, pp 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Conesa ''et al.'' (2004) "Characterization of Flow Properties of Powder Coatings Used in the Automotive Industry" ''Kona'', Vol.22, pp 94-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Rough, D.I. Wilson and D.W. York (2005) "Effect of solids formulation on the manufacture of high shear mixer agglomerates" ''Adv. Powder Technol''., Vol.16, pp 145-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Garcia, R.A. Flores and C.E. Mazenko (2007) "Factors contributing to the poor bulk behavior of meat and bone meal and methods for improving these behaviors" ''Bioresource Technology'', Vol.98, No.15, pp 2852-2858.&lt;/ref&gt; as an indication of the flowability of a powder.&lt;ref&gt;USP &lt;1174&gt; "Excipient General Information Chapter: Powder Flow&lt;/ref&gt;  A Hausner ratio greater than 1.25 is considered to be an indication of poor flowability.  The Hausner ratio (H) is related to the [[Carr index]] (C), another indication of flowability, by the formula &lt;math&gt;H=100/(100-C)&lt;/math&gt;. Both the Hausner ratio and the Carr index are sometimes criticized, despite their relationships to flowability being established empirically, as not having a strong theoretical basis. Use of these measures persists, however, because the equipment required to perform the analysis is relatively cheap and the technique is easy to learn.

'''High Power Electric Propulsion''' ('''HiPEP''') is a variation of [[ion thruster]] for use in nuclear electric propulsion applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs09grc_prt.htm?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618 The Glenn Research Center]. NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Prometheus'&gt;[https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ion/present/hipep.htm HIGH POWER ELECTRIC PROPULSION PROGRAM (HiPEP)]. Glenn Research Center - NASA. 22 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040139476 |title= The High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP) Ion Thruster  NASA/TM—2004-213194 AIAA–2004–3812}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was ground-tested in 2003 by [[NASA]] and was intended for use on the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]], which was canceled in 2005.

== Theory ==
The HiPEP thruster differs from earlier ion thrusters because the [[xenon]] ions are produced using a combination of [[microwave]] and [[magnetic]] fields. The ionization is achieved through a process called [[Electron Cyclotron Resonance]] (ECR). In ECR, the small number of free electrons present in the neutral gas gyrate around the static magnetic field lines. The injected microwaves' frequency is set to match this gyrofrequency and a resonance is established. Energy is transferred from the right-hand [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] portion of the [[microwave]] to the electrons. This energy is then transferred to the bulk gas/[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] via the rare - yet important - collisions between electrons and neutrals. During these collisions, electrons can be knocked free from the neutrals, forming ion-electron pairs. The process is a highly efficient means of creating a plasma in low density gases. Previously the electrons required were provided by a [[Hollow cathode effect|hollow cathode]].

== Specifications ==
The thruster itself is in the 20-50 kW class, with a [[specific impulse]] of 6,000-9,000 seconds, and a propellant throughput capability exceeding 100 kg/kW.&lt;ref name='Prometheus'/&gt; The goal of the project, as of June 2003, was to achieve a [[technology readiness level]] of 4-5 within 2 years.

The pre-prototype HiPEP produced 670 mN of thrust at a power level of 39.3 kW using 7.0 mg/s of fuel giving a specific impulse of 9620 s.&lt;ref name='Prometheus'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040139476] Page 8 of the September 2004 HiPEP report NASA/TM—2004-213194 &lt;/ref&gt;  Downrated to 24.4 kW, the HiPEP used 5.6 mg/s of fuel giving a specific impulse of 8270 s and 460 mN of thrust.

[[File:Steam powered road-locomotive from England.png|thumb|Steam powered road-locomotive from England]]
The '''history of steam road vehicles''' comprises the development of [[vehicle]]s powered by a [[steam engine]] for use on land and independent of [[Rail transport|rails]], whether for conventional [[road]] use, such as the [[steam car]] and [[steam waggon]], or for agricultural or heavy haulage work, such as the [[traction engine]].

The first experimental vehicles were built in the 17th and 18th century, but it was not until after [[Richard Trevithick]] had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam powered vehicles on roads. Nevertheless, the 1880s to the 1920s saw continuing improvements in vehicle technology and manufacturing techniques, and steam road vehicles were developed for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of [[internal combustion engine]] technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the [[Second World War]]. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicle, and experimental technology no steam vehicles are in production at present.

==Early pioneers==
Early research on the [[steam engine]] before 1700 was closely linked to the quest for self-propelled vehicles and ships; the first practical applications from 1712 were stationary plant working at very low pressure which entailed engines of very large dimensions. The size reduction necessary for road transport meant an increase in steam pressure with all the attendant dangers, due to the inadequate boiler technology of the period. A strong opponent of high pressure steam was [[James Watt]] who, along with [[Matthew Boulton]] did all he could to dissuade [[William Murdoch]] from developing and patenting his steam carriage, built in model form in 1784.

[[Ferdinand Verbiest]] is suggested to have built what may have been the first steam powered car in about 1672,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but very little concrete information on this is known to exist.

During the latter part of the 18th century, there were numerous attempts to produce self-propelled steerable vehicles. Many remained in the form of models. Progress was dogged by many problems inherent to road vehicles in general, such as suitable power-plant giving steady rotative motion, suspension, braking, steering, adequate road surfaces, tyres, and vibration-resistant bodywork, among other issues. The extreme complexity of these issues can be said to have hampered progress over more than a hundred years, as much as hostile legislation.

===Cugnot's ''"Fardier à vapeur"''===
[[File:FardierdeCugnot20050111.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]]'s "Fardier à vapeur" ("Steam wagon")(1769)]]
[[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]]'s "''machine à feu pour le transport de wagons et surtout de l'artillerie''" ("fire engine for transporting wagons and especially artillery") was built from 1769 in two versions for use by the French Army. This was the first [[steam wagon]] that was not a toy, and that was known to exist. Cugnot's ''fardier'', a term usually applied to a massive two-wheeled cart for exceptionally heavy loads, was intended to be capable of transporting 4 tonnes (3.9 tons), and of travelling at up to 4&amp;nbsp;km/h (2.5&amp;nbsp;mph). The vehicle was of [[tricycle]] layout, with two rear wheels and a steerable front wheel controlled by a [[tiller]]. There is considerable evidence, from the period, that this vehicle actually ran, making it probably the first to do so; however it remained a short-lived experiment due to inherent instability and the vehicle's failure to meet the Army's specified performance level.

===Trevithick's steam carriage===
[[File:Trevithicks Dampfwagen.jpg|thumb|right|Trevithick's [[London Steam Carriage]] of 1803]]
[[File:1831-View-Whitechapel-Road-steam-carriage-caricature.jpg|thumb|right|1831 satire on steam coaches]]
In 1801, [[Richard Trevithick]] constructed an experimental steam-driven vehicle (''Puffing Devil'') which was equipped with a firebox enclosed within the boiler, with one vertical cylinder, the motion of the single piston being transmitted directly to the driving wheels by means of [[connecting rod]]s. It was reported as weighing 1520&amp;nbsp;kg fully loaded, with a speed of 14.5&amp;nbsp;km/h (9&amp;nbsp;mph) on the flat. During its first trip it was left unattended and "self-destructed". Trevithick soon built the ''[[London Steam Carriage]]'' that ran successfully in London in 1803, but the venture failed to attract interest and soon folded up.

In the context of Trevithick's vehicle, an English writer by the name of "Mickleham" in 1822 coined the term ''Steam Engine'':

:"It exhibits in construction the most beautiful simplicity of parts, the most sagacious selection of appropriate forms, the most convenient and effective arrangement and connexion; uniting strength with elegance; the necessary solidity with the greatest portability; possessing unlimited power with a wonderful pliancy to accommodate it to the varying resistance: it may indeed be called The Steam Engine."&lt;ref&gt;Luke Hebert: ''The Engineer's and Mechanic's Encyclopædia'', Vol. 2,  Pg. 612, 1849&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam-powered amphibious craft===
In 1805 [[Oliver Evans]] built the "Oruktor Amphibolos" (literally 'amphibious digger'), a steam-powered, flat-bottomed  dredger that he modified to be self-propelled on both land and water. It is widely believed to be the first [[amphibious vehicle]], and the first steam-powered road vehicle to run in the United States. However, no designs for the machine survive, and the only accounts of its achievements come from Evans himself. Later analysis of Evans's descriptions suggests that the 5[[horse-power|hp]] engine was unlikely to have been powerful enough to move the vehicle either on land or water, and that the chosen route for its demonstration would have had the benefit of gravity, river currents and tides to assist with the vehicles' progress. The dredger was not a success, and after a few years lying idle, was dismantled for parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lubar | first = Steve | title = Was This America’s First Steamboat, Locomotive, and Car? | work = Invention and Technology Magazine, Spring 2006, Volume 21, Issue 4 | publisher = (at American Heritage.com) | date =  | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_16.shtml | accessdate = 2008-04-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080403235757/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_16.shtml | archivedate = 3 April 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early steam carriage services===
[[File:Russell's steam carriage.png|thumb|right|150px|John Scott Russell's steam carriage, with boiler below the axle and two pistons]]
More commercially successful for a time than Trevithick's carriage were the steam carriage services operated in England in the 1830s, principally by [[Walter Hancock]] and associates of [[Sir Goldsworthy Gurney]], among others and in Scotland by [[John Scott Russell]]. However, the heavy road tolls imposed by the [[Turnpike Act]]s discouraged steam road vehicles and for a short time allowed the continued monopoly of horse traction until railway trunk routes became established in the 1840s and '50s.

==Victorian Age of Steam==
[[File:Obeissante.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amédée Bollée]]: L'Obéissante (1875).]]
Although engineers developed ingenious steam-powered road vehicles, they did not enjoy the same level of acceptance and expansion as steam power at sea and on the railways in the middle and late 19th century of the "Age of Steam".

Ransomes built a portable steam engine, that is a farm steam engine on wheels, hauled from farm to farm by horses in 1841.  The next year Ransomes automated it and had the engine drive itself to farms

Harsh legislation virtually eliminated mechanically propelled vehicles from the roads of Great Britain for 30&amp;nbsp;years, the ''[[Locomotive Act]]'' of 1861 imposing restrictive speed limits on "road locomotives" of 5&amp;nbsp;mph (8&amp;nbsp;km/h) in towns and cities, and 10&amp;nbsp;mph (16&amp;nbsp;km/h) in the country. In 1865 the ''Locomotives Act'' of that year (the famous [[Red Flag Act]]) further reduced the speed limits to 4&amp;nbsp;mph (6.4&amp;nbsp;km/h) in the country and just 2&amp;nbsp;mph (3.2&amp;nbsp;km/h) in towns and cities, additionally requiring a man bearing a red flag (red lantern during the hours of darkness) to precede every vehicle. At the same time, the act gave local authorities the power to specify the hours during which any such vehicle might use the roads. The sole exceptions were street [[trams]] which from 1879 onwards were authorised under licence from the [[Board of Trade]].

In France the situation was radically different from the extent of the 1861&amp;nbsp;ministerial ruling formally authorising the circulation of steam vehicles on ordinary roads. Whilst this led to considerable technological advances throughout the 1870s and '80s, steam vehicles nevertheless remained a rarity.

To an extent competition from the successful railway network reduced the need for steam vehicles. From the 1860s onwards, attention was turned more to the development of various forms of [[traction engine]] which could either be used for stationary work such as sawing wood and threshing, or for transporting outsize loads too voluminous to go by rail. Steam trucks were also developed but their use was generally confined to the local distribution of heavy materials such as coal and building materials from railway stations and ports.

===Thomas Rickett of Buckingham===
In 1858 Thomas [[Rickett (car)|Rickett]] of [[Buckingham]] built the first of several steam carriages. Instead of looking like a carriage, it resembled a small locomotive. It consisted of a steam-engine mounted on three wheels: two large driven rear wheels and one smaller front wheel by which the vehicle was steered. The whole was driven by a [[chain drive]] and a maximum speed of twelve miles per hour was reached. The weight of the machine was 1.5 tonnes and somewhat lighter than Rickett's steam carriage.

Two years later, in 1860, Rickett built a similar but heavier vehicle. This model incorporated [[spur-gear]] drive instead of chain. In his final design, resembling a railway locomotive, the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s were coupled directly outside the [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]s of the [[driving-axle]].

===Innocenzo Manzetti's steam car.===
In 1864, Italian inventor [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] built a road-steamer.&lt;ref name="manzetti"&gt;{{it}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131212204632/http://www.innocenzomanzetti.it/leinvenzioni.html Innocenzo Manzetti - Le invenzioni]&lt;/ref&gt; It had the boiler at the front and a single-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="manzetti"/&gt;

===Henry Taylor's steam buggy===

In 1867, Canadian jeweller [[Henry Seth Taylor]] demonstrated his [[Henry Seth Taylor steam buggy|four-wheeled steam buggy]] at the Stanstead Fair in [[Stanstead, Quebec]], and again the following year.&lt;ref&gt;The Montreal Gazette - 18 Jan 1986 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19860118&amp;id=G4Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5KUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3436,3937822&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;"Canada's First Automobile: Full Steam Ahead" from the book "Whatever Happened To...?" by Mark Kearny &amp; Randy Ray, Dundern Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===H.P. Holt===
H.P. Holt constructed a small road-steamer in 1866. Able to reach a speed of twenty miles per hour on level roads, it had a vertical boiler at the rear and two separate twin cylinder engines, each of which drove one rear wheel by means of a [[Chain drive|chain]] and sprocket wheels.

===Catley and Ayres of York===
In 1869, a small three-wheeled vehicle propelled by a horizontal twin cylinder engine which drove the rear axle by spur-gearing; only one rear wheel was driven, the other turning freely on the axle. A vertical [[boiler|fire-tube boiler]] was mounted at the rear with a polished copper casing over the fire box and chimney; the boiler was enclosed in a mahogany casing. The front wheel was used for steering and the weight was only 19 [[hundredweight|cwt]].

===J.H. Knight of Farnham===
1868 - 1870, [[John Henry Knight]] of [[Farnham]] built a four-wheeled steam carriage which originally only had a [[single-cylinder engine]].

===R.W. Thomson of Edinburgh===
[[File:Kath. Illustratie 1869-1870 nr 44 p.352 Thomson road steamer with charcoal wagons.jpg|thumb|left|Thomson road steamer with charcoal wagons (engraving, 1870)]]
[[File:Robey Steamer.png|thumb|225px|Robey Steamer built to Thomson's design]]
1869, The road-steamer built by [[Robert William Thomson]] of [[Edinburgh]] became famous because its wheels were shod with heavy solid rubber tyres. Thomson's first road steamers, manufactured in his own small workshop in Leith, were fitted with three wheels, the small single wheel at the front being directly below the steering wheel. The tyres, which were 125 mm (5") thick, were corrugated internally and adhered to the wheel by friction. He then turned to  T. M. Tennant and Co of Bowershall Iron and Engine Works, Leith for their manufacture, but as they could not keep up with demand  in 1870 some of the production was moved to [[Robey &amp; Co]] of Lincoln. &lt;ref&gt;Head J, (1873 "On the Rise and Progress of Steam Locomotion on Common Roads."&lt;/ref&gt;.
Over the next two years Robeys built 32 of these vehicles, which were either 8 or 12 [[horse power]] versions.  A large proportion were  exported. These included three to Vienna and others to Ireland, Greece, Moscow, New Zealand, Australia and Chile.  A further Thomson  steam vehicle was built in 1877, but apart from traction engines, Robeys appear to have discontinued making road steam vehicles until 1904, when they started manufacturing steam road lorries.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks R. (Undated, but 1988), ''Lincolnshire Engines Worldwide'' pg. 5, Lincolnshire Life Museum, Lincolnshire County Council. {{ISBN|086-1111362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Randolph of Glasgow===
1872, a steam-coach by Charles Randolph of [[Glasgow]] was {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} in length, weighed four and a half tons, but had a maximum speed of only 6&amp;nbsp;miles per hour. Two vertical twin-cylinder engines were independent of one another and each drove one of the rear wheels by spur-gearing. The entire vehicle was enclosed and fitted with windows all around, carried six people, and even had two driving mirrors for observing traffic approaching from behind, the earliest recorded instance of such a device.

===R. Neville Grenville of Glastonbury===
In 1875, R. Neville Grenville of [[Glastonbury]] constructed a 3-wheeled steam vehicle which travelled a maximum of 15&amp;nbsp;miles per hour. This vehicle is still in existence, preserved for many years in the [[Bristol City Museum]] but since 2012 at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].

===Amédée Bollée===
From 1873 to 1883 [[Amédée Bollée]] of [[Le Mans]] built a series of steam-powered passenger vehicles able to carry 6 to 12&amp;nbsp;people at speeds up to 60&amp;nbsp;km/h (38&amp;nbsp;mph), with such names as ''Rapide'' and ''L'Obeissante''. In his vehicles the boiler was mounted behind the passenger compartment with the engine at the front of the vehicle, driving the differential through a shaft with chain drive to the rear wheels. The driver sat behind the engine and steered by means of a wheel mounted on a vertical shaft. The lay-out more closely resembled much later [[motor car]]s than other steam vehicles. ''L'Obeissante'', moreover, in 1873 had [[independent suspension]] on all four corners.&lt;ref name="Csere1988p61"&gt;{{Citation | last = Csere | first = Csaba | authorlink = Csaba Csere |date=January 1988 | title = 10 Best Engineering Breakthroughs | work = Car and Driver | volume = 33 | issue = 7 }}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cederholm brothers===
In 1892, painter Joens Cederholm and his brother, André, a blacksmith, designed their first car, a two-seater, introducing a [[steam locomotive condensing apparatus|condensor]] in 1894. It was not a success.&lt;ref name=Georgano&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Shearer of South Australia===
Starting in 1894, [[J. &amp; D. Shearer|David Shearer]] designed and built the first car in Australia. It was capable of 15 miles per hour on the streets of Adelaide, South Australia. The boiler was his own design, being a horizontal boiler of the 'semi-flash' type. Steering was by a tiller type design and a photograph of the vehicle shows it carrying eight passengers. The news article on the car has a sectional drawing of the design.&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/58525297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/murray/content/didyouknow/shearerCar.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The car’s first official road trial was in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahistoryhub.com.au/people/david-shearer|title=David Shearer - SA History Hub|author=|date=|website=sahistoryhub.com.au|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Dion &amp; Bouton steam vehicles===
:''See [[steam tricycle]]''
The development by Serpollet of the flash steam boiler&lt;ref&gt;Combe Jean-Marc &amp; Escudier Bernard (1986, ''L'Aventure scientifique et technique de la vapeur;'' editions du CNRS, Paris, France; {{ISBN|2-222-03794-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought about the appearance of various diminutive steam tricycles and quadricycles during the late 80s and early 90s, notably by [[De Dion-Bouton|de Dion and Bouton]]; these successfully competed in long distance races but soon met with stiff competition for public favour from the internal combustion engine cars being developed, notably by Peugeot, that quickly cornered most of the popular market. In the face of the flood of IC cars, proponents of the steam car had to fight a long rear-guard battle that was to last into modern times.

===Locomobile Company of America===
[[File:SteamLocomobile1901.jpg|right|thumb|Steam powered [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]], from January, 1901 advertisement]]
This American firm bought the patents from the Stanley Brothers and began building their steam buggies from 1898 to 1905. [[Locomobile Company of America]] went into building gas cars and
lasted until the Depression.

===Stanley Motor Carriage Company===
In 1902, Francis E. Stanley (1849–1918) and Freelan O. Stanley formed the [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company]]. They made famous models such as the 1906 Stanley Rocket, 1908 Stanley K Raceabout and 1923 Stanley Steam Car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/6500685/Stanley_Steamer Models of Stanley Motor Carriage Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311134008/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/6500685/Stanley_Steamer |date=11 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military application of steam road vehicles===
During the [[Crimean War|Crimean war]] a [[traction engine]] was used to pull multiple open trucks.&lt;ref name=Beavan-217&gt;{{cite book|last=Beavan|first=Arthur H.|title=Tube, Train, Tram, and Car or Up-to-date Locomotion|year=1903|publisher=G. Routledge &amp; sons|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/tubetraintramcar00beavrich#page/216/mode/2up|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s many armies experimented with steam tractors pulling [[road train]]s of supply wagons.&lt;ref name="farmcollector.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmcollector.com/steam-traction/steam-tractors-power-behind-first-motorized-armored-vehicles.aspx|title=Steam Tractors the Power Behind First Motorized Armored Vehicles - Steam Engines - Steam Traction|author=|date=|website=farmcollector.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898 steam traction engine trains with up to four wagons were employed in military manoeuvres in England.&lt;ref name=war-20&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanical traction in war for road transport, with notes on automobiles generally|year=1900|publisher=S.

==Early to mid 20th century==
{{For|a more detailed history of 20th century steam cars|steam car}}
&lt;!--did not copy the paragraph about steam cars! Needs some more general history here--&gt;
In 1906 the [[Land Speed Record]] was broken by a Stanley steam car, piloted by Fred Marriott, which achieved 127&amp;nbsp;mph (203&amp;nbsp;km/h) at [[Ormond Beach, Florida]]. This annual week-long "Speed Week" was the forerunner of today's [[Daytona 500]]. This record was not exceeded by any land vehicle until 1910, and stood as the steam-powered world speed record till 25 August 2009.

===Doble Steam Car===
[[File:1924 Doble Model E at Henry Ford Museum.jpg|right|thumb|1924 [[Doble Steam Car|Doble Model E]]]]
Attempts were made to bring more advanced steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the [[Doble Steam Car]]&lt;ref&gt;Walton J.N. (1965-74) ''Doble Steam Cars, Buses, Lorries, and Railcars'' . "Light Steam Power" Isle of Man, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; which shortened start-up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient monotube steam generator to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control. By 1923, [[Abner Doble|Doble's]] steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40&amp;nbsp;seconds or less.

===Paxton Phoenix===
[[File:1953 Paxton Phoenix.jpg|right|thumb|Paxton Phoenix]]
Abner Doble developed the [[Doble Steam Car|Doble Ultimax]] engine for the [[Paxton Phoenix]] steam car, built by the Paxton Engineering Division of [[McCulloch (company)|McCulloch Motors Corporation]], Los Angeles. Its sustained maximum power was {{convert|120|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The project was eventually dropped in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt1b69q0jt/?order=2&amp;brand=calisphere "The True Story of the Paxton Phoenix."] ''Road and Track'', April 1957. pp. 13 - 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of steam car development===
Steam cars became less popular after the adoption of the electric starter, which eliminated the need for risky hand cranking to start gasoline-powered cars. The introduction of assembly-line mass production by [[Henry Ford]], which hugely reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the steam car's demise as the [[Model T]] was both cheap and reliable.

==Late 20th century==
{{for|more information about more modern steam cars|Steam car#Modern steam cars}}&lt;!--Many more types are detailed there--&gt;

===Renewed interest===
In 1968, renewed interest was shown, sometimes prompted by newly available techniques. An older idea that was resurrected is to use a water-tube generator with fire around it, as opposed to using firetubes{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;!-- A large proportion of steam cars have used water tube boilers, including once-through steam generators, since 1900 and before. Stanley is about the only significant fire-tube exception. It's wrong to claim that this is a 1960s innovation --&gt; heating a boiler of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=steam+car&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sYZzTMLLKMODswaQlLX2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=steam+car&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 September 1968|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=13 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype car was built by Charles J. &amp; Calvin E. Williams of Ambler, Pennsylvania. Other high-performance steam cars were built by Richard J.Smith of Midway City, California, and A.M. and E. Pritchard of Caulfeld, Australia. Companies/organisations as [[Controlled Steam Dynamics]] of Mesa, Arizona, [[General Motors]], [[Thermo-Electron Corp.]] of Waltham, Massachusetts, and [[Kinetics Inc]], of Sarasota, Florida all built high-performance steam engines in the same period. [[Bill Lear]] also started work on a closed circuit steam turbine to power cars and buses, and built a transit bus and converted a [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] sedan to use this turbine system. It used a proprietary working fluid dubbed '''Learium''', possibly a [[chlorofluorocarbon]] similar to DuPont Freon.&lt;ref&gt;Ethridge. John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NNQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22lear%22+steam+car+monte#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lear%22%20steam%20car%20monte&amp;f=false  "PM takes a ride in tomorrow's bus, today."] ''Popular Mechanics,'' August 1972. Retrieved: 31 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|While Lear hinted at exotic working fluids, the material used was almost certainly water.|date=October 2015}}

In 1970, a variant of the steam car was made by [[Wallace L.Minto]], which works on Ucon U-113 [[fluorocarbon]] as the working fluid (instead of steam) and kerosene, gasoline, or the like as a fuel. The car was called the [[Minto car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=steam+car&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sYZzTMLLKMODswaQlLX2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=steam+car&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 September 1968|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=13 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steamautomobile.com/SA.html|title=Minto car mentioned in Steam Car books|author=|date=|website=steamautomobile.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land speed record===
On 25 August 2009, a team of British engineers from [[Hampshire]] ran their steam powered car "[[Inspiration (car)|Inspiration]]" at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in the [[Mojave Desert]], and averaged {{Convert|139.84|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}} over two runs, driven by Charles Burnett III.  The car was {{Convert|7.62|m|in|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{Convert|3000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, built from [[Carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] and [[aluminium]] and contained 12 [[boiler]]s with over {{Convert|2|mi|km}} of [[steam]] tubing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/8209288.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK team breaks steam car record | date=25 August 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern steam vehicles==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2013|reason=Whole section should just be deleted.}}
Today most of the problems facing steam cars have been satisfactorily solved, but not the core problem of the low fuel efficiency achieved by practical road going engines.

The main upside would be the ability to burn fuels currently wasted, such as [[garbage]], [[wood]] scrap, and fuels of low value such as [[crude oil]].

Currently the re-introduction of any modern steam car project would run up against the problem of a general loss of steam engine culture which would make it difficult to set up an infrastructure of spares and qualified mechanics. It would also be necessary to meet more stringent safety standards and legislation than existed in the heyday of steam-powered road vehicles. The biggest arguments in favour of such a movement would be: greatly reduced pollution by particulates and noxious gases without recourse to filters, silence in operation, and direct drive without a gearbox. However the competition which development of a modern steam-powered vehicle has to consider is not so much from gasoline-powered cars as from electric, hydrogen-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Proposed [[nuclear car]]s would actually be steam powered with the steam generated from the heat of a nuclear reaction. Nuclear power is probably the best known commercial use of steam in the 21st century, because every [[nuclear power plant]] uses steam in a similar manner.

In [[chemistry]], a '''hydron''' is the general name for a [[cationic]] form of atomic [[hydrogen]], represented with the symbol {{chem|H|+}}. However, this term is avoided and instead '''"[[proton]]"''' is used, which strictly speaking refers to the cation of [[Isotopes of hydrogen#Hydrogen-1 (protium)|protium]], the most common isotope of hydrogen. The term "hydron" includes cations of hydrogen regardless of their isotopic composition: thus it refers collectively to protons (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for the protium isotope, [[deuteron]]s (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for the [[deuterium]] isotope, and [[triton (physics)|tritons]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for the [[tritium]] isotope. Unlike most other ions, the hydron consists only of a bare [[atomic nucleus]].

The negatively charged counterpart of the hydron is the [[hydride]] anion, {{chem|H|−}}.

== Properties ==

=== Solute properties ===

Hydron compounds are [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] ([[ionic compound|ionic]]) solutes. While displaying a preference for solvents with high [[relative static permittivity]] (dielectric constants), they dissolve not only in polar compounds, but also in nonpolar compounds.

The hydron (a completely free or "naked" hydrogen atomic nucleus) is too reactive to occur in many liquids, even though it is sometimes visualized to do so by students of chemistry. A free hydron would react with a molecule of the liquid to form a more complicated cation. Examples are the [[hydronium]] ion in water-based acids, and {{Chem|H|2|F|+}}, the unstable cation of [[fluoroantimonic acid]], the strongest [[superacid]]. For this reason, in such liquids including liquid acids, hydrons [[diffuse]] by contact from one complex cation to another, via the [[Grotthuss mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psc.edu/science/klein2000.html] Computer modeling of proton-hopping in superacids.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acidity ===

The hydron ion can incorporate an electron pair from a Lewis base into the molecule by adduction:
:{{Chem|[H]|+}} + :L → {{Chem|[HL]|+}}
Because of this capture of the Lewis base (L), the hydron ion has Lewis acidic character. The hydron ion is a strong Lewis acid, able to capture one Lewis base.

The hydrated form of the hydrogen cation, the [[hydronium]] (hydroxonium) ion {{chem|H|3|O|+}}&lt;small&gt;(aq)&lt;/small&gt;, is a key object of [[Acid#Definitions and concepts|Arrhenius' definition of acid]]. Other hydrated forms, the [[Zundel cation]] {{chem|H|5|O|2|+}} which is formed from a proton and two water molecules, and {{what|the [[Eigen cation]] {{chem|H|9|O|4|+}}, a hydronium ion and three water molecules, play an important role in "hydron hopping" according to the Grotthuss mechanism|date=September 2016}}. The hydron itself is crucial in more general [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory]], which extends the concept of [[acid–base]] chemistry beyond [[aqueous solution]]s.

== Isotopes of hydron ==

[[File:Hydron.svg|thumb|150px]]
# [[Proton]], having the symbol p or &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is the +1 ion of [[Hydrogen|protium]], &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.
# [[Deuteron]], having the symbol &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is the +1 ion of [[deuterium]], &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or D.
# [[triton (physics)|Triton]], having the symbol &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is the +1 ion of [[tritium]], &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H or T.
Other [[isotopes of hydrogen]] are too unstable to be relevant in chemistry.

== History of the term ==
The term "hydron" is recommended by [[IUPAC]] to be used instead of "proton" if no distinction is made between the isotopes proton, deuteron and triton, all found in naturally occurring undifferentiated [[isotope]] mixtures. The name "proton" refers to [[isotope separation|isotopically pure]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry-IUPAC Recommendations 2005 [http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf Red Book 2005.pdf] IR-3.3.2, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, referring to the hydron as simply ''hydrogen ion'' is not recommended because [[hydrogen anion]]s also exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Compendium of Chemical Terminology'', 2nd edition McNaught, A.D. and Wilkinson, A. Blackwell Science, 1997 {{ISBN|0-86542-684-8}}, also [http://www.iupac.org/publications/compendium/index.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212164525/http://www.iupac.org/publications/compendium/index.html |date=2005-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- what about other hydrogen ions, such as dihydrogen cation? --&gt;

The term "hydron" was defined by [[IUPAC]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=hydron|file=H02904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Names for hydrogen atoms, ions, and groups, and for reactions involving them (Recommendations 1988) | last = Bunnet | first = J.F. |author2=Jones, R.A.Y. | year = 1968 | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 1115–6 | journal = [[Pure Appl. Chem.]] | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6007x1115.pdf | doi = 10.1351/pac198860071115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Traditionally, the term "proton" was and is used in place of "hydron".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
The latter term is generally only used in the context where comparisons between the various isotopes of hydrogen is important (as in the [[kinetic isotope effect]] or hydrogen [[isotopic labeling]]).  Otherwise, referring to hydrons as protons is still considered acceptable, for example in such terms as [[protonation]], [[deprotonation]], [[proton pump]] or [[voltage-gated proton channel|proton channel]]. The transfer of {{chem|H|+}} in an acid-base reaction is usually referred to as ''proton'' transfer. Acid and bases are referred to as ''proton'' donors and acceptors correspondingly.

However, although 99.9844% of natural hydrogen nuclei are protons, the remainder (about 156 per million in sea water) are deuterons (see [[deuterium]]). A rare triton also occurs (see [[tritium]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1624">A '''hypertriton''' is a type of [[hypernucleus]], formed of a [[proton]], a [[neutron]] and any [[hyperon]]. The name comes from ''hyperon'', which refers to [[baryon]]s containing [[strange quark]]s, and ''triton'', which refers to the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of [[tritium]]. Because low-mass hyperons are longer-lived and easier to create than high-mass hyperons, the most common hypertritons are those containing [[Lambda baryon]]s.

Its antiparticle, the '''antihypertriton''', is formed of an [[antiproton]], an [[antineutron]] and any antihyperon. The first one was discovered in March 2010 by the [[STAR detector]] of the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].

==Extension of the table of nuclides==
[[Image:Table isotopes en.svg|thumb|right|150px|The 'normal' table of nuclides.]]

[[Atomic nucleus|Normal nuclei]] are formed only of protons and neutrons. To study them, scientists arrange the various [[nuclide]]s into a two-dimensional [[table of nuclides]]. On one axis is the number of neutrons ''N'', and on the other is the number of protons ''Z''. Because the antihyperon introduces a third component ([[strangeness]]), the table becomes three-dimensional.

'''Kakanj Thermal Power Plant''' is one of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s largest [[coal|coal-fired]] power plant having an installed electric capacity of 450&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elektroprivreda.ba/np/ep/epp?bp=2&amp;mp=10 Kakanj Thermal Power Plant]&lt;/ref&gt; and producing around 2.3&amp;nbsp;billion Kwh of electricity per year.  The power plant is operated by [[Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine]].
The chimney of Kakanj Power Plant is 300 metres tall and is one of the tallest man-made objects built in former Yugoslavia.

==History==
Kakanj has been coal mining area since 1898. Construction of the coal-fired power plant started in 1947. and the first and unit was commissioned in 1956.&lt;ref name=industcards&gt;

[[File:Macquoidpanelchest.jpg|thumb|An English oak chest with complex linenfold panels.]]

'''Linenfold''' (or '''linen fold''') is a simple style of [[relief carving]] used to decorate [[Frame and panel|wood panelling]] with a design "imitating window tracery",&lt;ref&gt;Whiton, Augustus Sherrill. ''Interior Design and Decoration''. Lippincott, 1974. {{ISBN|0-397-47302-8}}. Page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; "imitating folded linen"&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Banister. ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''. Scribner, 1961. Page 1266.&lt;/ref&gt; or "stiffly imitating folded material".&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Jane A. ''Brick Building in England from the Middle Ages to 1550''. J. Baker, 1972. Page 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally from [[Flanders]], the style became widespread across [[Northern Europe]] in the 14th to 16th centuries. The name was applied to the decorative style by [[antiquarian]] [[connoisseur]]s in the early 19th century; the contemporary name was apparently ''lignum undulatum'' ([[Latin]]: "wavy wood"), Nathaniel Lloyd pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Lloyd, "Medieval Wainscoting and the Development of the Linen Panel" ''The [[Burlington Magazine]] for Connoisseurs'' '''53''' No. 308 (November 1928), pp 230-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood panelling or [[wainscoting]], almost always made from [[oak]], became popular in Northern Europe from the 14th century, after European [[carpenter]]s rediscovered the techniques to create frame and panel [[Articulation (architecture)|joinery]]. The framing technique was used from the 13th century onwards to clad interior walls,&lt;ref&gt;A directive of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] for "Norway boards" to "wainscot" the chamber of the prince Edward at [[Winchester]] was noted by Nathaniel Lloyd 1928:230.&lt;/ref&gt; to form [[Choir (architecture)|choir stall]]s, and to manufacture moveable and semi-moveable furniture, such as chests and presses, and even the back panels of joined chairs. Linenfold was developed as a simple technique to decorate the flat surfaces of the ubiquitous panels thus created.

The simplest linenfold style is "parchemin" (also known as "[[parchment]] fold"), a [[Bas-relief|low relief]] carving formed like a sheet of [[paper]] or piece of [[linen]] folded in half and then spread out with the sharp centered fold running vertically, and the top and bottom running out to the corners of the panel, with something of the appearance of an opened book. This style of linenfold can be created using a plane and a pre-drawn pattern, with a little finishing chisel work required at each end. A stitched embroidered border could be counterfeited by the use of punches. More complicated styles resemble a sheet of fabric that has volute folds back and forth many times. Linenfold might be fielded, visually complete against a flat panel surface and contained within each panel, or it might provide the appearance of a continuous linenfold passing behind the stiles of the framing.

Carving linenfold decoration requires little carpentry skill or training, and it can be [[mass production|mass-produced]] by a semi-skilled workforce: the creased designs were run with a [[plane (tool)|moulding plane]]; only top and bottom edges needed to be finished with a [[chisel]]. Significantly, linenfold had no prototype in architectural practice:&lt;ref&gt;John Gloag, ''A Short Dictionary of Furniture'', rev. ed. 1969: sub "Linenfold"&lt;/ref&gt; the technique of the moulding plane is not applicable to [[masonry|stone-cutting]]. Workshops were established by the later 15th century to cater to the developing market for inexpensively ''ceiled'' rooms,&lt;ref&gt;Hence ''[[ceiling]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; supplementing the more complicated, and more expensive, patterns of [[tracery]] used in the earliest interior panelling.

Regional variations quickly developed in [[England]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]. The linenfold of France, Netherlands, and Germany "is carved with a sharper definition and greater delicacy than was usual in England",&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 15th ed. Article "Decorative Arts and Furnishings", section "Middle Ages" (by Joseph T. Butler, [http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-73720 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; where an early linenfold panelling can be seen in the hall screen at [[Compton Wynyates]]. Linenfold started to fall out of fashion as [[Renaissance]] styles spread in the 16th century, replaced by fielded panels for simpler work, and more complicated "Roman" and [[high relief|higher relief]] carving, but linenfold continued to be used in less sophisticated surroundings well into the 17th century. In the 19th century, linenfold panelling reappeared in the revivals of the [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] and [[Tudor revival|Tudor]] styles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2570">'''Lucretia W. Edwards''' (May 15, 1916 [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] &amp;ndash; October 12, 2005) was an environmental activist and preservationist from [[Richmond, California]]. 

Edwards is responsible for thousands of acres being added to the [[East Bay Regional Parks District]] and the [[National Park Service]]. These include the [[Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline]], [[Point Pinole Regional Shoreline]], and [[Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park]], which absorbed Lucretia Edwards Park, named in her honor. She was also responsible for the addition of [[Winehaven, California|Winehaven]], Point Richmond, [[East Brother Island Lighthouse]], and [[Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot|Point Molate]] to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1989 Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] recognized her in the congressional record; she was chosen the Woman of the Year for the 11th District by Assembly Person Bob Campbell. The [[California State Senate]] and Assembly honored her in a series of special ceremonies along with 101 women, a Women Legislators Caucus-sponsored honor.

She was married to Tom Edwards and had three children. The family lived in a [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond]], California, house for 37 years, where she also died.

'''''McGee v. General Motors''''' was a 1998 [[court case]] in which the jury awarded plaintiffs Robert and Connie McGee $60 million.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9802/14/gm.fuel.tanks/index.html?_s=PM:US|title=Documents: GM knew of safety problems|date=February 14, 1998|publisher=CNN|accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed hidden information about a [[General Motors]] fuel tank design. General Motors (GM) was alleged to have sacrificed vehicle safety measures in favor of additional profit.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; This case was featured on [[CNN]], ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

==Background==

On July 3, 1991, Robert and Connie McGee were traveling with their children Kelly and Shane in their 1983 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser]].&lt;ref name="LA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/19/business/fi-51200|title=Jury Orders GM to Pay Couple $33 Million Over Death of Son|date=May 19, 1998|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While stopped at a toll booth, the car was hit by a trailer which had disconnected from a truck several lanes away, driven by Curtis Cayton.&lt;ref name="LA1" /&gt; The impact caused the trailer tongue-head to pierce the car’s gas tank, resulting in a [[gas explosion|gasoline explosion]].

After the accident, Shane McGee died as a result of severe burns to 98% of his body. Robert, Connie, and Kelly survived, but needed skin grafts to repair burn damage. Connie had to undergo [[reconstructive surgery]] due to extensive burns on her hands and face.

The McGees settled with the truck driver out of court, but sued General Motors for intentionally failing to provide adequate safety measures on the car.

==Trial and Verdict==

During the trial, testimony from several former General Motors engineers showed that the design of the fuel tank was too thin and placed too close to the ground. Also, internal documents showed that the placement of a metal shield could protect the most vulnerable parts of the [[gas tank]] and greatly improve safety, at a cost of $4.50 per vehicle.&lt;ref name="SS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-05-12/news/9805110378_1_gm-engineer-gas-tanks-giant-automaker|title=Gm Cold-hearted, Attorney Says|author=HENRY FITZGERALD JR|date=May 12, 1998|publisher=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was tried at the Broward County Circuit Court in [[Ft. Lauderdale, FL]], and the plaintiffs were represented by Robert W. Kelley, John J. Uustal and Sheldon Schlesinger.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-05-19/news/9805180476_1_general-motors-corp-shane-mcgee-constance-mcgee|title=Family Gets Relief|date=May 19, 1998|publisher=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors was represented by James Feeney, Bud Kirk, Daniel Gerber, Terrence Russell and Jay Lefkowitz.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; On May 18, 1998, the jury returned a verdict of $60 million in compensatory damages, and ruled that both General Motors and Curtis Cayton were at fault.&lt;ref name="LA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-9712.html |title=$33M Jury Verdict Against GM|date=February 11, 2009|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Metglas is based on technology developed at [[AlliedSignal]] research facilities in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] and [[Vacuumschmelze]] in Hanau, Germany. The development of [[amorphous metal]]s began in 1970. Over the years, many new alloys have been found using the same principles of rapid solidification.

Metglas, also known as metallic glass alloys, differ from traditional metals in that they have a non-crystalline structure and possess unique physical and magnetic properties that combine high [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[hardness]] with [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] and [[toughness]].

'''Mikhail L. Surguchev''' (1928—1991) was a prominent [[petroleum]] scientist in the [[USSR]]. He was widely recognized in Russia and internationally as an expert in [[reservoir engineering]], [[oil field]] development, [[Water injection (oil production)|waterflooding]], enhancing and improving oil recovery (EOR and IOR) methods.

==Education==
Surguchev studied at Ishimbai Petroleum Engineering High School, and Kuibyshev Industrial Institute (University).

==Career==
After graduating from the University, Mikhail Surguchev obtained his Doctorate at the State Research Institute Giprovostokneft in Samara, where he developed a blocked inter-contour system for oilfield development by waterflooding. This system was implemented in a number of major oil fields, particularly those in the Volga-Ural and Western Siberia Regions.

In 1966, Dr. Surguchev was invited to join the All-Union Oil and Gas Scientific Research Institute (VNIIneft) in Moscow, the main research institute of the petroleum industry in the country.
In 1971 he was appointed Head of the Department of Enhanced Oil Recovery at the VNIIneft Institute; subsequently becoming the Deputy Director, and ultimately the Director. In his years at this Institute, he guided and took part in a range of theoretical and experimental investigations of EOR processes. He was also the project manager for the development of the giant Samotlor oil field in Western Siberia, and was responsible for initiating a number of improved oil recovery projects in reservoirs situated in the Volga-Urals, Western Siberia, and other parts of the country.

In 1986, Dr. Surguchev became the Director General of the Inter-branch Scientific Technological Complex “Oil Recovery” in Moscow, a position that he held until his untimely death in 1991. Under his leadership, the complex prospered, and has given considerable support to the industry in improving the technology of oil recovery.

Dr. Surguchev’s contribution to the science and technology of oil recovery included more than 200 scientific papers, 18 monographs and 30 patented inventions. A large number of his technical innovations were implemented by the petroleum industry.

Dr. Surguchev was elected a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He was a Laureate of the Lenin Prize for Scientific and Technical Achievements (1966) and an Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation (1989). He has been awarded the USSR Order of the Red Banner of Labour.

Dr. Surguchev was widely known and respected throughout the petroleum industry as a strong advocate for international cooperation and the dissemination of information between scientists and engineers. He was the Vice Chairman of the Executive Board of the World Petroleum Congress, and a very active member of the Steering committee for the European Symposia on Improved Oil Recovery.

The {{Nihongo|'''Ministry of the Environment'''|環境省|Kankyō-shō}} is a [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]]-level ministry of the [[government of Japan]] responsible for global environmental conservation, pollution control, and nature conservation. The ministry was formed in 2001 from the sub-cabinet level Environmental Agency established in 1971. The [[Minister of the Environment (Japan)|Minister of the Environment]] is a member of the Cabinet of Japan and is chosen by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]], usually from among members of the [[National Diet|Diet]].&lt;ref name="kokugo"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Kokugo Daijiten |title=Kankyō-shō |trans-title=Ministry of the Environment |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-02-31 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="end"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Ministry of Environment |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-05-31 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, the then-Minister of the Environment [[Yuriko Koike]], created a ''[[furoshiki]]'' cloth to promote its use in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/en/focus/060403.html Minister Koike created the "Mottainai Furoshiki" as a symbol of Japanese culture to reduce wastes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the [[Cabinet of Japan]] approved a plan to establish a new energy watchdog under the Environment Ministry,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/cabinet-approves-plan-to-set-up-new-nuclear-watchdog [[Japan Today]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nuclear Regulation Authority]] was founded on September 19, 2012.&lt;ref&gt; Nuclear Regulation Authority [http://www.nsr.go.jp/english/ index] Retrieved on September 22, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Cool Biz==
The Ministry of the Environment began advocating the [[Cool Biz campaign]] in summer 2005 as a means to help reduce electric consumption by limiting use of air conditioning and allowing the wearing of less formal officewear. This idea was proposed by then-Minister of the Environment [[Yuriko Koike]] under Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]].

==Super Cool Biz==
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in March 2011, the shut down of many nuclear power plants for safety reasons lead to energy shortages. To conserve energy, the government recommended setting air conditioners at 28 degrees Celsius, switching off computers not in use, and called for shifting work hours to the morning and taking more summer vacation than usual. The government then launched a ''Super Cool Biz'' campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/earth/info/challenge25/super_coolbiz.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015200315/http://www.env.go.jp/earth/info/challenge25/super_coolbiz.html |archivedate=2012-10-15 }} Japan's Ministry of the Environment Official Super Cool Biz Campaign site {{ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage workers to wear outfits appropriate for the office yet cool enough to endure the summer heat.

A '''nurse log''' is a fallen [[tree]] which, as it decays, provides [[ecological facilitation]] to seedlings. Broader definitions include providing shade or support to other plants. Some of the advantages a nurse log offers to a seedling are: [[water]], [[moss]] thickness, [[leaf litter]], [[mycorrhizae]], disease protection, nutrients, and [[sunlight]]. Recent research into soil pathogens suggests that in some forest communities, pathogens hostile to a particular tree species appear to gather in the vicinity of that species, and to a degree inhibit seedling growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mangan |first1=Scott A. |last2=Schnitzer |first2=Stefan A. |last3=Herre |first3=Edward A. |last4=Mack |first4=Keenan M. L. |last5=Valencia |first5=Mariana C. |last6=Sanchez |first6=Evelyn I. |last7=Bever |first7=James D. |year=2010 |title=Negative plant–soil feedback predicts tree-species relative abundance in a tropical forest |journal=Nature |volume= |issue= |pages=752–755 |id= |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09273 |accessdate=3 February 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurse logs may therefore provide some measure of protection from these pathogens, thus promoting greater seedling survivorship.

==Occurrence==

Various mechanical and biological processes contribute to the breakdown of [[lignin]] in fallen trees, resulting in the formation of niches of increasing size, which tend to fill with forest litter such as soil from spring floods, needles, [[moss]], mushrooms and other flora. Mosses also can cover the outside of a log, hastening its decay and supporting other species as rooting media and by retaining water. Small animals such as various [[squirrel]]s often perch or roost on nurse logs, adding to the litter by food debris and scat. The decay of this detritus contributes to the formation of a rich [[humus]] that provides a seedbed and adequate conditions for germination.
[[Image:Nursery Log at Schooner Trail.jpg|thumb|left|Nurse log harboring a young [[western hemlock]]]]

Nurse logs often provide a seedbed to conifers in a [[temperate rain forest]] ecosystem.

They are strictly freshwater, and are found in ditches, ponds, streams and canals.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, A.K.A. (1989): Freshwater fishes of Bangladesh. ''[[Zoological Society of Bangladesh]]. Department of Zoology, University of Dhaka. 364 p.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
In an aquarium, they are generally peaceful, and tend not to bother other fishes, even those much smaller than they are although they are susceptible to be bullied by larger more boisterous fish. They prefer cooler water (76&amp;nbsp;°F/24.4&amp;nbsp;°C at most, although higher temps are tolerated in the short term providing oxygen levels do not drop).Gentle water flow is preferred and be sure to use a soft substrate as this fish has sensitive bristles which is uses whilst foraging.

''Oreichthys cosuatis'' is found in the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] and [[Brahmaputra river]] systems in India, Bangladesh and [[Nepal]]. This fish favours slow flowing areas of rivers with dense vegetation and clear water.
This fish reaches around 40mm with the male growing slightly larger than the females,slightly more colourful and  they have an extended dorsal fin

==History==
[[File:African rice niger.png|thumb|Growing ''Oryza glaberrima'' along the Niger River, where the species was first domesticated.]]
Humans have independently domesticated two different rice species. African rice was domesticated from wild African rice, ''[[Oryza barthii]]'', while Asian rice (''[[Oryza sativa]]''), was domesticated from wild Asian rice, ''[[Oryza rufipogon]]''.

''[[Oryza barthii]]'' still grows wild in Africa, in a wide variety of open habitats. The Sahara was [[North African climate cycles|formerly wetter]], with massive [[paleolakes]] in what is now the Western Sahara. As the climate dried, the wild rice retreated and probably became increasingly domesticated as it relied on humans for irrigation. Rice growing in deeper, more permanent water became [[floating rice]].&lt;ref name=PROT4U&gt;{{citation|author=Plant Resources of Tropical Africa, PROTA4U database|title=Oryza glaberrima Steud|url=http://www.prota4u.org/protav8.asp?p=Oryza+glaberrima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed to have been domesticated 2000–3000 years ago in the [[Inner Niger Delta|inland delta]] of the Upper [[Niger River]], in what is now [[Mali]].&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;&lt;ref name=genome&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ng.3044| issn = 1061-4036| volume = 46| issue = 9| pages = 982–988| last1 = Wang| first1 = Muhua| last2 = Yu| first2 = Yeisoo| last3 = Haberer| first3 = Georg| last4 = Marri| first4 = Pradeep Reddy| last5 = Fan| first5 = Chuanzhu| last6 = Goicoechea| first6 = Jose Luis| last7 = Zuccolo| first7 = Andrea| last8 = Song| first8 = Xiang| last9 = Kudrna| first9 = Dave| last10 = Ammiraju| first10 = Jetty S.

In the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Portuguese sailed to the Southern Rivers area in [[West Africa]] and wrote that the land was rich in rice. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]&lt;/nowiki&gt;hey said they found the country covered by vast crops, with many cotton trees and large fields planted in rice … the country looked to them as having the aspect of a pond (i.e., a marais)”. The Portuguese accounts speak of the Falupo [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Landuma]], [[Biafada]], and  [[Bainuk people|Bainik]] growing rice. [[André Álvares de Almada]] wrote about the [[dike (construction)|dike]] systems used for rice cultivation,&lt;ref name=linares/&gt; from which [[Carabane#Rice cultivation|modern West African rice dike systems]] are descended.

African rice was brought to the Americas with the [[transatlantic slave trade]], arriving in Brazil probably by the 1550s&lt;ref name=carney/&gt; and in the U.S. in 1784.&lt;ref name=charleston/&gt;{{dubious|date=August 2016}} The seed was carried as provisions on slave ships,&lt;ref name=carney/&gt; and the technology and skills needed to grow it were brought by enslaved rice farmers.

Asian rice came to West Africa in the late 1800s, and by the late twentieth century had substantially supplanted native African rice. However, African rice was still used in specific, often marginal habitats, and preferred for its taste&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;&lt;ref name=PROT4U/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 8| issue = 6| pages = 624–631| last1 = Ologbon| first1 = O.

The 2007 food price shocks drove efforts to raise rice production.

Subsidies of nerica seeds have also been criticized for encouraging the loss of native varieties and reducing the independence of farmers.&lt;ref name=ngo/&gt;

Multiple varieties of African rice are often grown so that the harvest is staggered. In this way, the harvest can be eaten fresh. Freshly harvested rice is moist, and can be [[puffed rice|puffed]] in fire, and eaten. Fried rice have browny color when fried this is because of the husk that is green in color when heated turns brown.{{clarify|reason=Is the rice puffed by roasting it in its husk, which turns brown?|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

African rice can be prepared in much the same way as Asian rice, but has a distinct nutty flavour, for which it is favoured in West Africa.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;&lt;ref name=kew&gt;{{Cite web| title = Oryza glaberrima (African rice) |publisher=Plants &amp; Fungi At Kew| accessdate = 2016-08-10| url = http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:410061-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; African rice grains are often reddish in colour; some varieties are strongly aromatic,&lt;ref name=PROT4U/&gt; other, like Carolina Gold, are not at all aromatic.&lt;ref name=charleston/&gt;

African rice is also used medicinally.&lt;ref name=kew/&gt;

==Traits==

===Appearance===
African rice is a tall rice plant, usually under 120&amp;nbsp;cm but up to five meters for [[floating rice|floating]] varieties, which may also branch and root from higher stem nodes.&lt;ref name=PROT4U/&gt; Generally, African rice has small, pear-shaped grain, reddish bran and green to black [[rice hull|hulls]], straight, simply-branched [[panicles]], and short, rounded [[ligules]]. There are, however, exceptions, and it can be hard to distinguish from Asian rice.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;&lt;ref name=PROT4U/&gt; For complete certainty, a genetic test can be used.

===Hardiness===
African rice is well adapted to the African environment. It is drought- and [[deepwater rice|deep-water]]-resistant, and tolerates fluctuations in water depth, iron toxicity, infertile soils, severe climatic conditions, and human neglect better than Asian rice.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;&lt;ref name=shatter&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4314/ijbcs.v7i2.10| issn = 1997-342X| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 535–543| last1 = Montcho| first1 = D.| last2 = Futakuchi| first2 = K.| last3 = Agbangla| first3 = C.| last4 = Fofana| first4 = M.| last5 = Dieng| first5 = I.| title = Yield loss of Oryza glaberrima caused by grain shattering under rainfed upland conditions| journal = International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences| accessdate = 2016-08-09| date = 2013-01-01| url = http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijbcs/article/view/92412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some varieties also mature more quickly, and may be sown directly on higher ground, eliminating the need to transplant seedlings.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt; Most is rain-watered, and the soil is often not cultivated.&lt;ref name=PROT4U/&gt;

African rice has profuse vegetative growth, which smothers weeds. It exhibits better resistance to various [[List of rice diseases|rice pests and diseases]], such as [[blast disease]], [[Cecidomyiidae|African rice gall midge (''Orseolia oryzivora'')]], parasitic [[nematode]]s (''[[Heterodera sacchari]]'' and ''[[Meloidogyne]]'' spp.), [[Benyvirus|rice stripe necrosis virus]], [[rice yellow mottle virus]], and the parasitic plant ''[[Striga (plant)|Striga]]''.&lt;ref name=india/&gt;&lt;ref name=shatter/&gt;

===Yield and processing===
Most African rices [[shattering (agriculture)|shatter]] more than Asian rices, possibly because they haven't been domesticated for as long. A few varieties of African rice are as resistant to shattering as shatter-resistant Asian varieties, but most are not; on average, about half of the grains are scattered and lost. This is why yield is lower; when the heads of African rice are bagged before they become ripe, so that the shattered grains are caught in paper bags, the yield of African rice is the same as the yield of Asian rice.&lt;ref name=shatter/&gt;

Like other grains, rice may lodge, or fall over, when grain heads are full. African rice's greater height and weaker stems makes it more likely to lodge, although it also lets it survive [[deepwater rice|in deep water]], and makes it easier to harvest. African rice tends to elongate rapidly if completely submerged, which is not advantageous in regions prone to short floods, as it weakens the plant.&lt;ref name=PROT4U/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-12-005907-2| last = Woolhouse| first = Harold William| title = Advances in botanical research. Vol. 7 Vol. 7| location = London| date = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grains of African rice are more brittle than those of Asian rice. The grains are more likely to break during industrial polishing.&lt;ref name=blackrice&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-02921-7| last1 = Carney| first1 = Judith Ann| title = Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas| date = 2009-06-30|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/c/carney-rice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broken rice]] is widely used in West Africa, and some cookbooks from the region will suggest manually breaking the grains for certain recipes,([http://congocookbook.com/rice_recipes/ceebu_jen.html example]) but most broken rice eaten is from Asian rice, about 16% of which is broken in processing.

===Breeding===
African and Asian rice do not readily interpollinate, even under controlled conditions, and when they do, the offspring are very rarely fertile. Even the fertile crossbred offspring have low fertility.&lt;ref name=india/&gt;

Crossbreeding seems to have succeeded in at least one area of Maritime Guinea, as some varieties there show crossbred genes.&lt;ref name=cross&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10681-006-9278-1| issn = 0014-2336| volume = 154| issue = 1–2| pages = 127–137| last1 = Barry| first1 = M.

More recently, the [[NERICA|nerica cultivars]] ('''ne'''w '''ri'''ce for Afri'''ca''') have been developed using [[green revolution]] techniques like [[embryo rescue]].&lt;ref name=india/&gt; Over 3000 crosses were made as part of the NERICA program.&lt;ref name=india/&gt; Breeding within the species is easier, and there are uncounted numbers of African rice varieties, although the majority may have been lost.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt; A similar crossed variety was bred in the United States in 2011,&lt;ref name=goldenseed/&gt; and work is being done on crosses with Indian rice varieties.&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0011-3891| volume = 89| issue = 25| last1 = Sarla| first1 = N.| last2 = Swamy| first2 = B.

== Cultivars ==

===African cultivars===
There are a great many varieties of African rice. In the 1960s older women in [[Jipalom]] (a village in the [[Ziguinchor Region]]) could unhesitatingly name more than ten varieties of African rice that were no longer planted, besides the half-dozen that were then still being planted. Each woman would plant multiple different varieties, to suite varying microhabitats and to stagger the harvest.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt; A 2006 survey showed that a village typically cultivated 25 varieties of rice; an individual household would on average have 14 varieties and grow four per year;&lt;ref name=ngo/&gt; this, however, is down from the seven to nine varieties per woman that was average in previous decades. Women, who are traditionally responsible for the seeds, trade them often over long-distance networks.&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;

Varieties, each with subtypes, include:&lt;ref name=linares/&gt;
* ''aspera''
* ''ebenicolorata''
* ''evoluta''
* ''rigida''
* ''rustica''

The cultivars the [[Africa Rice Center]] calls TOG 12303 and TOG 9300 have low [[shattering (agriculture)|shattering]], and thus yields comparable with low-shattering Asian rice varieties.&lt;ref name=shatter/&gt;

Scientists from the [[Africa Rice Center]] managed to cross-breed African rice with Asian rice varieties to produce a [[Cultivar group|group]] of interspecific cultivars called [[New Rice for Africa]] (NERICA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interspecific Oryza Sativa L.

===American cultivars===
{{see also|Rice production in the United States}}

Carolina Gold is an heirloom cultivar grown in the early United States, sometimes known as golden-seed rice for the colour of its grains.&lt;ref name=charleston&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.carolinagoldricefoundation.org/papers/ricepaper.5.1.2011.pdf |title=Charleston Gold: A Direct Descendant of Carolina Gold |first=David S. |last=Shields |magazine=The Rice Paper |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2011 |publisher=Carolina Gold Rice Foundation |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-grain gold-seed rice boasted grains 5/12ths of an inch long (up from 3/8ths of an inch), and was brought to market by planter Joshua John Ward in the 1840s. Despite its popularity, the variety was lost in the American Civil War.&lt;ref name=charleston/&gt;

Charleston Gold was released in 2011 and is a crossbreed of Carolina Gold and two ''[[Oryza sativa]]'' breeding lines called IR64 ([[Oryza sativa var. indica|Indica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1385/1-59745-130-4:201 |issn=1064-3745 |volume=343 |pages=201–212 |last=Datta |first=Karabi |last2=Datta |first2=Swapan Kumar |title=Indica rice (Oryza sativa, BR29 and IR64) |journal=[[Methods in Molecular Biology]] |year=2006 |pmid=16988345}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and IR65610-24-3-6-3-2-3, which raised the yield, shortened the stem, and added an aromatic quality to the rice.&lt;ref name=charleston/&gt;

The '''Pedras de abalar''', [[Galician language|Galician]] for "oscillating stones", are several large stones in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain, that can easily be moved by a person or the wind. One of these is in [[Muxía]], and is known as the "Pedra da Barca". These are large stones that are balanced on a point, so that they can be moved back and forth easily, or even wiggle in response to the wind. These were used at one time to determine the guilt or innocence of those accused of serious crimes. In English, such stones have been called [[rocking stone]]s, or logan stones.

The ''Pedras de Abalar'' in Galicia are:
* [[Cíes]] Island
* Corbelle ([[Vilalba]])
* Sande ([[Ourense]])
* Paradela (near [[Cambados]])
* Pedra da Barca (near [[Muxía]])
* Meixide ([[Viana do Bolo]])
* Vilamaior de Boullosa (in the [[Limia River]] region)
* Pena da Conga ([[Melide, A Coruña|Melide]])
* Castro do Faro ([[O Porriño]])
* Pena de Embade de Ferrol (demolished, 1755)

Other pedra de abalar include the "Pena da Conga" in [[Melide, A Coruña|Melide]], and the "Castro do Faro" in [[O Porriño]].

'''Perfluorooctanoic acid''' ('''PFOA''') ([[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] '''perfluorooctanoate''') is a [[perfluorinated carboxylic acid]] produced and used worldwide as an industrial [[surfactant]] in chemical processes and as a material [[feedstock]], and is known as an emerging health concern and subject of regulatory action and voluntary industrial phase-outs. PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure consisting of a perfluorinated, n-octyl "tail group" and a [[carboxylate]] "head group". The head group can be described as [[hydrophilic]] while the [[fluorocarbon]] tail is both [[hydrophobic]] and [[lipophobic]]; The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The "tail" is hydrophobic due to being [[non-polar]] and lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to the [[London dispersion force]] than [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name="Lemal2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lemal DM|date=January 2004|title=Perspective on fluorocarbon chemistry|journal=J. Org. Chem.|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1021/jo0302556|pmid=14703372}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

PFOA is used for several industrial applications, including carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, sealants, and cookware. PFOA serves as a surfactant in the [[emulsion polymerization]] of [[fluoropolymers]] and as a building block for the synthesis of perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds, polymers, and polymeric materials.  PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindstrom |first1=Andrew B. |last2=Strynar |first2=Mark J. |last3=Libelo |first3=E.

Technol. |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=7954–7961 |doi=10.1021/es2011622}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also formed by the [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] of [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] such as some [[fluorotelomer]]s. PFOA is used as a surfactant because it can lower the [[surface tension]] of water more than [[hydrocarbon]] surfactants while having exceptional stability due to having perfluoroalkyl tail group.&lt;ref name="Salager2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lemal2004" /&gt; The stability of PFOA is desired industrially but is a cause of concern environmentally.

PFOA persists indefinitely in the environment. It is [[toxic]].{{Citation needed|reason=Following sentence with citations indicates that the toxicity of PFOA is currently disputed|date=August 2018}} As it is a suspected [[carcinogen]], various studies have been undertaken, but no link between PFOA and cancer emerged, although it remains suspect and under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2011.05.010 |pmid=21676652 |title=Impacts of two perfluorinated compounds (PFOS and PFOA) on human hepatoma cells: Cytotoxicity but no genotoxicity? |journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health |volume=214 |issue=6 |pages=493–9 |year=2011 |last1=Florentin |first1=Arnaud |last2=Deblonde |first2=Tiphanie |last3=Diguio |first3=Nathalie |last4=Hautemaniere |first4=Alexis |last5=Hartemann |first5=Philippe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tox.2010.05.006 |pmid=20621739 |title=Alterations in tumor biomarker GSTP gene methylation patterns induced by prenatal exposure to PFOS |journal=Toxicology |volume=274 |issue=1–3 |pages=57–64 |year=2010 |last1=Wan |first1=Yan-Jian |last2=Li |first2=Yuan-Yuan |last3=Xia |first3=Wei |last4=Chen |first4=Jun |last5=Lv |first5=Zi-Quan |last6=Zeng |first6=Huai-cai |last7=Zhang |first7=Ling |last8=Yang |first8=Wen-jie |last9=Chen |first9=Tian |last10=Lin |first10=Yi |last11=Wei |first11=Jie |last12=Xu |first12=Shun-Qing }}&lt;/ref&gt; PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] (ppb) range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. How general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood. PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain-resistant carpets, carpet-cleaning liquids, [[house dust]], [[Popcorn bag|microwave popcorn bags]], water, food, some cookware and PTFE products.

As a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with [[DuPont]], three [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that there was probably an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes: [[kidney cancer]], [[testicular cancer]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[thyroid disease]], [[hypercholesterolemia]] (high cholesterol), and [[Gestational hypertension|pregnancy-induced hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicole |first1=W. |title=PFOA and Cancer in a Highly Exposed Community: New Findings from the C8 Science Panel |doi=10.1289/ehp.121-A340 |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=121 |issue=11–12 |pages=A340 |year=2013 |pmid=24284021 |pmc=3855507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary manufacturer of [[PFOS]], the [[3M|3M Company]] (known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company from 1902 to 2002), began a production phase-out in 2002 in response to concerns expressed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="epa_PFOA" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Eight other companies agreed to gradually phase out the manufacturing of the chemical by 2015.&lt;ref name="epa_PFOA" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

In the fall of 2000, lawyer Rob Bilott, a partner at Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister, won a court order forcing DuPont to share all documentation related to PFOA. This included 110,000 files, consisting of confidential studies and reports conducted by DuPont scientists over decades. By 1993, DuPont understood that "PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals" and the company began to investigate alternatives. However, products manufactured with PFOA were such an integral part of DuPont's earnings, $1 billion in annual profit, they chose to continue using PFOA.&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html?_r=0 |title=The Lawyer Who Became DuPont’s Worst Nightmare |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2016 |author=Rich, Nathaniel |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billott learned that both "3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades", and by 1961 DuPont was aware of [[hepatomegaly]] in mice fed with PFOA.&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Gerald J. |last=Arneson |title=Toxicity of Teflon Dispersing Agents |publisher=DuPont, Polychemicals Department, Research &amp; Development Division, Experimental Station |date=November 1961 |url=http://www.defendingscience.org/case_studies/upload/1961-memo.pdf

Research on PFOA has demonstrated ubiquity, animal-based toxicity, and some associations with human health parameters and potential health effects. Additionally, advances in [[analytical chemistry]] in recent years have allowed the routine detection of low- and sub-[[parts per billion]] levels of PFOA in a variety of substances.&lt;ref name=Lau04 /&gt; In 2013, [[Gore-Tex]] eliminated the use of PFOAs in the manufacture of its weatherproof functional fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.gorefabrics.com/en_gb/enterprise/innovation/gore-completes-elimination-of-pfoa-from-raw-material-of-its-functional-fabrics/|title=GORE completes elimination of PFOA from raw material of its functional fabrics: GORE-TEX Products Newsroom |publisher=Gore Fabrics |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GenX]] has been introduced as a replacement for PFOA but it is doubtful whether it is less harmful.

== Synthesis ==
PFOA has two main synthesis routes, [[electrochemical fluorination]] (ECF) and [[telomerization]].&lt;ref name=Prevedouros2006 /&gt; The equation below represents the ECF route with [[hydrofluoric acid]] reacting with [[octanoic acid|octanoyl]] [[acyl chloride|chloride]], [[octanoyl chloride]].&lt;ref name=Savu&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/0471238961.0612211519012221.a01 |chapter=Fluorinated Higher Carboxylic Acids |title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |year=2000 |last1=Savu |first1=Patricia M |isbn=0-471-23896-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation above shows the multiple products of ECF. The target product, F(CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;[[Acyl halide|COF]] (not represented) is produced as only 10–15% of the total product, while the main products are [[fluorocarbon|perfluorinated]] cyclic [[ether]] [[isomer]]s, including [[FC-75]].&lt;ref name=Savu /&gt; To yield PFOA, the perfluorinated acid fluoride is hydrolyzed. The PFOA formed by this method is a mixture of straight chain (78%), terminally branched (13%), and internally branched (9%) molecules, as ECF rearranges the carbon "tail" of the acid chloride.&lt;ref name=Savu /&gt; ECF also results in production wastes.&lt;ref name=goeden&gt;{{cite conference |first=Helen |last=Goeden |date=June 2008 |title=Issues and Needs for PFAA Exposure and Health Research: A State Perspective |conference=PFAA Days II |conferenceurl=http://pfaadays-epa.com |others=Minnesota Department of Health |location=U.S. EPA – Research Triangle Park |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/hazardous/topics/pfcs/pfaapresent.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726102740/http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/hazardous/topics/pfcs/pfaapresent.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[3M]] synthesized ECF PFOA at their [[Cottage Grove, MN]] facility from 1947 to 2002 and was the world's largest producer.&lt;ref name=Prevedouros2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=goeden /&gt; ECF production continues on a smaller scale in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=Prevedouros2006 /&gt;

People who lived in the PFOA-contaminated area around DuPont's Washington Works facility were found to have higher levels of PFOA in their blood from drinking water. The highest PFOA levels in drinking water were found in the Little Hocking water system, with an average concentration of 3.55 [[parts per billion]] during 2002–2005.&lt;ref name=Emmett2006 /&gt; Individuals who drank more tap water, ate locally grown fruits and vegetables, or ate local meat, were all associated with having higher PFOA levels. Residents who used water [[Carbon filtering|carbon filter]] systems had lower PFOA levels.

== Regulatory status ==

=== Drinking water and products ===
In the United States there are no federal drinking water standards for PFOA or PFOS as of late 2017. EPA began requiring [[public water system]]s to monitor for PFOA and PFOS in 2012,&lt;ref name="EPA advisories"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos |title=Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-30 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published drinking water [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Health advisories|health advisories]], which are non-regulatory technical documents, in 2016. The lifetime health advisories and health effects support documents assist federal, state, tribal, and local officials and managers of drinking water systems in protecting public health when these chemicals are present in drinking water. The levels of PFOS and PFOA concentrations under which adverse health effects are not anticipated to occur over a lifetime of exposure are 0.07 ppb (70 ppt).&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2016-05-25). "Lifetime Health Advisories and Health Effects Support Documents for Perfluorooctanoic Acid and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|81|33250}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has not announced whether it will develop a [[Safe Drinking Water Act#National Primary Drinking Water Regulations|National Primary Drinking Water Regulation]] for these contaminants.&lt;ref name="EPA advisories"/&gt;

In November 2017 the [[State of New Jersey]] announced plans to develop its own drinking water standards for PFOA and [[PFNA]]. These standards—14 ppt for PFOA and 13 ppt for PFNA—would be the most stringent regulatory standards in the country.&lt;ref name="Record-110217"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=James M. |date=2017-11-02 |title=N.J. sets stringent standard on cancer-causing chemical PFOA in drinking water |url=http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2017/11/01/nj-sets-stringent-standard-cancer-causing-chemical-pfoa-drinking-water/822458001/ |work=The Record (Bergen County) |location=Woodland Park, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, scientists at Emory University compared health risks in workers at a DuPont chemical plant in West Virginia with high PFOA exposure to the risks of the same diseases in other regional DuPont factory workers and in the US population.

In 2002, a panel of toxicologists, including several from EPA, proposed a level of 150 ppb for [[drinking water]] in the PFOA contaminated area around DuPont's Washington Works plant. This level was much higher than any known environmental concentration.&lt;ref name=Renner2003 /&gt;

In July 2004, EPA filed a suit against DuPont alleging "widespread contamination" of PFOA near the Parkersburg, West Virginia plant "at levels exceeding the company's community exposure guidelines;" the suit also alleged that "DuPont had—over a 20 year period—repeatedly failed to submit information on adverse effects (in particular, information on liver enzyme alterations and birth defects in offspring of female Parkersburg workers)."&lt;ref name=Clapp /&gt;

In October 2005, a USFDA study was published revealing PFOA and PFOA precursor chemicals in food contact and [[PTFE]] products.&lt;ref name=Begley2005 /&gt;

On November 21, 2006, EPA ordered DuPont to offer alternative drinking water or treatment for public or private water users living near DuPont's Washington Works plant in West Virginia (and in Ohio), if the level of PFOA detected in drinking water is equal to or greater than 0.5 parts per billion. This measure sharply lowered the previous action level of 150 parts per billion that was established in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=EPA |title=Fact Sheet: EPA, DuPont Agree on Measures to Protect Drinking Water Near the DuPont Washington Works |author=Mid-Atlantic Enforcement |url=http://www.epa.gov/region03/enforcement/dupont_factsheet.html

According to a May 23, 2007, ''[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]'' Online article, [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] research regarding food contact papers as a potential source of PFOA to humans is ongoing.&lt;ref name=Renner2007 /&gt;

In November 2007, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) published data on PFOA concentrations comparing 1999–2000 vs. 2003–2004 [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey|NHANES]] samples.&lt;ref name=Calafat2007 /&gt;

On January 15, 2009, EPA set a provisional health advisory level of 0.4 ppb in drinking water.&lt;ref name=set /&gt;

On May 19, 2016, EPA lowered the drinking water health advisory level to 0.07 ppb for PFOA and PFOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== U.S. state government actions ===
In 2007, the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] (NJDEP) issued a preliminary health-based guidance level of 0.04 ppb in drinking water, due to PFOA being found at "elevated levels in the system's drinking water near DuPont's massive [[Carneys Point Township, New Jersey#Dupont Chambers Works|Chambers Works]] chemical plant".&lt;ref name=NJ&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Renner |first1=Rebecca |last2=Cooney |first2=Catherine M. |last3=Pelley |first3=Janet |last4=Chatterjee |first4=Rhitu |last5=Lubick |first5=Naomi |last6=Engelhaupt |first6=Erika |title=New Jersey dives into PFOA water guidance |journal=Environ.

In 2007, the [[Minnesota]] Department of Health lowered its Health Based Value for PFOA in drinking water from 1.0 ppb to 0.5 ppb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/pfc030107.html |title=Health officials issue new health guidelines for PFOA, PFOS |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2007-03-01 |website= |publisher=Minnesota Department of Health |id=News Release |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814205017/http://health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/pfc030107.html |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where "the sources are landfilled industrial wastes from a 3M manufacturing plant".&lt;ref name=NJ /&gt;

=== European action ===
PFOA contaminated waste was incorporated into soil improver and spread on agricultural land in Germany, leading to PFOA drinking water contamination of up to 0.519 [[parts per billion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title =Perfluorinated surfactants contaminate German waters—Mislabeled waste in fertilizer leads to a water scandal |journal =Environ.

In the Netherlands, after questions by members of Parliament, the minister of Environment ordered a study into the potential exposure to PFOA of people living in the vicinity of the DuPont factory in [[Dordrecht]]. The report was published in March 2016 and concluded that "prior to 2002 residents were exposed to levels of PFOA at which health effects could not be ruled out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rivm.nl/Documenten_en_publicaties/Wetenschappelijk/Rapporten/2016/maart/Risicoschatting_emissie_PFOA_voor_omwonenden_Locatie_DuPont_Chemours_Dordrecht_Nederland|title=Risicoschatting emissie PFOA voor omwonenden : Locatie: DuPont/Chemours, Dordrecht, Nederland|website=rivm.nl|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, the government commissioned several further studies, including blood tests and measurements in drinking water.

PFOA was identified as a PBT substance in the EU in 2013. It was then included in the candidate list of [[Substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]. In 2017, PFOA, its salts and PFOA-related substances were added to annex XVII (restriction) of the [[REACH Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2017:150:FULL Official Journal of the European Union, L 150], 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian action ===

On August 10, 2016, Australian [[Legal financing|litigation funder]] IMF Bentham announced an agreement to fund a class action led by the law firm [[Gadens]] against the Australian Department of Defence for economic losses to homeowners, fishers, and farmers resulting from the use of [[Firefighting foam|aqueous film forming foam]] (containing PFOA) at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/imf-announces-williamtown-pfos-pfoa-contamination-class-oliver-gayner |title=Press Release: Williamtown Contamination Class Action |last1=Gayner |first1=Oliver |date=2016-08-10 |website=LinkedIn |publisher=IMF Bentham |access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iron powder.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Iron powder]]
A '''powder''' is a dry, bulk [[solid]] composed of a large number of very fine particles that may flow freely when shaken or tilted. Powders are a special sub-class of [[granular material]]s, although the terms ''powder'' and ''granular'' are sometimes used to distinguish separate classes of material. In particular, ''powders'' refer to those granular materials that have the finer grain sizes, and that therefore have a greater tendency to form clumps when flowing. ''Granulars'' refers to the coarser granular materials that do not tend to form clumps except when wet.

== Types ==

Many manufactured goods come in powder form, such as [[flour]], [[sugar]], ground [[coffee]], [[powdered milk]], copy machine [[toner]], [[gunpowder]], [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] powders, and some [[pharmaceutical]]s.  In nature, [[dust]], fine [[sand]] and [[snow]], [[volcanic ash]], and the top layer of the lunar [[regolith]] are also examples.

Because of their importance to industry, medicine and earth science, powders have been studied in great detail by [[chemical engineer]]s, [[mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]], [[chemist]]s, [[physicist]]s, [[geologist]]s, and researchers in other disciplines.

==Mechanical properties==

Typically, a powder can be compacted or loosened into a vastly larger range of [[bulk density|bulk densities]] than can a coarser granular material. When deposited by sprinkling, a powder may be very light and fluffy. When vibrated or compressed it may become very dense and even lose its ability to flow. The bulk density of coarse sand, on the other hand, does not vary over an appreciable range.

The clumping behavior of a powder arises because of the molecular [[Van der Waals force]] that causes individual grains to cling to one another. This force is present not just in powders, but in sand and gravel, too. However, in such coarse granular materials the weight and the inertia of the individual grains are much larger than the very weak Van der Waals forces, and therefore the tiny clinging between grains does not have a dominant effect on the bulk behavior of the material. Only when the grains are very small and lightweight does the Van der Waals force become predominant, causing the material to clump like a powder. The cross-over size between flow conditions and stick conditions can be determined by simple experimentation&lt;ref&gt; Smalley, I.J. 1964. Flow-stick transition on powders. Nature 201, 173-174. doi:10.1038/201173a0&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many other powder behaviors are common to all granular materials. These include segregation, stratification, jamming and unjamming, [[fragile matter|fragility]], loss of [[kinetic energy]], [[friction]]al shearing, [[Soil compaction|compaction]] and [[Reynolds' dilatancy]].

==Powder transport==

Powders are transported in the atmosphere differently from a coarse granular material. For one thing, tiny particles have little inertia compared to the drag force of the gas that surrounds them, and so they tend to ''go with the flow'' instead of traveling in straight lines. For this reason, powders may be an inhalation hazard. Larger particles cannot weave through the body's defenses in the nose and sinus, but will strike and stick to the mucous membranes. The body then moves the mucous out of the body to expel the particles. The smaller particles on the other hand can travel all the way to the lungs from which they cannot be expelled. Serious and sometimes fatal diseases such as [[silicosis]] are a result from working with certain powders without adequate respiratory protection.

Also, if powder particles are sufficiently small, they may become [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the atmosphere for a very long time. Random motion of the air molecules and [[turbulence]] provide upward forces that may counteract the downward force of gravity. Coarse granulars, on the other hand, are so heavy that they fall immediately back to the ground. Once disturbed, dust may form huge [[dust storm]]s that cross continents and oceans before settling back to the surface. This explains why there is relatively little hazardous dust in the natural environment. Once aloft, the dust is very likely to stay aloft until it meets water in the form of rain or a body of water. Then it sticks and is washed downstream to settle as [[mud]] deposits in a quiet lake or sea. When geological changes later re-expose these deposits to the atmosphere, they may have already cemented together to become [[mudstone]], a type of rock. For comparison, the Moon has neither wind nor water, and so its [[regolith]] contains dust but no mudstone.

The cohesive forces between the particles tend to resist their becoming airborne, and the motion of wind across the surface is less likely to disturb a low-lying dust particle than a larger sand grain that protrudes higher into the wind. Mechanical agitation such as vehicle traffic, digging or passing herds of animals is more effective than a steady wind at stirring up a powder.

The aerodynamic properties of powders are often used to transport them in industrial applications. [[Pneumatics|Pneumatic]] conveying is the transport of powders or grains through a pipe by blowing gas. A gas fluidized bed is a container filled with a powder or granular substance that is ''fluffed up'' by blowing gas upwardly through it. This is used for [[fluidized bed combustion]], chemically reacting the gas with the powder.'

Some powders may be dustier than others. The tendency of a powder to generate particles in the air under a given energy input is called "[[dustiness]]". It is an important powder property which is relevant to powder aerosolization process. It also has indications for human exposure to aerosolized particles and associated health risks (via skin contacts or inhalation) at workplaces. Various dustiness testing methods have been established in research laboratories, in order to predict powder behaviors during aerosolization.&lt;ref&gt;Yaobo Ding, Burkhard Stahlmecke, Araceli Sánchez Jiménez, Ilse L.

DOI:10.1016/j.powtec.2013.05.040.&lt;/ref&gt; These methods (laboratory setups) allow application of a wide range of energy inputs to powdered materials, which simulates different real-life scenarios.

==Fire dangers of powders==
{{main|Dust explosion}}
Many common powders made in industry are combustible; particularly metals or organic materials such as [[flour]]. Since powders have a very high surface area, they can combust with explosive force once ignited. Facilities such as flour mills can be vulnerable to such explosions without proper dust mitigation efforts.

Some metals become especially dangerous in powdered form, notably [[titanium]].

==Comparison with other substances==

A [[paste (rheology)|paste]] or [[gel]] might become a powder after it has been thoroughly dried, but is not considered a powder when it is wet because it does not flow freely. Substances like dried [[clay]], although dry bulk solids composed of very fine particles, are not powders unless they are crushed because they have too much [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] between the grains, and therefore they do not flow freely like a powder. A [[liquid]] flows differently than a powder, because a liquid cannot resist any shear stress and therefore it cannot reside at a tilted angle without flowing (that is, it has zero ''[[angle of repose]].'') A powder on the other hand is a solid, not a liquid, because it may support [[shear stress]]es and therefore may display an angle of repose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">A '''saturation dome''' is a graphical representation of the combination of vapor and gas that is used in [[thermodynamics]]. It can be used to find either the [[pressure]] or the [[specific volume]] as long as one already has at least one of these [[properties]].

==Description==
A saturation dome uses the projection of a P–''v''–T diagram (pressure, specific volume, and temperature) onto the P–''v'' plane. This gives a P–''v'' diagram at a constant temperature. The points that create the left-hand side of the dome represent the saturated liquid states, while the points on the right-hand side represent the saturated vapor states (commonly referred to as the “dry” region). On the left-hand side of the dome there is compressed liquid and on the right-hand side there is superheated gas.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Sanford, and Gregory Nellis. 'Thermodynamics'. Cambridge University Press. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:PVT 3D diagram.png|thumb|PVT 3D diagram]]Within the dome itself, there is a liquid–vapor mixture. This two-phase region is commonly referred to as the “wet” region. The percentage of liquid and vapor can be calculated using vapor quality.&lt;ref&gt;Arora, C P. 'Thermodynamics'. McGraw Hill, 1998, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The triple state line is where the three phases (solid, liquid, and vapor) exist in equilibrium.

==Critical point==
The point at the very top of the dome is called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. This point is where the saturated liquid and saturated vapor lines meet. Past this point, it is impossible for a liquid–vapor transformation to occur.&lt;ref name="Wark"&gt;Wark, Kenneth. ''Thermodynamics''. McGraw-Hill, 1977, p. 110-116&lt;/ref&gt; It is also where the critical temperature and critical pressure meet. Beyond this point, it is also impossible to distinguish between the liquid and vapor phases.

==States==
A saturation state is the point where a phase change begins or ends. For example, the saturated liquid line represents the point where any further addition of energy will cause a small portion of the liquid to convert to vapor. Likewise, along the saturated vapor line, any removal of energy will cause some of the vapor to condense back into a liquid, producing a mixture. When a substance reaches the saturated liquid line it is commonly said to be at its boiling point. The temperature will remain constant while it is at constant pressure underneath the saturation dome (boiling water stays at a constant of 212F) until it reaches the saturated vapor line. This line is where the mixture has converted completely to vapor. Further heating of the saturated vapor will result in a superheated vapor state. This is because the vapor will be at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature (212F for water) for a given pressure.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;Moran, Michael J., and Howard N. Shapiro. Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics. 7th ed. Hoboken, N.J. : Chichester: Wiley ; John Wiley, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vapor quality==
[[Vapor quality]] refers to the vapor–liquid mixture that is contained underneath the
dome. This quality is defined as the fraction of the total mixture which is vapor, based on
mass.&lt;ref name="Wark" /&gt; A
fully saturated vapor has a quality of 100% while a saturated liquid has a quality of 0%.
Quality can be estimated graphically as it is related to the specific volume, or how far horizontally across the dome the point exists. At the saturated liquid state, the specific volume is denoted as ''v''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, while at the saturated vapor stage it is denoted as ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Quality can be calculated by the equation:

&lt;math&gt; x={v-v_f\over v_g-v_f}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rao, R V C. 'Engineering Thermodynamics'. Universities Press, 2005, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southport Gas Holder''' was once the tallest structure in the northern town of [[Southport]], England for 40 years.
The {{convert|84.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high structure could be seen from miles around, for example from [[Blackpool]] and [[Winter Hill (North West England)|Winter Hill]]. To some people of the local area it was an instantly recognisable symbol of home coming after being away for weeks.
It was built in 1969 in the [[Blowick]] area of [[Southport]] (1.7 miles from the town centre) – {{gbmapping|SD362167}}. It acted as a storage unit guaranteeing the town's gas supply. Similar structures were built across the country when town gas was generated from coal and before the construction of a high pressure gas grid.

==Decommission and destruction==
The largest tower was decommissioned in January 2008, due to an environmental risk posed by the storage of oil within it. Discussions soon came as it was decommissioned and just weeks later it was decided by [[National Grid plc]], that two out of the three gas holders (including the largest) would be completely demolished as soon as mid-2009. This sparked mixed reviews. Some people thought that the tower was a symbol of Southport, and should not be destroyed. Others however (mostly those who lived directly in the shadow of the tower) disagreed and could not wait to see the back of it. The tower caused problems for local residents such as poor TV reception.

On Tuesday 14 April, demolition men arrived to start dismantling the 1,100 tonne structure. The second largest crane in Britain came to dismantle the iconic structure and in less than seven weeks it was gone from the Southport skyline forever. The gas holder may be the largest structure the town will ever see.

==The future==
After the destruction of the tower there was a mixed reaction from the local residents, some felt they had lost an icon while others felt the tower was an eyesore, and the removal may even affect house prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Siddle |first=John |date=12 September 2008 |title=Blowick’s famous gasometer is to be demolished |url=http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/southport-news/southport-southport-news/2008/09/12/blowick-s-famous-gasometer-is-to-be-demolished-101022-21801684/ |newspaper=Southport Visiter |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future of the third holder is still uncertain due to costs of removal.
'Ground Zero', how some people like to call the site where the gas tower once was, has yet to be developed but it is said it will be either housing and/or for business use. Some people have suggested that there should be something to remember the gas tower, but this idea has not yet been agreed on.

The '''Stonehenge Free Festival''' was a British [[free festival]] from 1974 to 1984 held at the prehistoric monument [[Stonehenge]] in England during the month of June, and culminating with the [[summer solstice]] on or near June 21. It emerged as the major  free festival in the calendar after the violent suppression of the [[Windsor Free Festival]] in August 1974, with [[Wally Hope]] providing the impetus for its founding, and was itself violently suppressed in 1985 in the [[Battle of the Beanfield]], with no free festival held at Stonehenge since although people have been allowed to gather at the stones again for the solstice since 1999. 

By the 1980s, the festival had grown to be a major event, attracting up to 30,000 people in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/henge-menu.html History of the Stonehenge Free Festival :1972-1985.]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival attendees were viewed as [[hippie]]s by the wider British public {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. This, along with the open drug use and sale, contributed to the increase in restrictions on access to Stonehenge, and fences were erected around the stones in 1977. The same year, police resurrected a moribund law against driving over grassland in order to levy fines against festival goers in motorised transport. By 1984 police-festival relations were relaxed with only a nominal police presence required.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
==Bands==
The festival was a celebration of various alternative cultures. The Tibetan Ukrainian Mountain Troupe, The [[Tepee]] People, Circus Normal, the [[Peace Convoy]], [[New Age Travellers]] and [[the Wallys]] were notable [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] attendees.

The stage hosted many bands including [[Hawkwind]], [[Gong (band)|Gong]],  [[Doctor and the Medics]], [[Flux of Pink Indians]], [[Buster Blood Vessel]], [[Omega Tribe]], [[Crass]], [[The Selecter]], [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], [[Thompson Twins]], [[Bronz]], [[The Raincoats]], [[The 101ers]] with [[Joe Strummer]], [[Jeremy Spencer]] &amp; the Children of God, Brent Black Music Co-op, Killerhertz, [[Mournblade (band)|Mournblade]], [[Amazulu (band)|Amazulu]], [[Wishbone Ash]], [[Man (band)|Man]], [[Benjamin Zephaniah]], [[Inner City Unit]], [[Here &amp; Now (band)|Here and Now]], [[Cardiacs]], [[The Enid]], [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Ted Chippington]], [[Zorch]] and [[Ozric Tentacles]], Vince pie and the crumbs, which all played for free.

The 1981 list of bands included Red Ice, Selecter, Theatre of Hate, [[Sugar Minott]], Doll by Doll, Thompson Twins, Night Doctor, Merger, Androids of Mu, Deaf Aids, Killerhertz, The Raincoats, Thandoy, Foxes and Rats, ICU Lightning Raiders, Psycho Hampster, [[Misty in Roots]], Andy Allens Future, Inner Visions, Red Beat, Man to Man Triumphant, Stolen Pets, Seeds of Creation, sorcerer ,Coxone Sound System, [[Black Widow (band)|Black Widow]], Here and Now, Hawkwind, Steel and Skin, The Lines, Waiting for Arnold, Play Dead, Cauldron, Lighting by Shoe, Flux of Pink Indians, The Mob, Treatment, Popular History of Signs, The Wystic Mankers, Elsie Steer and Cosmic Dave.

In [[chemistry]], a '''trigonal pyramid''' is a [[molecular geometry]] with one [[atom]] at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] and three atoms at the corners of a [[trigonal]] base, resembling a [[tetrahedron]] (not to be confused with the [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral geometry]]). When all three atoms at the corners are identical, the molecule belongs to [[Molecular symmetry|point group]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;''. Some molecules and ions with trigonal pyramidal geometry are the [[pnictogen hydride]]s (XH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[xenon trioxide|xenon trioxide (XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]], the [[chlorate]] ion, {{chem|ClO|3|−}}, and the [[sulfite]] ion, {{chem|SO|3|2−}}. In [[organic chemistry]], molecules which have a trigonal pyramidal geometry are sometimes described as [[orbital hybridisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized]]. The [[AXE method]] for [[VSEPR theory]] states that the classification is AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
[[Image:Phosphine-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Phosphine]], an example of a molecule with a trigonal pyramidal geometry.]]

== Trigonal pyramidal geometry in ammonia ==

The [[nitrogen]] in [[ammonia]] has 5 [[valence electron]]s and bonds with three hydrogen atoms to complete the [[octet rule|octet]]. This would result in the geometry of a regular [[tetrahedron]] with each bond angle equal to [[inverse trigonometric function|cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−{{sfrac|1|3}})]]&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;109.5°. However, the three hydrogen atoms are repelled by the electron [[lone pair]] in a way that the geometry is distorted to a trigonal [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] (regular 3-sided pyramid) with bond angles of 107°. In contrast, [[boron trifluoride]] is flat, adopting a [[trigonal planar]] geometry because the [[boron]] does not have a lone pair of electrons. In ammonia the trigonal pyramid undergoes rapid [[nitrogen inversion]].&lt;ref name="Cleeton"&gt;{{cite journal|author1-link=Claud E. Cleeton|first1=C. E. |last1=Cleeton |author2-link=Neal H.

'''Tungsram''' is one of [[Hungary]]'s largest, oldest, and internationally most prestigious firms, known for light bulbs and electronics. Established in [[Újpest]] (today part of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]) in 1896, it initially produced telephones, wires and switchboards. The name "Tungsram" is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[tungsten]]" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|ŋ|s|t|ən}} and "wolfram" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|f|r|əm}} (the two common names of the metal used for making light bulb [[electrical filament|filaments]]).

==History==
On 13 December 1904, Hungarian [[Sándor Just]] and Croatian [[Franjo Hanaman]] were granted Hungarian patent no. 34541 for the world's first [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten filament bulb]] that lasted longer and produced brighter light than a carbon filament. The co-inventors licensed their patent to the company, which came to be named Tungsram after the eponymous tungsten incandescent bulbs, which are still called Tungsram bulbs in many European countries.{{CN|date=July 2018}} In 1934, Tungsram incorporated a patent by [[Imre Bródy]] for bulbs filled with [[krypton]] gas, providing for longer bulb lifetime. During [[World War I]] mass production of [[radio tube]]s began and became the most profitable division of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Károly Jeney |author2=Ferenc Gáspár |author3=English translator:Erwin Dunay |title=The History of Tungsram 1896-1945|page=11|publisher=Tungsram Rt.|year=1990|ISBN=978-3-939197-29-4|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/08800/08856/08856.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Tungsram Radio Works was a subsidiary of Hungarian Tungsram in pre-war days.

In 1990, [[General Electric]] acquired a majority stake in Tungsram and over six years invested $600 million in the venture, thoroughly restructuring every aspect of its operations. To date, this has been the largest manufacturing investment by a U.S. firm in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/janfeb97/art9.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsram is today a subsidiary of General Electric and the name is merely retained as a [[brand]].

As of February 2018, the CEO of [[General Electric|GE Hungary]], Jörg Bauer agreed to buy GEʼs lighting business in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Turkey, as well as its global automotive lighting business. The business continues to operate again under the name ''Tungsram Group''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bbj.hu/business/company-of-former-ge-hungary-head-to-buy-ge-lighting-emea-_145482 Company of former GE Hungary head to buy GE Lighting EMEA - Budapest Business Journal - February 15, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uranium tetrafluoride''' ('''UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a green crystalline solid compound of [[uranium]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; with an insignificant [[vapor pressure]] and very slight [[solubility]] in water. Uranium in its tetravalent ([[uranous]]) state is very important in different technological processes. In the uranium refining industry it is known as '''green salt'''.

UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is generally an intermediate in the conversion of [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) to either [[uranium oxide]]s (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; or UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or uranium metal. It is formed by the reaction of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with hydrogen gas in a vertical tube-type reactor or by the action of [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF) on [[uranium dioxide]]. UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is less stable than the uranium oxides and reacts slowly with moisture at ambient temperature, forming UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HF, the latter of which is very corrosive; it is thus a less favorable form for long-term disposal. The bulk density of UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; varies from about 2.0 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to about 4.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the production process and the properties of the starting uranium compounds.

A [[molten salt reactor]] design, a type of [[nuclear reactor]] where the working fluid is a molten salt, would use UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the core material. UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is generally chosen over other salts because of the usefulness of the elements without [[isotope separation]], better neutron economy and moderating efficiency, lower [[vapor pressure]] and better chemical stability.

Like all uranium salts UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic and thus harmful by inhalation, ingestion and through skin contact.

The '''Winter Hill air disaster''' occurred on 27 February 1958 when the [[Silver City Airways]] [[Bristol 170 Freighter]] ''G-AICS'', traveling from the [[Isle of Man]] to [[Manchester, England|Manchester]], England, crashed into [[Winter Hill (North West England)|Winter Hill]] (also known as Rivington Moor) several hundred yards away from the [[Independent Television Authority]]'s [[Winter Hill transmitting station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19580227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-five people died and seven were injured.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrictaircrashes.co.uk/pages/pennines/penninesg-aics.htm |title=Bristol 170 Freighter Mk.21E G-AICS |author=Alan Clark |work=Crash Sites in the Pennines |publisher=Peak District Air Accident Research |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICAO report&lt;ref&gt;ICAO Accident Digest, Circular 59-AN/54 (83–92)&lt;/ref&gt; states that the accident occurred at 09.15 in the morning. At this time, the weather was so severe that none of the engineers working in the ITA transmitting station were aware of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/news/5803054.Survivors_relive_Winter_Hill_crash_horror Survivors relive Winter Hill crash horror] Retrieved on 31st January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Several feet of snow hampered rescue efforts, and a [[snowcat|snow cat]] vehicle had to be diverted from the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] to cut a path for emergency vehicles though the track had been cleared by people using spades by the time it arrived.

==Background==
The flight was essentially a charter flight from Ronaldsway Airport in the [[Isle of Man]] to Manchester Ringway Airport for a group of mainly Motor Traders to visit the Manchester Exide Battery Factory and Manchester car show.&lt;ref name="Steve Poole 1999"&gt;Steve Poole ''Rough Landing or Fatal Flight. A history of aircraft accidents on, or over and around the Isle of Man'' (1999) (1st Edition) Manx Heritage Foundation Amulree Publications {{ISBN|1-901508-03-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
[[File:Winter Hill Air Disaster Memorial Plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial Plaque at the crash site]] The Silver City Airways [[Bristol 170 Freighter]] ''G-AICS'', call sign "Charlie Sierra", was due to fly from [[Ronaldsway Airport]], [[Ballasalla]], on the Isle of Man to an aircraft reporting point at Squire's Gate about {{convert|3|mi|km}} from Blackpool. The aircraft was flown by Captain Cairnes at an altitude of {{convert|1500|ft|m}} due to low cloud and other air traffic in the Manchester area. After gaining clearance from air-traffic control at Manchester Ringway Airport, Captain Cairnes flew "Charlie Sierra" inland to Wigan Beacon, a non-directional beacon in the Manchester Zone, which transmitted a recognition signal of "MYK" in morse code on a frequency of 316&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] and a range of about {{convert|25|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="Steve Poole 1999" /&gt; Due to a number of navigation errors in respect to the radio compass bearings and altitude readings, the Silver City Bristol Freighter crashed near the summit of Winter Hill, five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) south-east of Chorley, Lancashire at 9:45&amp;nbsp;am on 27 February 1958.

==Passengers and Crew==
Thirty-five of the passengers were killed, the majority connected with the Isle of Man motor trade. The three crew were among the seven that survived with injuries.

==Investigation==
The error of the first officer in tuning the radio compass on Oldham Beacon instead of on Wigan Beacon was the probable cause.{{fact|date=February 2018}}
