      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4716">'''Antilocution''' is a form of [[prejudice]] in which [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] [[Speech|verbal]] remarks against a [[person]], group, or community, are made in a [[public]] or private setting and not addressed directly to the target. American psychologist [[Gordon Allport]] first used this term in his 1954 book, ''The Nature of Prejudice''''',''' to label the first of the five degrees of [[antipathy]] that measure manifestation of prejudice in a society as antilocution (see also: "[[Allport's Scale]]"). Antilocution is similar to the rather common form of [[betrayal]] in which a person "talks behind someone's back.", but antilocution involves an in-group [[ostracism|ostracizing]] an out-group on a [[bias]]ed basis.

The use of the term antilocution is overshadowed by the term [[hate speech]], which holds a similar meaning but places no regard on the fact that the out-group is unaware of the [[discrimination]].

==Etymology==

The term antilocution first appeared in 1954 in "The Nature of Prejudice", a book written by an American psychologist "Gordon Allport". Antilocution is the first stage of Allport's scale, a scale to measure the degree of bias or prejudice in one's [[society]]. Following antilocution, the greater stages of prejudice are [[Avoidance coping|avoidance]], [[discrimination]], [[physical abuse|physical attack]], and [[Genocide|extermination]] respectively. Antilocution is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] noun which consists of the word locution and the word anti, to express a counterproductive way to employ locution.

==Description==
Antilocution is considered the least aggressive form of prejudice and represented by [[conversations]] of individuals in a society sharing similar opinions, which often are biased and result in negative reputation of the target of antilocution. Although this form of prejudice maybe the least aggressive, it nevertheless can be very destructive and life-changing for the subject. Those who employ antilocution may not be aware or consider themselves as involved in any discriminatory act.  Antilocution is perhaps the most common form of discriminative act, and is more commonly referred as minor [[gossips]] or [[scandals]]. The subject may feel the need to join in with the flow or comedize it if the antilocution is employed by the [[majority]]. This can either create a place for the subject in the pack or lead to a spread of biased [[information]] through the society and can lead to negative modification in [[behaviors]] toward the subject, thus will significantly put the subject in a [[disadvantaged]] way both socially and mentally.

==Causes, employment, and danger==
Individuals often engage in prejudicial conversation when they feel threatened and frequently is based on misperceptions and stereotyping of the subject. Antilocution often related to the fact that the subject is viewed as an anomaly to the group, for example the subject maybe a newcoming member thus no one actually know the subject so they judge the subject based on their perceptions and stereotyping, often involve [[racism]], [[ethnic]], or [[gender]]. Most individuals engaged in this type of behavior will most likely deny that their behavior is prejudicial in any way, and often indicate this as a matter of expressing their own [[opinions]]. This kind of treatment to antilocution is very dangerous in its own as it leads to a widespread in discriminative acts toward the subject as individuals feel little to no [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in doing so. Facts are often needed to [[contradict]] [[misinformation]] and create a positive [[Social influence|influence]] in the society toward the subject, or else opinions will continue to multiply and lead to further misconceptions, which can eventually lead to more serious forms of prejudice and discrimination and will harm the subject socially, mentally, and even physically if the problem worsen to a certain degree.

It serves graphic design professionals, managers, educators and students. Created in 1996 by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] (Bill Pr56),&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario:1523 ROYAL ASSENT / SANCTION ROYALE|author=[http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardeissue/36-1/l064.htm  '''Bill Pr56, An Act respecting the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario]|date=25 April 1996|journal=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Association is Canada's only accredited body of graphic designers with a legislated title&lt;ref name=RGD-founders/&gt; and the second such accredited body of graphic designers in the world. RGD certifies graphic designers and promotes knowledge sharing, continuous learning, research, advocacy and mentorship.

==Advocacy==
RGD works to establish professional standards and innovative thinking within the graphic design industry. The association assumes an advocacy role for best practices for both graphic designers and the clients they work with. They focus on issues such as spec work and crowdsourcing, accessibility, sustainability, salaries and billing practices, pro bono work and internship guidelines.

RGD advocacy initiatives include:
* Supporting, defending and maintaining policies
* Promoting measures that broadly benefit members and the industry
* Increasing public awareness and disseminating information about industry best practices and the value of working with a Registered Graphic Designer (RGD)
* Arguing in favour of a new idea
* Speaking out on issues of concern
* Mediating, coordinating, clarifying and advancing a particular point of view
* Intervening with others on behalf of the profession

==History==
In 1956, Toronto-based designers Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld and Sam Smart formed the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).&lt;ref name=RGD-founders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |title=Founders |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702230050/http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |archive-date=2014-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TDC was later renamed the [[Society of Graphic Designers of Canada]] (GDC) to reflect the wider interests of its members.

By 1984 many other design disciplines such as Architecture and Interior Design had been given Acts in Provincial Legislatures so that their respective associations could govern and grant their members exclusive professional designations. RGD's founders recognized the need to align Graphic Design with other design professionals. To ensure Graphic Design could also advance as an acknowledged profession the Association's founders decided to incorporate the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD).

On April 25, 1996 Bill Pr56&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"/&gt; was passed and Royal Assent was given to an Act Respecting The Association of Registered Graphic Designers by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Sponsored by Mrs. [[Margaret Marland]], Member of Provincial Parliament and signed by the Honourable [[Hal Jackman]] C.M., O.Ont., O.ST.J., B.A., L.L.B., L.L.D., Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario.

In 1999 a separate Examination Board was established to administer the Registered Graphic Designers Qualification Examination, now referred to as the [http://www.rgd.ca/rgd-certification.php Certification Process for RGD].

The '''Australian Science and Mathematics School''' ('''ASMS''') is a [[coeducational]] public senior [[high school]] for Years 10 - 12 located on the campus of [[Flinders University]] in [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]], a southern suburb of [[Adelaide]], the capital of [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.asms.sa.edu.au/&lt;/ref&gt; As the school is unzoned, it attracts students from all across the Adelaide metropolitan area as well as some regional locations, in addition to international students. The goal of the school is to prepare its students for [[university]], particularly in the fields of [[mathematics]] and [[science]]. The ASMS is unconventional in its approach to education, emphasising a love of learning in both students and teaching staff; students are given the freedom to take control of their own education. ASMS aims to make students aware of their own learning and for them to become self-directed in the way they complete academic tasks.

==Overview==

The Australian Science and Mathematics School was opened in 2004 and is one of only two in [[Australia]]. As the school is designed to provide an adult environment for senior school students, there is no [[school uniform]] policy, which promotes a variety of culture and social styles and structures. A key feature of the ASMS is the productive relationship between the school and the Flinders University, on which the campus is located; the ASMS shares many resources with the university, including the library, cafeteria, student services, transport, recreational areas and car parks, in addition to booked access to lecture theatres and specialist science and support facilities. Furthermore, students at the ASMS in collaboration with Flinders University's [[Science and Technology Enterprise Partnership]] (STEP) may be involved in research projects in the business, industry and university sectors.

==Curriculum==
The ASMS is a specialist science and mathematics school, however it offers a comprehensive curriculum which covers all learning areas necessary for students to achieve their [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE) qualification. 
The Year 10/11 curriculum is organised into interdisciplinary Central Studies; these alternate every year to ensure that a student will not do the same subjects twice. The Year 12 curriculum consists of standard SACE Stage 2 subjects, such as the various Mathematics, Science, English and Humanities subjects.

==Adventure Space==
The ASMS also provides special activities for Year 10 and 11 students in the form of Adventure Space. Examples of these include Dance, Cryptography, Robotics, Aviation, Australian Space Design Competition, Paramedical Pathways, Electronics, Creative Writing, and Palaeontology. While not assessed, they do provide an opportunity to interact with university life, as well as an opportunity to take part in learning focused productive extra-curricular activities.

In [[economics]], the '''average propensity to save (APS)''', also known as the '''savings ratio''', is the proportion of [[income]] which is saved, usually expressed for household savings as a fraction of total household [[disposable income]]. The ratio differs considerably over time and between countries. The savings ratio for an entire economy can be affected by (for example) the proportion of older people (as they have less motivation and capability to save), and the rate of [[inflation]] (as expectations of rising prices can encourage people to spend now rather than later).

The complement (1 minus the APS) is the [[average propensity to consume]] (APC).

In [[complex analysis]], a field within [[mathematics]], '''Bloch's theorem''' gives a lower bound on the size of a disc in which an inverse to a [[holomorphic function]] exists. It is named after [[André Bloch (mathematician)|André Bloch]].

==Statement==
Let ''f'' be a [[holomorphic function]] in the [[unit disk]] |''z''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1. Suppose that |''f′''(0)| = 1. Then there exists a disc of radius ''b'' and an analytic function φ in this disc, such that ''f''(φ(''z'')) = ''z'' for all ''z'' in this disc. Here ''b'' &gt; 1/72 is an absolute constant.

==Landau's theorem==
If ''f'' is a holomorphic function in the unit disc with the property |''f′''(0)| = 1, then the image of ''f'' contains a disc of radius ''l'', where ''l'' ≥ ''b'' is an absolute constant.

This theorem is named after [[Edmund Landau]].

==Valiron's theorem==
Bloch's theorem was inspired by the following theorem of [[Georges Valiron]]:

'''Theorem.''' If ''f'' is a non-constant entire function then there exist discs ''D'' of arbitrarily large radius and analytic functions φ in ''D'' such that ''f''(φ(''z''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z'' for ''z'' in ''D''.

Bloch's theorem corresponds to Valiron's theorem via the so-called [[Bloch's Principle]].

== Bloch's and Landau's constants ==
The lower bound 1/72 in Bloch's theorem is not the best possible.  The number ''B'' defined as the [[supremum]] of all ''b'' for which this theorem holds, is called the '''Bloch's constant'''.  Bloch's theorem tells us ''B''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1/72, but the exact value of ''B'' is still unknown.

The similarly defined optimal constant ''L'' in Landau's theorem is called the '''Landau's constant'''. Its exact value is also unknown.

The best known bounds for ''B'' at present are
:&lt;math&gt;0.4332\approx\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}+2\times10^{-4}\leq B\leq \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\Gamma(\frac{11}{12})}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}\approx 0.4719,&lt;/math&gt;
where Γ is the [[Gamma function]].  The lower bound was proved by Chen and Gauthier, and the upper bound dates back to [[Lars Ahlfors|Ahlfors]] and Grunsky. They also gave an upper bound for the Landau constant.

In their paper, Ahlfors and Grunsky conjectured that their upper bounds are actually the true values of ''B'' and ''L''.

The '''Chromic acid cell''' was a type of [[primary cell]] which used [[chromic acid]] as a [[depolarizer]].  The chromic acid was usually made by acidifying (with [[sulfuric acid]]) a solution of [[potassium dichromate]].  The old name for potassium dichromate was potassium bichromate and the cell was often called a '''Bichromate cell'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayrton, W.E. and Mather, T. ''Practical Electricity'', Cassell and Company, London, 1911, pp 185-187&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of cell is now only of historical interest.

== History ==

{{main|History of the battery}}

==Construction==

The main elements of the cell were:

* [[Anode]], [[zinc]]
* Electrolyte, dilute sulfuric acid
* Depolarizer, chromic acid
* [[Cathode]], [[carbon]]

The cell was made in two forms - the single-fluid type, attributed to [[Johann Christian Poggendorff|Poggendorff]] and the two-fluid type, attributed to '''Fuller'''.  In both cases, cell [[voltage]] was about 2 [[volt]]s.

===Poggendorff cell===

The cell was set up in a long-necked glass bottle with a zinc plate located between two carbon plates.  The electrolyte and depolarizer were mixed.  The mixture would dissolve the zinc plate even when the cell was not in use, so there was a mechanism for lifting the zinc plate out of the liquid and storing it in the neck of the bottle.

===Fuller cell===

The cell was set up in a glass, or [[Ceramic glaze|glazed earthenware]], pot.  This contained the chromic acid solution, the carbon plate and a porous pot.  Inside the porous pot was dilute sulfuric acid, the zinc rod, and a small quantity of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].  The mercury formed an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] with the zinc and this reduced "local action", i.e. unwanted dissolution of the zinc when the cell was not in use.

'''Dromore''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]], located within the outflow channel [[Maja Valles]] in the [[Lunae Palus quadrangle]] at 20.1 N and 49.7 W. It measures 14.8 kilometers in diameter and was named after a town in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{gpn|1641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dromore is famous for showing clear evidence that it was affected by floods of water which broke through dams, carved deep valleys, and eroded grooves into bedrock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2094">'''Duality of structure''' is one of [[Anthony Giddens]]' coined phrases and main propositions in his explanation of [[structuration theory]].  The basis of the duality lies in the relationship the [[human agency|Agency]] has with the [[Structure]].  In the duality, the Agency has much more influence on its lived environment than past structuralist theory had granted.  The key to Giddens' explanation is his focus on the knowledgeability of the agent and the fact that the agency cannot exist or be analyzed separately from its structure.  They can only exist as a duality. The structural properties which he calls [[modalities (sociology)|modalities]] help illustrate the dimensions of the duality. 

"By the duality of structure I mean that the structural properties of social systems are both the medium and the outcome of the practices that constitute those systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=Central Problems in Social Theory|date=1979|publisher=The Macmillan Press Ltd|location=London and Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-333-27293-0|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Structure has both [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and resources or constraints and enabling qualities. Language is often used to exemplify these modalities. The [[system of interaction]] includes in itself "rules" of the language such as syntax but also leaves room for interpretations or the creation of completely new words.  The system of interaction is responsible for maintaining a certain standard of consistency in order for the language to make sense to both the speaker and the interpreter.  At the same time, the completeness of the language can always be manipulated and changed through interaction by the agent.

The phrase is used in [[Chomsky]] by John Lyons to illustrate the differences between human and animal communication. It is described there as "two levels of grammatical structure." The first being [[syntactic]] and the second being [[phonemes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">'''Electron equivalent''' is a concept commonly used in [[redox chemistry]], reactions involving [[electron transfer]], to define a quantity (e.g. energy or moles) relative to one electron. [[Gibbs free energy|Energies of formation]] are often given as kilojoules per electron equivalent to enable calculation of specific reaction energies on a "per electron" basis.  Reactions containing movement of electrons are often balanced such that reaction quantities are given in relation to the transfer of a single electron, allowing quantification of reactants and products in relation to a single electron transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">'''Functional contextualism''' is a modern [[philosophy of science]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Needs a citation from a Philosophy of Science s source.}} rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general and the field of [[behavior analysis]] and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001). ''Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Strosahl, K. &amp; Wilson, K.G. (1999). ''Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An experiential approach to behavior change''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

==Contextualism==
The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher [[Stephen C. Pepper]] in his book ''[[World Hypotheses]]: A Study in Evidence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, S.C. (1942). ''World hypotheses: A study in evidence''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct "world hypotheses" or "[[world view]]s". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and [[Truth#Substantive theories|truth criterion]]. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well-understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its [[ontological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its [[epistemological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed).

The root metaphor of contextualism is the "act in context", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed "successful working", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical [[pragmatism]] developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others.

===Varieties of contextualism===
Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism—its root metaphor and truth criterion—both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of "successful working" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because "success" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1953). ''Essays in experimental logic''. New York: Dover (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the root metaphor of the "act-in-context" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, E.V. &amp; Hayes, S.C. (1999). Functional contextualism: A pragmatic philosophy for behavioral science. In W. O'Donohue &amp; R. Kitchener (Eds.), ''Handbook of behaviorism'' (pp. 285–327). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed "true" or "useful". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge.

Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C. (1993). Analytic goals and the varieties of scientific contextualism. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 11–27). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: "descriptive contextualism" and "functional contextualism".

====Descriptive contextualism====
Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of [[history]], in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, E.K. (1993). Contextualism, historiography, and the history of behavior analysis. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 137-165). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a [[historical narrative]], it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including [[social constructionism]], [[dramaturgy]], [[hermeneutics]], and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism.

====Functional contextualism====
Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of [[science]] or [[engineering]], in which general rules and principles are used to predict and influence events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E. J. (2006). Constructing a pragmatic science of learning and instruction with functional contextualism. ''Educational Technology Research &amp; Development, 54'' (1), 5-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place.

'''Johannes Heinrich Justus Carl Ernst Brauns''' (21 March 1857 – 3 February 1929), more known as '''Hans Brauns''', was a German [[physician]] and [[entomologist]].

Born in [[Vlotho]], [[Germany]], Brauns qualified as Doctor of Medicine in 1894 at the [[University of Leipzig]]. He moved to [[South Africa]] in 1895, where he practiced medicine and collected insects whenever possible. Most of his entomological research focused on insects of the order [[Hymenoptera]].&lt;ref name="Schonland1934"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schonland | first1 = B. F.

'''Hans Henrik Reusch''' (5 September 1852 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1922) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[geologist]], [[geomorphologist]] and educator. He served as director of the [[Geological Survey of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Hans_Henrik_Reusch |title =    Hans Henrik Reusch |publisher =    Store norske leksikon|author= Haakon Fossen|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Born in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], he was educated at the [[University of Leipzig]] and [[Heidelberg University]]. He  graduated [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Oslo|University of Christiania]] (now University of Oslo) in 1883. He was married to the painter [[Helga Marie Ring Reusch]] He joined the [[Geological Survey of Norway]] in 1875, and was its Director from 1888 to 1921. He was a Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology at [[Harvard University]] (1897–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1897/10/6/courses-under-dr-reusch-dr-hans/|title=Courses Under Dr. Reusch |publisher=The Harvard Crimson|date=October 6, 1897|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2012NE/finalprogram/abstract_200085.htm|title=Sturgis Hooper Professors of Geology at Harvard University |publisher=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, Vol. 44, No. 2, p. 43|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is distinguished for his research on the [[crystal]]line [[schist]]s and the [[Palaeozoic]] rocks of Norway. He discovered [[Silurian]] [[fossil]]s in the highly altered rocks of the Bergen region; and in 1891 he called attention to the so-called "[[Reusch's Moraine]]" a [[Precambrian]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] of [[Glacier|glacial]] origin in the [[Varanger Fjord]], a view confirmed by  A. Strahan in 1896, who found glacial striations on the rocks beneath the ancient boulder-bed. Reusch has likewise thrown light on the later geological periods, on the [[Pleistocene]] glacial phenomena and on the sculpturing of the scenery of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nb.no/nmff/fotograf.php?fotograf_id=2354|title=Hans Henrik Reuch|work=Preus museum|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 Reusch founded a popular science magazine, ''[[Naturen]]''.&lt;ref name="the"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas F. Glick|author2=Elinor Shaffer|title=The Literary and Cultural Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VW97AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=22 May 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-78093-712-0|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited it for the first four years.&lt;ref name=the/&gt; Among his separate publications were ''Silurfossiler og pressede Konglomerater'' (1882) and ''Det nordlige Norges Geologi'' (1891). He chaired the [[Norwegian Geographical Society]] from 1898 to 1903, and from 1907 to 1909. In 1900 he was among the founders of the Norwegian association of book artwork (''Foreningen for norsk bokkunst'').  In 1907, his honorary doctorate was awarded at [[Oxford University]]. In 1922, he served as the first chairman of the Norwegian Association of Bibliophiles (''Bibliofiklubben'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nbl.snl.no/.search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Hans+Henrik+Reusch|title=Hans Henrik Reusch|publisher=Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Inge Bryhni|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/bokkunst/historikk|title=bokkunst – historikk |publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=Katrine Kalleklev|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''Hippocratic Oath for scientists''' is an oath similar to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for medical professionals, adapted for scientists. Multiple varieties of such an oath have been proposed. [[Joseph Rotblat]] has suggested that an oath would help make new scientists aware of their social and moral responsibilities;&lt;ref name=oath/&gt; opponents, however, have pointed to the "very serious risks for the scientific community" posed by an oath, particularly the possibility that it might be used to shut down certain avenues of research, such as [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;

==Development==
The idea of an oath has been proposed by various prominent members of the scientific community, including [[Karl Popper]], [[Joseph Rotblat]] and [[John Sulston]]. Research by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) identified sixteen different oaths for scientists or engineers proposed during the 20th century, most after 1970.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/page/should-there-be-oath-scientists-and-engineers|title=Should there be an Oath for Scientists and Engineers?|publisher=AAAS|date=April 2001|author=Margot Iverson|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper, Rotblat and Sulston were all primarily concerned with the ethical implications of scientific advances, in particular for Popper and Rotblat the development of the [[atomic bomb]], and believed that scientist, like medics, should have an oath that compelled them to "[[Primum non nocere|first do no harm]]". Popper said: "Formerly the pure scientist or the pure scholar had only one responsibility beyond those which everybody has; that is, to search for the truth. … This happy situation belongs to the past."&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt; Rotblat similarly stated: "Scientists can no longer claim that their work has nothing to do with the welfare of the individual or with state policies." He also attacked the attitude that the only obligation of a scientist is to make their results known, the use made of these results being the public's business, saying: "This amoral attitude is in my opinion actually immoral, because it eschews personal responsibility for the likely consequences of one's actions."&lt;ref name=oath/&gt; Sulston was more concerned with rising public distrust of scientists and conflicts of interest brought about by the exploitation of research for profit. The started intention of his oath was "both to require qualified scientists to cause no harm and to be wholly truthful in their public pronouncements, and also to protect them from discrimination by employers who might prefer them to be economical with the truth."&lt;ref name=Sulston/&gt;

The concept of an oath, rather than a more detailed [[code of conduct]], has been opposed by Ray Spier, Professor of Science and Engineering Ethics at the [[University of Surrey]], UK, who stated that "Oaths are not the way ahead".&lt;ref name=Sulston&gt;{{cite news | title = An oath for scientists?| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1250331.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 2001 | accessdate = 2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objections raised at a AAAS meeting on the topic in 2000 included that an oath would simply make scientists look good without changing behaviour, that an oath could be used to suppress research, that some scientists would refuse to swear any oath as a matter of principle, that an oath would be ineffective,  that creation of knowledge is separate from how it is used, and that the scientific community could never agree on the content of an oath. The meeting concluded that: "There was a broadly shared consensus that a tolerant (but not patronizing) attitude should be taken towards those developing oaths, but that an oath posed very serious risks for the scientific community which could not be ignored."&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt; Nobel laureate [[Jean-Marie Lehn]] has said "The first aim of scientific research is to increase knowledge for understanding. Knowledge is then available to mankind for use, namely to progress as well as to help prevent disease and suffering. Any knowledge can be misused. I do not see the need for an oath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindau-nobel.org/do-scientists-need-an-equivalent-of-the-hippocratic-oath-to-ensure-ethical-conduct/|title=Do scientists need an equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath to ensure ethical conduct?|author=Lou Woodley|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Lindsay Nobel Laureate Meetings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the propositions are outlined below.

=== Karl Popper ===
In 1968, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] gave a talk on "The Moral Responsibility of the Scientist" at the International Congress on Philosophy in Vienna, in which he suggested "an undertaking analogous to the Hippocratic oath". In his analysis he noted that the original oath had three sections: the apprentice's obligation to their teacher; the obligation to carry on the high tradition of their art, preserve its high standards, and pass these standards on to their own students; and the obligation to help the suffering and preserve their confidentiality. He also noted that it was an apprentice's oath, as distinct from a graduation oath. Based on this, he proposed a three-section oath for students, rearranged from the Hippocratic oath to give ''professional responsibility'' to further the growth of knowledge; ''the student'', who owes respect to others engaged in science and loyalty to teachers; and ''the overriding loyalty'' owed to humanity as a whole.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Popper|first1=Karl|title=The Moral Responsibility of the Scientist|date=March 1969|pages=52–56|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1969mar-00052?View=Overview|journal=[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Rotblat ===

The idea of a Hippocratic Oath for scientists was  raised again by [[Joseph Rotblat]] in his acceptance speech for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=The time has come to formulate guidelines for the ethical conduct of scientist, perhaps in the form of a voluntary Hippocratic Oath|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1995/rotblat-lecture.html|title=Nobel Prize lecture: Remember Your Humanity|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|date=1995|author=Joseph Rotblat|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later expanded on the idea, endorsing the formulation of the Student Pugwash Group:&lt;ref name="oath"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rotblat | first1 = Joseph| authorlink1 =Joseph Rotblat| title = A Hippocratic Oath for Scientists | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5444.1475 | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = 5444 | pages = 1475 | year = 1999 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/286/5444/1475| pmid =  10610545| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I promise to work for a better world, where science and technology are used in socially responsible ways. I will not use my education for any purpose intended to harm human beings or the environment. Throughout my career, I will consider the ethical implications of my work before I take action. While the demands placed upon me may be great, I sign this declaration because I recognize that individual responsibility is the first step on the path to peace.}}

=== John Sulston ===
In 2001, in the scientific journal ''[[Biochemical Journal]]'', Nobel laureate [[John Sulston]] proposed that "For individual scientists, it may be helpful to have a clear professional code of conduct – a Hippocratic oath as it were". This path would enable scientists to declare their intention "to cause no harm and to be wholly truthful in their public pronouncements", and would also serve to protect them from unethical employers. The concept of an oath was opposed by Ray Spiers of the [[University of Surrey]], an expert on scientific ethics who was preparing a 20-point code of conduct at the time.&lt;ref name=Sulston/&gt;

=== David King ===
In 2007, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, [[David King (scientist)|David King]], presented a "Universal Ethical Code for Scientists" at the [[British Association]]'s Festival of Science in York. Despite being a code rather than an oath, this was widely reported as a Hippocratic oath for scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = ‘Hippocratic oath for scientists’| url = http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2007/09/hippocratic_oath_for_scientist.html | work = [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]] |date=12 September 2007 | author=Daniel Cressey|accessdate = 2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6990868.stm|quote=Described as the scientific equivalent of doctors' Hippocratic Oath, the code includes clauses on corruption, public consultation and the environment.|title=UK science head backs ethics code|author=[[Pallab Ghosh]]|date=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 September 2007|title='Hippocratic Oath' for scientists proposed|author1=Roger Highfield| author2= Nic Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the earlier oaths, King's code was not only intended to meet the public demand that "scientific developments are ethical and serve the wider public good" but also to address public confidence in the integrity of science, which had been shaken by the disgrace of cloning pioneer [[Hwang Woo-suk]] and by other research-fraud scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=David King|date=20 March 2007|title=Rigour, respect and responsibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Work on the code started in 2005, following a meeting of [[G8]] science ministers and advisors. It was supported by the [[Royal Society]] in its response to a public consultation on the draft code in 2006, where they said it would help whistleblowers and the promotion of science in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/05/highereducation.uk|date=5 January 2006|title=Ethics code seeks to regulate science
|author=Donald MacLeod|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code has seven principles, divided into three sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-ethical-code-for-scientists|title=Rigour, respect, responsibility: a universal ethical code for scientists|publisher=[[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]]|date=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Rigour'''
* Act with skill and care in all scientific work. Maintain up to date skills and assist their development in others.
* Take steps to prevent corrupt practices and professional misconduct. Declare conflicts of interest.
* Be alert to the ways in which research derives from and affects the work of other people, and respect the rights and reputations of others.
'''Respect'''
* Ensure that your work is lawful and justified.
* Minimize and justify any adverse effect your work may have on people, animals and the natural environment.
'''Responsibility'''
* Seek to discuss the issues that science raises for society. Listen to the aspirations and concerns of others.
* Do not knowingly mislead, or allow others to be misled, about scientific matters. Present and review scientific evidence, theory or interpretation honestly and accurately.}}

'''''Indirana gundia''''' is a species of [[frog]] found in the [[Western Ghats]] of [[India]]. It is only known from its [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]], Kempholey, [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name=frost&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Anura/Ranixalidae/Indirana/Indirana-gundia |title=''Indirana gundia'' (Dubois, 1986) |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2014 |work=Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference. Version 6.0 |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indirana gundia'' is listed among "Top 100 [[EDGE species|EDGE Amphibians]]". It represents a family that has been evolving independently in India for almost 50 million years.&lt;ref name=EDGE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/amphibians/species_info.php?id=632 |title=Gundia Indian Frog (''Indirana gundia'') |author= |year= |work=EDGE of Existence programme  |publisher=Zoological Society of London |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Indirana gundia'' are small in size, with a total length of {{convert|23|-|38|mm|abbr=on}}. The dorsum is variable in colour, ranging from brown to yellowish, via golden, cream, pinkish and reddish hues, probably providing good [[camouflage]] against the background of decaying leaves on the forest floor. Adult frogs have long, muscular legs; the digits on both pairs of limbs are unwebbed but dilated into disc-like suckers. The head is fairly pointed and the skin has longitudinal glandular folds along the back. The mouth is wide and the buccal cavity is whitish or yellowish.&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

==Habitat and conservation==
''Indirana gundia'' is a terrestrial frog inhabiting moist tropical forest. It is threatened by [[habitat loss]] caused by intensive livestock production, harvesting of wood and timber by local people, road construction, and the development of tourism facilities.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

Greer , Robert J. Grover, Susan G. Fowler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zlm2hJ7H0wIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=information+professional+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSzbg_Zts1&amp;sig=S_1tRmBMQdnNe37WRW-_Nz0yEXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E9WeU43ALMjqPOiHgWA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=information%20professional%20definition&amp;f=false], pages 12-15&lt;/ref&gt;   

U.S. Occupational Outlook Handbook (2008-2009 edition), [https://books.google.com/books?t. The versatile term 'information professional' is also used to describe other similar professions, such as [[archivist]]s, information managers, information systems specialists, and [[records manager]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Library and Information Professions, by Roger C. Greer , Robert J. Grover, Susan G. Fowler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zlm2hJ7H0wIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=information+professional+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSzbg_Zts1&amp;sig=S_1tRmBMQdnNe37WRW-_Nz0yEXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E9WeU43ALMjqPOiHgWA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=information%20professional%20definition&amp;f=false], pages 12-15&lt;/ref&gt; Information professionals work in a variety of private, public, and academic institutions.

== Skills ==
Since the term information professional is broad, the skills required for this profession are also varied. A [[Gartner]] report in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aiim.org/pdfdocuments/Rise-of-the-Information-Professional-White-Paper.pdf|author=John F. Mancini|publisher=[[AIIM]]|pages=4|title=Rise of the Information Professional}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that "Professional roles focused on information management will be different to that of established IT roles. An 'information professional' will not be one type of role or skill set, but will in fact have a number of specializations". Thus, an information professional can possess a variety of different skills, depending on the sector in which the person is employed.

Some essential cross-sector skills are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=National Archives and Records Service (NARS, South Africa)|url=http://www.national.archives.gov.za/Final%20Report%2015%20March2010.pdf|pages=87-88|title=The demand for and supply of skills in library and informations sciences...|date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* IT skills, such as word-processing and spreadsheets, digitisation skills, and conducting internet searches, together with skills in digitisation, loan systems, databases, content management systems, and specially designed programmes and packages.
* [[Customer service]]. An information professional should have the ability to address the information needs of customers.
* [[Language proficiency]]. This is essential in order to manage the information at hand and deal with customer needs.
* [[Soft skills]]. These include skills such as negotiating, conflict resolution, and time management, which are useful for all interactions at a workplace.
* Management training. An information professional should be familiar with notions such as strategic planning and project management.

Moreover, an information professional should be skilled in planning and using relevant systems, in capturing and securing information, and in accessing it to deliver service whenever the information is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=AIIM|title=Become a Certified Information Professional (CIP)|url=http://www.aiim.org/Education-Section/CIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications ==
Many universities around the world offer academic degrees, or degrees on related subjects such as Archival Studies, Information Systems, Information Management, and Records Management. Furthermore, many library associations and unions offer Information Management training, and there are also online e-learning resources, some of which offer certification for information professionals. In many countries the courses and certificates available are accredited by the relevant professional association, as is the case for example with the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) in the USA, [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP) in the UK, and [[Australian Library and Information Association]] (ALIA) in Australia.

'''Africa''': Information development in Africa started later than in other continents, mainly due to a lack of internet access,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla65/papers/118-116e.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise and resources to manage digital infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wits.ac.za/conferences/icadla/18123/icadla.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715063153/http://www.wits.ac.za/conferences/icadla/18123/icadla.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays however, academic degrees in Information studies are available at many universities of African countries, such as the University of Pretoria (South Africa), University of Nairobi (Kenya), Makerere University (Uganda), University of Botswana (Botswana), and University of Nigeria (Nigeria).

'''Asia''': LIS-related studies are available in more than 30 Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cisap.asia/schools/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130114191226/http://www.cisap.asia/schools/ |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples are: Information Science at Anhui University (China), Library and Information Science at the University of Kelaniya (Sri Lanka), Educational and Information Science at Fo Guang University (Taiwan), Library and Information Science at Airlangga University (Indonesia), Library and Information Science at University of Malaya (Malaysia), Library and Information Science at International Islamic University (Malaysia), and master's degree in Library and Information Science at Kuwait University (Kuwait).

'''Australia''': The [[Australian Library and Information Association]] (ALIA) currently list 22 undergraduate and postgraduate accredited university courses for 'Librarian and Information Specialist' on their official website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alia.org.au/view/course-listing?field_area_of_practice_tid=109]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europe''': The majority of European countries have universities, colleges, or schools which offer bachelor's degrees in LIS studies. Over 40 universities offer master's degrees in LIS-related fields, and many institutions, such as the Swedish School of Library and Information Science (Sweden), the University of Barcelona (Spain), Loughborough University (UK), and Aberystwyth University (Wales, UK) also offer PhD degrees.

'''North America''': Information studies and degrees are available at numerous academic institutions throughout the US and Canada. US professional associations, together with their European counterparts, have undertaken many educational initiatives and pioneered many advances in the field of Information studies, such as increased interdisciplinarity and more effective delivery of distance learning.&lt;ref&gt;Global , [http://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783598441349/9783598441349.549/9783598441349.549.xml?format=EBOK], pages 549 and 552&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South America''': There are many schools and colleges in Latin American countries which offer courses in Library Science, Archival Studies, and Information Studies, however these subjects are taught completely separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Library and Information Science|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783598441349/9783598441349.405/9783598441349.405.xml?format=EBOK|pages=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far only three universities offer the modern version of LIS information studies, namely the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina), the [[Pontifical Xavierian University]] (Colombia) and the National University of Costa Rica (Costa Rica).

== Associations ==
Most countries have a professional association who oversee the professional and academic standards of librarians and information professionals. Some of these educational institutions refer to themselves as an [[iSchool]], such as the CiSAP (Consortium of iSchools Asia Pacific) in Asia and the iSchool Caucus in the USA. There are also international associations related to LIS, the most prominent of which is the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9109">'''Interaction theory''' (IT) is an approach to questions about [[social cognition]], or how one understands other people, that focuses on bodily behaviors and environmental contexts rather than on mental processes.  IT argues against two other contemporary approaches to social cognition (or what is sometimes called ‘[[theory of mind]]’), namely [[theory theory]] (TT) and [[Simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]] (ST).  For TT and ST, the primary way of understanding others is by means of ‘mindreading’ or ‘mentalizing’ – processes that depend on either theoretical inference from [[folk psychology]], or simulation.  In contrast, for IT, the minds of others are understood primarily through our embodied interactive relations.  IT draws on interdisciplinary studies and appeals to evidence developed in [[developmental psychology]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)]], and [[neuroscience]].

== Origins ==

According to Michael et al (2013),&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J., Christiansen, W., and Overgaard, S. (2013). Mindreading as social expertise. Synthese. DOI 10.1007/s11229-013-0295-z&lt;/ref&gt; “The recent surge of interactionist approaches to social cognition can be traced back to [[Shaun Gallagher]]’s proposal for a new approach to social cognition, which he labeled ‘interaction theory’.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. (2001). The practice of mind: Theory, simulation, or primary interaction?  Journal of Consciousness Studies, 8 (5–7): 83–107&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher argued that mainstream mindreading approaches neglect the interactive contexts in which social cognition is embedded, and thereby overlook embodied and extended processes that are engaged in interactions, and which are important components of social cognition.”  The basic ideas of IT can be traced back to the work of Colwyn Trevarthen&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. B. 1979. Communication and cooperation in early infancy: A description of primary intersubjectivity. In M. Bullowa (ed.), Before Speech.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who coined the term ‘primary intersubjectivity’ to refer to early developing sensory-motor processes of interaction between infants and caregivers.  Other work in developmental psychology by [[Daniel Stern (psychologist)]], [[Andrew N. Meltzoff]], [[Peter Hobson]], Vasu Reddy, and others, provides important evidence for the role of interaction in social cognition.  Similar insights can be found earlier in the work of the phenomenologists, like [[Max Scheler]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].   IT has also motivated a rethinking in the methods for studying social cognition in neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;Schilbach, L.,Timmermans, B., Reddy, V., Costal, A., Schlicht, T. and Vogeley, K. 2013. Toward a second-person neuroscience. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 36(4): 393-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary and secondary intersubjectivity ==

[[Colwyn Trevarthen]]&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. B. 1979. Communication and cooperation in early infancy: A description of primary intersubjectivity. In M. Bullowa (ed.), Before Speech.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term ‘primary [[intersubjectivity]]’ to refer to early developing sensory-motor processes of interaction between infants and there caregivers.  Important cues for understanding others are provided by their facial expressions, bodily posture and movements, gestures, actions, and in processes of neonate imitation, proto-conversations, gaze following and affective attunement. "In most intersubjective situations, that is, in situations of social interaction, we have a direct perceptual understanding of another person’s intentions because their intentions are explicitly expressed in their embodied actions and their expressive behaviors. This understanding does not require us to postulate or infer a belief or a desire hidden away in the other person’s mind. What we might reflectively or abstractly call their belief or desire is expressed directly in their actions and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. &amp; Hutto, D. (2008). Understanding others through Primary Interaction and Narrative Practice. In T. Zlatev, T. Racine, C. Sinha, &amp; E. Itkonen, The Shared Mind: Perspectives on Intersubjectivity (pp. 17–38). Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime during the first year of life infants also start to enter into [[joint attention]] situations and begin to pay attention to how others act and what they do with objects in everyday contexts, and this also provides a way to understand their intentions and contextualized actions.  This is referred to as ‘secondary intersubjectivity’, which highlights the fact that interactions often take place in cooperative contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. and Hubley, P. 1978. Secondary intersubjectivity: Confidence, confiding and acts of meaning in the first year. In A. Lock (ed.), Action, Gesture and Symbol: The Emergence of Language (pp. 183-229). London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  During most interactions, intentions are apparent based upon the pragmatic context of the situation in which they are occurring. We can instantly see what the other “intends” or “wants” based upon their actions and the current context; we do not need to infer their intentions as if they are hidden away. There is a “shared world” that we live in where we intuitively and instinctively perceive others as minded beings like ourselves.

== Direct perception ==

Interaction theory supports the notion of the direct perception of the other's intentions and emotions during intersubjective encounters. Gallagher&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. (2005). How the Body Shapes the Mind.  Oxford: Oxford University Press/Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. 2008. Direct perception in the intersubjective context.  Consciousness and Cognition 17: 535–543&lt;/ref&gt; argues that most of what we need for our understanding of others is based on our interactions and perceptions, and that very little mindreading occurs or is required in our day-to-day interactions. Rather than first perceiving another’s actions and then inferring the meaning of their actions (as in TT), the intended meaning is perceptible in the other person’s movements and contextualized actions.  Differences in a person’s intentions show up as differences in perceptible kinematic properties of action movements.&lt;ref&gt;Becchio C., Manera V., Sartori L., Cavallo A., Castiello U. (2012). Grasping intentions: from thought experiments to empirical evidence. Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, 6, 117&lt;/ref&gt;  A person’s emotions are not only expressed on their faces and in their postures and gestures, but these perceptible embodied aspects help to constitute what the emotion is. Mental states (like intentions and emotions) are therefore not hidden away from view, they are, IT claims, in fact, and at least in part, bodily states that are apparent in the action movements that constitute them. For example, as phenomenologists from [[Max Scheler]] to [[Dan Zahavi]] point out, upon seeing an angry face an observer does not first see a face that is contorted into a scowl and then infer that the target is angry. The anger is immediately apparent on the face of the other.  The overwhelming majority of interactions in our daily lives are face-to-face so it makes sense that our primary way of understanding one another is from a second-person perspective rather than from the detached, theoretical, third-person perspective described by TT and ST.

== Narrative competency ==

In addition to primary and secondary intersubjectivity, and the contributing dynamics of interaction itself to the social cognitive process,&lt;ref&gt;De Jaegher, H., Di Paolo, E. &amp; Gallagher, S. (2010). Can social interaction constitute social cognition? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 14 (10), 441-447&lt;/ref&gt; IT proposes that more nuanced and sophisticated understandings of others are based, not primarily on folk psychological theory or the use of simulation, but on the implicit and explicit uses of narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. &amp; Hutto, D. (2008). Understanding others through primary interaction and narrative practice. In T. Zlatev, T. Racine, C. Sinha, &amp; E. Itkonen, The Shared Mind: Perspectives on Intersubjectivity (pp. 17–38). Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutto, D. Folk Psychological Narratives: The Sociocultural Basis of Understanding Reasons. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  IT builds on the notion that the pervasiveness of narratives in most cultures, from the earliest nursery rhymes to the performances of theater, film, and television, expose us to a variety of characters, situations, and reasons for acting in certain ways.  These, combined with personal narratives, provide the background knowledge that allows us to implicitly frame the actions of others in understandable narratives, providing a fallible and revisable sense of what the other is up to.

[[File:M83 - Southern Pinwheel.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Messier 83]] is an intermediate spiral galaxy of type SABc located in the [[constellation]] [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].]]

An '''intermediate spiral galaxy''' is a [[Galaxy|galaxy]] that is in between the classifications of a [[barred spiral galaxy]] and an [[unbarred spiral galaxy]]. It is designated as '''SAB''' in the [[galaxy morphological classification]] system devised by [[Gerard de Vaucouleurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vaucouleurs|first1=Gerard|title=Revised Classification of 1500 Bright Galaxies|journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement|date=1963|volume=8|page=31|doi=10.1086/190084|bibcode=1963ApJS....8...31D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtypes are labeled as SAB0, SABa, SABb, or SABc, following a sequence analogous to the [[Hubble sequence]] for barred and unbarred spirals. The subtype (0, a, b, or c) is based on the relative prominence of the central [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] and how tightly wound the [[spiral arms]] are.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">The '''Leipzig school''' was a branch of [[sociology]] developed by a group of academics led by philosopher and sociologist [[Hans Freyer]] at the [[University of Leipzig]], [[Germany]] in the 1930s.

Freyer saw [[Nazism]] as an opportunity; many of his followers were politically active [[Nazism|Nazis]]. They included [[Arnold Gehlen]], [[Gunter Ipsen]], [[Heinz Maus]], [[Karl Heinz Pfeffer]], and [[Helmut Schelsky]].

The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (Nazi Party) did not allow any competing [[ideology|ideologies]] to develop in universities; however, some of the Leipzig School group remained at the university until 1945. Their numbers declined as some emigrated (Günther) or made a career in the [[Third Reich]] (Gehlen, Ipsen, Pfeffer), and before the war ended, Freyer himself left to take up a teaching position at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]].

This page lists the most relevant '''model railway scale standards''' in the world. Most standards are regional, but some have followers in other parts of the world outside their native region, most notably [[Normen Europäischer Modelleisenbahnen|NEM]] and [[NMRA]]. While the most significant standardised dimension of a model railway scale is the gauge, a typical scale standard covers many more aspects of model railways and defines scale-specific dimensions for items like [[Overhead lines|catenary]], [[Wheelset (rail transport)|rolling stock wheels]], [[loading gauge]], [[Minimum railway curve radius|curve radii]] and [[Grade (slope)|grades for slopes]], for instance.

== Scale standards ==

=== NEM ===
[[MOROP]] (the European federation of national model railway associations) is a European organisation which publishes [[Normen Europäischer Modelleisenbahnen|NEM]]-standards. NEM-standards are used by model railway industry and hobbyists in Europe. The standards are published in French and German and both versions have an official status. Unofficial translations in English from third parties exist for certain NEM-standard sheets.

Model railway scales and gauges are standardized in NEM 010,&lt;ref name="NEM010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miba.de/morop/nem010_d.pdf|publisher=[[MOROP]]|title=Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen Maßstäbe, Nenngrößen, Spurweiten | language=German|date=2011|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers several gauges for each scale. Narrow gauges are indicated by an additional letter added after the base scale as follows:
* no letter = [[standard gauge]] (prototype: {{convert|1250|-|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}})
* m = [[metre gauge]] (prototype: {{convert|850|-|1250|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}})
* e = [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] (prototype: {{convert|650|-|850|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}})
* i = [[Industrial railway|industrial]] (prototype: {{convert|400|-|650|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}})
* p = [[List of ridable miniature railways|park railway]] (prototype: {{convert|300|-|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}})
For instance, a metre gauge model railway in H0-scale would be designated H0m. In German text letter 'f' (stands for Feldbahn) is sometimes used instead of 'i'. Letter 'e' is derived from the French word 'étroit' which translates to 'narrow'. NEM gauges are arranged conveniently to use normal gauge of smaller scales as narrow gauges for a certain scale. For instance, H0m gauge is the same as the TT scale normal gauge, H0e same as the N scale normal gauge and H0i same as the Z scale normal gauge

For H0 and 0 -scales, NEM uses the number zero or the letter 'O', whereas NMRA uses letter 'O' (HO instead of H0). Regardless of whether a letter or number is used, the scale is the same.

=== NMRA ===
The [[NMRA]] (National Model Railroad Association) standardized the first model railway scales in the 1940s. NMRA standards are used widely in North America and by certain special interest groups all over the world. To some extent NMRA and NEM standards are compatible, but in many areas, the two standards specify certain model railway details in somewhat incompatible ways for the same scale.

There are two NMRA standard sheets where the scales have been defined. NMRA standard S-1.2 covers the ''popular model railway scales'' and S-1.3 defines ''scales with deep flanges'' for model railways with very sharp curves or other garden railway specific design features.

In certain NMRA scales an alternative designation is sometimes used corresponding the length of one prototype foot in scale either in millimetres or in inches. For instance, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm scale is the same as HO. For [[HO scale|HO]] and [[O scale|O]] -scales, NMRA uses the letter 'O' whereas NEM uses the number zero (H0 instead of HO).

NMRA has defined alternative, more prototypical, track and wheel system standards in standard sheet S-1.1 for the purposes of reproducing the prototype proportions in scale model more realistically. These model railway standards are based on the full size prototype standards and the scale model operational reliability is therefore reduced in comparison to the models conforming to the normal NMRA standards. Proto and finescale rails and wheels are generally not compatible with the normal scale model railway material with the same scale ratio.

Proto scale was originally developed by the Model Railway Study Group in Great Britain in 1966 and later adopted into NMRA standards with modifications necessary for the North American prototype railway standards. Proto scale reproduces faithfully the prototype wheel tread profile and track work used by the [[Association of American Railroads]] and the [[American Railway Engineering Association]].

Finescale reproduces the prototype wheel tread profile and track work used by the Association of American Railroads and the American Railway Engineering Association with minor compromises for performance and manufacturability.

=== British ===
The main railways in Great Britain use the international [[standard gauge]] of {{RailGauge|uksg}} but the [[loading gauge]] is narrower and lower than in the rest of Europe with the same standard gauge. This is one of the main reasons why the country has traditionally used its own distinctive model railway scales which can rarely be found outside the British Isles.

When H0 scale was being introduced, the motors available were too large&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hobbiesplus.com.au/scaleandgauge.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to fit in scale-sized bodies and so as a compromise the scale was increased from 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 4&amp;nbsp;mm to the foot, but the gauge was not changed so other elements could be shared. For 00 therefore the track is narrower than it should be for the scale used. EM and P4 standards correct this anomaly by adopting a wider track gauge.

The globally more-widespread international NEM and NMRA scale standards are relatively rare in Great Britain and used almost exclusively by those modelling foreign prototypes.

{| class=wikitable
|-
! Scale !! Ratio !! Gauge !! Notes
|-
| 000&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:152 || {{RailGauge|9.42 mm}} || An early predecessor of small scales like N. Developed before [[World War II]] and became somewhat popular in the 1950s. No commercial products available. Today The 2mm Scale Association is the force behind the scale and 2&amp;nbsp;mm scale has become a finescale alternative to the British N-scale.
|-
| [[N gauge|N]] || 1:148 || {{RailGauge|9 mm}} || A British adaptation of N-scale for modelling British prototypes with a smaller loading gauge. Has a track gauge error of approximately -7%. Hobbyists who model European or American prototypes in Britain, use the standard N-scale with the scale ratio 1:160.
|-
| [[TT scale#British TT|TT/TT3]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:102 || {{RailGauge|12 mm}} || Introduced by Triang in 1957 as a British adaptation of the American TT scale. Later Triang dropped this scale in favour of N scale and today there is no commercial following. Has a track gauge error of approximately -15% (the rolling stock superstructures are too large for its gauge). Those models can drive on straight and curved sections of German BTTB Standard Gleis except crossings and switches.
|-
| [[H0 gauge|H0]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;3.5&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:87 || {{RailGauge|16.5 mm}} || H0 scale was introduced in Britain in the 1920s, and although it stayed as the most common worldwide modelling scale, in Britain H0 has little commercial availability and is generally only used to model the British prototype by a small number of modellers.
|-
| [[00 gauge|00]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:76 || {{RailGauge|16.5 mm}} || The most popular railway modelling scale in Britain. The correct track gauge at the scale of 4&amp;nbsp;mm per foot should be approximately 18.8&amp;nbsp;mm. At 16.5&amp;nbsp;mm, it has a track gauge error of approximately -12.4%.
|-
| [[EM gauge|EM]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:76 || {{RailGauge|18.2 mm}} || This gauge is represented by the EM Society (in full, Eighteen Millimetre Society). 00 track (16.5&amp;nbsp;mm) is the wrong gauge for 1:76 scale, but use of an {{RailGauge|18.2 mm}} gauge track is accepted as the most popular compromise towards scale dimensions without having to make significant modifications to ready-to-run models. Has a track gauge error of approximately -3.5%.
|-
| [[Protofour|P4]]/S4&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:76.2 || {{RailGauge|18.83 mm}} || Uses a track gauge of 18.83&amp;nbsp;mm which represents an exact scaling down of the prototype at 4&amp;nbsp;mm to 1&amp;nbsp;ft scale. P4 contains an allowance for the tighter curves found on model railways in the wheel back-to-back and related dimensions. S4 removes this allowance, for a dead-scale representation of all trackwork dimensions. Both standards are now maintained by the Scalefour Society and are now applied to other prototypical track gauges (such as Irish broad gauge).
|-
| [[O14]] || 1:43.5 || {{RailGauge|14 mm}} || For accurately representing 2&amp;nbsp;ft narrow gauge in 7&amp;nbsp;mm scale.
|-
| [[O scale|0]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:43.5 || {{RailGauge|32 mm}} || Three sub-standards: coarse, unified and fine. Has a track gauge error of approximately -3%.
|-
| [[ScaleSeven]] (S7)&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;mm || 1:43.5 || {{RailGauge|33 mm}} || A finescale represented by The ScaleSeven group.

=== Japanese ===
While there are Japanese model railway manufacturers that export their products to other parts of the world and follow the scale standards of the export destinations, in Japan there are several domestic scales that are popular in the country but virtually unknown elsewhere. International NEM and NMRA scales are also used by some Japanese modellers. The main reason for the domestic scales different from international standards is the smaller prototype loading gauge and unusual gauges of Japanese railways: {{RailGauge|600mm}}, {{RailGauge|762 mm}} and {{RailGauge|1067 mm}} are used, along with standard gauge of {{RailGauge|1435 mm}}.

=== Live steam ===
[[Live steam]] model railways are not standardized systematically by any single standardization body. There are, however, certain scales and gauges which have become de facto standards and in some cases correspond to either NEM or NMRA standard scales. One example is the "IBLS" ([http://www.ibls.org International Brotherhood of Live Steamers]), an informal organization which has published standards for some of the gauges. Many clubs have their own standards, which also may vary slightly from country to country. [[Hornby Railways]] have pioneered commercial model live steam in 00 (1:76 scale on 16.5&amp;nbsp;mm gauge), the existing models are heated using a controllable electric current through the two running rails and have the steam pressure chamber in the model tender.

In addition to these scales, the United Kingdom has, over the last forty years, fathered a scale that is based on the predominant British narrow track gauge of {{RailGauge|2ft}}. Using {{RailGauge|32 mm}} - 0 gauge - track, there is an extensive range of 16&amp;nbsp;mm to the foot scale [1:19] live-steam and other types of locomotives, rolling stock and accessories. Many of these models are dual gauge, and can be converted to run on {{RailGauge|45 mm}} track ([[gauge 1]]), and radio control is common. Locomotives in this scale are generally large and 'chunky', and can range from the tiny 0-4-0 seen on Welsh slate quarry lines all the way up to the very largest found in the UK, such as the ex-ACR NG/G16 Beyer-Garratt locomotives, seen running on the Welsh Highland Railway in North Wales. The hobby is supported by a number of 16&amp;nbsp;mm live steam and electric traction builders, dominated by the likes of Roundhouse Engineering and Accucraft UK.

| [[00 gauge|00]] || 1:76 || {{RailGauge|16.5 mm}} || Hornby produced. Generally regarded as the smallest scale for live steam. Discontinued in 2011 due to poor sales and reliability of the units. The operating instructions from Hornby were incorrect and led to many locomotives being broken after derailing and crashing to the floor. There is still much interest and lively sales of secondhand sets. The 00 Live Steam Club also promotes the product.

| No.3 || 1:22.6 || {{RailGauge|64 mm}} || The smallest scale able to pull real passengers. Was one of the first popular live steam gauges, developed in England in the early 1900s. In terms of model railway operation, gauge 3 is the largest (standard gauge) scenic railway modelling scale, using a scale of 13.5&amp;nbsp;mm to the foot. The Gauge '3' Society represents this aspect of 2{{fraction|1|2}}" gauge railway modelling with both electric and live steam operation. Gauge '3' corresponds to NEM II scale, also known as 'Spur II' in Germany.

The National 2.5″ Association continues to support live steam passenger hauling in 2.5″ gauge using MES tracks. They use a 'scale' appropriate to the original prototype modelling both standard and narrow gauge locomotives to run on 2.5″ track.

=== Historical ===
There have been many short-lived and often promising model railway scales which are very much defunct nowadays. Quite often these were backed by only the company that created a new scale in the first place.

'''MDPI''' is an organisational acronym used by two related organisations, '''Molecular Diversity Preservation International''' and '''Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute''', which were both co-founded by [[Shu-Kun Lin]]. The first organisation, Molecular Diversity Preservation International, founded in 1996, is primarily a chemical sample archive, with some scholarly publishing and conference activities. The second organisation, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, was founded in 2010, primarily as a publisher. As of 2018 MDPI publishes 213 peer-reviewed academic journals of which 37 have received an [[impact factor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

MDPI was included on [[Jeffrey Beall]]'s list of [[predatory open access publishing]] companies in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillis|first1=Alex|date=January 12, 2017|title=Beware! Academics are getting reeled in by scam journals|url=http://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/beware-academics-getting-reeled-scam-journals/|journal=University Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beall2014" /&gt; and was removed in 2015.&lt;ref name="ASH2017" /&gt; Beall's list was shut down in 2017; Beall later wrote that he had been pressured to shut down the list by various publishers, specifically mentioning MDPI.&lt;ref name="biochemia" /&gt; The publisher has been downgraded to non-academic status (level 0) in the [[Norwegian Scientific Index]] from 2019.&lt;ref name="NorwegianScientificIndex" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Molecular Diversity Preservation International ===

Molecular Diversity Preservation International was founded and registered as a [[non-profit association]] ([[Swiss Verein|Verein]]) by Shu-Kun Lin and Benoit R. Turin in Basel in 1996 to enable the deposit and exchange of rare molecular and biomolecular research samples.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/history |title=History of MDPI |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to preserve the diversity of chemical compounds through the collection and storage of samples that could be made available to the scientific community for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chemical Museum and Samples Exchange |url=http://www.mdpi.org/index-samples.htm |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of samples was permanently transferred to the MDPI Sustainability Foundation in 2013, and Molecular Diversity Preservation International was dissolved. The collection of chemical samples is now operated by Molmall Sarl on behalf of the MDPI Sustainability Foundation.&lt;ref name="molmall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.molmall.net/about-us.html |title=MolMall About us |date=2013 |publisher=MolMall |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [[Molecules (journal)|''Molecules'']] was established in 1996 in collaboration with Springer-Verlag (now [[Springer Science+Business Media]]) in order to document the chemical samples of the MDPI collection. Several other journals were established by the MDPI Verein, including [[Entropy (journal)|''Entropy'']] (1999), the ''[[International Journal of Molecular Sciences]]'' (2000), [[Sensors (journal)|''Sensors'']] (2001), ''[[Marine Drugs]]'' (2003), and the ''[[International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health]]'' (2004). The publisher '''MDPI AG''' (see below) was spun off from MDPI Verein in 2010.

MDPI Verein co-organized several [[academic conferences]], including the ''International Symposium on Frontiers in Molecular Science''. It also runs [[virtual conference]]s, such as the ''Electronic Conference on Synthetic Organic Chemistry'', which was started in 1997. In 2010 MDPI launched the platform Sciforum.net to host virtual conferences. In 2014, various virtual conferences were hosted in the areas of synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences, sensors, and sustainability. In 2015, MDPI co-organized two physical conferences with and at the [[University of Basel]], the ''4th Internationational Symposium on Sensor Science'' and the ''5th World Sustainability Forum''. Since 2015, scholars can organize their own conference for free on the Sciforum platform.

=== MDPI AG (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) ===
MDPI AG, a publisher of [[open-access]] [[scientific journal]]s, was spun off from the Molecular Diversity Preservation International organization. It was formally registered by Shu-Kun Lin and Dietrich Rordorf in May 2010 in Basel, Switzerland, and maintains editorial offices in China, Spain and Serbia.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; MDPI relies primarily on [[article processing charges]] to cover the costs of editorial quality control and production of articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Does MDPI Offer Any Discounts or Waivers of the Article Processing Charges (APCs)? |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/apc#discount |publisher=MDPI |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 280 universities and institutes have joined the MDPI Institutional Open Access Program; authors from these organizations pay reduced article processing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership Institutes |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/ioap |publisher=MDPI |accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDPI is a member of the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]], the [[International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers]], and the [[Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association]] (OASPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicationethics.org/members/publishers?name=MDPI |title=COPE Members |accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stm-assoc.org/membership/our-members/ |title=STM Members |accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oaspa.org/membership/members// |title=OASPA Members |accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDPI publishes more than two hundred [[peer-reviewed]] scientific journals. As of August 2018, 40 journals have been selected for coverage in the [[Science Citation Index Expanded]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/sci |title=Journals indexed in SCI-E (Web of Science)|accessdate=2016-06-20 |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 69 journals are indexed in other [[Clarivate Analytics]] products, such as the [[Emerging Sources Citation Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/esci |title=Journals indexed in ESCI (Web of Science)|accessdate=2017-11-16 |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BIOSIS Previews]], and [[The Zoological Record]].

A total of 49 MDPI journals publishing in biomedicine, life sciences, and related areas are archived in [[PubMed Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/pubmed/ |title=Journals indexed in PubMed |accessdate=2017-11-16 |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDPI journals can also be found in other relevant indexing services, such as [[Scopus]], which currently includes over 79 MDPI journals, and [[Ei Compendex]], which covers 13 MDPI journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/scopus |title=Journals indexed in Scopus | accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Journals indexed in Ei Compendex |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/compendex |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with OASPA's recommendation, all articles published by MDPI since 2008 are released under the CC-BY [[Creative Commons license]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MDPI Open Access Information and Policy |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/openaccess |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preserved with the [[Swiss National Library]] and [[CLOCKSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CLOCKSS |url=https://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About MDPI |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrulis' theoretical paper, ''Theory of the Origin, Evolution, and Nature of Life'', aiming at presenting a framework to explain life.&lt;ref name=andruli&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrulis |first=Erik D. |title=Theory of the Origin, Evolution, and Nature of Life |journal=Life |date=2011 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–105 |doi=10.3390/life2010001 |pmid=25382118 |pmc=4187144 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted coverage by the popular science and technology magazines ''[[Ars Technica]]'' and ''[[Popular Science]]'', which characterized it as "crazy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timmer |first=John |title=How the craziest f#@!ing "theory of everything" got published and promoted |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/01/how-the-craziest-fing-theory-of-everything-got-published-and-promoted/ |accessdate=17 January 2014 |newspaper=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "hilarious".&lt;ref name="popscilifepaper"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nosowitz |first=Dan |title=Hilarious "Theory of Everything" Paper Provokes Kerfuffle |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/hilarious-theory-everything-paper-provokes-kerfuffle-hullabaloo-foofaraw |accessdate=17 January 2014 |newspaper=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[editorial board]] of ''Life'' resigned in response.&lt;ref name="popscilifepaper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |title=Life turned upside down |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/01/31/life-turned-upside-down/#.Utj4jvS1zFV |accessdate=17 January 2014 |newspaper=Discover Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Lin defended the journal's editorial process, saying that the paper had been revised following lengthy reviews by two faculty members from institutions different from the author's.&lt;ref name="lifeguesteditor"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/2/1/213 | title=Publication of Controversial Papers in ''Life'' | journal=Life | year=2012 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=213–214 | doi=10.3390/life2010213 | pmid=26791663 | pmc=4187141 |doi-access=free| last=Lin | first=Shu-Kun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, another MDPI journal, ''[[Entropy (journal)|Entropy]]'', published a review paper claiming [[glyphosate]] may be the most important factor in the development of [[obesity]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[autism]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[cancer]], and [[infertility]].&lt;ref name=samsel&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samsel |first=Anthony |author2=Stephanie Seneff |title=Glyphosate's Suppression of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes and Amino Acid Biosynthesis by the Gut Microbiome: Pathways to Modern Diseases |journal=Entropy |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1416 |doi=10.3390/e15041416 |doi-access=free  |bibcode=2013Entrp..15.1416S |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper itself does not contain any primary research results.&lt;ref name=samsel /&gt; It was criticized as [[pseudo-science]] by the popular [[List of science magazines|science magazine]] [[Discover (magazine)|''Discover'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kloor |first=Keith |title=When Media Uncritically Cover Pseudoscience |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/2013/04/26/when-media-uncritically-cover-pseudoscience/#.UtkD__S1zFU |accessdate=17 January 2014 |newspaper=Discover Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the same controversial study, [[Jeffrey Beall]] has rhetorically asked, "Will MDPI publish anything for money?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Roundup (Glyphosate) Researchers Use Easy OA Journals to Spread their Views |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2015/01/08/anti-roundup-glyphosate-researchers-use-easy-oa-journals-to-spread-their-views/ |website=Scholarly Open Access |accessdate=8 January 2015 |last1=Beall |first1=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Beall |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112022110/http://scholarlyoa.com/2015/01/08/anti-roundup-glyphosate-researchers-use-easy-oa-journals-to-spread-their-views/ |archivedate=12 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, another MDPI journal, ''[[Behavioral Sciences (journal)|Behavioral Sciences]]'', published a review paper claiming pornography caused [[erectile dysfunction]]. Six scientists independently contacted MDPI concerned about fraud and other issues in the article, initiating an independent review by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). COPE recommended retracting the article.&lt;ref name="retractionwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web|title= Journal corrects, but will not retract, controversial paper on internet porn|url= https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/13/journal-corrects-but-will-not-retract-controversial-paper-on-internet-porn/|accessdate=13 June 2018|last1=Retraction Watch|deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180614175449/https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/13/journal-corrects-but-will-not-retract-controversial-paper-on-internet-porn/|archivedate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listed paper editor, Scott Lane, denied having served as the editor. Thus, the paper appears not to have undergone peer-review. Further, two authors had undisclosed conflicts of interest. Gary Wilson's association with [[The Reward Foundation]] did not properly identify it as an activist, anti-pornography organization. Wilson also had posted extensively in social media that the study was "by the US Navy", although the original paper stated that it did not reflect the views of the US Navy. The other author, Dr. Andrew Doan, was an ophthalmologist who ran an anti-pornography ministry Real Battlefield Ministries, soliciting donations for their speaking. Further, the Committee on Publication Ethics determined that the cases were not properly, ethically consented for inclusion. MDPI issued a correction for some of these issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.3390/bs8060055|pmid = 29857562|pmc = 6000996|title = Correction: Park, B.Y., et al.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When publishers like MDPI disseminate research by science activists like [[Stephanie Seneff]] and her co-authors, I think it’s fair to question the credibility of all the research that MDPI publishes. Will MDPI publish anything for money?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A third instance of controversial publications is documented in the ''[[Australian paradox]]''.

MDPI has published a statement in December 2013 as a response and defense on publishing controversial papers.&lt;ref name="controversialstatement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/controversial-articles |title=Controversial Articles |date=December 2013 |website= |publisher=MDPI |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Sting}}One of its journals had been targeted in the ''[[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?]]'' [[sting operation]] and rejected the fake paper.&lt;ref&gt;See the {{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60/suppl/DC1 |title=Data and Documents}} of {{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.60|pmid=24092725|title=Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|journal=Science|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=60–65|year=2013|last1=Bohannon|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, MDPI's ''Life'' journal started featuring [[open peer review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3390/life4020225 |pmid=25370195 |pmc=4187159 |doi-access=free | title = Opening up Peer Review in Life: Towards a Transparent and Reliable Process| journal = Life| volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 225–226| year = 2014| last1 = Rampelotto | first1 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (optional, at the authors' discretion),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Life |title=Instructions for Authors — Editorial Procedures and Peer-Review |url=http://www.mdpi.com/journal/life/instructions#editorial_procedure |publisher=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been advocated as a transparency measure to combat predatory journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/2014/11/26/is-this-peer-reviewed-predatory-journals-and-the-transparency-of-peer-review/ |title=Is this peer reviewed?

=== Inclusion in Beall's list ===
MDPI was included on [[Jeffrey Beall]]'s list of [[predatory open access publishing]] companies in February 2014,&lt;ref name=Beall2014&gt;[[Jeffrey Beall]] (18 February 2014), [http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/18/chinese-publishner-mdpi-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers/ Chinese Publisher MDPI Added to List of Questionable Publishers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306052944/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/18/chinese-publishner-mdpi-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers/ |date=2014-03-06 }}, ''Scholarly Open Access: Critical analysis of scholarly open-access publishing''&lt;/ref&gt; and removed in October 2015 following a successful appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beall|first1=Jeffrey|title=MDPI removed from publisher list following successful appeal. #OA #MDPI|url=https://twitter.com/jeffrey_beall/status/659321914582679552?lang=en|website=@jeffrey_beall|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Beall's concern was that "MDPI's warehouse journals contain hundreds of lightly-reviewed articles that are mainly written and published for promotion and tenure purposes rather than to communicate science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Publisher MDPI Added to List of Questionable Publishers |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/18/chinese-publishner-mdpi-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers/ |accessdate=10 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306052944/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/18/chinese-publishner-mdpi-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers/ |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Beall also claimed that MDPI used [[email spam]] to solicit manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Beall]] (11 June 2015), [http://scholarlyoa.com/2015/06/11/guest-editing-a-special-issue-with-mdpi-evidences-of-questionable-actions-by-the-publisher/ Guest Editing a Special Issue with MDPI: Evidences of Questionable Actions by the Publisher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616230128/http://scholarlyoa.com/2015/06/11/guest-editing-a-special-issue-with-mdpi-evidences-of-questionable-actions-by-the-publisher/ |date=2015-06-16 }}, ''Scholarly Open Access: Critical analysis of scholarly open-access publishing''&lt;/ref&gt;
MDPI characterized Beall's comments as "an incompetent general critique" and alleged that the inclusion of MDPI on his list was motivated by a [[Jeffrey Beall#Criticism of open access publishing|hostility towards open access publishing in general]], noting that he had recently published a commentary on that theme.&lt;ref name=tripleC&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beall |first=Jeffrey |title=The Open-Access Movement is Not Really about Open Access |journal=[[tripleC]] |date=2013 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=589–597 |url=http://triplec.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/525/514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beallstatement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/534 |title=Response to Mr. Jeffrey Beall's Repeated Attacks on MDPI |author= |date=February 2014 |website= |publisher=MDPI |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Murray-Rust]], a chemist currently working at the [[University of Cambridge]] and an editorial board member of the MDPI journal ''Data'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data — Editors |url=http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/editors |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized Beall's critique of MDPI as being "irresponsible" and lacking evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murray-Rust |first=Peter |title=Beall's criticism of MDPI lacks evidence and is irresponsible |url=https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2014/02/18/bealls-criticism-of-mdpi-lacks-evidence-and-is-irresponsible/ |date=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the reasons Beall gave for adding MDPI to his list of questionable publishers was the accusation that the company listed Nobel Prize–winning geneticist [[Mario Capecchi]] in one of the editorial board without his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/18/chinese-publishner-mdpi-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers/ |title=Chinese Publisher MDPI Added to List of Questionable Publishers |website=Scholarly Open Access |date=18 February 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2015 |author=Beall, Jeffrey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215061135/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/18/chinese-publishner-mdpi-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers/ |archivedate=15 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later revealed as the result of an inaccurate communication by Capecchi's assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecampusnews.com/top-news/open-access-publisher-566/3/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310085753/http://www.ecampusnews.com/top-news/open-access-publisher-566/3/|title=Open access critic has major publisher in crosshairs - Page 3 of 3 - eCampus News|archivedate=10 March 2014|website=eCampus News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MDPI2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/534 |title=Response to Mr. Jeffrey Beall's Repeated Attacks on MDPI |publisher=MDPI | date=24 February 2014 | accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
MDPI has compiled and posted emails claiming to document the acceptance by the following Nobelists as members of the board in MDPI journals:&lt;ref name=MDPI2014/&gt; [[Robert F. Curl]], [[Richard R. Ernst]], [[Jerome Karle]], [[Harold Kroto]], [[Yuan-Tseh Lee]], [[Rudolph A. Marcus]], [[Eric S. Maskin]], [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Kurt Wüthrich]] and [[George Smoot]].&lt;ref name=edbo&gt;

  | accessdate =2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Beall's criticism of MDPI, the [[Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association]] (OASPA) conducted an investigation in April 2014 and concluded that MDPI meets the OASPA Membership Criteria, stating that "Based on our findings we feel satisfied that MDPI continue to meet the OASPA Membership Criteria".&lt;ref name="oaspa.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conclusions from OASPA Membership Committee Investigation into MDPI |url=http://oaspa.org/conclusions-from-oaspa-membership-committee-investigation-into-mdpi/ |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further critique was raised by [[Martin Haspelmath]] who argues that the publication model employed by MDPI "creates a strong incentive to create journals and book imprints that function like '[[vanity press]]es,' allowing authors to publish their low-quality work without significant risk of rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haspelmath|first1=M. |author-link=Martin Haspelmath |year=2013 |title=Why open-access publication should be nonprofit—a view from the field of theoretical language science |journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=7 |page=57 |doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00057 |pmid=23760738 |pmc=3674310 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Haspelmath, MDPI published a commentary in the same journal disputing a number of points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rittman|first1=M|title=Commentary: "Why open-access publication should be nonprofit-a view from the field of theoretical language science"|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=201|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00201|doi-access=free |pmid=26347622|pmc=4543888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDPI was removed from Beall's list in 2015.&lt;ref name=ASH2017&gt;{{cite news|title=Predatory Publishing: The Dark Side of the Open-Access Movement - ASH Clinical News|url=https://www.ashclinicalnews.org/features/predatory-publishing-dark-side-open-access-movement/|work=ASH Clinical News|date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 article in ''[[Biochemia Medica]]'', Beall wrote that he had been pressured to remove his list due to harassment from predatory publishers, and mentioned MDPI specifically as a publisher that had "tried to be as annoying as possible to the university so that the officials would get so tired of the emails that they would silence me just to make them stop."&lt;ref name=biochemia&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Beall|title=What I learned from predatory publishers|journal=Biochemia Medica|year=2017|volume=27|issue=2|pages=273–279|doi=10.11613/BM.2017.029|pmid=28694718|pmc=5493177|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Publication Committee of Norway has decided that MDPI does not meet the criteria to be defined as an academic publisher, and the publisher has been downgraded to "level 0" (non-academic) in the [[Norwegian Scientific Index]].&lt;ref name="NorwegianScientificIndex"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/KanalForlagInfo.action?id=26778&amp;bibsys=false |title=MDPI |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=[[Norwegian Scientific Index]] |publisher=|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation of editors ===
In August 2018, 10 senior editors (including the editor-in-chief) of the journal ''[[Nutrients (journal)|Nutrients]]'' resigned, alleging that MDPI forced the replacement of the editor-in-chief because of his high editorial standards and for resisting pressure to "accept manuscripts of mediocre quality and importance."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aav3129|title=Open-access journal editors resign after alleged pressure to publish mediocre papers|journal=Science|year=2018|last1=Vrieze|first1=Jop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären''''', known in English as '''''Metamorphosis of Plants''''', was published by German poet and [[philosopher]] [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1790. In this work, Goethe essentially discovered the (serially) homologous nature of leaf organs in plants, from [[cotyledons]], to [[photosynthetic]] leaves, to the petals of a [[flower]]. Although [[Sir Richard Owen]], the British vertebrate anatomist, is generally credited with first articulating a definition of the word "[[homology (biology)|homology]]" (in 1843), it is clear that Goethe had already arrived at a sophisticated view of homology and transformation (within an idealist morphological perspective) more than fifty years earlier.

The '''multiple nuclei model''' is an economical model created by [[Chauncy Harris]] and [[Edward Ullman]] in the 1945 article "The Nature of Cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Chauncy D.|last2=Ullman|first2=Edward L.|date=1945-01-01|title=The Nature of Cities|jstor=1026055|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=242|pages=7–17|doi=10.2307/1026055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==
The model describes the layout of a city, based on Chicago. It says that even though a city may have begun with a [[central business district]], or CBD, other smaller CBDs develop on the outskirts of the city near the more valuable housing areas to allow shorter commutes from the outskirts of the city. This creates nodes or nuclei in other parts of the city besides the CBD thus the name multiple nuclei model. Their aim was to produce a more realistic, if more complicated, model. Their main goals in this were to:
# Move away from the concentric zone model
# To better reflect the complex nature of urban areas, especially those of larger size

==Effects of multiple nuclei on Industry==
As multiple nuclei develop, transportation hubs such as airports are constructed which allow industries to be established with reduced transportation costs.
These transportation hubs have [[negative externalities]] such as noise pollution and lower land values, making land around the hub cheaper. Hotels are also constructed near airports because people who travel tend to want to stay near the source of travel. Housing develops in wedges and gets more expensive the farther it is from the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the model==

Harris and Ullman argued that cities do not grow a single nucleus but several separate nuclei. Each nucleus acts like a growth point.

The theory was formed based on the idea that people have greater movement due to increased car ownership. This increase of movement allows for the specialization of regional centers (e.g. heavy industry, business parks, retail areas). The model is suitable for the large, expanding cities. The number of nuclei around which the city expands depends upon situational as well as historical factors. Multiple nuclei develop because:
# Certain industrial activities require transportation facilities e.g. ports, railway stations, etc. to lower transportation costs.
# Various combinations of activities tend to be kept apart e.g. residential areas and airports, factories and parks, etc.
# Other activities are found together to their mutual advantage e.g. universities, bookstores and coffee shops, etc.
# Some facilities need to be set in specific areas in a city - for example the CBD requires convenient traffic systems, and many factories need an abundant source of resources.

==Assumptions for Model &lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;==
#Land is not flat in all areas
#Even Distribution of Resources
#Even Distribution of people in Residential areas
#Even Transportation Costs

The '''Nadal formula''', also called '''Nadal's formula''', is an equation in [[railway]] design that relates the downward force exerted by a [[train]]'s wheels upon the rail, with the lateral force of the wheel's flange against the face of the rail. This relationship is significant in railway design, as a [[Derailment#Slow speed derailments|wheel-climb derailment]] may occur if the lateral and vertical forces are not properly considered.&lt;ref name=APTA&gt;[http://www.aptastandards.com/portals/0/press_pdfs/Mechanical/SS-M-015-06%20Wheel%20Flange%20Angle.pdf APTA SS-M-015-06 Standard for wheel flange angle for passenger equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nadal formula is represented by:
&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu}{1+\mu*\tan(\delta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, L and V refer to the lateral and vertical forces acting upon the rail and wheel, δ is the angle made when the wheel flange is in contact with the rail face, and μ is the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rail.&lt;ref name=APTA /&gt;

Typically, the [[axle load]] for a railway vehicle should be such that the lateral forces of the wheel against the rail should not exceed 50% of the vertical down-force of the vehicle on the rail.&lt;ref name=DOT&gt;[http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Counsel/nprm/tssnprm.pdf Federal Register, July 3, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, there should be twice as much downward force holding the wheel to the rail, as there is lateral force which will tend to cause the wheel to climb in turns. This ratio is accomplished by matching the [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] with the appropriate [[rail profile]] to achieve the L/V ratio desired. If the L/V ratio gets too high, the wheel flange will be pressing against the rail face, and during a turn this will cause the wheel to climb the face of the rail, potentially derailing the railcar.

==Wagner Formula==

The Nadal formula assumes the wheel remains perpendicular to the rail&amp;mdash;it does not take into account [[hunting oscillation]] of the wheelset, or the movement of the wheel flange contact point against the rail.&lt;ref name="Dukkipati"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dukkipati | first=Rao | title=Vehicle Dynamics | publisher=Narosa Publishing House | year=2000 | isbn=978-81-7319-265-4 | pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the Nadal formula, which does take these factors into consideration, is the Wagner formula. As the wheelset yaws relative to the rail, the vertical force V is no longer completely vertical, but is now acting at an angle to the vertical, β. When this angle is factored into the Nadal formula, the result is the Wagner formula:&lt;ref name="Dukkipati" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu*\cos\beta}{(1+\mu*\tan(\delta))*\cos\beta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When the vertical force is truly vertical (that is, β=0 and therefore cos(β)=1), the Wagner formula equals the Nadal formula.

'''Petrophysics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πέτρα, ''petra'', "rock" and φύσις, ''[[physis]]'', "nature") is the study of physical and chemical rock properties and their interactions with [[fluid]]s.&lt;ref name="Tiabb"&gt;{{cite book |title= Petrophysics|author1=Tiabb, D.  |author2=Donaldson, E.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2004|publisher= Elsevier|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-7506-7711-2|page= 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pGb6jaa5IVYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major application of petrophysics is in studying [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoirs]] for the [[hydrocarbon industry]].  Petrophysicists are employed to help [[reservoir engineering|reservoir engineers]] and [[Earth science|geoscientists]] understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Tiabb"/&gt;  Some of the key properties studied in petrophysics are [[lithology]], [[porosity]], [[water saturation]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[density]].  A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring [[well log]] measurements – in which a string of measurement tools are inserted in the borehole, [[coring|core]] measurements – in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface, and [[Seismic exploration|seismic]] measurements.  These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.

While most petrophysicists work in the hydrocarbon industry, some also work in the mining and water resource industries.  The properties measured or computed fall into three broad categories: conventional petrophysical properties, rock mechanical properties, and ore quality.

Petrophysical studies are used by [[petroleum engineering]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[exploration geophysics]] and other related studies.

==Conventional petrophysical properties==
Most petrophysicists are employed (SS) to compute what are commonly called conventional (or reservoir) petrophysical properties.  These are:

''[[Lithology]]:'' A description of the rock's physical characteristics, such as grain size, composition and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithology|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=lithology|work=Earthquake Glossary|publisher=[[US Geological Survey]]|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By studying the lithology of local geological [[outcrop]]s and [[core sample]]s, geoscientists can use a combination of log measurements, such as [[Gamma ray logging|natural gamma]], [[Formation Evaluation Neutron Porosity|neutron]], [[Density logging|density]] and [[Resistivity logging|resistivity]], to determine the lithology down the well.

''[[Porosity]]:'' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (Anti=tattilization)The percentage of a given volume of rock that is pore space and can therefore contain fluids.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/p/porosity.aspx Porosity]", ''[[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary''. Retrieved 12 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the reaction of the rock to bombardment by [[Formation Evaluation Neutron Porosity|neutrons]] or by [[Density logging|gamma rays]] but can also be derived from [[Sonic logging|sonic]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance in porous media|NMR]] logging.

''[[Water saturation]]:'' The fraction of the pore space occupied by water.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/w/water_saturation.aspx Water saturation]", ''[[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary''. Retrieved 12 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the resistivity of the rock and is known by the symbol &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt;.

''[[Permeability (fluid)|Permeability]]:'' The quantity of fluid (usually hydrocarbon) that can flow through a rock as a function of time and pressure, related to how interconnected the pores are.  [[Drill Stem Test|Formation testing]] is so far the only tool that can directly measure a rock formation's permeability down a well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  In case of its absence, which is common in most cases, an estimate for permeability can be derived from empirical relationships with other measurements such as [[porosity]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance in porous media|NMR]] and sonic logging.

''Thickness'' of rock with enough permeability to deliver fluids to a well bore.  This property is often called “''Net reservoir rock''.”  In the oil and gas industry, another quantity “''Net Pay''” is computed which is the thickness of rock that can deliver hydrocarbons to the well bore at a profitable rate.

Reservoir models are built upon their measured and derived properties to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir, the rate at which that hydrocarbon can be produced to the Earth’s surface through wellbores and the fluid flow in rocks.  In the water resource industry, similar models are used to compute how much water can be produced to the surface over long periods of time, without depleting the aquifer.

==Rock mechanical properties==
Some petrophysicists use acoustic and density measurements of rocks to compute their mechanical properties and strength. They measure the compressional (P) wave velocity of sound through the rock and the shear (S) wave velocity and use these with the density of the rock to compute the rocks' ''compressive strength'', which is the compressive stress that causes a rock to fail, and the rocks' ''flexibility'', which is the relationship between stress and deformation for a rock. [[Converted-wave analysis]] is also used to determine subsurface lithology and porosity.

These measurements are useful to design programs to drill wells that produce oil and gas. The measurements are also used to design dams, roads, foundations for buildings, and many other large construction projects. They can also be used to help interpret seismic signals from the Earth, either man-made seismic signals or those from earthquakes.

==Ore quality==
Bore holes can be drilled into ore bodies (for example coal seams or gold ore) and either rock samples taken to determine the ore or coal quality at each bore hole location or the wells can be wireline logged to make measurements that can be used to infer quality.  Some petrophysicists do this sort of analysis.  The information is mapped and used to make mine development plans.

==Methods of analysis==
''[[Coring]] and [[core analysis]]'' is a direct measurement of petrophysical properties. In the petroleum industry rock samples are retrieved from subsurface and measured by core labs of oil company or some commercial core measurement service companies. This process is time consuming and expensive, thus can not be applied to all the wells drilled in a field.

[[File:wikipedia petrophysics figure 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 1]]
''[[Well logging|Well Logging]]'' is used as a relatively inexpensive method to obtain petrophysical properties downhole. Measurement tools are conveyed downhole using either [[Wireline logging#Wireline log|wireline]] or [[Logging while drilling|LWD]] method.

An example of wireline logs is shown in Figure 1.  The first “track”, shows the natural gamma radiation level of the rock.  The gamma radiation level “log” shows increasing radiation to the right and decreasing radiation to the left.  The rocks emitting less radiation have more yellow shading.  The detector is very sensitive and the amount of radiation is very low.  In clastic rock formations, rocks that have smaller amounts of radiation are more likely to be coarser grained and have more pore space, rocks with higher amounts of radiation are more likely to have finer grains and less pore space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poupon|first=A.|author2=Clavier, C., Dumanoir, J., Gaymard, R., Misk, A.|title=Log Analysis of Sand-Shale SequencesA Systematic Approach|journal=Journal of Petroleum Technology|year=1970|volume=22|issue=7|pages=867–881 |doi=10.2118/2897-PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second track over in the plot records the depth below the reference point which is usually the Kelly bush or rotary table in feet, so these rocks are 11,900 feet below the surface of earth.

In the third track, the electrical resistivity of the rock is presented. The water in this rock is salty and the salt in the water causes the water to be electrically conductive such that lower resistivity is caused by increasing water saturation and decreasing hydrocarbon saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Brown |first=G. A. |title=A Mathematical Comparison of Common Saturation Equations |conference=SPWLA twenty-seventh annual logging symposium |date=June 1986 |id=1986-T |url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPWLA-1986-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth track, shows the computed water saturation, both as “total” water (including the water bound to the rock) in magenta and the “effective water” or water that is free to flow in black.  Both quantities are given as a fraction of the total pore space.

The fifth track shows the fraction of the total rock that is pore space, filled with fluids.  The display of the pore space is divided into green for oil and blue for movable water. The black line shows the fraction of the pore space which contains either water or oil that can move, or be “produced.” In addition to what is included in blackline, the magenta line includes the water that is permanently bound to the rock.

The last track is a representation of the solid portion of the rock.  The yellow pattern represents the fraction of the rock (excluding fluids) that is composed of coarser grained sandstone.  The gray pattern represents the fraction of rock that is composed of finer grained “shale.”  The sandstone is the part of the rock that contains the producible hydrocarbons and water.

==Rock volumetric model for shaly sand formation==
''Symbols and Definitions:''
[[File:wikipedia petrophysics figure 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2, a petrophysical rock model for clastic rock formation]]

The following definition and petrophysics model are a typical shaly sand formation model which assumes:
1. Shale is composed of silt, clay and their bounded water which will not flow. 
2. Hydrocarbon are stored only in pore space in sand matrix.

ΦT –	Total porosity (PHIT), which includes the pore space in sand and shale.

Sw –	Total water saturation, the fraction of the pore space occupied by water.

Φe –	Effective shale corrected porosity which includes only the pore space in sand. The pore space in shale which is filled with bounded water is excluded.

Swe –	Effective shale corrected water saturation. The volumetric fraction of Φe which is occupied by water.

Vsh – Volumetric fraction of shale.  This includes medium to very fine silt plus clay and the shale bound water.

Φsh – Shale porosity. Volumetric fraction of pore space in shale. These pore space is filled with bounded water by definition.

Key equations:

(1-Φe-Vsh) + Vsh + Φe*Swe + Φe*(1-Swe) = 1

Sandstone matrix volume  +  shale volume  +   water volume in sand   +  hydrocarbon volume in sand  = total rock volume

Φe  = ΦT – Vsh *Φsh

'''Response Prompting Procedures''' are systematic strategies used to increase the probability of correct responding and opportunities for positive reinforcement for learners by providing and then systematically removing [[prompts]]. Response prompting is sometimes called "errorless" learning because teaching using these procedures usually results in few errors by the learner. The goal of response prompting is to transfer [[stimulus control]] from the prompt to the desired [https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Discriminative+Stimulus discriminative stimulus]. Several response prompting procedures are commonly used in [[special education]] research: (a) system of least prompts, (b) most to least prompting, (c) progressive and constant time delay, and (d) simultaneous prompting.

==System of least prompts==
The SLP prompting procedure uses and removes prompts by moving through a hierarchy from less to more restrictive prompts.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; If the student emits the correct behavior at any point during this [http://www.educateautism.com/applied-behaviour-analysis/discrete-trial-training.html instructional trial] (with or without prompts), reinforcement is provided. The system of least prompts gives the learner the opportunity to exhibit the correct response with the least restrictive level of prompting needed. Because teachers are required to use multiple types of prompts (e.g., verbal and physical prompts), the SLP prompting procedure may be complicated for use in typical settings,&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; but may be similar to [https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/html/prfteachers/reading_first1phonics.html non-systematic teaching] procedures typically used by teachers that involve giving learners an opportunity to exhibit a behavior independently before providing a prompt.

SLP has been widely used for a variety of learners and skills. It has been most widely used in a 1:1 format (individual instruction) for [[chained skills]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; It has recently been used in conjunction with new technology, like portable DVD players and video iPods, to each self-help skills to young adults with intellectual disabilities&lt;ref&gt;Mechling, L. C., Gast, D. L., &amp; Fields, E. A. (2008). Evaluation of a portable DVD player and system of least prompts to self-prompt cooking task completion by young adults with moderate intellectual disabilities. The Journal of Special Education, 42, 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt; and to improve transition skills for elementary school students with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Cihak, D., Fahrenkrog, C., Ayres, K. M., &amp; Smith, C. (2010). The use of video modeling via a video iPod and a system of least prompts to improve transitional behaviors for students with autism spectrum disorders in the general education classroom. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, 12, 103-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most to least prompting==
The MTL prompting procedure (Cuvo, Leaf, &amp; Borakove, 1978) removes prompts by moving through a hierarchy from most restrictive to less restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The MTL prompting procedure begins with the most restrictive prompt, usually a physical prompt. After the learner has received reinforcement for completing the task with physical prompts, a less restrictive prompt is given (e.g., a partial physical prompt), and then an even less restrictive prompt (e.g., verbal prompt). Usually, a specific criterion is set for each prompt change (e.g., after three days of correct performance of the behavior with the use of a partial physical prompt, a verbal prompt will be used). If the individual fails to perform the behavior correctly with the less intrusive prompt, the instructor would return to a more intrusive prompt for a specified number of trials.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the discriminative stimulus for the behavior is the typically [[occurring stimulus]] (e.g., when lunch is finished, student independently goes to the sink to wash hands) or the direction (e.g., when teacher says "Class, it is time to sit in your desks", the student sits in his desk).

MTL prompting procedures have been most often used to teach chained tasks (e.g., hand washing) to learners with intellectual disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., &amp; Gast, D. L. (1984). Effective and efficient procedures for the transfer of stimulus control. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 4, 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt; but has been used to teach learners with mild to profound disabilities from infants to adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolery and Gast&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., &amp; Gast, D. L. (1984). Effective and efficient procedures for the transfer of stimulus control. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 4, 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that MTL prompting procedures should be used with [[Imitative learning|non-imitative learners]] who may not initially respond to less-restrictive prompts like models and may not be as efficient for imitative learners with mild or no disabilities.

==Constant and progressive time delay==
With CTD and PTD procedures, the same prompt is used throughout, and this prompt should ensure that the learner can give the correct response: It is a "controlling" prompt. The time delay prompt procedures are different from SLP and MTL procedures because instead of removing prompts by progressing through a [[hierarchy]], prompts are removed by delaying them in time. The progressive time delay procedure was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Touchette, P. E., (1971). Transfer of stimulus control: Measuring the moment of transfer. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 15, 347-354.&lt;/ref&gt; and the constant time delay procedure was developed as a more [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] procedure for teaching students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M. E., &amp; Gast, D. L. (1981). Applying the time delay procedure to the instruction of the severely handicapped. Journal of the Association for the Severely Handicapped, 6, 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt; CTD and PTD are systematic procedures that use the teaching strategy of waiting on a learner's response that has likely been used haphazardly for years.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using time delay procedures, a prompt is initially given immediately after the desired discriminative stimulus. For example, immediately after the teacher says "What is this?" while showing a picture of a dog, she gives the student the correct answer "dog". After a pre-specified number of trials (when teaching discrete tasks, usually this is a "session" comprising at least 10 trials), the prompt is delayed. In the previous example, the teacher would ask the question "What is this?" and would then wait a few seconds before giving the controlling prompt "dog". PTD delays the prompt in time gradually, so the teacher would first wait 1 second, then 2 seconds, etc. CTD delays the prompt in time only once, usually by 3–5 seconds.

''Example: Trial during an initial session of PTD or CTD to teach naming''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Prompt Level !! Teacher Behavior !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence
|-
| Prompted || "What is this? Dog." While showing a picture of a dog. (Waits specified time; e.g., 3 seconds) || Prompted Correct: "Dog" (provide reinforcer)|| Prompted Incorrect: "Cat" (ignore)|| No Response (ignore)
|}

During initial sessions, the learner is not given the opportunity to respond independently because the prompt is given immediately (0-second delay). However, in subsequent sessions, a learner is given an opportunity to respond independently because the prompt is delayed in time. The learner accesses reinforcement more quickly if s/he answers independently, but s/he is still reinforced for prompted responses.

''Example: Trial during a subsequent session of PTD or CTD to teach naming''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Prompt Level !! Teacher Behavior !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence !! Learner Behavior and Consequence
|-
| Independent || "What is this?" while showing a picture of a dog. (Waits specified time; e.g., 3 seconds)|| Unprompted Correct: "Dog" (provide reinforcer)|| Unprompted Incorrect: "Cat" (remind to wait for a prompt if s/he doesn't know the answer) || No Response (provide prompt)
|-
| Prompted || "What is this? Dog." While showing a picture of a dog. (Waits specified time; e.g., 3 seconds)|| Prompted Correct: "Dog" (provide reinforcer)|| Prompted Incorrect: "Cat" (ignore)|| No Response (ignore)
|}

PTD and CTD are similar except that the delay is gradual for PTD and immediate for CTD. For students who are not able to wait for a prompt when they are unable to independently perform a skill, PTD may be a better choice as a prompting strategy because it will decrease errors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M., Ault, M. J., &amp; Doyle, P. M. (1992). Teaching students with moderate to severe disabilities. Use of response prompting strategies. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| 4 || 3 sec || 3 sec

CTD and PTD have been extensively used and found to be effective with a variety of students with and without disabilities, across both discrete and chained skills, in both individual and small group settings, for learners from toddlers to adults. Like SLP, CTD has been used in conjunction with new technologies like SMART boards to teach children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mechling, L. C., Gast, D. L., &amp; Krupa, K. (2007). Impact of SMART board technology: An investigation of sight word reading and observational learning. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 37, 1869-1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, M. L., &amp; Mechling, L. C. (2009). Small group computer-assisted instruction with SMART board technology: An investigation of observational and incidental learning of nontarget information. Remedial and Special Education, 30, 47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simultaneous prompting==
A modification of the time delay procedures was presented by [[Schuster Time Delay Modification|Schuster]] and colleagues in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, A. N., &amp; Schuster, J. W. (1992). The use of simultaneous prompting for teaching expressive word identification to preschoolers with developmental delays. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 12, 247-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, J. W., Griffen, A. K., &amp; Wolery, M. (1992). Comparison of simultaneous prompting and constant time delay procedures in teaching sight words to elementary students with moderate mental retardation. Journal of Behavioral Education, 2, 305-325.&lt;/ref&gt; For this procedure, the same prompt is given during every session (a controlling prompt; similar to CTD &amp; PTD). However, the prompt is not delayed in time. During every instructional session, the prompt is immediately given to the student after the stimulus is presented (see 0 second delay sessions, above). The learner does not have a chance to emit an unprompted response during these sessions. However, immediately before each session, a probe session is conducted to test whether the child can emit an unprompted correct response. So, using an example similar to the one above, a teacher might present a picture and ask "What is this?" and then immediately give a prompt ("dog") during instructional sessions. Each day prior to instructional sessions, the teacher would ask "What is this?" but provide no prompts. This probe session is done to test whether the student has acquired the material. Instruction ends when the learner reaches a criterion level (e.g., 100% correct for 3 consecutive days) during probe sessions.

The primary advantage of [[simultaneous]] prompting, when compared with time delay procedures, is that a learner does not need to have the prerequisite skill of waiting for a prompt if he or she cannot independently emit the behavior. It is also a less complicated procedure for teachers to use because there are fewer response variations (e.g., unprompted corrects and unprompted incorrects are not possible) and fewer prompt variations (e.g., no need to vary prompt intrusiveness or delay).

Simultaneous prompting has been used with learners from three years of age through adulthood, and with learners with learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and learners without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, T. E., &amp; Schuster, J. W. (2004). Simultaneous prompting: A Review of the Literature. Education and Training in Developmental Disabilities, 39, 153-168.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study suggests that it may not be necessary to conduct probes every day,&lt;ref&gt;Reichow, B., &amp; Wolery, M. (2009). Comparison of everyday and every-fourth-day probe sessions with the simultaneous prompting procedure. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 29, 79-89.&lt;/ref&gt; but further research is needed to determine how frequency of probe sessions affects efficiency of the procedure.

==Summary and limitations==
All of the discussed response prompting procedures can be considered evidence based practices using the criteria suggested by [https://education.uoregon.edu/users/horner Horner] and colleagues in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, R. H., Carr, E. G., Halle, J., McGee, G., Odom, S., &amp; Wolery, M. (2005). The use of single-subject research to identify evidence based practice in special education. Exceptional Children, 71, 165-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolery, M. (in press). Studying response prompting procedures. In C. H. Kennedy (Ed.), Context, intervention, and disability: Essays in honor of Thomas G. Haring.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that response prompting is effective for learners from preschool through adulthood, in a variety of instructional contexts (e.g., embedded into large group activities, during small group direct instruction). In addition, studies have shown that a variety of instructional agents, including teachers, assistants, and peers with and without disabilities, can accurately use prompting procedures.

Little is known about the use of prompting procedures when procedural fidelity is low, as it may be in typical instructional contexts, though errors in some steps of the procedure may not impede learning.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbers, J. S. (1989). Effects of high and low procedural fidelity in the delay interval of the constant time delay procedure. Unpublished Master's degree thesis. University of Kentucky, Lexington.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies regarding typical errors made by instructors and the effects of the errors on acquisition of skills by learners are needed. In addition, prompting procedures have been primarily used to teach specific responses rather than response classes (e.g., conversational skills, social play skills). The relative effectiveness of response prompting procedures to teach response classes needs to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbers, J. S. (1989). Effects of high and low procedural fidelity in the delay interval of the constant time delay procedure. Unpublished Master's degree thesis. University of Kentucky, Lexington.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle''', or simply '''Shuttle-Derived Vehicle (SDV)''', is a term describing one of a wide array of concepts that have been developed for creating space [[launch vehicle]]s from the components, technology and infrastructure of the [[Space Shuttle program]].  SDVs have also been part of NASA's plans several times in the past.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, NASA formally studied a cargo-only vehicle, [[Shuttle-C]], that would have supplemented the crewed Space Shuttle in orbiting payloads. 

In 2005, NASA decided to develop the [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]] launch vehicles, based in part on highly modified Shuttle components to replace the [[Space Shuttle]], and enable exploration of the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=ares&gt;{{cite web | date = June 30, 2006 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/spacecraft/ares_naming.html | title = Ares: NASA's New Rockets Get Names | publisher = NASA | accessdate = November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tariq |last=Malik |url=http://space.com/news/060630_ares_rockets.html |title=NASA Names Rockets for Moon and Mars Missions |publisher=Space.com |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agency also studied a third such vehicle, the [[Ares IV]].  As of April 2011, NASA's replacement vehicle for the Space Shuttle is an SDV, the [[Space Launch System]] and multiple commercial vehicles. Over the course of the 2010 two different commercial vehicles were developed that use man-rated heavy lift launcher. In the meantime NASA has continued to use the Russian [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], which it also used during the Shuttle program as part of the International Space Station program.

== Concepts ==
{{See also|Magnum (rocket)}}
[[Image:In-Line SDLV 1978.jpg|thumb|right|1978 image of a Morton Thiokol-proposed In-Line Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle. ]]

SDV concepts were proposed even before the Shuttle itself began flying.  Proposed SDV concepts have included:
* Replacing the winged [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]] with an uncrewed, expendable cargo pod ("side-mount style" SDV)
* Removing the Orbiter and mounting an upper stage and payload atop the [[Space Shuttle external tank]] ("inline-style" SDV)
* Adding a large cargo container to the rear of the external tank, allowing launches of bulky materials (Aft Cargo Carrier)
* Replacing the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s (SRBs) with liquid rockets, including recoverable winged "flyback" boosters
* Creating vehicles from one or more Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, usually with some kind of an upper stage
* Removing the wings of an Orbiter at the end of its useful life, permanently attaching it to a Space Shuttle external tank, and launching the combination as a space station

Several such concepts are of particular note:

=== Shuttle-C ===
{{main|Shuttle-C}}
[[File:Shuttle-c launch painting.jpg|thumb|right|Shuttle-C art]]
Beginning in 1987, NASA actively pursued development of a vehicle called the Shuttle-C, an uncrewed cargo-only launch vehicle.  Shuttle-C would have replaced the winged Space Shuttle Orbiter with an expendable cargo module.  The module would have no wings, would not carry crew, and would not be recovered.  It was expected to carry up to {{convert|150000|lb|kg}} of payload to low-Earth orbit, compared to the Shuttle's nominal maximum of {{convert|65000|lb|kg}}.  Budget pressures, caused in large part by the [[Space Station Freedom]] project, resulted in the official cancellation of Shuttle-C in 1990.

=== National Launch System ===
{{main|National Launch System}}

The National Launch System was a study authorized in 1991 by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to outline alternatives to the [[Space Shuttle]] for access to Earth Orbit. The largest of three proposed vehicles was designated NLS-1 and used for its core stage a modified [[Space Shuttle]] [[External Tank]] with four Space Transportation Main Engines (STMEs) attached to the bottom of the tank. A payload or [[Multistage rocket|second stage]] would fit atop the core stage, and two detachable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid Rocket Boosters]] would be mounted on the sides of the core stage. Larger rockets than NLS-1 were contemplated, using multiples of the NLS-1 core stage.

=== DIRECT / Jupiter ===
{{main|DIRECT|Jupiter (rocket family)}}
[[File:Jupiter Family.jpg|thumb|Some envisioned Jupiter configurations, including crew and cargo variants]]

A recent proposal put forward as alternative to the NASA Ares vehicles is the "Direct Shuttle Derivative" or DIRECT architecture (unrelated to the "Mars Direct" plan), made by a grassroots group of engineers and other spaceflight enthusiasts.  As of May 2009, DIRECT revolves a notional series of vehicles, dubbed "Jupiter", that would use an [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] (ET) derived core stage powered by three or four [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs), plus a pair of standard four-segment SRBs.  All versions of Jupiter would use this "common core"; larger variants would include an upper stage.

DIRECT's proponents, which the group says includes dozens of NASA and industry personnel working anonymously, argue that development costs of this vehicle would be significantly lower than those for the Ares I / Ares V because of Jupiter's greater commonality with the existing Space Shuttle and its proven, human-rated systems. Further, because the same common core design would be used for both crew and cargo launches, savings would be realized over the dissimilar Ares I and Ares V vehicles through economies of scale, streamlined production and processing, and the like. The DIRECT Team claims that two Jupiter launches would be capable of exceeding NASA's delivered payload mass targets for an Ares I / Ares V lunar mission.

The group presented its concept to the [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee]] at a public hearing on 17 June 2009 in Washington, D.C.

In June 2009 at the same public hearing of the [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee]], Shuttle Program Manager John Shannon unveiled a preliminary concept for a new "side-mount" variant SDV.  NASA had begun studying this as an alternate for the [[Constellation program]].  &lt;ref&gt;Borenstein, Seth for Associated Press. [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2009-06-30-nasa-moon_N.htm "NASA manager pitches a cheaper return-to-moon plan"]. USA Today, June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept would be somewhat similar to the Shuttle-C, but with the Shuttle Orbiter replaced by a keel and boattail structure permanently affixed to the ET (as opposed to the detachable cargo-carrier on Shuttle-C).  Three SSMEs would be mounted in the boattail, essentially a simplified Orbiter boattail, and a large expendable fairing would encapsulate the payload. The entire vehicle, including SSMEs, would be discarded after launch. Shannon presented the concept for both cargo-only operation, and crewed missions using the Orion spacecraft and its [[launch escape system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Irene |last=Klotz |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31532912/ns/technology_and_science-space |title=NASA readies Plan B for moon rockets |publisher=msnbc.com |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/361842main_15%20-%20Augustine%20Sidemount%20Final.pdf "Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle"]. NASA, June 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While requiring far less development than the Ares vehicles, the basic configuration of the vehicle would in a 2-launch lunar architecture be less capable than the currently envisioned Ares I and Ares V mission scenario.

=== Mars Direct ===
{{main|Mars Direct}}

As part of the Mars Direct plan, [[Mars]] exploration advocate [[Robert Zubrin]] and other baselined an "inline" SDV concept developed by engineers at NASA and Martin Marietta.  The rocket consisted of a large upper stage and payload shroud mounted on top of the Space Shuttle external tank, and the Orbiter replaced by a simple engine pod.  The rocket would launch crews and vehicles directly to Mars.  The term "Mars Direct" reflected the idea of launching crews and habitats directly to Mars, without assembly or significant loiter in low Earth orbit. NASA's planned Ares V vehicle would superficially resemble this vehicle due to its "inline" setup, although the Mars Direct Ares used side-mounted Space Shuttle Main Engines and a core with the Shuttle External Tank's diameter for greater commonality with Space Shuttle infrastructure.

===Vision for Space Exploration===
{{main|Vision for Space Exploration}}
In 2005, NASA decided to pursue the design and construction of two new launchers, both based on technology and infrastructure developed for the US [[Space Shuttle program]].  These launchers would replace the Space Shuttle and supply the launch services necessary to fulfill the Vision for Space Exploration.  NASA has given the name "[[Project Constellation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Berger |url=http://space.com/news/060120_cev_overhaul.html |title=CEV Makeover: NASA Overhauls Plans for New Spaceship |publisher=Space.com |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the manned Crew Launch Vehicle project.

====Ares I====
{{main|Ares I}}
[[File:Ares I-X launch 08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ares I-X]] test launch in 2009]]
The [[Ares I]], to be used for crew launch, was to use as its first stage a [[solid rocket]] derived from the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]] (SRB). Whereas the Shuttle SRBs used four segments of solid propellant, the Ares I first stage would have used five. The shape of the central bore of each propellant segment was going to be modified to produce a faster burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2007/01/16/Navigation/200/211501/More+powerful+vehicle+'no+threat'+to+launcher.html |title=More Powerful Vehicle 'No Threat' To Launcher |publisher=flightglobal.com |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ares I would have been  topped by a new second stage  burning  liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

====Ares V====
{{main|Ares V}}

The unmanned Ares V vehicle, to be used to loft equipment for [[lunar sortie]] or [[lunar outpost]] flights into orbit to be met by human crews launched by the Ares I, superficially resembles many of the earlier proposed "inline" SDV concepts. NASA also has proposals of using the Ares V as the main booster to launch the manned [[Orion Asteroid Mission]] to an orbiting [[Near-Earth Asteroid]]. It consists of a cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and liquid oxygen (LOX) center stage flanked by two modified SRBs, topped by a new second stage based on the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket.  Previous "inline" SDV concepts, however, envisioned extensive use of Shuttle components such as the existing External Tank, or a "stretched" version thereof, as well as the Shuttle's existing main engines.  The Ares V will use stretched five or "five-point-five"-segment versions of the SRBs; a new, larger tank using Shuttle External Tank construction and insulation technology; and newer, cheaper expendable rocket engines (the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne]] [[RS-68]] engine, identical to those used on the [[Delta IV]] [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle|EELV]]) located at the base of the new tank.

====Ares IV====
[[File:NASA-Ares-logo.svg|thumb|Ares logo]]
NASA briefly studied a third, crew-capable, launch vehicle concept, called [[Ares V#Ares_IV|Ares IV]], which would use the Ares V first stage core and side-mounted SRBs, but with the planned Ares I second stage atop that to carry the Orion crew vehicle.  Advantages over the Ares I would probably include reduced development cost and time, common launch pad infrastructure and providing more than adequate lift for the Orion, while disadvantages would include increased per-launch cost over the use of a single SRB for the first stage.  According to NASA, potential uses of the Ares IV would have included sending the Orion spacecraft on early "shakeout" missions into lunar orbit only, as well as testing high-speed [[Skip reentry|"skip reentries"]] in which the capsule would skip in the Earth's atmosphere before landing, rather than making a relatively direct descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Berger |url=http://space.com/news/070126_ares_moon.html |title=NASA Studies Early Moon Shot for New Space Capsule |publisher=Space.com |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ares V Lite====
[[Ares IV#Ares IV|Ares IV]] was an alternative launch vehicle for NASA's Constellation program suggested by the [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|Augustine Commission]]. [[Ares V Lite#Ares V Lite|Ares V Lite]] was a scaled down Ares V.&lt;ref&gt;Coppinger, Rob. [http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/08/11/330800/will-constellation-live-on.html "Will Constellation live on?"]. Flight International, August 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madrigal, Alexis. [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/10/augustine-final-report/ "Human Spaceflight Ball in Obama’s Court"]. Wired, October 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It would use five [[RS-68]] engines and two five-segment SRBs and have a low Earth orbit payload of approximately 140 metric tons (309,000&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=HSF_review_Lite/&gt;  If chosen, Ares V Lite would replace the Ares V and [[Ares I]] launchers.  One Ares V Lite version would be a cargo lifter like Ares V and the second version would carry astronauts in the Orion spacecraft.&lt;ref name=HSF_review_Lite&gt;Augustine Committee 2009, pp. 38, 64-67, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space Launch System===
{{main|Space Launch System}}
[[File:Orange tank SLS - Post-CDR.jpg|thumb|Concept art for SLS, 2015]]
The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010]] envisions the transformation of the [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]] vehicle designs into a Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, the Space Launch System, both for crew and cargo. It is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. The initial capability of the core elements, without an upper stage, should be for between 70 tons and 100 tons into [[low-Earth orbit|LEO]] in preparation for transit for [[beyond low-Earth orbit|missions beyond low-Earth orbit]]. With the addition of integrated upper [[Earth Departure Stage|Earth departure stage]] the total lift capability of the Space Launch System should be 130 tons or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c111:3:./temp/~c111MS7qB3:: S.3729 -- National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberty===
{{main|Liberty (rocket)}}

A proposal put forth by [[Alliant Techsystems|ATK]] and [[Astrium]] was to use a five-segment version of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]] as a first stage and a liquid-core first stage of an [[Ariane 5]] as the second stage of a proposed rocket named [[Liberty (rocket)|Liberty]]. Such a design would cut costs and development time by using already-proven technologies. Liberty would have been 90 meters in length with a projected capability of carrying 20 metric tonnes to [[low earth orbit]]. It was projected that this rocket would be flight-capable by 2013 and human-certified by 2015. Some of the potential crew vehicles were being developed with funds from the [[Commercial Crew Development|Commercial Crew Development program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12394991 | work=BBC News | title=New rocket could lift astronauts | date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Liberty was not among the vehicles selected for funding announced on August 3, 2012 under the [[Commercial Crew Development#Commercial Crew integrated Capability|Commercial Crew Integrated Capacity]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity''''' is [[climate scientist]] [[James Hansen]]'s first book, published by [[Bloomsbury Press]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is about threats to people and habitability for life on earth from [[global warming]].

==Themes==
In the book, Hansen describes how the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s is changing our climate and argues that this is putting [[Earth]] into imminent peril. He suggests that millions of species, and humanity itself, are threatened.&lt;ref name=jh/&gt; The title of the book, ''Storms of My Grandchildren'', refers to the ferocious and stormy weather events that will occur in the next generation if fossil fuel use continues in the way it has.&lt;ref name = kk/&gt;

In Hansen's evaluation, the response of [[politician]]s to this crisis has mainly been "[[greenwashing]]", where their proposals sound good but amount to little.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mwva_7dPyAcC&amp;pg=PR9 ix–xii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen says that we immediately need to cut back [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] emissions such that atmospheric concentrations are stabilized at 350 [[Parts per million|ppm]] or less, in order to avoid environmental disasters for generations to come. He advocates prompt phaseout of coal plant emissions, plus improved forestry and agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=jh/&gt; Hansen supports a [[carbon tax]] returned to citizens as a dividend and rejects [[emissions trading|cap and trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2009|pp=221, 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supports [[nuclear power]] and rejects [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2009|pp=204, 230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6715">'''The Superhighway Summit''' was held at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s Royce Hall on 11 January 1994. It was the first public conference bringing together all of the major industry, government and academic leaders in the field. It began the national dialogue about the [[information superhighway]] and its implications.&lt;ref name="digitalcenter.org"&gt;[http://www.digitalcenter.org/webreport94/apph.htm UCLA Center for Communication Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028124642/http://www.digitalcenter.org/webreport94/apph.htm |date=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by Richard Frank of the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]], and Jeffrey Cole and Geoffrey Cowan, the former co-directors of UCLA's Center for Communication Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalcenter.org/pages/person_details.asp?intTypeId=3 USC Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by former UCLA Chancellor, Andrea L. Rich. The keynote speaker was Vice President [[Al Gore]].

==Background==
Thirty leaders in the area of communications presided over the event, which had an attendance of over 1800 people. It was broadcast live on [[C-SPAN]], [[E!]] Entertainment, and on the [[UCLA]] campus.&lt;ref name="digitalcenter.org"/&gt;

==Highlights==
The conference was given extensive coverage by Cynthia Lee and Linda Steiner Lee over two issues of ''UCLA TODAY'' (January 13 and 27, 1994). In the article "Gore Details Telecommunications Ideas," Lee and Lee gave an overview of the opening speech given by Vice President Gore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinton1.nara.gov/White_House/EOP/OVP/other/superhig.html Remarks at Superhighway Summit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They commented that "Vice President [[Al Gore]] outlined the [[Clinton Administration]]'s proposals to reform the communications marketplace and challenged his audience to provide links from the so-called [[information superhighway]] to every classroom, library, hospital, and clinic in the country by the year 2000 [...] 'We have a dream for...an [[information superhighway]] that can save lives, create jobs and give every American, young and old, the chance for the best education available to anyone, anywhere,' Gore said."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lee, Cynthia and Linda Steiner Lee.  "Gore Details Telecommunications Ideas." UCLA TODAY: 1&lt;/ref&gt; During his talk, "Ernestine" (the fictional telephone operator created by [[Lily Tomlin]] for ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'') made a surprise appearance. She complained "about the confusing and rapid transformation of communications technology. The Vice president laughingly assured Ernestine that the new technology would be simple to understand and available to all Americans."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

In the follow-up article, "CEOs Ponder Direction of Information Superhighway", Cynthia Lee stated that leaders at the conference noted that the future of the information superhighway was still uncertain. " 'Here we are, all ready to go cruising off down this new information superhighway,' said [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], Chairman of The [[Walt Disney]] Studios, during one of the panel discussions, 'and we really don't know where we are going. It's the first time we will be moving in a certain direction when we don't even know our final destination.' "&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lee, Cynthia. "CEOs Ponder Direction of Information Superhighway." UCLA TODAY: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey Cowan, the former co-director of UCLA's Center for Communication Policy, indicated that the key concept of the Information Superhighway was [[interactivity]], or "the ability for the consumer to control it, to decide what they want to receive, and the ability of the technology to respond to highly sophisticated consumer demands."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

The participants underscored the point that the major challenge of the information superhighway would lie in access, or the "gap between those who will have access to it because they can afford to equip themselves with the latest electronic devices and those who can't."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The STAR-TIDES project (Sustainable Technologies, Accelerated Research - '''Transformative Innovation for Development and Emergency Support''')&lt;ref name="star-tides.net"&gt;[http://www.star-tides.net/about Star-tides] Public domain text&lt;/ref&gt; is a global knowledge-sharing research network coordinated at the George Mason University (GMU). It is derived from a research project called TIDES which was originally a research effort for the Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) at the National Defense University (NDU)--part of the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name="star-tides.net"/&gt; The STAR-TIDES project promotes sustainable support to stressed populations – post-war, post-disaster, or impoverished, in foreign or domestic contexts, for short-term or long-term (multi-year) operations. The project provides reach-back “knowledge on demand” to decision-makers and those working in the field. It uses public-private partnerships and “whole-of-government” approaches to encourage unity of action among diverse organizations where there is no unity of command, and facilitates both inter-agency and international engagement.

==Strategy==

TIDES has three main goals, to:&lt;ref name="star-tides.net"/&gt;
* Leverage global network
* Promote integrated approaches
* Sustain through private sector

STAR-TIDES analyses begin with scenarios chosen by stakeholders. These include: 
# Stabilization &amp; Reconstruction in Afghanistan
# Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/ DR) in tropical regions
# Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) in the US and 
# Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) in Latin America and Africa.

Better collaboration and shared situational awareness among disparate stakeholders in these, and other, environments could improve readiness for, and responses to, disasters, instabilities, insurgencies, and food crises. Exercises, training and education are key to institutionalizing lessons learned, and historically events like the [[Strong Angel]] series of demonstrations have served as early sources of such lessons. Links are being forged among the Defense Department (DoD), U.S. State Department, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, other US government agencies, International Organizations, NGOs, Private Volunteer Organizations (PVOs), the business community and academia.&lt;ref name="star-tides.net"/&gt;

In lieu of the deployable, expensive systems that DoD often brings to these contingencies, STAR-TIDES focuses on seven infrastructures: shelter, water, power, integrated combustion and solar cooking, cooling/lighting/heating, sanitation and information &amp; communications technologies (ICT). Solutions need to be sustainable by local populations with the resources they’re likely to have available, and all information will be made available in the public domain via this website.&lt;ref name="star-tides.net"/&gt;

Once examples of low cost infrastructures are identified, “cross-cutting” solution sets (mixes of shel-ter, water, power, etc.) can be tailored to the needs of the local coalitions of business, government and civil society—those who will have to implement and sustain them on the ground. Not all solutions suit all scenarios—building partner nation capacity to stabilize southern archipelagoes calls for different answers than supporting mountain earthquake victims in winter. STAR-TIDES’ focus on the needs of “relevant populations” contributes to humanitarian assistance, the Millennium Development Goals, and peace building. It supports public diplomacy, meets National Security Strategy guidance, and improves the inter-agency’s ability to work together and interact with participants in civil-military missions, such as when implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS). In addition, all parties may save money by agreeing on which supplies could best be provided by governments, and which by non-government entities, commercial supply chains, or empowered individuals.&lt;ref name="star-tides.net"/&gt;

The '''UK Space Conference''' is an bi-annual conference devoted to [[outer space|space]], held in the United Kingdom. The conference hosts the [[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]] prizegiving dinner.

==History==
The UK Space Conference evolved out of the British Rocket Oral History Programme (BROHP) annual conference which had been running since 1998.  The rebranding of the conference in 2007 signalled a broadening of its remit.  The 2008 event included parallel sessions on Education, Research, Engineering and Astronomy as well as History.

Until 2010, the conference was held at [[Charterhouse School]] in [[Surrey]] in March each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090209014646/http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/7189.aspx] &lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2011, the conference has been held every two years.

The 2017 conference was held at the [[Manchester Central Convention Complex]] between 30 May and 1 June. Sponsors included the [[UK Space Agency]], [[ESA]] and [[DSTL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ukspace2017.co.uk/|title=UK Space Conference 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=ukspace2017.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
