'''Affirmative prayer''' is a form of [[prayer]] or a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] technique that is focused on a positive outcome rather than a negative situation. For instance, a person who is experiencing some form of illness would focus the prayer on the desired state of perfect health and affirm this desired intention "as if already happened" rather than identifying the illness and then asking God for help to eliminate it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== New Thought==
{{New Thought beliefs}}
[[New Thought]] spirituality originated during the 1880s and has emphasized affirmative prayer as an essential part of its philosophy.&lt;ref name= Albanese&gt;{{cite book |title=A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion |first=Catherine L. |last=Albanese |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=313 |year=2007 |isbn=0-300-11089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners among the various New Thought denominations  [[Religious Science]], [[Divine Science]] and [[Unity Church|Unity]] may also refer to this form of [[prayer]] by such names as "scientific prayer," "spiritual mind treatment" or, simply, "treatment."&lt;ref name="stuartgrayson.com"&gt;http://stuartgrayson.com/mindtreatment.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Within New Thought organizations, centers and churches, the foundational logic of this form of prayer is based on the belief that God is unlimited and plays no favorites, that God has created spiritual laws that are both as mysterious and as constant as scientific principles like [[gravity]], and thus, if one's prayer is correctly and diligently focused, it will be answered consistently.&lt;ref name="stuartgrayson.com"/&gt;

=== Religious Science, Divine Science, and Unity ===
{{Main|Religious Science|Divine Science|Unity Church}}
Affirmative prayer is called "Spiritual Mind Treatment" by practitioners of Religious Science.&lt;ref name=Vahle&gt;{{cite book|last = Vahle|first = Neal|title = Open at the top: The life of Ernest Holmes|publisher = Open View Press|year = 1993|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affirmative prayer with a Christian theme is a central practice of the [[Unity School of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring New Religions |first=George D. |last=Chryssides |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group| year=1999 |pages=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewish Science ===
{{Main|Jewish Science}}
In the early 1900s, some in the American Jewish community were attracted to the teachings of [[Christian Science]] and the [[New Thought Movement]], by the 1920s they were referring to their study by the term ''[[Jewish Science]]''.  A major figure in this movement was [[Morris Lichtenstein]] who together with his wife [[Tehilla Lichtenstein]], published the ''Jewish Science Interpreter'', a periodical featuring much of his own writing.  Lichtenstein found affirmative prayer to be particularly useful because, he believed that it provided the personal benefits  of prayer without requiring the belief in a supernatural God who could suspend the laws of nature.&lt;ref name= Umansky&gt;{{cite book |title=From Christian Science to Jewish Science: Spiritual Healing and American Jews |first= Ellen M. |last=Umansky |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=104 |isbn=0-19-504400-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein considered that affirmative prayer is a method that can access inner power that could be considered divine, but not supernatural. He taught that the origins of affirmative prayer can be found in the [[Old Testament]] book of [[Psalms]], and that affirmations, or affirmative prayer is best offered in silence.&lt;ref name= Umansky/&gt;

== Spiritualism==

The well-known [[Theosophist]], [[Spiritualist]], and New Thought poet [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]] popularized the power of affirmative prayer. After the death of her husband Robert Wilcox, she wrote that she had tried in vain to communicate with his spirit, but only after she composed and recited the affirmative prayer, "I am the living witness: The dead live: And they speak through us and to us: And I am the voice that gives this glorious truth to the suffering world: I am ready, God: I am ready, Christ: I am ready, Robert"{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} was she able to contact him by means of a [[Ouija board]], an event she described in her 1918 autobiography, ''The Worlds and I.''&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book |title= The Worlds and I |first=Ella Wheeler |last=Wilcox|publisher=George H. Doran Company, New York | year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoodoo==

Affirmative prayer is used by practitioners of [[African American]] [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]],&lt;ref name=Vanzant&gt;{{cite book |title=Tapping the Power Within: A Path to Self-Empowerment for Women |first=Iyanla |last=Vanzant |publisher=Hay House, Inc |year=2008 |isbn=1-4019-2188-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in conjunction with its opposite, which is called a ''prayer of removal''. In this [[folk magic]] application of the technique, the prayer of removal may be said during a [[waning moon]] or at [[sunset]] or at [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]] ("As the sun goes down, this disease is removed from my body") and the affirmative prayer may be said during a [[waxing moon]], at [[dawn]], or at [[high tide]] ("As the sun rises, this day brings me perfect health").&lt;ref name=hyatt&gt;{{cite book
|title=Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork (Five Volumes)
|author=Harry Middleton Hyatt
|publisher=Alma Eagan Hyatt Foundation
|year=1973
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanation for this application of affirmative prayer is that God has ordained laws of natural inflow and outflow, and that by linking one's prayer to a natural condition that prevails at the time, the prayer is given the added power of God's planned natural event.&lt;ref name=hyatt/&gt;

== Self-help ==

[[William James]] described affirmative prayer as an element of the American metaphysical healing movement that he called the "mind-cure"; he described it as America's "only decidedly original contribution to the systemic philosophy of life."&lt;ref name= Zaleski&gt;{{cite book |title=Prayer: A History |pages=322 |first= Philip |last=Zaleski |author2=Carol Zaleski |publisher=Mariner Books |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-77360-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What sets affirmative prayer apart from secular [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmations]] of the [[autosuggestion]] type taught by the 19th century [[self-help]] author [[Émile Coué]] (whose most famous affirmation was "Every day in every way, I am getting better and better") is that affirmative prayer addresses the practitioner to God, the Divine, the Creative Mind, emphasizing the seemingly practical aspects of religious belief.&lt;ref name=Inge&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of American Popular Culture |first=M. Thomas |last=Inge |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1989 |pages=1256 |isbn=0-313-25406-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the self-help and [[self-improvement]] movements{{who|date=November 2010}} advocate affirmative prayer in addition to or instead of secular affirmations. The choice is largely an individual one, based on the beliefs of the practitioner.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Ali Puli''', also known as '''Alipili''', is the attributed author of a number of 17th-century [[alchemy|alchemical]] and [[hermeticism|hermetic]] texts. However, his historical existence is doubtful, and [[A.E. Waite]] went as far as to describe the work attributed to him as "forgery pure and simple in respect of age and authorship [which] may be left to stand at its value in the matter of content."&lt;ref name=waite1&gt;{{cite book|pages=352–7|first=A.E.|last=Waite|title=The Secret Tradition in Alchemy, its development and records|publisher=K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd.|location=London|year=1926|oclc=1295967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is described as a [[Mauretania]]n [[Christianity|Christian]] of [[Asia]]tic extraction - also variously as an [[Arab]] (because he was said to have written in [[Arabic]]), and a [[Moors|Moor]].&lt;ref name=waite2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waite|first=A.E.|title=Some notes on the alchemist Alipili|journal=The Alchemical Journal |date=November 1914 |volume=3|issue=15 |pages=25–28|oclc=41963988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The most influential work attributed to him is ''Centrum Naturae Concentratum''. This work was purported to have been written originally in Arabic, though no Arabic version is extant. It was published in Dutch in 1694, and first translated into English by [[Edmund Brice]] in 1696. It is most noted for the following passage:

{{Quote|I admonish thee, whosoever thou art, that desirest to dive into the innermost parts of Nature, if that thou seekest thou findeth not within thee, thou wilt never find it without thee.&lt;ref name=alipili1&gt;{{cite book|year=1696|place=London|publisher=J.Harris|translator=E. Brice|title=Centrum naturae concentratum,or, The salt of nature regenerated|last=Alipili|oclc=13046722}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage is cited by Waite as evidence of a spiritual mystical tradition within alchemy, and has been widely quoted, notably by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Madame Blavatsky]] (who misattributes him as Abipili).&lt;ref name=isis1&gt;{{cite book|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=Isis Unveiled|page=617|volume=Vol.2|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasade/isis/iu2-12b.htm|place=New York NY|year=1972|origyear=1877|isbn=1-55700-135-9|publisher=Theosophical University Press Online Edition|oclc=310905077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage has been identified as a source of the [[Wicca]]n ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'' produced by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and later revised by [[Doreen Valiente]].&lt;ref name="serith1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm|first=Ceisiwr|last= Serith|title=The Sources of the Charge of the Goddess|accessdate =23 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928211209/http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest of the sources so identified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">'''Alpana''' or '''alpona''' ({{lang-bn|আল্পনা}}) refers to colourful motifs, sacred art or painting done with hands and paint which is mainly a paste of rice and flour on auspicious occasions in [[Bengal]].&lt;ref name="hindu27122017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Reviving-a-vanishing-folk-art-form-in-Bengal/article16083431.ece|title=Reviving a vanishing folk art form in Bengal|date=27 December 2016|work=The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu Group|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Alpana is derived from the Sanskrit ''alimpana'', which means 'to plaster' or 'to coat with'.  Traditionally, it was drawn by the women of the house before sunset. It is also a folk art in Bengal.

==Materials used to draw an Alpana==
Traditionally in Bengal , alpana is strictly white since the liquid paste used for alpana is rice powder mixed in water. Nowadays there is somewhat change in materials. Some fabric colours are used along with some glue to give some long life of the alpana. Alpana is although generally white some green, red forms also drawn. Traditionally the green colouration done by tree leaves and red colour by sindur . It is also done with the cotton thread soaked in the liquid paste.

==Uses of Alpana==
The art is known by different names in various parts of India and its use varies from region to region. The most common type of alpana all around India is [[Rangoli]], which uses colored sand to draw a design. The artwork is mainly done by women. They are conscious of the changing moods of the seasons and their creativity thus marks the changing cycle of the year.

Circular alpana is used as a holy pedestal during festivals such as the  Bengal,Saraswati puja (also referred to as [[vasant panchami]]) in Bengal and the Festival of Lights ([[Diwali]]). Items drawn with the technique include the sun, swastika, a rice stem, an owl, a ladder, a plough, the footprints of the goddess [[Lakshmi]], a fish, [[betel]], a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]], shankhalata (a snake)and some times just some abstract art to look beautiful .

The '''cantor''' ({{lang-he|חַזָּן}} ''[[hazzan]]'') in the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] is a clergy member who fills a diverse role within the Jewish community. Cantors lead worship, officiate at lifecycle events, teach adults and children, run synagogue music programs, and offer pastoral care. Cantors typically serve along with other clergy members, usually [[rabbis]] and occasionally additional cantors, in partnership to lead synagogue communities. The Reform cantor is a professional office with a prescribed educational path and professional organization. Cantors are "invested", a term borrowed from the idea of priestly [[Kohen Gadol#3His Vestments|vestments]], at the conclusion of study. "Investiture" confers the status of clergy to cantors, just as "ordination" does for rabbis.

As of 2011, a decision has been made to "ordain" rather than "invest" cantors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jta.org/2012/05/01/life-religion/whats-in-a-word-for-ordained-rather-than-invested-cantors-a-lot&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Union College==

===History===
Cantors in the North American Reform Movement are trained by the [[Hebrew Union College]] – Jewish Institute of Religion, School of Sacred Music. Located near New York University, the school offers the degree of Master of Sacred Music. Upon graduation, students receive formal ordination as cantor and then become eligible for membership in the American Conference of Cantors, the professional organization for cantors.

The School of Sacred Music was established in 1948 as a response to the "growing number of Reform congregations... prepared to employ a cantor if qualified individuals could be found,"&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 183&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Eric Werner. American synagogues in the mid-twentieth century were increasingly populated by second generation American Jews and Jews who viewed themselves as fully American. These communities could no longer relate to the European-trained cantors of their communal past. Judah Cohen observes that "the American cantorial school rose on the crest of both a revival and reevaluation of the cantor in the postwar era. Placing standards of cantorial knowledge and ability within a curricular framework," the School of Sacred Music "attempted to improve the cantor's religious standing."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception, the SSM was the first and only American cantorial school and sought to educate cantors to serve all American Jewish communities. While the school's founders, including the influential members of The Society for the Advancement of Jewish Liturgical Music, articulated their desire to create a cantorial school for all of American Jewry, particular attention was given to serving the Reform Movement's specific needs since the SSM's inception. HUC Dean Franzlblau conducted an exploratory survey of North American Reform congregations to gauge their "receptivity to cantor-educators in 1948."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of the study revealed that congregations would be most receptive to hiring well-trained cantors who were prepared to take on significant education roles in synagogues. The school's earliest curriculum responded to this need, training what were called "cantor-educators," or cantors with additional training in education. Cantorial certification was awarded after three years of study. The SSM has since undergone a significant evolution, first offering a bachelor's degree in four years, beginning in the fall of 1953),&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately conferring a Master of Sacred Music over the course of five years and culminating with investiture as cantor.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 184"&gt;Meyer, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

===The SSM today===
Today, the curriculum of the SSM includes liturgical music classes covering traditional [[Shabbat]], [[High Holiday]] and Festival [[Jewish prayer modes|nusach]], Chorus, Musicology, Reform Liturgy and Composition; Judaica and text classes such as Bible, Midrash and History; and professional development. Each student is assigned practica (mini-recitals) during the second, third and fourth years of school culminating with a Senior Recital (based on a thesis) during the fifth year.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted with permission from admissions documents to the School of Sacred Music&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, the institution was renamed the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music.&lt;ref name="urj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urj.org/about/union/pr/2011/?syspage=article&amp;item_id=57420|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602071547/http://urj.org/about/union/pr/2011/?syspage=article&amp;item_id=57420 |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=yes|title=HUC-JIR Names School of Sacred Music in Memory of Debbie Friedman - URJ|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Conference of Cantors==
Successful completion of the five-year School of Sacred Music program allows the newly ordained cantor membership in the American Conference of Cantors. This professional organization was established in 1953 by the early graduates of the SSM. The ACC currently serves over 450 cantors, offering conventions, newsletters, a listserve, and placement support.&lt;ref name="accantors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accantors.org/acc/node/25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006162853/http://www.accantors.org/acc/node/25|archive-date=2008-10-06|dead-url=yes|title=Who We Are &amp;#124; American Conference of Cantors|accessdate=2016-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACC is the professional organization of over 450 invested and/or certified cantors. Responsible for raising the professional standards of synagogue musicians, the ACC offers continuing education programs in conjunction with HUC-JIR School of Sacred Music and professional development opportunities for its members.
Members of the ACC have special expertise in the music of the Jewish people and serve synagogues and communities in pastoral, worship, programming, and educational roles. The ACC sponsors an annual convention and publishes Koleinu, a regular newsletter. It also offers placement services to its members and URJ congregations through the Joint Cantorial Placement Commission. The American Conference of Cantors is an affiliate of the Union for Reform Judaism.

==Women in the Reform Cantorate==
{{See also|Timeline of women hazzans|Timeline of women hazzans in the United States}}

In 1968, [[Sally Priesand]] became the first woman accepted for rabbinic training at Hebrew Union College. When Sally Priesand was ordained in 1972, she became the first female rabbi in America. Following the ordination, the Reform Movement of Judaism also began accrediting female music students for formal cantorial studies. In 1975, [[Barbara Ostfeld-Horowitz]] became the first woman to be ordained as a female cantor. Following graduation, she received pulpit placement and was inducted into the American Conference of Cantors, the professional organization for cantors. Ostfeld's investiture "marked an era of rapid demographic change" at the SSM, investing more than 179 female cantors.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on her profession, Ostfeld-Horowitz writes, “Women cantors have altered the way in which prayer is offered, heard, and received.” &lt;ref name="jwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/cantors-american-jewish-women|publisher=jwa.org|title=Cantors: American Jewish Women &amp;#124; Jewish Women&amp;#039;s Archive|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The evolving role of the cantor==
Prominent historian of the cantorate Mark Slobin explores the evolution of the office of the cantor in his work ''Chosen Voices:The Story of the American Cantorate''. Slobin outlines the journey of cantor as a sacred singer who would find employment by responding to positions posted in the newspaper in the 1930s to the formalized process of cantor/congregation matchmaking now in place.&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, 156&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the School of Sacred Music in 1948 marks the beginning of the cantor as a modern professional. At the inception of the SSM, the role of the cantor in the American synagogue was so narrow that the concept of the "cantor-educator" was created so that the newly minted cantors would have the additional skill set of "educator" so that they could serve congregations in a full-time capacity.&lt;ref name="Meyer, 184"/&gt; The school abandoned the notion of the "cantor-educator" as the perception of the modern cantorate expanded to include the duties now associated with the role of the full-time cantor. The role of today's Reform cantor includes inspiring others in the act of worship, serving as an authority on [[Religious Jewish music]], teaching all members of their community, helping to build strong Jewish identities, offering pastoral care, and officiating at life cycle events. Even though the cantor fills a diverse role in the modern Reform synagogue, the "heart of the cantorate" remains in "the sanctuary,"&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, 168&lt;/ref&gt; leading the Jewish people in prayer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7800">{{About|reminders of the Buddha|the architectural form|stupa}}

'''Cetiya''', "reminders" or "memorials" ([[Sanskrit]] ''caitya''), are objects and places used by [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] to remember [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Kalingabodhi jātaka, as quoted in John Strong, ''Relics of the Buddha'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004), 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Damrong Rajanubhab]], four kinds are distinguished in the [[Pāli Canon]]: "Relic [Dhatu], Memorial [Paribhoga], Teaching [Dhamma], and [[Votive offering|votive]] [Udesaka]."&lt;ref name="Siam)1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Damrongrāchānuphāp|authorlink=Damrong Rajanubhab|title=A History of Buddhist Monuments in Siam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd8KAAAAYAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Siam Society|pages=10, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griswold, in contrast, states that three are traditional and the fourth, the [[dharma|dhamma]], was added later to remind monks that the true memory of Gautama Buddha can be found in his teachings.&lt;ref name="Griswold1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griswold|first=Alexander B.|title=What is a Buddha Image?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIhuAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Promotion and Public Relations Sub-Division, Fine Arts Department|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these can be broadly called [[Buddhist symbolism]], the emphasis tends to be on a historical connection to the Buddha and not a metaphysical one.

==Sārīraka==
The sārīraka (Sanskrit [[śarīra]]) or dhātu cetiya, the remains of Gautama Buddha's body, are the category commonly considered "relics" today by Western observers, and were responsible for major forms of Buddhist art and symbolism, although they only constitute one of the three categories of reminders.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; Most frequently preserved parts of Buddha's body are tooth and bone, because these parts would remain after the rest of the body decayed. The [[relic of the tooth of the Buddha]] in Sri Lanka is the most notable site where a relic is visibly preserved, but hundreds of such sites were created, in the architectural form now called a [[stupa]]. In Thai, these stupas are called ''chedī'', retaining the second half of the phrase ''dhātu cetiya''; in Lao, they are called ''that'' after the first half.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Pichard, François Lagirarde, ''The Buddhist Monastery'' (École française d'extrême-orient, 2003), 171&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the stupa itself, sārīraka are used across the Buddhist world, in such quantity that not all could be legitimate; in this sense the sārīraka functions mainly as a symbol, with the importance of authenticity varying between cultures.

More relics of bone were discovered during archaeological excavations of a stupa built in what is now [[Peshawar]] by [[Kanishka]] of the [[Kushan Empire]] in the second century. In 1909, three pieces of bone (approx 1½ in. or 3.8&amp;nbsp;cm long) were found in a crystal reliquary in a bronze casket bearing an effigy of Kanishka and an inscription recording his gift.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Gandhāran Reliquaries" K. Walton Dobbins. ''East and West'', 18 (1968), pp. 151-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Is the Kaniṣka Reliquary a work from Mathurā?" Mirella Levi d’Ancona. ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 31, No. 4 (Dec., 1949), pp. 321-323.&lt;/ref&gt; They were removed to [[Mandalay]] in 1910 by [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto]], the [[Governor-General of India]], for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stūpa and Vihāra of Kanishka I''. K. Walton Dobbins. (1971) The Asiatic Society of Bengal Monograph Series, Vol. XVIII. Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally kept in a stupa in Mandalay but it has become dilapidated and is used as housing. The relics are being kept in a nearby monastery until funds can be found to build a new stupa to house the relics next to Mandalay Hill. The crystal reliquary holding the bones is now enclosed in a gold and ruby casket provided by Burmese devotees. The miniature gold stupa in which they were transported to Mandalay may be seen in the photo to the right of the modern ruby and gold reliquary.

The body parts of especially powerful monks are also called sārīraka, but these usually take on the form of bright jewels formed during the cremation of the body.

==Paribhogaka==
The paribhoga cetiya, things used by the Buddha, would seem at first to be a nonexistent category today. However, temples such as [[Tongdosa]] in [[South Korea]] claim to keep his robe and begging bowl.&lt;ref name="AHA"&gt;http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/koreasouth/busan/tongdosa.php&lt;/ref&gt; The category also includes all places the Buddha visited, so [[Bodh Gaya]] itself functions as a paribhogaka. The most common paribhogaka is the [[Bodhi Tree]],&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; which was transplanted across Southeast Asia; cuttings of the original bodhi tree still survive today in Sri Lanka.

[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|A [[Buddha footprint]], showing the Buddhist wheel and a larger-than-life foot.]]
Another extremely common paribhoga cetiya is the [[Buddha footprint]], which are found across the Buddhist world symbolizing the ground that Buddha walked on and the powerful size of his [[Dharmakāya|dhammakāya]]. Sometimes these footprints are also classed as udesaka, a representation of the Buddha's foot, or sārīraka, implying that the footprint was the foot itself.

==Udesaka==
[[File:Great Departure.JPG|thumb|left|Buddha's departure from the lay life as depicted at [[Gandhara]] in the early second century CE.]]
The final category, udesaka or uddesika cetiya, literally translates as "indicative reminders" or "votive objects", for example images of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; Udesaka do not have any physical connection to the Buddha but still serve as relics because they were created in his memory. Originally udesaka were secondary to paribhogaka and sārīraka, but with the influence of [[Greco-Buddhism]], [[buddharupa|statues of the Buddha]] were produced in great numbers, followed later by paintings and other images. The [[dharmachakra]] "wheel of the dharma", falls under this category as a reminder of Buddhist insight.

The conventional view has long been this meant that early [[Buddhist art]] was [[aniconic]]. However, this view has recently been the [[aniconism in Buddhism|subject of debate among specialists]].  There does not seem to have been any prohibition of creating images of the Buddha. Rather, creating images of the paribhogaka was regarded as a more fulfilling and meaningful symbol by the early Buddhists, evoking the discovery of Buddhist understanding ([[prajñā (Buddhism)|pañña]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huntington|first1=Susan L.|title=Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism|journal=Art Journal|date=1990|volume=49|issue=4|pages=401–408|doi=10.2307/777142|jstor=777142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnard|first=Jacob N|authorlink=Jacob N Kinnard|title=Imaging Wisdom: Seeing and Knowing in the Art of Indian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYYWbmmzikgC&amp;pg=PA77|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77924-4|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these scenes contained ''substitutes'' for the image of Buddha himself is currently under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huntington|first1=Susan L.|title=Aniconism and the Multivalence of Emblems: Another Look|journal=Ars Orientalis|date=1992|volume=22|pages=111–156|doi=10.2307/4629428|jstor=4629428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglas James Henning''' (May 3, 1947&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a Canadian [[magic (illusion)|magician]], [[illusionist]], [[escape artist]] and politician.

==Early life==
Henning was born in the Fort Garry district of [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, and began practicing magic at Oakenwald School in [[Fort Garry, Winnipeg|Fort Garry]], later moving to [[Oakville, Ontario]].

Doug's first experience in magic occurred by watching a magician on television when he was six years old. He asked his mother, "...what made the woman float in the air?"

"Magic," his mother said. 

Doug went on to say that he still remembered that feeling. The shy Doug wanted to re-create that same emotion he felt.

He performed his first show at the age of 14 at the birthday party of a friend and was inspired by his audience's spellbound reaction. Within a few months of placing an ad in a local newspaper, Henning launched a series of performances on local television in [[Toronto]], and as an entertainer at parties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

After Henning graduated high school, he stopped doing magic not wanting to do it for a living. He felt that there was only two kinds of magicians, "...magicians for kids, and magicians for nightclub acts. I didn't want to be either kind."

So, instead, he enrolled and became a student at [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and studied [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; and prepared for a medical degree. It was there that Henning met [[Ivan Reitman]] when he appeared in the 1968 Reitman-directed production of ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' in the role of Lonesome Polecat.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

To support himself during this time, he worked at the Toronto International Airport loading and unloading crates. He found the work to be too heavy and tiring. So with the help of a female assistant, he formed the partnership of Henning and Mars and performed at local bars and nightclubs.

==Career==
It was because of the shows he was giving at those nightclubs Henning decided to take a couple of years off from school. After graduating with honors with a degree in Science and psychology, Doug decided to take a couple of years off before entering medical school to continue with his magic. Henning and Mars successful performed with the top entertainers in Canada and traveled from one end of the country to the other.
 
He soon realized that he needed more theatrical training as well as the principles of magic. He applied for a grant with the Canada Council Arts Bursary in the theater division with a proposal that used the equation that magic plus theater equals art. Henning was awarded a [[Canada Council for the Arts]] grant for $ 4,000.&lt;ref name="LinkingRing"&gt;{{cite journal

   }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After being awarded the grant for a one year study of the art of magic, he studied mime under [[Adrian Pecknold]] as well as dance with a Canadian choreographer. He sifted through magic literature in the hopes of developing an all-around magic education in manipulation and being an illusionist.

He made a trip to the [[Magic Castle]] in Hollywood, California. The Magic Castle is a private club for magicians. He did an impromptu performance in the Wine Cellar and met resident magician and guru [[Dai Vernon]] known as "The Professor". The terms of the grant required Henning to study magic. Later on in the year, he got up the nerve to write the Professor and asked him if he could take lessons with him. Soon after, Vernon said yes. He did so, traveling to Hollywood to study with Vernon, then with another magic great [[Slydini]] and considered him his primary teacher of magic.&lt;ref name=genii&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Doug_Henning "Doug Henning Bio"]. Genii Magic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

With the intention of returning magic to its "glory days", Henning worked to perfect his craft. Garnering financial support, he developed a live theatrical show, ''Spellbound''. It was there that he contacted his college friend [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed Spellbound. Along with music by [[Howard Shore]] and co-starring actress [[Jennifer Dale]], a musical that combined a dramatic story and Henning's magic tricks.

Doug borrowed money for the project and spent $5,000 to build and design illusions. They set up a backers audition in Toronto. One man did find potential in the project and invested $70,000 into the show. It took a long time to work out a plot around Doug's illusion. So much so they only had time for two dress rehearsals neither of which was in the theater.

The show opened at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, where it broke box-office records. Henning reworked the show after catching the attention of New York producers, and took it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as ''[[The Magic Show]]'', with songs composed by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]. Debuting in 1974, the show ran for four and a half years, and earned Henning a [[Tony Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1975 |title=1975 Tony Award Winners |publisher=BroadwayWorld.con |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his Broadway success, Henning approached [[NBC]] with the idea of producing a television special. It was not until Henning suggested that he would reproduce live [[Harry Houdini]]'s famous and dangerous water-torture escape&amp;mdash;for the first time since Houdini performed it himself&amp;mdash;that the NBC executives signed him.

Henning spent the next eight months reworking his stage act for TV and practicing the water-torture escape act. More than 50 million viewers tuned in for the December 1975 broadcast of ''[[Doug Henning's World of Magic]],'' hosted by [[Bill Cosby]].

In 1977, Henning co-wrote a biography of Houdini, ''Houdini: His Legend and His Magic''.&lt;ref name="ISBN author"&gt;{{cite web

After a brief marriage, Henning divorced [[Barbara De Angelis]] in 1981 and married Debby Douillard in the [[Ladies' Dome]] in  [[Fairfield, Iowa]], in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;name="GrandIllusions" {{cite news

In 1983, Henning was the producer and star of the Broadway musical [[Merlin (musical)|''Merlin'']].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; In 1984, he began a solo show on Broadway called ''Doug Henning and His World of Magic.''&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

In 1985, a set of plush toys called "Doug &amp; Debby Henning's: WONDER WHIMS" were made by Panosh Place and copyrighted by Marvin Glass and Associates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} There were a total of six Wonder Whim characters.

In 1986 Henning sold his illusions to David Copperfield and other magicians to devote his time to Transcendental Meditation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===The ''World of Magic'' specials===
Doug Henning's first ''World of Magic'' special aired on NBC on December 26, 1975. Henning successfully performed the water torture illusion, although he did not break Houdini's time record. Produced by famed talk show host [[David Susskind]] and sponsored by [[Mobil]], the show ran live in the eastern United States without commercials. The event was the first of seven annual broadcasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually bring Henning seven&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/09/local/me-62603 "Magician Doug Henning Dies of Liver Cancer at 52"] ''Los Angeles Times''; February 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] nominations, including two back-to-back in 1976 and 1977 for ''World of Magic''.

In December 1976, ''Doug Henning's World of Magic II'' aired, again live and with only two commercial breaks, on NBC. The theme for this show was "Fire, Water and Air" and it was hosted by actor [[Michael Landon]], with guest star [[Joey Heatherton]]. The show included Henning vanishing an elephant and also included a segment with special guest magician [[Ricky Jay]].

On December 15, 1977, ''Doug Henning's World of Magic III'' aired live with guests [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Sandy Duncan]]; the hyped illusion was "Walking Through a Brick Wall".

On December 14, 1978, ''Doug Henning's World of Magic IV'' aired with the theme "A Magical Journey Through Time"; however, due to numerous problems that occurred during the telecast, this was the last special broadcast live.

On February 15, 1979, there was a broadcast of the fifth World of Magic special, which was taped at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]].

''Doug Henning's World of Magic VI'', taped at Osmond Studios in [[Orem, Utah]], is broadcast February 22, 1980 on NBC. Bill Cosby made his second appearance as special guest. [[Marie Osmond]] also appeared on the program.  Several revamped versions of illusions from earlier specials appeared.  The finale was an escape and reappearance featuring a huge [[Rube Goldberg machine]].

Henning's last TV special was ''World of Magic VII'' in 1982, which featured guest [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Caitlyn Jenner's name at the time was Bruce Jenner.&lt;/ref&gt; and several revamped versions of illusions from earlier specials.  The theme was Henning's magical house with rooms featuring magic from the past, present and future. In the show's finale, Henning creates the illusion of turning a black horse and a white horse into a [[zebra]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIS-c3iGUho&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of each ''World of Magic'' performance, Henning addressed the audience with the same monologue: "Anything the mind can conceive is possible. Nothing is impossible. All you have to do is look within, and you can realize your fondest dreams. I would like to wish each one of you all of life's wonders and a joyful age of enlightenment."&lt;ref name=goodbye&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218045811/http://www.goodbyemag.com/jan00/henning.html|url=http://www.goodbyemag.com/jan00/henning.html|title=Doug Henning: Magician Addled by TM|work=Good Bye!: The Journal of Contemporary Obituaries|date=January 2000|archivedate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other television appearances===
On December 13, 1977, Henning appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]''. While Henning performed illusions and chatted with host [[Johnny Carson]] and his other guests, he also plugged his new book on Houdini and announced that he was to marry [[Barbara De Angelis]] in a week.

In 1979 Henning appeared on ''The Crystal Gayle Special'', a variety program starring singer [[Crystal Gayle]] and featuring, along with Henning, [[B.B. King]] and [[the Statler Brothers]].

In 1980, Henning appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' where he performed several acts. He demonstrated [[chink-a-chink]] for [[Kermit the Frog]]'s nephew Robin, segmented a Muppet monster into four pieces (and put him together wrong), and performed [[Metamorphosis (illusion)|The Metamorphosis]]: a bit where he swapped places with an assistant who was locked inside a trunk.

In December, Henning appeared in ''The Osmond Family Christmas Special''. Starring the popular brother/sister act [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]] and guesting with such entertainers as [[Peggy Flemming]] and [[Greg Evigan]], at the time star of NBC's ''[[B.J. and the Bear]]''.

On February 13, 1981, Henning made his seventh appearance on ''The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson''. This show marked the first time Henning is Carson's first guest.

A version of ''The Magic Show'' was mounted in [[Toronto]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]]. The purpose of this show was to film in front of a live audience of several thousand people for broadcast on [[CBC Television]]. Henning came back to the show that had made him a star, and many changes were made for this new production.  Notably, most of the cast was changed, specifically the role of Cal, now performed by [[Didi Conn]]. Some script changes were made (the night club was now known as "Chez Manny" and the older, drunk magician was now named "Van Zyskin"). Some of the songs in the Broadway version were also changed (notably the risqué lyrics of Charmin's lament), or replaced totally, such as the song "Solid Silver Platform Shoes" (the once popular shoe style, by then out of fashion) which was replaced with "It's Gonna Take a Magician."  The film version of the production was only aired once on Canadian television, but released on DVD decades later.

Henning was featured in television commercials during 1984 to promote the [[Plymouth Voyager]] [[minivan]].

In 1993 he released a video for the Canada Natural Law Party made up of excerpts from his World of Magic specials along with newly recorded linking dialogue detailing Doug's philosophy of how the world's problems could be solved by meditation and yogic flying.

==Transcendental Meditation==

In the mid 1980s, Henning retired from the stage and had an increasing interest in [[Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; He received a Ph.D in the [[Transcendental Meditation#Science of Creative Intelligence|Science of Creative Intelligence]] from the Maharishi University in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let a smile be your platform|first=Jay|last=Stone|work=The Ottawa Citizen|date=October 23, 1993|page=E.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Henning and Transcendental Meditation founder, [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] drafted plans for a $1.5 billion-dollar project called "Maharishi Veda Land" near [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; that would "combine astonishing, unique visual and sensory effects, state-of-the-art 3D imagery, and ultra high-tech entertainment technology with his best and most original magic illusion secrets".&lt;ref name="Vedaland"&gt;[http://maharishivediccity.net/amenities/vedaland.html “Maharishi Veda Land”] maharishivediccity.net description of Vedaland project&lt;/ref&gt; Attractions were to include a building suspended above water and a journey into the heart of a rose but as of 2000 the project's status was uncertain.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Political career==

In 1992, Henning was a [[Natural Law Party]] candidate in the [[United Kingdom]]'s general election, contesting the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]] of [[Blackpool South (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool South]] in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/constituency/731/blackpool-south | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Blackpool South Labour: Gordon Marsden}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Canadian citizen, Henning qualified as a candidate under British electoral law, which allows candidates from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. He finished fourth of four candidates, polling 173 votes. He was senior vice president of the [[Natural Law Party of Canada]] ("NLPC"), and ran as the party's candidate for the former Toronto [[Riding (country subdivision)|riding]] of [[Toronto Centre|Rosedale]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], finishing sixth out of ten candidates.&lt;ref name =Gardner&gt;Gardner, Martin (May/June 1995).

==Death and legacy==

Henning died aged 52 in February 2000 at [[Cedars Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]] five months after being diagnosed with [[liver cancer]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |first= Jesse|last= McKinley |title=Doug Henning, a Superstar Of Illusion, Is Dead at 52. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/09/arts/doug-henning-a-superstar-of-illusion-is-dead-at-52.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 9, 2000 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His ashes were scattered in the [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Redondo Beach, California]].

[[James Randi]], a fellow Canadian magician and prominent skeptic, was critical of Henning's involvement with Transcendental Meditation (TM).&lt;ref name=RandiTM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/219-swift-september-19-2008.html |title=SWIFT September 19, 2008 |author=James Randi |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |date=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, Randi asserted in his blog, ''SWIFT'', that TM founder [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] had "caused the death of my friend Doug Henning".&lt;ref name=RandiTM2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/160-swift-february-8-2008.html |title=SWIFT February 8, 2008 |author=James Randi |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |date=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that Henning had immersed himself so thoroughly in TM that he "abandoned regular medical treatment for liver cancer, continued to pursue his diet of nuts and berries, and died of the disease."&lt;ref name=RandiTM2/&gt;

In 2005, a handwritten letter from Doug Henning to James Randi was placed for auction on [[eBay]], unbeknownst to Randi.  When Randi learned of it, he announced on his blog that the letter had been "stolen" from his files.&lt;ref name=stolen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/06/01/james-randis-letter.html |title=James Randi's letter from Doug Henning is stolen and on eBay |author=Doctorow, Cory |publisher=boingboing.com |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |date=June 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A week later, Randi wrote that he "managed to have the sale stopped" and that the letter was back in his possession but did not elaborate on further details of the controversy.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite web |title=SWIFT June 10, 2005 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/061005smug.html#10 |author=James Randi |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF)  |date=June 10, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiddler's Green''' is a legendary supposed [[afterlife]], where there is perpetual mirth, a [[fiddle]] that never stops playing, and dancers who never tire.  
In 19th-century maritime folklore it was a kind of afterlife for sailors who have served at least 50 years at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4s9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA168&amp;dq=Fiddler's+Green&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xBseTPX1M4mIOL3b8aQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Fiddler's%20Green&amp;f=false|title=The Sailor's magazine, and naval journal – American Seamen's Friend Society|date=February 1898|publisher=[[American Seamen's Friend Society]]|page=168|work=Life on the Ocean|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The slang dictionary: or, the vulgar words, street phrases, and "fast" expressions of high and low society]] |first=John Camden |last=Hotten |publisher= |year= 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Fiddler's Green appears in [[Frederick Marryat]]'s novel ''The Dog Fiend; Or, Snarleyyow'', published in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULABAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+dog+fiend%3B+or,+Snarleyyow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mdqO22cLF4&amp;sig=Y3iMTL7DLMZfM5lOjVj7RVWEMlc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LRseTKGPO4T-0gTQ1fmkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The dog fiend: or, Snarleyyow |first=Frederick |last=Marryat |publisher=G. Routledge &amp; Company |year=1856 |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as lyrics to a sailors' song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;At Fiddler’s Green, where seamen true
When here they’ve done their duty
The bowl of grog shall still renew
And pledge to love and beauty.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Herman Melville]] describes a Fiddler’s Green as a sailors’ term for the place on land “providentially set apart for dance-houses, doxies, and tapsters” in his novella ''[[Billy Budd, Sailor]]'' (published posthumously in 1924).

Fiddler's Green is the title of a novel by [[Ernest K. Gann]] published in 1950 dealing with the redemption of a petty criminal escaping the authorities by working as a seaman for his passage after stowing away.

The author [[Richard McKenna]] wrote a story, first published in 1967, entitled "Fiddler's Green", in which he considers the power of the mind to create a reality of its own choosing, especially when a number of people consent to it. The main characters in this story are also sailors, and have known of the legend of Fiddler's Green for many years.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, R. ''Casey Agonistes and other SF and Fantasy stories'', Pan Books Ltd., London, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiddler's Green is an extrasolar colony mentioned in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novels ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]].''

In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' comic book series, Fiddler's Green is a place located inside of [[The Dreaming (comics)|the Dreaming]], a place that sailors have dreamed of for centuries. Fiddler's Green is also personified as a character as well as a location in the fictional world; the former largely based upon casual associations of [[G. K. Chesterton]].
From November 12 to 14, 2004, a comic book convention promoted as "Fiddler's Green, A Sandman Convention" was held at the Millennium Hotel in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. Author Neil Gaiman and several Sandman series artists and others involved in the series' publication participated in the convention, with profits benefiting the [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]].

In [[George Romero]]'s 2005 film ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', the safe, upper-class high-rise condo building is called "Fiddler's Green."

In Rebecca Yarros's Hallowed Ground, at a military funeral at West Point, Josh says, with reference to his fallen friend Lt Will Carter, "See you at Fiddler's Green, brother".

== U.S. military==
The Cavalrymen's Poem, also entitled "Fiddlers' Green" was published in the U.S. Army's ''Cavalry Journal'' in 1923 and became associated with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |title= Fiddler's Green and other Cavalry Songs by JHS |journal= [[Cavalry Journal]]|date=April 1923 |pages= |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Halfway down the trail to Hell in a shady meadow green,
are the Souls of all dead troopers camped near a good old-fashion canteen,
and this eternal resting place is known as Fiddlers' Green.
 
Marching past, straight through to Hell, the Infantry are seen, 
accompanied by the Engineers, Artillery and Marine,
for none but the shades of Cavalrymen dismount at Fiddlers' Green.
 
Though some go curving down the trail to seek a warmer scene,
no trooper ever gets to Hell ere he's emptied his canteen 
and so rides back to drink again with friends at Fiddlers' Green.
 
And so when man and horse go down beneath a saber keen,
or in a roaring charge fierce melee you stop a bullet clean,
and the hostiles come to get your scalp,
just empty your canteen and put your pistol to your head
and go to Fiddlers' Green.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name has had other military uses. Many places associated with the U.S. Military have been named Fiddler's Green:

The '''first [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]''', during the [[Persian Wars]], began in 492 BC, and ended with the decisive Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king [[Darius I]] primarily in order to punish the city-states of [[Athens]] and [[Eretria]]. These cities had supported the cities of [[Ionia]] during their [[Ionian Revolt|revolt]] against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.

The first campaign in 492 BC, led by [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], re-subjugated [[Thrace]] and forced [[Macedon]] to become a fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia, after being a vassal to Persia as early as the late 6th century BC.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}} However, further progress was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of [[Mount Athos]]. The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, Darius sent ambassadors to all parts of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and [[Sparta]], both of whom executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.

The second Persian campaign, in 490 BC, was under the command of [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. The expedition headed first to the island [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], which it captured and burned. It then island-hopped between the rest of the [[Cyclades|Cycladic Islands]], annexing each into the Persian empire. Reaching Greece, the expedition landed at Eretria, which it besieged, and after a brief time, captured. Eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to [[Attica]], landing at [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], en route for Athens. There, it was met by a smaller Athenian army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]].

This defeat prevented the successful conclusion of the campaign, and the task force returned to Asia. Nevertheless, the expedition had fulfilled most of its aims, punishing Naxos and Eretria, and bringing much of the Aegean under Persian rule, as well as the full inclusion of Macedon. The unfinished business from this campaign led Darius to prepare for a much larger invasion of Greece, to firmly subjugate it, and to punish Athens and Sparta. However, internal strife within the empire delayed this expedition, and Darius then died of old age. It was thus left to his son [[Xerxes I]] to lead the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]], beginning in 480 BC.

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Laws I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in [[Halicarnassus]], [[Asia Minor]] (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As the British author [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to [[Renaissance]] Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.&lt;ref&gt;Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Ionian Revolt}}

The first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionist, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, p47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h58&gt;Holland, p58–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p203&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Persian king Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt; Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the Empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|expanding past the Danube river]], conquering [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]],{{sfn|Howe|Reames|2008|p=239}} and forcing [[Macedon]] to become a client kingdom to Persia; though the latter retaining an amount of autonomy up to 492 BC.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138, 342-345}} Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of Ancient Greece may have been inevitable.&lt;ref name = h58/&gt;&lt;ref name = fine276&gt;Fine, p276&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, 171–178&lt;/ref&gt; Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.&lt;ref name = h171/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].&lt;ref name = h154&gt;Holland, p154–157&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.&lt;ref name = h154/&gt; The other [[Ionia]]n cities, ripe for rebellion, followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.&lt;ref name = h154/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.98 V, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristagoras then appealed to the states of Mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.&lt;ref name = h157&gt;Holland, p157–161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darius detail on the Darius vase.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius the Great]] and its inscription (ΔΑΡΕΙΟΣ, top right) on the "[[Darius Vase]]"]]
The involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.&lt;ref name = h157/&gt;
In 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.&lt;ref name = V65&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.65 V, 65]&lt;/ref&gt; With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.&lt;ref name = V65/&gt; Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]], and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.97 V, 96]&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.&lt;ref name = h131&gt;Holland, pp131–132&lt;/ref&gt; In a daring response, Cleisthenes proposed to the Athenian people that he would establish a '[[democracy]]' in Athens, much to the horror of the rest of the aristocracy. Cleisthenes's reasons for suggesting such a radical course of action, which would remove much of his own family's power, are unclear; perhaps he perceived that days of aristocratic rule were coming to an end anyway; certainly he wished to prevent Athens becoming a puppet of Sparta by whatever means necessary.&lt;ref name = h131/&gt; However, as a result of this proposal, Cleisthenes and his family were exiled from Athens, in addition to other dissenting elements, by Isagoras. Having been promised democracy however, the Athenian people seized the moment and revolted, expelling Cleomenes and Isagoras.&lt;ref name = "h133"&gt;Holland, pp133–136&lt;/ref&gt; Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to establish democratic government. The establishment of democracy revolutionised Athens, which henceforth became one of the leading cities in Greece.&lt;ref name = "h133"/&gt; The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of Hippias, or any form of outside subjugation; by Sparta, Persia or anyone else.&lt;ref name = "h133"/&gt; 

Cleomenes, unsurprisingly, was not pleased with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army.&lt;ref name = h136&gt;Holland, p136–138&lt;/ref&gt; Cleomenes's attempts to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire.&lt;ref name = h142&gt;Holland, p142&lt;/ref&gt; Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him a '[[earth and water]]', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to.&lt;ref name = h142/&gt; However, they were severely censured for this when they returned to Athens.&lt;ref name = h142/&gt; At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens.&lt;ref name = V96&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23872;layout=;loc=5.95.1 V, 96]&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant.&lt;ref name = "h157"/&gt; Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia.&lt;ref name = V96/&gt; Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt.&lt;ref name = "h157"/&gt; The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.&lt;ref name = "h157"/&gt;

The city of Eretria also sent assistance to the Ionians for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean.&lt;ref name = "h157"/&gt; Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the [[Miletus|Milesians]] had given Eretria in a past war against [[Chalcis]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23875;loc=5.98.1 V, 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 [[trireme]]s to Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23875;layout=;loc=5.98.1 V, 99]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there, the Greek army surprised and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city.&lt;ref name = "h160"&gt;Holland, p160&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was as much as the Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.&lt;ref name = "h168"&gt;Holland, p168&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian naval victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p176&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East Aegean&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23933;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 31]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Propontis]], which had not been part of the Persian dominions before.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23935;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 33]&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

== 492 BC: Mardonius' campaign ==

[[File:Archers frieze Darius palace Louvre AOD487.jpg|thumb|Persian warriors, possibly [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], a frieze in Darius's palace at [[Susa]]. Siliceous glazed bricks, c. 510 BC, [[Louvre]]]]
In the spring of 492 BC an expeditionary force, to be commanded by Darius's son-in-law [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], was assembled, consisting of a fleet and a land army.&lt;ref name = VI43&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23945;layout=;loc=6.44.1 VI, 43]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the ultimate aim was to punish Athens and Eretria, the expedition also aimed to subdue as many of the Greek cities as possible.&lt;ref name = VI43/&gt;&lt;ref name = VI44&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23946;layout=;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from Cilicia, Mardonius sent the army to march to the Hellespont, whilst he travelled with the fleet.&lt;ref name = VI43/&gt; He sailed round the coast of Asia Minor to Ionia, where he spent a short time abolishing the tyrannies that ruled the cities of Ionia. Ironically, since the establishment of democracies had been a key factor in the Ionian Revolt, he replaced the tyrannies with democracies.&lt;ref name = VI43/&gt;

Thence the fleet continued on to the Hellespont, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to Europe.&lt;ref name = VI43/&gt; The army then marched through Thrace, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already been added to the Persian Empire in 512 BC, during [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|Darius's campaign against the Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p153&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], the Persians forced it to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire; they had been [[vassals]] of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138, 342-345}}

Meanwhile, the fleet crossed to [[Thasos]], resulting in the Thasians submitting to the Persians.&lt;ref name = VI44/&gt; The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as [[Acanthus (Greece)|Acanthus]] in [[Chalcidice]], before attempting to round the headland of [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name = VI44/&gt; However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, with the loss of 20,000 men.&lt;ref name = VI44/&gt;

Then, whilst the army was camped in Macedon, the [[Brygians]], a local Thracian tribe, launched a night raid against the Persian camp, killing many of the Persians, and wounding Mardonius.&lt;ref name = VI45&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23947;layout=;loc=6.44.1 VI, 45]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his injury, Mardonius made sure that the Brygians were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the Hellespont; the remnants of the navy also retreated to Asia.&lt;ref name = VI45/&gt; Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to Greece had been secured, and the Greeks had no doubt been made aware of Darius's intentions for them.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt;

== 491 BC: Diplomacy ==
Perhaps reasoning that the expedition of the previous year may have made his plans for Greece obvious, and weakened the resolve of the Greek cities, Darius turned to diplomacy in 491 BC. He sent ambassadors to all the Greek city states, asking for "[[earth and water]]", a traditional token of submission.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23950;layout=;loc=6.47.1 VI 48]&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of cities did as asked, fearing the wrath of Darius. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.&lt;ref name = "h178"&gt;Holland, pp178–179&lt;/ref&gt; This firmly and finally drew the battle-lines for the coming conflict; Sparta and Athens, despite their recent enmity, would together fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = "h178"/&gt;

However, Sparta was then thrown into disarray by internal machinations. The citizens of [[Aegina]] had submitted to the Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled by the possibility of Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene.&lt;ref name = h179&gt;Holland, pp179–181&lt;/ref&gt; Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king [[Demaratus]], who supported their stance.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23952;layout=;loc=6.49.1 VI, 49]&lt;/ref&gt; Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, with the help of the priests at [[Delphi]] (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin [[Leotychides]].&lt;ref name = h179/&gt; Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23975;layout=;loc=6.72.1 VI, 73]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23976;layout=;loc=6.73.1 VI, 74]&lt;/ref&gt; He then sought to rally the northern Peloponnesus to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him back to the city.&lt;ref name = h179/&gt; By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day.&lt;ref name = h179/&gt; Cleomenes was succeeded by his half-brother [[Leonidas I]].&lt;ref name = h179/&gt;

== 490 BC: Datis and Artaphernes' campaign ==
Taking advantage of the chaos in Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref name = h181&gt;Holland, pp181–183&lt;/ref&gt; An army was assembled in [[Susa]], and marched into [[Cilicia]], where a fleet had been gathered.&lt;ref name = h181/&gt; Command of the expedition was given to [[Datis]] the Mede and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]], son of the satrap [[Artaphernes]].

=== Size of the Persian force ===
According to Herodotus, the fleet sent by Darius consisted of 600 triremes.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231001;layout=;loc=6.96.1 VI, 95]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication in the historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]'s [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|invasion]] in 480 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.97 VII, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; it has been suggested either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships,&lt;ref name=Iranchamber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, p90&lt;/ref&gt; or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.&lt;ref name = L46&gt;Lazenby, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus does not estimate the size of the Persian army, only saying that they formed a "large infantry that was well packed".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.94 VI 94]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other ancient sources, the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], a near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000, while a later writer, the Roman [[Cornelius Nepos]] estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name = CNMIV&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Miltiades'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] both independently give 300,000, as does the [[Suda]] dictionary;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 305B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias IV, 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]] dictionary, entry ''Hippias''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Lysias]] assert 500,000; and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 600,000.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 240A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lysias, ''Funeral Oration'', 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = JII9&gt;Justinus II, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians generally dismiss these numbers as exaggerations.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt; One approach to estimate the number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, in addition to a probable 14 standard marines.&lt;ref name=VII184&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.184 VII, 184]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt;&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Kampouris (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000.&lt;ref name="Iranchamber"&gt;{{cite web| last=Stecchini |first=Livio |title=The Persian Wars |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars4.php |accessdate=2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h390&gt;Holland, p390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p164&lt;/ref&gt; However, the consensus is around 25,000.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt;&lt;ref name = h390/&gt;

The Persian infantry used in the invasion was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting.&lt;ref name = L23&gt;Lazenby, pp23–29&lt;/ref&gt; The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;&lt;ref name = h195/&gt; The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a [[corslet]] of [[scale armour]].&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently;&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; for instance, the [[Saka]] were renowned axemen.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp17–18&lt;/ref&gt; The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, [[Medes|Medians]], [[Khuzistan|Cissians]] and the Saka;&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon.&lt;ref name= VI113&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.113.1 VI, 113]&lt;/ref&gt; The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the ''coup de grace'' with spear and sword.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;

Estimates for the cavalry are usually in the 1,000–3,000 range.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt;&lt;ref name="IEE"&gt;Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους (History of the Greek nation volume Β), Athens 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian cavalry was usually provided by the ethnic Persians, [[Bactria]]ns, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p232&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet must have had at least some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships would be required to carry 1,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt;

=== Lindos ===
Once assembled, the Persian force sailed from Cilicia firstly to the island of [[Rhodes]]. A Lindian Temple Chronicle records that [[Datis]] besieged the city of [[Lindos]], but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Lind. Chron. D 1–59 in Higbie (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naxos ===

The fleet then moved north along the Ionian coast towards [[Samos Island|Samos]], before abruptly turning west into the Aegean Sea.&lt;ref name = h183&gt;Holland, pp183–186&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier.&lt;ref name = h183/&gt; Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; according to Herodotus, those that the Persians caught were enslaved.&lt;ref name = VI96/&gt; The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.&lt;ref name = VI96&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231002;layout=;loc=6.95.1 VI, 96]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Cyclades ===
[[File:Cyclades-Satellite.png|thumb|250px|right|Satellite image of the [[Cyclades]]. [[Delos]] is the small island directly to the bottom-left of [[Mykonos]]]]

Moving on, the Persian fleet approached [[Delos]], whereupon the Delians also fled from their homes.&lt;ref name = VI97&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231003;layout=;loc=6.96.1 VI, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Having demonstrated Persian power at Naxos, Datis now intended to show clemency to the other islands, if they submitted to him.&lt;ref name = h183/&gt; He sent a herald to the Delians, proclaiming: &lt;blockquote&gt; ''"Holy men, why have you fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It is my own desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So return now to your homes and dwell on your island."''&lt;ref name = VI97/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Datis then burned 300 talents of frankincense on the altar of [[Apollo]] on Delos, to show his respect for one of the gods of the island. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of Aegean on its way to Eretria, taking hostages and troops from each island.&lt;ref name = h183/&gt;

=== Karystos ===
The Persians finally arrived off the southern tip of Euboea, at [[Karystos]]. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to the Persians, so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231005;layout=;loc=6.100.1 VI, 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siege of Eretria ===
{{Main|Siege of Eretria}}

The task force then sailed around Euboea to the first major target, Eretria.&lt;ref name = VI100&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231006;layout=;loc=6.99.1 VI, 100]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst themselves as to the best course of action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians.&lt;ref name = VI100/&gt; In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city.&lt;ref name = VI101&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231007;layout=;loc=6.100.1 VI, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides;&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt;

=== Battle of Marathon ===
{{Main|Battle of Marathon}}

[[File:Battle of Marathon Greek Double Envelopment.png|thumb|250px|right|The Greek wings envelop the Persians]]

The Persian fleet next headed south down the coast of Attica, landing at the bay of Marathon, roughly {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Athens, on the advice of Hippias, son of the former tyrant of Athens, Peisistratus.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.102 VI, 102]&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians, joined by a small force from [[Plataea]], marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon.&lt;ref name = h187&gt;Holland, pp187–190&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Athens' greatest runner, [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides) was sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to Athens' aid.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; Pheidippides arrived during the festival of ''[[Carneia]]'', a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231011;layout=;loc=6.106.1 VI, 105]&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to hold out at Marathon for the time being, and they were reinforced by a contingent of hoplites from Plataea.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt;

Stalemate ensued for five days, before the Athenians (for reasons that are not completely clear) decided to attack the Persians.&lt;ref name = L59&gt;Lazenby, pp59–62&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective, routing the Persians wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line; the remnants of the Persian army left the battle and fled to their ships.&lt;ref name = "h195"&gt;Holland, pp195–197&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield;&lt;ref name = VI117&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231023;layout=;loc=6.116.1 VI, 117]&lt;/ref&gt; the Athenians lost just 192 men&lt;ref name = VI117/&gt; and the Plataeans 11.&lt;ref name="DRJ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Janice|title=Dr. J's Illustrated Persian Wars|date=August 2, 2005|url=http://lilt.ilstu.edu/drjclassics/lectures/history/PersianWars/persianwars.shtm|accessdate=2007-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205032506/http://lilt.ilstu.edu/drjclassics/lectures/history/PersianWars/persianwars.shtm|archivedate=December 5, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sunium to attack Athens directly,&lt;ref name = VI115&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.115.1 VI, 115]&lt;/ref&gt; although some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp191–194&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.&lt;ref name = VI116&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231022;layout=;loc=6.115.1 VI, 116]&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the Persians from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the Persians turned about and returned to Asia.&lt;ref name = VI116/&gt; On the next day, the Spartan army arrived, having covered the {{convert|220|km|mi|sp=us}} in only three days. The Spartans toured the battlefield at Marathon, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.120 VI, 120]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}
[[File:Greek-Persian duel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Greek hoplite and Persian warrior depicted fighting. 5th century BC]]

The defeat at Marathon ended for the time being the Persian invasion of Greece. However, Thrace and the Cycladic islands had been resubjugated into the Persian empire, and Macedon reduced to a subordinate kingdom part of the empire; since the late 6th century BC they had been vassals of the Persians, but remained having a broad scope of autonomy.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138, 342-345}} Darius was still fully intent on conquering Greece, to secure the western part of his empire.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p177&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Athens remained unpunished for its role in the Ionian Revolt, and both Athens and Sparta were unpunished for their treatment of the Persian ambassadors.&lt;ref name = "h202"/&gt;

Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = "h202"&gt;Holland, p202–203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp206–208&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp208–211&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition was finally ready by 480 BC, and the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] thereby began, under the command of Xerxes himself.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp240–244&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==

For the Persians, the two expeditions to Greece had been largely successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished.&lt;ref name = h202/&gt; It was only a minor setback that the invasion had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p200&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p201&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory at Marathon was a defining moment for the young Athenian democracy, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the battle effectively marks the start of a 'golden age' for Athens.&lt;ref name = h138&gt;Holland, p138&lt;/ref&gt; This was also applicable to Greece as a whole; "their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born".&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt;&lt;ref name = "jfc"&gt;Fuller, pp11–32&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]]'s famous opinion was that "the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the [[Battle of Hastings]]".&lt;ref name = "BDLI"&gt;Powell ''et al.'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Militarily, a major lesson for the Greeks was the potential of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious.&lt;ref name = "h194"/&gt; Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how devastating the hoplites could be in battle.&lt;ref name = "h194"&gt;Holland, p194–197&lt;/ref&gt; The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the [[Battle of Plataea]]), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.&lt;ref name = "h344"&gt;Holland, pp344–352&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands.&lt;ref name = L28&gt;Lazenby, p28&lt;/ref&gt; Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration.&lt;ref name = L28/&gt;

[[Nagasawa Kanaye]] (1852-1934) was Harris' California lieutenant, who acted as developer and manager of the community's {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of vineyards near Santa Rosa.  He also succeeded Harris and acted as leader of the brotherhood until 1934.

The main structure was a two-story mansion originally occupied by Harris, his wife, and a handful of utopians; it was also used for important guest lodging and common meals. It was called "Aestivossa" by Harris, which he said meant "high country of divine joy" in a language only he understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LeBaron|first1=Gaye|authorlink=Gaye LeBaron|title=Fountaingrove's strange history reads like fiction|agency=The Santa Rosa Press Democrat|date=July 18, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was commonly referred to as the manor house. Luxuriously furnished, it was in the center of a ring of eucalyptus trees and little gardens and a lily pond, but Harris maintained that his "real palace" was in "interspace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LeBaron|first1=Gaye|title=Angels watched over Santa Rosa's Fountaingrove|agency=The Santa Rosa Press-Democrat|date=Feb 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brotherhood guidelines, all of the structures in the Fountain Grove commune were built to be taken physically into the "Celestial Sphere."&lt;ref&gt;"Scholars have estimated that Harris believers numbered about 1,000 at the peak of his charismatic career," Fountaingrove History Folder, Gaye LeBaron Collection, Special Collections, University Library, Sonoma State University.&lt;/ref&gt; The manor house was demolished in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kagan |first=Paul |title=New World utopias: a photographic history of the search for community |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1975 |pages=21, 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutton |first=Robert P. |title=Communal utopias and the American experience: religious communities, 1732–2000 |publisher=Greenwood |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I72_6-4spGgC&amp;pg=PA125 |page=125 |isbn=0-275-97554-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern neighborhood==
Harris' community left a significant stamp on the history of Santa Rosa, and today that part of town is still called Fountaingrove, and a street, Thomas Lake Harris Drive, is named for Harris. The [[round barn]] that was part of the winery was a noted landmark in the area until its loss to fire in 2017.

The former Fountain Grove Winery buildings, now owned by Medtronic, are slated for demolition. The original winery was founded in 1882 and ceased operations in the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;"State of neglect." Santa Rosa Press Democrat. April 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the neighborhood is known to be home to some of the city's wealthiest residents. Fountaingrove and Skyfarm together comprise the most expensive neighborhoods in the city and the county as a whole.

The neighborhood was severely affected by the 2017 [[Tubbs Fire]], which destroyed many homes, along with the Fountaingrove Inn and the round barn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/news/article/2-big-wildfires-prompt-evacuations-in-Napa-County-12262945.php |title=1 dead as Wine Country fires burn hundreds of homes and businesses, force evacuations, close hospitals |date=October 9, 2017 |work=SF Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/7506978-181/fires-burn-across-sonoma-and?artslide=15 |title=Santa Rosa's historic round barn burns in the Fountaingrove area |date=October 9, 2017 |first=Kent |last=Porter |work=The Press Democrat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism_small}}

'''Hinduism''' is a minority religion in [[Korea]].  Through [[Buddhism]], it has also had an indirect impact on certain aspects of traditional Korean thought.  The [[Four Heavenly Kings]] that can be seen in Korean Buddhist temples originated from the [[Guardians of the directions#Lokapālas|Lokapālas]].

==North Korea==
There is no presence of Hinduism in North Korea.

==South Korea==

There are many Hindu temples in the Seoul region, like the [[Sri Radha Shyamasundar Mandir]] and the [[Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple]], located on Seoul's outskirts, approximately 2 hours from the city centre. [[South Korea]] is home to a small number of expats, including students and engineers, from countries such as [[India]] and [[Nepal]] many of whom are [[Hindu]]. [[Yoga]] has also gained increasing popularity in recent years.

Sri Radha Shyamasundar Mandir&lt;ref&gt;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2008/09/177_30805.html&lt;/ref&gt; is open daily, at specific times in the morning and evening. The temple offers various services to the mostly expat Hindu community, including children's classes, religious courses, festivals and ceremonies, such as weddings, as well as groceries for vegetarians.

Though [[South Korea]] is mostly secular, the range of religious beliefs displayed is quite broad. While [[Korean Shamanism]] shares some similarities with Hinduism, most religious people adhere to either Buddhism or Christianity, and there remains a strong [[Confucian]] presence.

'''John Darrell''' (born 1562 in or near [[Mansfield]], England) was an Anglican clergyman noted for his [[Puritan]] views and his practice as an [[exorcist]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=7168|title=Darrell, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exorcist==
Darrell was a [[sizar]] of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DRL575J|name=Darrell, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1586 he exorcised a girl in Derbyshire, and published an account of his work. In 1596–7 he conducted further exorcisms, mainly at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham]], where he was appointed curate by [[Robert Aldridge]], but also in Lancashire, where with others he exorcised demons from seven members of the household of Nicholas Starkey in [[Tyldesley witch|Tyldesley]] on 17 and 18 March 1597,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and in Staffordshire. Many were sceptical of these, especially when Darrell claimed that he knew of thirteen witches in the town.

==Prosecution==
Because of the intense public interest and the fierce arguments in Nottingham, [[John Whitgift]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], ordered an investigation. As a result, Darrell was accused of fraudulent exorcism. The prosecutor was [[Samuel Harsnett]], who was to end his career as [[Archbishop of York]]. Harsnett's views about Darrell were published in ''A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures'' in 1603. [[Shakespeare]] read it, and [[King Lear]] contains the names of devils, like Flibbertigibbet and Smulkin, from the book. Darrell always maintained that there was no fraud in his activities. What he wanted to prove was that Puritans were as capable as Roman Catholics in the matter of dispossessing evil spirits.

Darrell was deprived of holy orders and sent to prison, but released in 1599.

He began his career as a stone-mason, notoriously working by both day and night. He had been taught to play the dulcimer by a lodger at the age of about fourteen, but it was not until he was about thirty that he seriously began to study music, becoming both a performer and a composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maggie Humphreys|author2=Robert Evans|title=Dictionary of Composers for the Church in Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSLUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|year=1997|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-7201-2330-2|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works include a number of anthems and hymn tunes, such as "Gethsemane" (''Lleuad yr Oes'', 1827), which was arranged by Rowland Huw Pritchard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Davies|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-PRIC-HUW-1811.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Griffith|first=Robert David|accessdate= 2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khamtrul [[tulku]] lineage is part of the Dongyud Palden section of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] of the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==Origins==
The Fourth [[Gyalwang Drukpa]] [[Kunkhyen Pema Karpo]], head of the Drukpa Lineage, was one of the most celebrated masters in the 16th century. One of his most accomplished disciples, Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo (the First Yongdzin Rinpoche), had numerous disciples. Among those disciples, nine attained the level of realization where there is no distinction between the states of meditation and non-meditation (Gom-Med). One of these disciples was Ngawang Tenphel who became the 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche. Khamtrul means the reincarnation (tulku) from [[Kham]].

It is said that the appearance of the Khamtrul lineage was foretold by [[Padmasambhava]] (Guru Rinpoche), among other renowned Rinpoches. The Khamtrul Rinpoche is also said to be an authentic emanation of Padmasambhava and an emanation of King Gesar, the hero of the [[Epic of King Gesar|epic tale ''King Gesar'']].

==The lives of the Khamtrul Rinpoches==

===The First Khamtrul Rinpoche Ngawang Tenphel (1569–1627) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P875|title=karma bstan 'phel|last=|first=|date=|website=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
The 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche was born to Yab Khandro Bum and Yum Ri Nyima in Khotsa Rinchengang in Kham. From an early age, he took a liking to wearing the white cotton clothing worn by wandering yogis and would declare that he was a tokden of the Drukpa lineage. This earned him the nickname 'drukpa'. He was sent to Samten Lingpey Densa monastery, where – under the guidance of the master Sonam Gyaltshen – he was taught the preliminary studies and named Sonam Wangchuk.

While studying, he learned of a set of teachings taking place in central Tibet. At the teachings he heard of the teacher Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo (the 1st Drukpa Yongdzin Rinpoche), and travelled further to receive teachings from him. Upon meeting Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo, the young monk recognised him as his guru. He soon received the vows of monkhood from him and was given the name Ngawang Tenphel. It is said that he reached enlightenment very quickly under the instruction of Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo.

He returned to Kham soon afterwards, supposedly in the garb of a yogi (the same sort of plain white clothing he took to wearing years earlier). The people of Kham were reluctant in accepting the Rinpoche, however, and are said to have abused and beat him almost to death. As part of his work he was to have gone into China to further spread his message, but upon seeing a vision of the mountains of China, chose instead to remain in Kham. The various kings of Kham revered him as a spiritual leader, allowing him to mediate between them and help settle their disputes.

He continued his practice and his teaching until his death, including spending periods of up to three years on meditation retreat. He died at a retreat centre named Mishig Dorji Dzong gyi Drubney.

During his lifetime, the 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche spread his teachings widely in Kham, setting up retreat centers, educational institutes, monasteries and nunneries. There were almost two hundred branches of Khampagar Monastery in Kham region alone due to his work.

As a result of this, the rinpoche gained a great number of followers. The three main disciples of his were Zigar Sonam Gyamtso, the 1st Zigar Rinpoche, Trulshik Trinley Gyatso, the 1st Adeu Rinpoche, and Drugu Choegyal Gyatso, the 1st Choegyal Rinpoche. These three Dharma brothers were known as the three oceans. All three lineages still exist and the current lineage holders, especially Choegyal Rinpoche, continue to have a close relationship with the Khamtrul Rinpoche; the 9th Zigar Rinpoche resides at [[Rewalsar, India]], the 8th Adeu Rinpoche died in July 2007 (his next incarnation is yet to be discovered) and the 8th Drugu Choegyal Rinpoche helps Dorzong Rinpoche with the latter's monastery, known as Jangchub Jong, in Himachal Pradesh, India, and is rebuilding his monastery in Tibet.

===The Second Khamtrul Rinpoche Ngawang Kunga Tenphel (1639–1679) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W22140|title=Biographies of the predecessors in the Khams-sprul incarnation lineage from the great yogis of India through the Fourth Khams-sprul bstan-'dzin-chos-kyi-ni-ma|last=|first=|date=1985|website=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

===The Third Khamtrul Rinpoche Ngawang Kunga Tenzin (1680–1728) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P923|title=kun dga' bstan 'dzin|last=|first=|date=|website=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Ngawang Kunga Tenzin was responsible for the founding of Pal Phuntsok Choekor Ling monastery in Kham, more popularly known as Khampagar monastery, under the patronage of the King of Lhathog. The residence of the 9th Khamtrul Rinpoche Shedrub Nyima in [[Tashi Jong]], Himachal Pradesh, India is likewise known as Khampagar monastery, though its full name is Pal Phuntsok Choekor Ling. Ngawang Kunga Tenzin was well known for his scholarship, having written seventeen volumes of commentaries including explanations regarding the preliminary and actual practice of [[Mahamudra]].

===The Fourth Khamtrul Rinpoche Tenzin Chokyi Nyima (1730–1779) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P313|title=bstan 'dzin chos kyi nyi ma|last=|first=|date=|website=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Tenzin Chokyi Nyima wrote a commentary on Tibetan poetry, ''Khampai Nyen Ngag Drelchen'', which is said to be highly respected throughout Tibet. Inspired by his teacher, the Third Khamtrul Rinpoche, he founded the [[:fr:Khampagar|Khampa Gar]] Monastery in [[Karuo District|Chamdo County]], [[Kham]], which became the seat of the Khamtrul lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://treasuryoflives.org/en/institution/Khampa-Gar|title=Khampa Gar|work=The Treasury of Lives|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=G50|title=Khams pa sgar Monastery|last=|first=|date=|website=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Eighth Khamtrul Rinpoche Dongyud Nyima (1931–1980) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P848|title=don brgyud nyi ma|last=|first=|date=|website=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Born in 1931, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche was still quite young when the [[Battle of Chamdo]] began in October 1950. He remained in Tibet through the resistance movement in Kham and [[Amdo]] in June 1956, but when this was crushed, with serious ramifications for the citizens – including the monks and nuns – he realised he had to leave. In 1958 he left for [[India]] with a group of 16 monks and [[tulku]]s. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] would leave Tibet soon after following the failure of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]].

Initially the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche and his followers settled in [[Kalimpong]], [[West Bengal]]. There, a number of exiles from the area surrounding the original Khampagar monastery became affiliated with them. In 1969 this community moved west to [[Himachal Pradesh]] and settled in a village called Jekhli Beth. The village lies about {{convert|10|km}} east of [[Palampur]] and about {{convert|4|km}} west of [[Baijnath, Himachal Pradesh|Baijnath]] in the [[Kangra district]] of Himachal Pradesh. The move brought them just two hours from the Dalai Lama's residence in [[McLeod Ganj]]. They were granted {{convert|37|acre|m2}} of land and named it Tashi Jong, which is Tibetan for "Auspicious (or Happy) Valley".

The area is an historically holy part of [[Northeast India]] known as Ngalen gyi Yul.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

It is said that when he visited Tashi Jong, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche had a vision of the peaceful and wrathful [[Manjusri]]. In the vision, Tashi Jong and its surroundings were formed by a body, speech, mind quality and activity [[mandala]] of Manjusri. The rinpoche took this as a sign to settle there and to re-establish the Khampagar monastery.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The rinpoche rebuilt the Khampagar monastery, with the work being done by the lay community, monks and reincarnated lamas together. The rinpoche himself was a skilled artist and created many of the statues and paintings which can be seen in the monastery today. Tashi Jong has since flourished into a community of 150 monks, both in the monastery and the Khampagar Institute, a school teaching Buddhist philosophy which is connected to the monastery. There is also a lay community of around 400 people and a retreat centre for tokdens that houses about 15 yogis. The recreation of the monastery saw the resurgence of cham, or 'lama-dances', ritual dances by the monks, for which Tashi Jong has gained a high reputation (attracting a number of tourists, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, each year). Throughout their years in exile, the rinpoche and his followers kept up the observance of their [[Puja (Buddhism)|pujas]].

The Khamtrul Rinpoche is also well known as the root guru of [[Tenzin Palmo]], an English nun and only the second Western woman to be ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist [[śrāmaṇerī]] and, subsequently, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist women ever to be ordained as a full [[Bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] in 1973. The 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche gave her the Tibetan name Tenzin Palmo (she was originally called Diane Perry) and instructed her to build a nunnery near Tashi Jong. This request resulted in Dongyu Gatsal Ling (DGL) Nunnery, just a couple of kilometres from Tashi Jong. As of April 2008, work continues on the nunnery, but it is still a fully functional centre for the training of Buddhist nuns with 45 nuns there at the moment.

In later life, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche visited [[Bhutan]] on a few occasions, giving teachings and initiations. In 1980, at the age of 49, he died due to ill health. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, [[bodhisattva]]s can have multiple incarnations; the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche has two recognised reincarnations (with no disputes about the veracity of either).

===The Ninth Khamtrul Rinpoche Shedrub Nyima (1980–)===
The 9th Khamtrul Rinpoche was born in 1980 at Bomdila, [[Arunachal Pradesh]] . He was recognised as a reincarnation of the 8th by [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa ]] and by Dilgo Khyentse, who both predicted the same names of the parents. It was said that, in his youth, Shedrub Nyima was often seen in a position of meditation and that he inspired awe in those who saw him. He received training and instruction from various sources, including from Tokden Amtrin, a highly respected yogi at Tashi Jong (who died on 1 July 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innerfreedom.podbean.com/togden-amtrins-brief-life-story/ |title=Innerfreedom » Togden Amtrin’s Brief Life Story |publisher=Innerfreedom.podbean.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and from the late Adeu Rinpoche (the first incarnation of whom was a student of the 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche). Shedrub Nyima currently maintains his seat as the head of Khampagar monastery in Tashi Jong, the monastery founded by his predecessor. He is also the spiritual head of [[Tenzin Palmo]]'s [[gompa|monastery]], Dongyu Gatsal Ling..

===The Ninth Khamtrul Rinpoche Jigme Pema Nyinjadh (1981–)===
The Ninth Khamtrul Rinpoche Jigme Pema Nyinjadh was born in 1981, into the family of the Twelfth Gyalwang Drukpa, supreme head of the Drukpa Lineage. His root teacher is Gyalwang Drukpa with father Karma Dorjee and mother Chimey Yudon. He was recognized by the Dalai Lama, the Gyalwang Drukpa and the First Thuksey Rinpoche.
His basic studies were done at Druk Thupten Sangag Choeling Monastery in Darjeeling. There he spent his childhood and teenage years under the guidance of his root teacher, Gyalwang Drukpa. His other main teacher was Omze Sherab, a disciple of Trulshik Pema Chogyel, the enlightened Drukpa yogi who was also the teacher of the Eleventh Gyalwang Drukpa.
Khamtrul Rinpoche has completed the nine-year course in  Buddhist philosophy at [[Tango University]] in Bhutan, as advised by the Gyalwang Drukpa. Studying with him were his Dharma friends and heart friends, such as Gyelsey Trulku Rinpoche Mipham Tenzin Wangpo (who was the spiritual representative of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal after he died), the Second Thuksey Rinpoche, other tulkus and over 200 monks. Now Khamtrul Rinpoche is the representative of the Gyalwang Drukpa in all Asian countries and resides mainly in Nepal at Druk Amitabha mountain the seat of Gyalwang Drukpa the Head of Drukpa Lineage

==History==
Lighthouse Trails was founded in 2002 by David and Deborah Dombrowski from [[Silverton, Oregon]]. They decided to start the company as an [[apologetics]] outreach in hopes of exposing what they saw as the dangers of the [[Emerging church]] and the [[Contemplative prayer]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lighthousetrails.com/aboutus.htm About Us - LighthouseTrails.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their research project, named Lighthouse Trails Research, in turn received criticism from [[Moody Bible Institute]] regarding certain areas of belief in the emerging church movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moody Responds to Lighthouse Trails |url=http://www.moodyministries.net/crp_NewsDetail.aspx?id=7080 |quote=Moody Bible Institute recently became aware of certain assertions made about the Institution by Lighthouse Trails Research Project. |publisher=[[Moody Bible Institute]] |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223140931/http://www.moodyministries.net/crp_NewsDetail.aspx?id=7080 |archivedate=December 23, 2011 }} - Archived via [[Archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/6474712474.html|title=Converge Worldwide (Baptist General Conference)/Bethel University and Seminary Push Questionable Doctrinal Practices|date=Dec 16, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2015|publisher=ChristianNewsWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In spring of 2010 the company saw some major changes, including moving its headquarters to [[Eureka, Montana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lighthousetrailsresearch.com/blog/?p=4353 We've Moved - Lighthouse Trails Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of the Shepherd's [[Organic food|Organic]] Bible Verse [[Tea]] brand of products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshepherdsgarden.com/ The Shepherd's Garden]&lt;/ref&gt; and partnering with author Roger Oakland and his ministry Understand the Times to create the Missions for Truth project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionsfortruth.com Missions for Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; which helps widows and children by working with a group of pastors in western [[Kenya]].

The company advertised in the 2011 and 2014 editions of Christian Writers' Market Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stuart |first=Sally E. |date=December 27, 2010 |title=Christian Writers' Market Guide 2011: The Essential Reference Tool for the Christian Writer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xoP0yphgwVcC&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Tyndale House Publishers]] |isbn=9781414334264 |archiveurl=http://postimg.org/image/eumtwiqv9/full/ |archivedate=March 7, 2015 |page=129 |access-date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Jerry B. |date=January 31, 2014 |title=The Christian Writer's Market Guide 2014: Your Comprehensive Resource for Getting Published |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSucAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lighthouse%20Trails%20Publishing%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Tyndale House Publishers]] |isbn=9781414390512 |archiveurl=http://postimg.org/image/llrc3x1dz/full/ |archivedate=March 7, 2015 |page=88 |access-date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3770">'''Michael (Mike) Eigen''' (born January 11, 1936 in [[Passaic, New Jersey]]) is an American psychoanalyst and writer, perhaps best known for his willingness to allow for the role of [[mysticism]] in the therapeutic process.

==Biography==
Eigen was born in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eigen, ''The Electrified Tightrope'', ed. [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], New York: Routledge, 2018 [1993].&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Jeanette (née Brody), a teacher, and Sol, a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors: A Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Current Writers in Fiction, General Nonfiction, Poetry, Journalism, Drama, Motion Pictures, Television'', 1985, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
Eigen began by working with troubled children in his twenties, before moving on to treat adults. He took his B.A. (with honors) in 1957 from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and his PhD in 1974 from [[The New School]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://postdocpsychoanalytic.as.nyu.edu/object/faculty.michael.eigen Michael Eigen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors: A Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Current Writers in Fiction, General Nonfiction, Poetry, Journalism, Drama, Motion Pictures, Television'', 1985, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and trained as psychotherapist and psychoanalyst, before becoming one of the directors of the [[National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis]].

==Seminal ideas==
Described by [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]] as bringing with him “a new kind of moral seriousness”,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in P. Peay, ''America on the Couch'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Eigen is self-confessedly interested in “varieties of spiritual experience and how the psychological and spiritual fuse”, while remaining aware that such “Psyche-talk can sound weird, extravagant, crazy...arouse suspicion and rejection by our normative self”.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eigen, ''Contact with the Depths'' (2011) p. 23 and p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  He draws (among other psychoanalytic mystics)&lt;ref&gt;J. Belzen ed., ''Changing the Scientific Study of Religion: Beyond Freud?'' (2009) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; on the work of [[W. R. Bion]], particularly in his conception of O as the unknowable reality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eigen, ''Contact with the Depths'' (2011) p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Eigen saw early experience as marked by an innocent, uncomplicated relation to life, which could be lost in early infancy;&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (2003) p. x-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; he was also interested in [[Freud]]'s idea of the prevalence of the [[Narcissistic wound]] in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mark Stern, ''Elaborate Selves'' (2013) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Neo-revelationism''''' is a term for the beliefs of religious groups, especially Christian or [[Christianity-derived new religious movements|Christianity-derived]] who claim direct [[revelation]] beyond claims of [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration]] associated with the [[Christian Bible]] proper, but the term is also applicable relative to the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Ahmadiyya]] movement relative to mainstream Islam, and to [[Jewish Messiah claimants|Messiah claimants]] in a context of Judaism.
The English term is a translation of the German ''Neuoffenbarung''.

==Within the Christian church==
The Roman Catholic Church in principle accepts the possibility of "[[private revelation]]s", and recognizes certain instances (in practice mostly [[Marian apparition]]s) in the sense of ''nihil obstat'', i.e. the Church proclaims the possibility of a revelation being genuinely of divine origin without placing any positive claim to the effect. The Catholic Church agrees with Protestants in that public revelation ended with the death of the Apostle John.  Private revelation is not binding on Catholics and does not inform any new doctrine.  Some Protestant Reformers held different views, and taught that the miraculous gifts (including prophecy) ended with the death of the [[Apostles]] or soon thereafter. This doctrine, called [[cessationism]], is still held by conservative [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] (especially some [[Baptists]] and [[Calvinists]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}), who believe that the Bible is the final and complete revelation of God. By contrast, the [[Charismatic Movement]] emphasizes the claim that [[prophecy]] is available to contemporary believers.
 
[[Visions of Jesus and Mary]] have been common throughout the history of Christianity. The technical term of receiving revelations verbally, as opposed to in visions, is [[interior locution]].  For example,  [[Mother Teresa]] stated that she had been experiencing interior locutions, but that she preferred to remain private as to their contents. 

There are numerous examples of such instances in [[Christian mysticism]], during the medieval period and in the modern era e.g. [[Jacob Boehme]] and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], and later [[Jakob Lorber]] (1800–1864), [[Gottfried Mayerhofer]] (1807–1877), [[Bertha Dudde]] (1891–1965) and others. Proponents of neo-revelationism point to John 16:12–14, taking "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now" as an announcement of continued revelation outside of the biblical canon. 12th-century mystic [[Joachim of Fiore]] also pointed to Revelations 14:6 which presages an "everlasting gospel" yet to be taught in the future. Opponents, on the other hand, tend to point to the warning against [[false prophet]]s in Matthew 24.

==New religious movements==
Outside [[mainstream Christianity]], there have also been numerous [[new religious movements]] led by people either claiming to be directly inspired by Jesus, or indeed to [[List of people who have claimed to be Jesus|be Jesus returned]].

Other examples of notable neo-revelationist movements are the [[Unification Church]], [[Universal Life]],  [[Church of the Last Testament]] and  [[Uriella|Fiat Lux]]. A number of movements of [[Spiritual Christianity]] in tsarist Russia also fall under this category.

'''Nergis Mavalvala''' is a [[Pakistani Americans|Pakistani-American]] [[astrophysicist]] known for her role in the [[first observation of gravitational waves]].&lt;ref name="ScienceMag"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational wave researcher succeeds by being herself|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2012/06/just-herself|website=ScienceMag - AAAS|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the Curtis and Kathleen Marble [[Professor]] of [[Astrophysics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where she is also the Associate Head of the [[MIT Physics Department|Department of Physics]].&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nergis Mavalvala - MIT Department of Physics|url=http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/mavalvala_nergis.html|website=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellow]]ship in 2010.&lt;ref name="MacArthur Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nergis Mavalvala - MacArthur Foundation|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/35/|website=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoStraddle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nergis Mavalvala and Five Exceptional Stories Of Women In STEM|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/nergis-mavalvala-and-five-exceptional-stories-of-women-in-stem-329015/|website=AutoStraddle|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mavalvala is best known for her work on the detection of gravitational waves in the [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] (LIGO) project,&lt;ref name="ScienceMag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT2"&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Kavli Institute Directory - MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research|url=http://space.mit.edu/people/mavalvala-nergis|website=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheHindu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Making waves|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/read-about-nergis-mavalvala-who-made-the-news-last-week/article8280169.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she has also obtained prominent results on other [[physics]] problems that evolved out of LIGO: for example, she has performed pioneering experiments on [[laser cooling]] of [[macroscopic]] objects and in the generation of [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezed quantum states]] of light.

==Personal life==

Mavalvala was born in [[Lahore]] but primarily raised in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. She attended the [[Convent of Jesus and Mary, Karachi|Convent of Jesus and Mary]], Karachi, where she received her [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Level]] and [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]] qualifications. She moved to the [[United States]] in 1986 and enrolled at [[Wellesley College]], where she received a [[bachelor's degree]] in physics and [[astronomy]] in 1990. Before she graduated in 1990,  Mavalvala and her physics professor, Robert Berg, co-authored a paper in ''Physical Review B: Condensed Matter''. She also helped set up his lab. She went on to do her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in physics from MIT in 1997.

Born to a [[Parsi]] family,&lt;ref name="BusinessStandard"/&gt; Mavalvala was the younger of the two children. Mavalvala's parents highly valued their daughters' educational experiences, and encouraged Mavalvala to pursue higher education overseas. Mavalvala was always interested in math and science as a child, and believed that she was intrinsically good at it, in contrast to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Nergis Mavalvala: The Karachiite who went on to detect Einstein's gravitational waves. (2016, February 13). Retrieved March 25, 2018, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1239270&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mavalvala was raised in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith.&lt;ref name="TheHindu"/&gt; A [[lesbian]],&lt;ref name="ScienceMag"/&gt; Mavalvala and her partner have two children and reside in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in the United States. Mavalvala has extended family in Karachi and visited the city in 2010.&lt;ref name="ScienceMag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DAWN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nergis Mavalvala, Pakistan's unexpected celebrity scientist|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1239667/|website=DAWN|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Express Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Karachi bike repairman inspired Mavalvala|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1047678/karachi-bike-repairman-inspired-mavalvala/|website=Express Tribune|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet The Queer Woman Who Proved Einstein's Theory About Gravitational Waves|url=http://www.newnownext.com/meet-the-queer-woman-who-proved-einsteins-theory-about-gravitational-waves/02/2016/|website=NewNowNext|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview of Nargis Mavalvala|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vfceLjs3lU|website=YouTube|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being openly queer and Pakistani, Mavalvala gets a lot of questions based on her identity and roots. Mavalvala was not aware of her sexual preference until after college. She stands out as an immigrant of Pakistan who describes herself as "out, queer person of color." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;VenkatramanJun, V., PainApr, E., PainMar, E., NobeliFeb, I., &amp; PainSep, E. (2017, December 10). Gravitational wave researcher succeeds by being herself. Retrieved March 25, 2018, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2012/06/gravitational-wave-researcher-succeeds-being-herself&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mavalvala is frequently questioned about gender roles and how she was able to break through the barrier and was able to pursue the career of her choice. In an interview with the Pakistani newspaper [[DAWN (newspaper)|''Dawn'']] Mavalvala states, "I grew up in a family where the stereotypical gender roles were not really observed." She also speaks about the ability of individuals in Pakistan to break these gender roles and stigmas: "Anybody should be able to do those things. And I am proof of that because I am all of those things. With the right combination of opportunity, it was possible for me to do." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mavalvala is often viewed as a role model for aspiring female scientists of South Asian descent. As a young child Mavalvala was always involved in handy work, and was not bound to stereotypical gender roles in South Asian culture, due to the way her sister and she were raised. Mavalvala states that a lot of her success is accredited to good mentors in both the USA and Pakistan that encouraged her academic ability. In a television interview in 2016, Mavalvala stated that, "When everyone has access to education that's when all the other things come into place... [You've] got to do what gives you pleasure, gotta find a way to do it. People should just do what they enjoy most and i think for all of society whether it's in Pakistan or elsewhere we have to create opportunities for young girls to do what they're good at and do what they love to do must cultivate the sense of wonder in a child" &lt;ref&gt;Neo Tv Network - Exclusive Interview Of Nerjis Mavalvala [Television broadcast]. (2016, February 17). In News. Karachi, Pakistan: Neo TV.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
As a graduate student at MIT, she conducted her doctoral work under [[Rainer Weiss|Dr. Rainer Weiss]], where Mavalvala developed a prototype laser interferometer for detecting gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="TEDxCLE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nergis Mavalvala|url=http://www.tedxcle.com/nergis-mavalvala/|website=TEDxCLE|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduate school, she was a [[postdoctoral researcher]] and then a [[research scientist]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], starting her work with cosmic microwave background,&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan-born scientist played part in discovery of gravitational waves.

=== Discovery of gravitational waves ===

Mavalvala was among the team of scientists who, for the first time, observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves. Mavalvala has been working on gravitational waves since 1991.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was announced to the public on 11 February 2016. The detection confirmed a major prediction of [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref name="BusinessStandard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pak born scientist played significant role in discovery of gravitational waves|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/pak-born-scientist-played-significant-role-in-discovery-of-gravitational-waves-116021300386_1.html|website=Business Standard|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement of the observation, she became an instant celebrity scientist in her birthplace of Pakistan. Talking to the press she claimed that ''"we are really witnessing the opening of a new tool for doing astronomy."''&lt;ref name="Space.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's How It Felt to Discover Gravitational Waves (Kavli Hangout)|url=http://www.space.com/31991-ligo-gravitational-waves-interview.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InDaily"&gt;{{cite web|title=Einstein's gravitational waves detected|url=http://indaily.com.au/news/science-and-tech/2016/02/12/einsteins-gravitational-waves-detected/|website=InDaily|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview with Pakistani newspaper Dawn, after the detection of gravitational waves, she claimed that she was baffled by public interest in her research in Pakistan. She said ''"I really thought of what I want people to know in Pakistan as I have garnered some attention there. Anybody should be able to succeed — whether you're a woman, a religious minority or whether you're gay. It just doesn't matter."''&lt;ref name="DAWN" /&gt; In a statement by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Nawaz Sharif]], the Prime Minister praised Mavalvala, calling her a source of inspiration for Pakistani scientists and students aspiring to become future scientists. He also stated that ''"the entire nation is proud of her valuable contribution."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PM praises Pakistani scientist who played key role in discovery of gravitational waves|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1047451/pm-congratulates-pakistani-who-played-part-in-discovery-of-gravitational-waves/|website=Express Tribune|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  20 February 2016, [[Pakistan Ambassador to the United States|Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States]], [[Jalil Abbas Jilani]], conveyed the [[Government of Pakistan]]'s message of felicitation to Mavalvala for her outstanding achievement in the field of astrophysics. He also invited her to re-visit Pakistan, which she accepted.&lt;ref name="DAWN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PakistanObserver"&gt;{{cite web|title=PROF DR NERGIS MAVALVALA TO VISIT PAKISTAN|url=http://pakobserver.net/2016/02/20/prof-dr-nergis-mavalvala-to-visit-pakistan/|website=Pakistan Observer|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPakistan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jilani conveys PM's greetings to Pakistani-US scientist|url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/newsdetail/82836/1|website=Radio Pakistan|accessdate=25 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301052708/http://www.radio.gov.pk/newsdetail/82836/1|archivedate=1 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ET3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Would Nergis Mavalvala have made it had she stayed in Pakistan?|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/32394/would-nergis-mavalvala-have-made-it-had-she-stayed-in-pakistan/|website=The Express Tribune|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser cooling ===

Optical cooling of mirrors to nearly [[absolute zero]] can help eliminate [[Noise (signal processing)|measurement noise]] arising from thermal vibrations.  Part of Mavalvala's work focused on the extension of laser-cooling techniques to optically cool and trap more and more [[mass]]ive objects, both for the LIGO project and for other applications, such as to enable observation of [[Macroscopic quantum phenomena|quantum phenomena in macroscopic objects]].  Prominent results from her group in this area included cooling of a [[centimeter]]-scale object to a temperature of 0.8 [[kelvin]]s and observation of a 2.7-[[kilogram]] [[pendulum]] near its quantum [[ground state]].  These experiments lay the foundations for observing quantum behavior in human-scale objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berardelli|first1=Phil|title=Reflections of Absolute Zero|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2007/04/reflections-absolute-zero|work=Science|date=9 April 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Laser-cooling brings large object near absolute zero|url=http://news.mit.edu/2007/super-cool|work=MIT News|date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum states of light ===

Mavalvala has also worked on the development of exotic quantum states of [[light]], and in particular the generation of light in squeezed coherent states.&lt;ref name=LIGOnews11&gt;Dave Reitze, [http://ligonews.blogspot.com/2011/10/squeezed-light-experiment-glowing.html Squeezed Light Experiment a Glowing Success!], ''LIGO Laboratory News'' (28 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature13&gt;Ulrik L.

=== Lahore Technology Award ===
Mavalvala won the first Lahore Technology Award launched by [[Information Technology University]] on December 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.com.pk/18-Dec-2017/nergis-first-recipient-of-lahore-technology-award|title=Nergis first recipient of Lahore Technology Award|work=The Nation|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1586589/1-itu-convocation-mits-nergis-mavalvala-given-lahore-technology-award/|title=ITU convocation: MIT's Nergis Mavalvala given Lahore Technology Award - The Express Tribune|date=2017-12-18|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Awards==
In 2017, the Carnegie Corporation of New York honored Mavalvala as one of its Great Immigrants awards recipients. The awards go to "naturalized citizens who have made notable contributions to the progress of American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carnegie Corporation of New York |title=2017 Great Immigrants Honorees |url=https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/2017-great-immigrants-honorees-pride-america/ |website=www.carnegie.org |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Original Keetoowah Society''' is a [[Cherokee]] religious organization dedicated to preserving the culture and teachings of the [[Keetoowah Nighthawk Society]] (Cherokee:ᎩᏚᏩ ᎤᎾᏙᏢᎯ) in Oklahoma. Allogan Slagle, an historian of the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]], argues that the ''Original Keetoowah Society'' is the surviving core of the Cherokee religious movement originally led by [[Redbird Smith]] in the nineteenth century, whose aim was to preserve the culture and teachings of the Keetoowah in Oklahoma after the [[Indian removal]] of the tribes from the American Southeast. Slagle's argument that the group now known as ''The Original Keetoowah Society'' evolved from the early 20th century group known as the [[Keetoowah Nighthawk Society]] (or the Nighthawk Keetoowahs) appears in a lengthy treatise, ''Burning Phoenix'' (1993).

In the introduction to his 1993 work, ''Burning Phoenix: A Study of the Federal Acknowledgment, Reorganization and Survival of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma'', Allogan Slagle writes that, "In November 1899, the [original] Keetoowah Society convened in Tahlequah to pass resolutions critical of the Cherokee Council and the [[Dawes Commission]] particularly with regard to plans to dispose of Cherokee land and to create a roll without the consent of the Cherokee Nation."&lt;ref name = SlagleBurningPhoenix93&gt;{{cite book | author = Slagle, Allogan | date = 1993 | chapter = A Brief UKB Chronology [§1890s to 1901, Preparations for Statehood; The Cherokee Agreement, and the Dissolution of Indian Territory and Cherokee Nation, and Allotment; §1906-1934, The Growth of the Keetooway Governmental Organization Prior to IRA (The Indian Reorganization Act)] | title = Burning Phoenix: A Study of the Federal Acknowledgment, Reorganization and Survival of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, and of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's Efforts to Terminate the Band | page = 1 and preceding | location = Tahlequah, Oklahoma.  | publisher = Allogan Slagle and the Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians | url = https://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/xraca/documents/text/idc1-023663.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = March 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slagle further writes,
{{quote|They challenged amendments to the Constitution, and resolved to enroll only under protest. The Keetoowah in convention at Big Tucker Springs on 6 September 1901 decided to enroll with the Dawes Commission led to a final schism between Keetoowah factions. Redbird Smith left the meeting with eleven of his traditionalist supporters to resist enrollment actively, forming the Nighthawk Keetoowah.

Several hundred Keetoowah Indians, including several groups that started out as members of the Keetoowah Society and left with the Nighthawks in 1901, coalesced to form a number of secretive, traditionalist, exclusive factions. Most of these groups started near Gore, Vian, or Proctor, and adjoining areas. These groups were nascent within the Keetoowah Society as early as 1893, and derived from Goingsnake fire or various of the Four Mothers Nation fires. Like the Nighthawks, these groups generally refused until 1910 or later to accept the work of the Dawes Commission.

While they fully intended to maintain tribal government and functions regardless of the fate of the Cherokee Nation, the Keetoowah as a body officially acquiesced under protest to the effect of all the legislative provisions that would dissolve Cherokee Nation's government and allot Cherokee lands. They learned that they could not prevent the 1893 Act, the Dawes Commission enrollment, U. S. citizenship, the Curtis Act and the abolition of tribal courts, the Agreement with the Cherokee Nation of April 1, 1900, the 1906 Act and the virtual political dissolution of the corrupt Cherokee government as of 4 March 1906, presidential approval for all tribal ordinances affecting tribal or individual lands after allotment, and the allotment in severalty [the condition of being separate] of Cherokee lands.&lt;ref name = SlagleBurningPhoenix93/&gt;}}

Slagle references two court cases, ''Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. R.'' (1890) and ''Cherokee Nation v. Journeycake'' (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. R. 135 U. S. 641 (1890).{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cherokee Nation v. Journeycake, 155 U. S. 196 (1894).{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slagle argued that "John Smith, the most influential Nighthawk leader among Redbird Smith's sons, had lost virtually all credibility among Keetoowahs by the 1930s" for having supported [[Chester Polk Cornelius]], an [[Oneida people|Oneida]] who had "engaged them in speculative schemes", leading to splintering of the religious group into multiple factions. This resulted in two different and opposing ceremonial grounds (both run by members of Redbird Smith's own family - at Redbird's and Stokes Smith's grounds), as wall as the Goingsnake "Seven Clans"fire, the Medicine Springs Fire or Medicine Society, and the Four Mothers Nation.&lt;ref name = SlagleBurningPhoenix93/&gt;

== Keetoowah Society divergence ==
Other political factions arose among the Keetoowah. During the 1930s, the majority of Keetoowah factions supported the idea of reorganizing all the Keetoowah Cherokees in all the old [[clan]] districts as a united Band under the proposed 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]]. The Cherokees by Blood, representing all Cherokee descendants rather than Keetoowah alone, failed in 1932 to obtain standing as a party to the Cherokee claims litigation.&lt;ref name = SlagleBurningPhoenix93/&gt;

== Origin of name ==
James Mooney, in an extract of a report for the Bureau of American Ethnology, notes some background on the names by which the Cherokee peoples knew themselves, and were known by others, which included 
"Ani'-Kitu'hwagi", meaning "people of Kitu'hwa [Keetoowa]":
{{quote|The proper name by which the Cherokee call themselves is... Ani'-Yun'wiya' in the third person, signifying "real people," or "principal people"... The word properly denotes "Indians," as distinguished from people of other races, but in usage it is restricted to mean members of the Cherokee tribe, those of other tribes being designated as Creek, Catawba, etc., as the case maybe. On ceremonial occasions they frequently speak of themselves as Ani'-Kitu'hwagi, or "people of Kitu'hwa," an ancient settlement on Tuckasegee river and apparently the original nucleus of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author = Mooney, James | year = 1902 | chapter = Historical Sketch of the Cherokee | title = Myths of the Cherokees: Extract from the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology | location = Washington, DC | publisher = Government Printing Office | pages = 14–157, esp. 15 | url = https://archive.org/details/cu31924104080076 | format = PDF | access-date = March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Court clerk and reporter John Springston, a Keetoowah Society member from the Saline District before Oklahoma statehood, writing in 1928, also alludes to the use of the Keetooway name prior the [[Indian removal]] from the southeast, saying "Back in Georgia from whence the Cherokees originally migrated to the Indian Territory in 1838 and 1839, the old Keetoowah group...&lt;!--IS THIS INSERTION IN THE NEWSPAPER: ''(City of Keetoowah)''--&gt; was dying out as early as 1835."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Springston, John L. | date = December 28, 1928 | title =  | journal = Tulsa Tribune | location = Tulsa, OK | format = print edn. | page =  | url =  | access-date =  }}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The '''Pulahan''' (literally "those wearing red"; [[Plural|pl]]: '''Pulahanes'''; {{lang-es|Pulajan}}), also known as '''Dios-Dios''', are the members of a [[revivalism|religious revival]] of [[Philippine mythology|Philippine beliefs]] that developed in the [[Visayas]] prior to the [[Philippine Revolution]]. At its peak, it numbered around 10,000–15,000 adherents. The movement was severely crippled during the [[Philippine Revolution]] after the [[Philippine Constabulary]] took over patrols in [[Samar (island)|Samar]], when the [[U.S. military]] declared the island as "pacified".

==Beliefs==
Pulahanes practiced a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious revival centered mostly on [[Philippine mythology]] and [[Folk Catholicism]]. Individual beliefs include the [[Agimat|anting-antings]] as well as the revival of the [[babaylan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/bac/2006/11/04/oped/gil.alfredo.severino.think.economics.html |title=Severino: Cinco de Noviembre: Revolution or Hacienda? |publisher=Sun.Star Bacolod |date=2006-11-04 |accessdate=2010-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211152844/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/bac/2006/11/04/oped/gil.alfredo.severino.think.economics.html |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous fighting techniques such as [[eskrima]] were also utilized in the elite and ferocious combat style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olaa-naloeskrima.com/articles/DerobioEscrimaHistoryInfo.htm |title=Ola`a-Nalo Eskrima |publisher=Ola`a-Nalo Eskrima |date=1992-07-29 |accessdate=2010-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905195445/http://www.olaa-naloeskrima.com/articles/DerobioEscrimaHistoryInfo.htm |archivedate=2012-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They practiced a form indigenous [[martial arts]] called Derobio Eskrima and they specialize using a heavy, crescent-shaped [[bolo knife]] in their battles. Religious rituals using bottles of [[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oil]], prayer books such as the [[Bible]], consecrated ''[[anting-anting]]'', as blessings before battles.

[[United States|American]]s have described Pulahanes as notorious fighters and are experts in hand-to-hand combat. [[Battle cry|War cries]] were also common among their fighters. They have also been described as lacking in strategy due to their high casualty figures in battles such as the [[Massacre at Dolores]]. They were the subject of many laws passed during the early [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]] and have often been accused of [[banditry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwa-baptist-heritage.org/phil-Pas.htm |title=A History of Philippine Baptist Pastors 1898-2002 |publisher=Bwa-baptist-heritage.org |date=1983-08-29 |accessdate=2010-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914035730/http://www.bwa-baptist-heritage.org/phil-Pas.htm |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Religious Technology Center''' ('''RTC''') is an American [[non-profit corporation]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenoer|first=Jonathan |title=Cyberlaw: the law of the Internet|publisher=Springer|year=1997|page=62|isbn=978-0-387-94832-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Religious+Technology+Center%22+%22non-profit%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Religious%20Technology%20Center%22%20%22non-profit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was founded in 1982 by the [[Church of Scientology]] to control and oversee the use of all of the trademarks, symbols and texts of [[Scientology]] and [[Dianetics]]. Although RTC controls their use, those works are owned by another corporation, the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] which is [[doing business as]] L. Ron Hubbard Library, registered in [[Los Angeles County]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavote.net/CLERK/FBN_Search.cfm Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, as an example] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628174722/http://www.lavote.net/CLERK/FBN_Search.cfm |date=2007-06-28 }}, under "HUBBARD L RON LIBRARY"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/csi.htm Notice for Materials Copyrighted to Church of Scientology International]&lt;/ref&gt;

While exercising authority over the use of all Dianetics and Scientology materials, RTC claims that it is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Church of Scientology; that role is assigned to a separate corporation, the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI).
According to the RTC website, "RTC stands apart as an external body which protects the Scientology religion and acts as the final arbiter of orthodoxy" and its stated purpose is "to protect the public from misapplication of the technology and to see that the religious technologies of Dianetics and Scientology remain in proper hands and are properly ministered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html Section of RTC Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430043739/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |date=2006-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, [[David Miscavige]] has served as the organization's Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a 1993 [[memorandum]] by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the following information was provided to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] with regards to RTC's role and functions, its personnel and its income:&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Summary Description RTC-CSI.pdf|Summary Description of Churches of Scientology - RTC, CSI, CSFSSO, CSFSO, Other Churches, Missions, Field Ministers, CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151396 - 151398, Ex. 1-3, Washington, DC, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] RTC [...] owns the Scientology religious marks and advanced technology. It licenses the marks to CSI for sublicense to subordinate churches and directly licenses the advanced technology to appropriate churches. Through this structure RTC assures that practice of the Scientology religion within the ecclesiastical hierarchy under CSI's authority as Mother Church remains strictly orthodox, in accordance with the Scientology Scriptures. This church has a staff of approximately 50 individuals and an annual budget of approximately $ 6.6 million, based on its annual disbursements for the most recent year for which financial statements are available. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The RTC guarantees the “purity and workability of Scientology so far into the future,” thus engaging in programs to “restore, preserve, maintain and keep uncorrupted” the church’s "religious technology," according to Scientology spokesman Eric Roux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Scientology faces ban in Belgium | url = http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/scientology-faces-ban-in-belgium-amid-fraud-allegations/news-story/c8433d3f797edff382cfd35608e09d2b | work = AFP | publisher = news.com.au | date = December 12, 2015 | accessdate = March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first1=Eric |title=Cult Wars in Historical Perspective: New and Minority Religions |chapter=Scientology |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first=Eugene V. |publisher=Routledge |date=21 July 2016 |isbn=978-1472458124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate information==
[[File:Church of Scientology building in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.jpeg|thumb|Offices of the Religious Technology Center in Los Angeles]]
RTC was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on January 1, 1982 in Los Angeles, California by Terri Gamboa, [[David Mayo (Scientology)|David Mayo]], Norman Starkey, Phoebe Mauerer, Lyman Spurlock, Julia Watson, and [[David Miscavige]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Incorporation.djvu|Articles of Incorporation of Religious Technology Center, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Los Angeles, California, January 1, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, on June 15, 1982, the [[Articles of Incorporation]] were restated.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Restated-Incorporation.djvu|Restated Articles of Incorporation of Religious Technology Center, Bate Stamp: A 253931, Los Angeles, California, June 15th &amp; September 13th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 1986 they were amended in order to clarify the [[disposition]] of RTC's [[assets]] upon the [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of the [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Certificate-Amendment.djvu|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation - Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, April 8th, May 13th &amp; 14th, 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the official address of RTC is 1710 Ivar Avenue, Suite 1100, Los Angeles 90028, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building, while its main offices are on a big estate complex at 19625 Highway 79, Gilman Hot Springs 92383, California, as it was stated in a supporting document of Scientology's tax-exempt application to the IRS during the years 1992/1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Location-RTC.pdf|Response to Second Series of Questions, Church of Scientology International, Correspondence with Internal Revenue Service, Exhibit for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), June 29th, 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1993 the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at RTC: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of [[David Miscavige]], Gregory Wilhere, and Norman F. Starkey. The members of RTC's [[Board of Directors]] were at that time [[Mark Rathbun]], Warren McShane, and [[David Miscavige]]. RTC's [[President (corporate title)|President]] was [[Mark Rathbun]], its [[Secretary]] Warren McShane, and its [[Treasurer]] Barbara Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:CoS-Trustees-Directors-Officers-1993.pdf|List of Trustees, Directors &amp; Officers (of Church of Scientology Entities) - Ex. I-2, CSI Prod 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151380 - 151395, Los Angeles, California, September 21st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 5, 2001 RTC's corporate [[board of directors|officers]] were Warren McShane ([[Chief Executive Officer]]/[[President (corporate title)|President]]), Laurisse Stuckenbrock ([[Secretary]]), and Barbara Griffin ([[Chief Financial Officer]]/[[Treasurer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Domestic Nonprofit Corporation, Religious Technology Center, Secretary of State, State of California, Filed: Sacramento, California, February 9th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 14, 2008, RTC's official [[Agent (law)|agent]] has been the attorney Sherman D. Lenske from the law firm Lenske, Lenske &amp; Abramson ALC, Warner Atrium, 6400 Canoga Avenue, Suite 315, Woodland Hills 91367-2491.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C1063697 Entry for Religious Technology Center, California Business Portal of the Secretary of the State of California/March 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180322/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C1063697 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1993, RTC filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[:File:Application-501-RTC.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Religious Technology Center, Washington, DC, August 19th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted RTC's request for exemption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The granting of tax exemption to RTC and other Scientology corporations was preceded by years of continuous litigation between the IRS and the various entities of Scientology. According to former high-ranking executives, the Scientology organization had launched about 200 [[lawsuits]] against the IRS until 1991. During the same time, individual [[parish]]ioners of Scientology had initiated 2,300 [[Claim (legal)|claims]] against the agency, challenging the denial of tax deduction for their services at Scientology organizations. Late 1991, the dispute over Scientology's tax-exempt status began to resolve through high-level meetings between [[David Miscavige]] and the then [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]], Fred Goldberg, who encouraged a final resolution of the legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece Scientology: The Truth Rundown, Part 1 of 3 in a special report on the Church of Scientology, By Joe Childs &amp; Thomas C.

'''Main Corporate Activities'''

The Religious Technology Center (RTC) is the [[owner]] of certain [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]]. These marks and its related [[intellectual property]] form the "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" and the "Scientology applied religious technology".&lt;ref&gt;Copyright and trademark notice of the book "Dianetics" by L. Ron Hubbard, Los Angeles, California, (c) 1950, 2000, {{ISBN|0-88404-632-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology organizations, like "Churches," "Celebrity Centres" or "Missions," derive their income from the worldwide sales of this "technology" in form of courses, books, etc. to their members or to the general public. The organizations receive the right to sell the "technology" through license agreements with RTC as license holder and/or the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) as a sub-licensor. RTC and CSI in return derive their corporative income through the license fees, which in turn are obtained through those agreements. The licensing and its related actions are major corporate activities of the various Scientology-organizations.&lt;ref name="LicenseAgreement"&gt;[[:File:License-Agreement-RTC-CSI.pdf|"License Agreement - CSI (Marks)", License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology International, California, May 18th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Licensing of Trademarks &amp; Service Marks'''

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST)''

Shortly after its inception on January 1, 1982, RTC received on May 16, 1982 "the ownership, supervision and control" of the trademarks and service marks identifying "Scientology applied religious philosophy" and "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" by the originator and founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] through an "[[Assignment (law)|Assignment]] [[Contract|Agreement]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-RTC.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement was subject to an additional "Option Agreement" between Hubbard, RTC and another Scientology corporation, the "[[Church of Spiritual Technology]]" (CST). In two "Option Agreements" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the "Marks", the "Advanced Technology" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST.pdf|"Option Agreement (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, County of Los Angeles, California, May 10th, 1982/July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST-AT.pdf|Option Agreement (Advanced Technology-U.S.) - Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, California, May 10th &amp; July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the "Advanced Technology," which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential "Advanced technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-Agreement-LRH-RTC-AT.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Advanced Technology - US)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, May 10th &amp; 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these agreements RTC is to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the "financial money flows" of RTC during the year 1989, showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Analysis-Financial-Flows-RTC.pdf|"Religious Technology Center - Analysis of Financial Flows 1989", Exhibit I-9 for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), Bate Stamp: CSI Prod 11-4-93 151414]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI)''

RTC and CSI entered a license agreement on May 18, 1982, granting CSI, the new "Mother Church of Scientology," the right to use and sub-license certain of the trademarks and service marks. In return for the grant of the marks, the agreement gave RTC practically an unlimited corporate control not only over the activities of CSI but also over every organization that is a sub-licensee of CSI.&lt;ref name="LicenseAgreement"/&gt;

In particular the agreement stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] d) RTC shall have the right to monitor all operations of CSI and its related organizations, inspect all books, records and facilities, pertaining to use of the Marks and receive sample specimens and summaries of literature, publications and products using the marks, [...] e) RTC may, if it ever deems it necessary or advisable, send a corrective mission to any organization authorized the Marks to correct any deviation from the standards, specifications or guidelines of this Agreement, [... ]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally RTC and CSI signed on January 1, 1982 an "Organizational Covenant" granting CSI the right to deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its staff members.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSI-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology International &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Los Angeles, California, January 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology Western United States]] (CoSWUS)''

RTC and CoSWUS entered on May 23, 1985 an organizational covenant granting CoSWUS the right to sell and deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments of 6% of the monetary value of the "Advanced Technology"-services that are being delivered to the public from CoSWUS towards RTC.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSWUS-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Western United States &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably: Los Angeles, California, May 23rd, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]] (FSO)''

On January 1, 1982 RTC and FSO signed an organizational covenant with similar content to the covenant between RTC and CoSWUS.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSFSO-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Clearwater, Florida, January 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and other Scientology organizations''

RTC has entered over the years similar organizational covenants/license agreements with all the other "Advanced Organizations" (AOs) within the Scientology network. As all the AO's are integrated within a corporation, these agreements are formulated between RTC and these corporations, such as "Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Inc." from Netherlands Antilles,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:License-Agreement-RTC-FSSO.pdf|License Agreement - RTC/Licensee - License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Netherlands Antilles, June 2nd, 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc." from East Grinstead, England,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CoSRECI-AT.pdf|Advanced Technology Covenant RTC/RECI, Covenant between Religious Technology Center &amp; Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc., East Grinstead, England, November 18th, &amp; December 1st, 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Church of Scientology, Inc." from Sydney, Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CoSInc-AT.pdf|Advanced Technology Covenant RTC/Church of Scientology (Australia), Covenant between Religious Technology Center &amp; Church of Scientology Inc., Sydney, Australia, December 24th, 1988 &amp; March 16th, 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt; and with "Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe &amp; Africa" (AOSH EU).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-AOSHEU-AT.pdf|Example Covenant: "Advanced Technology Covenant - RTC/AOSH", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe &amp; Africa &amp; Religious Technology Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, December 1st, 1988, November 25th &amp; December 14th, 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC has registered its service marks and trademarks in various countries all over the world. Due to certain legal restrictions for religious corporations in certain countries, RTC founded the corporation "Inspector General Network, Inc." (IGN) on June 7, 1985, which functions as a "secular" representative for RTC in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Amendement-Incorporation-IGN.pdf|Notarized Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation, Inspector General Network, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State in the State of California, CSI Prod - November 22, 1993 - Bate Stamp: 237255, Los Angeles, California, June 7th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 RTC entered with IGN a so-called "Reversion and Reservation Agreement", which regulated the rights and obligations with regards to the Scientology and Dianetics trademarks of the "secular" organizations IGN and "World Institute of Scientology Enterprises, Inc." (WISE Inc.), a dormant Delaware corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Reversion-Agreement-RTC-WISE.pdf|Reversion and Reservation Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Inspector General Network, a California non-profit public benefit corporation, Los Angeles, California, June 17th, &amp; 18th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control of Other Corporations'''

At the time of RTC's filing for [[tax exemption]], RTC controlled four other corporations:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* ''"Inspector General Network" (IGN)''

IGN has served as [[legal]] [[agent (law)|representative]] for RTC and [[secular]] [[registered owner]] of RTC's [[trademarks|trade]] and [[service marks]] "in countries where contracts by religious corporations are not enforced". All [[corporate]] positions of IGN were held by members of RTC.

* ''"WISE, Inc."''

At the time of [[Scientology|Scientology's]] application for [[tax exemption]], WISE, Inc. has been a dormant [[corporation]] from [[Delaware]]. It had the same functions as IGN, prior to IGN's [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] in 1985.

* ''"RTC Australia"''

RTC Australia was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1986 as a regional office for RTC in Australia. It is a dormant [[corporation]] and has obtained [[tax exempt]] status.

* ''"Inspector General Network International AB" (IGN Int)''

IGN was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1992 in Sweden. The organization was founded to [[Registered trademark symbol|register]] [[Scientology|Scientology's]] [[trademarks|trade]] and [[service marks]] as a [[nominee]] for RTC in [[countries]], such as [[Libya]] or [[Iran]] "that do not recognize and will not do business with any United States entity".

==Organizational structure and management==
RTC stands hierarchically at the top of the [[Church of Scientology]] network. It has regulatory, corporate and [[ecclesiastical]] power over the policy and activities of all other Scientology management units, corporations, churches, missions and other organizations - with the only exception being the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]]. The position of RTC is notably visible in a drawing titled "The Command Channels of Scientology", which the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) and RTC provided to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status. It should be noted that the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] has not been included in this application.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:Command Channels CoS.jpg|The Command Channels of Scientology, Sketch depicting the hierarchical structure of the network of the Church of Scientology, the drawing was provided by CSI to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status in September 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its application for tax exemption, RTC described the internal structure of the organization as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] RTC's daily activities are carried out by a staff of 54 highly-trained individuals who function in their positions within the overall ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Scientology religion. Through receipt of reports and direct inspections, RTC ensures that those utilizing the marks are ministering orthodox Scientology religious services. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] The senior ecclesiastical position in RTC is held by David Miscavige, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board RTC and also as Inspector General. There are also several Deputy Inspector Generals who assist in the performance of RTC's
religious functions. There is a Deputy Inspector General who functions as Chairman of the Board RTC's second in command and
sees to the day to day functioning of the organization. There is a Deputy Inspector General who oversees internal matters in RTC
and another who is in charge of RTC's religious programs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The religious mission of RTC, protecting the orthodoxy of the technologies of Dianetics and Scientology, is carried out by two ecclesiastical divisions within RTC as described below. There is now one Inspectorate division which consists of four departments. The Department of Data receives reports and collects information from other organizations and Scientologists and collates, analyzes and distributes the information to all other departments that require it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Trademark Registration, Maintenance and Enforcement gets the religious marks of Dianetics and Scientology legally registered and sees to it that all users of the marks are properly licensed. It also investigates and, where necessary, prosecutes legal infringements of the marks."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Technical Policing inspects application of the Scientology Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of religious services by licensees and corrects misapplication where it is found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Organization Policing inspects the application of Scientology Scriptures as it pertains to governance of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and corrects misapplication where it is found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Authorization, Verification and Correction International ('AVC INT') is a division within RTC which is responsible for authorizing and verifying that the ecclesiastical programs, evaluations, strategies, promotional materials and issues as authored by CSI are in accordance with Scripture. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As previously mentioned, RTC is currently led by the "[[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] (of [[Board of directors|Directors]])" [[David Miscavige]], who has held this position since 1987. Miscavige has been in leading positions within the Scientology management since the early 1980s. Prior to being in his current position, Miscavige had been a member of the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] and had been instrumental in the internal purge of the [[Guardian's Office]], the former [[intelligence service]] and legal defense unit of the Scientology network. In 1982 he became the [[Chief Executive Officer]] and later the [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] of the [[for-profit corporation]] [[Author Services Inc.]] (ASI). Miscavige stayed on this position until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/Scien56.html The Man behind Scientology by Thomas C. Tobin, St. Petersburg Times, October 25, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the role and the position of the RTC within the structure of the Scientology network, David Miscavige declared in 1994:&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Declaration David Miscavige 1994.pdf|Declaration of David Miscavige, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Riverside County, February 8th, 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] Since March of 1987, I have been Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center [...]. RTC is not part of Church management, nor is it involved in the daily affairs of various Church of Scientology organizations or missions. RTC ensures that the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology, and the technology they represent, are properly used around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] 8 . RTC was formed with the specific purpose of seeing that the religion of Scientology was kept pure and true to the source materials of the religion. In fact, a major reason for its formation was to have such a Church organization that performed these functions in a capacity entirely separate from the actual management of the various Churches and Missions of Scientology. Not only is RTC not involved in the management of the international hierarchy of Scientology churches, but its very existence and performance of its true functions depends on the fact that it is not part of Church management. The authority of the Religious Technology Center stems from the ownership of the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] 11. Neither RTC nor I has any corporate authority over any Scientology church, including CSI. CSI is the Mother Church of the Scientology religion and has been since its inception in 1981. As such, CSI is responsible for the activities commensurate with such a role, including the ecclesiastical management of Churches, dissemination and propagation of the faith and defense of its activities, including external and legal affairs. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such representations stand in stark contrast to declarations of high-level ex-scientologists, who have worked in the Scientology management. Former CSI security officer Andre Tabayoyon and former RTC second-in-command Jesse Prince have stated in [[affidavit]]s and declarations that RTC and its chairman [[David Miscavige]] maintain de facto control of the entire Scientology network, including the [[Church of Scientology International]].&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;[http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/Media/video/legal/prince_erlich.pdf Affidavit of Jesse Prince] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101175401/http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/Media/video/legal/prince_erlich.pdf |date=2004-11-01 }} United States District Court, Central District of California, San Jose Division case no. C-95-20091 RMW (EAI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within that context, André Tabayoyon stated in a 1994 declaration the following about Miscavige's exertion of power as [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] and ultimate [[head]] of the global [[Scientology]] network:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_at.html Declaration of Andre Tabayoyon from April 4, 1994, Church of Scientology International, Case No. CV 91 6426 HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224143/http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_at.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 59. I have personal knowledge that Miscavige issues oral and written orders and instructions to Scientologists irrespective of either ecclesiastical lines of authority or corporate lines of is authority or demarcation. Miscavige uses this omnipotent authority to exercise personal control over any and all Scientology organizations whenever he elects to do so. I observed that in running the various Scientology organizations, Miscavige constantly crosses all corporate and ecclesiastical command lines without regard to the fact that there are numerous Scientology related corporations of which he is neither an employee, officer nor director. He does not have to be to control any Scientology organization. He is above all Scientology organizations as the ecclesiastical head of Scientology, COB RTC and Commander of the Sea Org. In this capacity, Miscavige acts as the managing agent of each Scientology organization."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 61. I personally observed Miscavige take over this position of ultimate power over all of Scientology after Hubbard died. I observed Miscavige when he was COB RTC ordering into Golden Era Studios ("Gold"), a CSI division, and ordering into the Commodore's Messenger Organization International ("CMO Int"), another CSI division planetary dissemination organization, etc. Both of these Sea Org units are corporately part of CSI. RTC, CMO Int and Gold are all located at a large compound outside of Hemet, California. It is called Gold. As I learned, the Scientology corporate structure was only for the benefit of the outside "wog" world. It didn't have any bearing on how Scientology operated."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"62. When Hubbard was alive it was common knowledge and I also observed it personally that he was in direct control, via Miscavige and [[Pat Broeker]], of CMO Int and Gold, and the rest of Scientology. After Hubbard died[,] Miscavige ousted Pat Broeker and Vicki Aznaran, who were then in control of Scientology. After that, it was my experience that Miscavige had complete control over Scientology just as Hubbard had when he was alive. Miscavige took over Hubbard's place as managing agent of all Scientology organizations. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mark Rathbun|Mark ("Marty") Rathbun]], [[David Miscavige]] and [[Warren McShane]], Deputy Inspector General for Legal Affairs formed for several years the above-mentioned "Board of Directors RTC".&lt;ref name="rtc.org"&gt;Religious Technology Center, Board of Directors, (c) 1999–2001 Religious Technology Center, http://www.rtc.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2008, all references to both Rathbun and McShane have disappeared from the RTC website, and their names or pictures have also been removed from other official Scientology websites. Though Miscavige is still listed as Chairman of the Board, no other board members are acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtc.org/david-miscavige.html David Miscavige - Official website of Religious Technology Center, (c) 1996–2008 Religious Technology Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the executive branch of RTC existed at least until 2001 the position of "Inspector General RTC," which had been held by Mark Rathbun. This network spanned from RTC headquarters in Gilman Hot Springs to all of the "Advanced Organizations" in Los Angeles, Clearwater, East Grinstead, Copenhagen and Sidney, where RTC has maintained offices.&lt;ref name="rtc.org"/&gt;

In an internal newsletter, "Keeping Scientology Working," RTC stated the following about the purpose and duties of the "Inspector General Network":&lt;ref&gt;"Keeping Scientology Working", Caption of photo depicting the staff of the RTC IG Network, page 4, (c) 1995 Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These Deputy Inspector Generals head the entire IG Network, which locates and handles internal and external infiltration and suppression, legally protects and safeguards the trademarks and technology of the religion of Scientology, and sees that management, orgs and missions and their application of tech and policy remain standard and true to LRH's writings."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While RTC has a dominant role over the "mother church," CSI and its subordinate organizations, the relationship to the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST) is unclear. While the above-mentioned "assignment agreement" with L. Ron Hubbard on May 10, 1982 granted CST corporative authority over RTC with respect to Scientology's trademarks and service marks, there is no sign that CST ever executed any internal, "ecclesiastical" authority over RTC. In fact, the U.S. Claims Court noted in its opinion in a tax case, which involved CST in 1992:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/blog/suleiman2/cst_vs_irs_1992.html Opinion, Church of Spiritual Technology vs. United States, No. 581-88T, United Claims Court, June 29, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"CST claims that it does not and will not monitor RTC's use of the religious marks and technology. CST explains that there is no need to do so because any unorthodox use would be immediately obvious. Regardless of how it arrived at the conclusion, however, the point is that one of its obligations is to prevent misuse of the marks and technology. CST's present confidence in RTC has no significance. If CST ignored that element of its charter, one of the assumptions built into LRH's gift would be missing. Monitoring for a misuse by RTC is a form of ongoing oversight. The decision to exercise the option is an ecclesiastical one which would not be readily susceptible to judicial review."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Litigation==

Since its inception in 1982, RTC has been involved in various [[lawsuit]]s in both [[State court (United States)|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The majority of the cases initiated by RTC contend unauthorized use of Scientology's [[copyright]]s, [[service mark]]s, or [[trademark]]s. Critics of Scientology contend that a great number of these lawsuits have been launched in order "to silence critics."&lt;ref&gt;Church in Cyberspace, Marc Fisher, Washington Post, August 19, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have agreed in some cases; in ''RTC v. Lerma'' Judge Leonie Brinkema found that the RTC's lawsuit was intended to pursue the "broader motivation" of "the stifling of criticism and dissent of the religious practices of Scientology and the destruction of its opponents."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/specials/scientology/SCIENTOLOGY_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The RTC filed a lawsuit on January 1, 1985 in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against Robin Scott and the Church of New Civilization (not to be confused with the [[New Civilization Church]]), a Scientology splinter group, alleging [[theft]] and unauthorized use of confidential material owned by RTC. The case took over a decade to resolve, and was dismissed on April 11, 1996 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. In its final [[legal opinion|opinion]] the court summarized the history of the case and commented on the conduct of RTC while the case was litigated:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Religious Technology Center v. Scott|Unpublished Opinion from April 11, 1996, Religious Technology Center et al. vs. Robin Scott et al., 82 F.3d 423, 1996 WL 171443, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] In January 1985 RTC sued Mayo and other persons connected with the Church of the New Civilization, a splinter group of the official Church of Scientology, contending that they were making unauthorized use of stolen documents relating to the religion of Scientology. RTC stated that it was "the protector" of the religion of Scientology, its philosophy and its technology "including the Advanced Technology" consisting of "confidential and proprietary information regarding counseling and training," and was the owner of various trademarks registered with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] protecting the Advanced Technology. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] After 1,825 docket entries and nine years of pretrial litigation involving three [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] [[United States magistrate judge|magistrates]], a special master, the [[recusal]] of two district court judges, the denial of five petitions for writ of [[mandamus]], three appeals [...] and three denials of [[certiorari]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the third district judge [...] entered Final Judgment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] [T]here is little doubt that RTC is playing "fast and loose" with the judicial system as required in the minority view of [[estoppel]]. To first assert that its unfair competition and false designation of origin claims are [[Justiciability|justiciable]] and at the same time assert that Mayo's identical claims are not is at best questionable; in light of RTC's documented history of [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious behavior]], RTC's actions are indefensible. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Knowledge reports==
The RTC maintains a task force called the Inspector General Network, an investigatory body which operates from seven offices on four different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430043739/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |archivedate=2006-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGN's stated function is to "keep Scientology working by ensuring the pure and ethical use of Dianetics and Scientology technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtc.org/en_US/matters/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022163614/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/matters/index.html |archivedate=2006-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC, like the Church of Scientology, encourages the use of "Knowledge Reports" (KR) from anyone inside or outside of the Church, to report on potential misuse of the [[Standard Tech]] and copyrighted/trademarked materials. They maintain an online form in which anyone is encouraged to report any such matters that may be of concern.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rtc.org/reports/form/index.html?locale=en&lt;/ref&gt; The use of reports is one system used by RTC to police the use of Scientology materials and the application.

|[[Afghanistan]]
|Population 31,410,000, Christian 0.1%, Muslim 99.7%
|Sunni Muslim 80%, Shia Muslim 19%, other 1%
|Christian 0.1%, Muslim 99.7%
|Reliable data on religious demography is difficult to obtain because an official nationwide census has not been conducted in decades. U.S. government estimates indicate a population of approximately 30.4 million, with Sunni Muslims comprising 80 percent of the population, Shia Muslims making up about 19 percent, and other religious groups comprising less than 1 percent. The Ismailis, who self identify as a Shia denomination, comprise approximately 5 percent of the total population. Leaders of minority religious communities estimate there are 350 Sikh families and 30 Hindu families. Estimates of the Bahá'í and Christian communities are less clear because neither group practices openly for fear of persecution. Reportedly, the Christian community is between 500 and 8,000 persons and the Bahá'í community is approximately 2,000 persons. In addition, there are small numbers of practitioners of other religions. There is one known Jewish citizen.
There are three active gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship) in Kabul and 10 in other parts of the country; there were 64 gurdwaras throughout the country before the mujahideen era, when many were seized. There are five remaining Hindu mandirs (temples) in three cities: two in Kabul, one of which shares a wall with a mosque, one in Jalalabad, one in Helmand, and one in Kandahar.
Afghanistan's last known Jew maintains Kabul's sole synagogue, and there are also three defunct synagogues in Herat, which are no longer in use for lack of a Jewish community. There are no public Christian churches. Afghan Christians worship alone or in small congregations in private homes. Many Afghan Christians converted while living as refugees in third countries. Chapels and churches for noncitizens of various faiths are located on several military bases, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and at the Italian embassy in Kabul. Buddhist foreigners are free to worship in Hindu temples.
Followers of the Bahá'í Faith have practiced in the country for approximately 150 years. The community is predominantly based in Kabul, although some Bahá'ís remain in Kandahar.

|[[Albania]]
|Population 3,200,000, Christian 18.0%, Muslim 80.3%, Unaffiliated 1.4%, Other Religion 0.2%
|Muslim 56.7%, Roman Catholic 10%, Orthodox 6.8%, atheist 2.5%, Bektashi (a Sufi order) 2.1%, other 5.7%, unspecified 16.2%
note: all mosques and churches were closed in 1967 and religious observances prohibited; in November 1990, Albania began allowing private religious practice (2011 est.) 
|Bahá'í 0.2%, Christian 31.6%, Muslim 62.7%, Atheist 0.5%, Agnostic 5.0% 
|According to the 2011 census, the population is 2.8 million. It is difficult to assess the size of religious groups because nearly 20 percent of respondents declined to answer the optional census question about religious affiliation. Several religious leaders challenge the census results. According to the census, Sunni Muslims constitute nearly 57 percent of the population, Roman Catholics 10 percent, Orthodox Christians (the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania) nearly 7 percent, and Bektashi (a form of Shia Sufism) 2 percent. Other groups present include Bahá'ís, Jehovah's Witnesses, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The State Committee on Cults reports more than 230 religious groups, organizations, foundations, and educational institutions operating in the country.

|[[Algeria]]
|Population 35,470,000, Christian 0.2%, Muslim 97.9%, Unaffiliated 1.8%
|Muslim (official; predominantly Sunni) 99%, other (includes Christian and Jewish) &lt;1% (2012 est.) 
|Christian 0.2%, Muslim 98.5%, Agnostic 1.2%
|The population is 37.1 million according to January estimates from the Office of National Statistics. Over 99 percent is Sunni Muslim. Groups together constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Christians, Jews, and a small community of [[Ibadi]] Muslims residing in the province of Ghardaia. Some religious leaders estimate there are only a few hundred Jews. Unofficial estimates of the number of Christians in Algeria vary between 30,000 and 70,000. For security reasons, due mainly to civil conflict, Christians concentrated in the cities of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran in the mid-1990s. According to Christian leaders, evangelical Christians, including Seventh-day Adventists, account for the largest number of Christians. Most evangelicals live in the Kabylie region. Next in size are the Methodists and members of other Protestant denominations, followed by Roman Catholics. A significant proportion of Christian foreign residents, whose numbers are difficult to estimate, are students and illegal immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa seeking to reach Europe. One religious leader estimates there are between 1,000 and 1,500 Egyptian Coptic Christians living in the country. There are no statistics on the number of religious conversions; however, according to the Minister of Religious Affairs, 150 foreigners converted to Islam and 50 citizens converted to Christianity in 2011. Christian leaders estimate that dozens of Algerians have converted to Christianity in the past two years. Officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments (MRA) report that there are approximately 16,000 mosques and 24,000 imams in Algeria.

The National Institute for Religious Affairs estimates 25 percent of the population combines Christian and traditional beliefs; 10 percent is Protestant, including Methodists, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Congregationalists (United Church of Christ), and Assemblies of God; and 5 percent belongs to Brazilian evangelical churches. A small portion of the rural population practices animism or indigenous religious beliefs. There is a small Muslim community, unofficially estimated at 80,000 to 90,000, most of whom are migrants from West Africa or of Lebanese origin. Some Muslim sources put these figures closer to 500,000, but it is not possible to confirm the estimate.
There are approximately 450 to 500 Jews, primarily Israelis.

There are approximately 350 licensed Sunni mosques, while the number of licensed Shia places of worship includes 863 mosques and 589 matams (religious cultural centers). In newer residential developments such as Hamad Town and Isa Town, which often have mixed Shia and Sunni populations, there tends to be a disproportionate number of Sunni mosques.
Foreigners, mostly from South Asia and from other Arab countries, constitute an estimated 54 percent of the population. Approximately half of resident foreigners are non-Muslim, including Hindus, Buddhists, Christians (primarily Roman Catholic, Protestant, Syrian Orthodox, and Mar Thoma from South India), Bahá'ís, and Sikhs.

Most of the Nepali-speaking minority is Hindu, although there are small numbers of Christians and Buddhists. Hindus represent approximately 25 percent of the population. Hindu temples exist in southern areas. Christians are reportedly concentrated in towns and in the south.
According to unconfirmed estimates, there are between 3,000 and 15,000 Christians in the country. There are also reports of a few Muslims. Although priests of the animist Bon tradition often officiate at and include Bon rituals in Buddhist festivals, very few citizens adhere exclusively to this religion. The Sharchops ethnic group, which forms the majority of the population of eastern Bhutan, reportedly practices Tibetan Buddhism combined with elements of the Bon tradition and Hinduism.
According to an April estimate by the Ministry of Labor and Resources, just over 55,000 Indian laborers are present in the country, most of whom are Hindu or Muslim.

According to unofficial estimates from the statistics agency, Muslims constitute 45 percent of the population, Serbian Orthodox Christians 36 percent, Roman Catholics 15 percent, Protestants 1 percent, and other communities, including Jews, 3 percent. There is a strong correlation between ethnicity and religion: Bosniaks are generally associated with Islam, Bosnian Serbs with the Serbian Orthodox Church, and Bosnian Croats with the Roman Catholic Church. The Jewish community has approximately 1,000 members and maintains an historic place in society by virtue of centuries of coexistence with other religious communities and its active role in the Inter-Religious Council, which mediates among the four religious communities regarded as "traditional" (Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish).
The majority of Serbian Orthodox adherents live in the RS, and the majority of Muslims and Catholics in the Federation. Within the Federation distinct, Muslim and Catholic majority areas remain, with most Catholics in Herzegovina and areas of central Bosnia and most Muslims elsewhere in central Bosnia and Sarajevo. The Jewish community, similar to Protestants and most other small religious communities, has its largest membership in Sarajevo.

|Although there has not been a census since 1983, a 2012 U.S. government source estimates the population to be 54,584,700. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion. The principal minority religious groups include Christians (primarily Baptists, Roman Catholics, and Anglicans, along with several other small Protestant denominations), Muslims (mostly Sunni), Hindus, and practitioners of traditional Chinese and indigenous religions. Some sources suggest that approximately 90 percent of the population practices Buddhism, 4 percent Christianity, and 4 percent Islam. These statistics likely underestimate the non-Buddhist proportion of the population. A very small Jewish community in Rangoon has a synagogue but no resident rabbi.
The country is ethnically diverse, with significant correlation between ethnicity and religion. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion among the majority Burman ethnic group and also among the Shan, Rakhine, and Mon ethnic minorities. Christianity is dominant among the Kachin, Chin, and Naga ethnic groups. Christianity also is practiced widely among the Karen and Karenni ethnic groups; although many Karen and Karenni are Buddhist and some Karen are Muslim. Citizens of South Asian origin, who are concentrated in major cities and in the south-central region, are predominantly Hindu or Muslim, although some are Christian. Islam is practiced widely in Rakhine State and in Rangoon, Irrawaddy, Magwe, and Mandalay Divisions, where some Burmese, ethnic Indians, ethnic Bengalis, ethnic Kaman, and Rohingya practice the religion. Chinese ethnic minorities generally practice traditional Chinese religions. Traditional indigenous beliefs are practiced widely among smaller ethnic groups in the highland regions.

The two Anglophone regions of the country are largely Protestant, and the eight Francophone regions are mostly Catholic. In the northern regions, the dominant Fulani (or Peuhl) ethnic group is mainly Muslim, but the overall population in those regions is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religions, who are mostly located in rural areas. The Bamoun ethnic group of the West Region is predominantly Muslim. Many Muslims, Christians, and members of other faiths also adhere to some aspects of African animist beliefs.

According to the 2002 census, 70 percent of the population over the age of 14 is Roman Catholic and 15 percent is "evangelical", a term referring to all non-Catholic Christian groups except The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Jehovah's Witnesses, Orthodox (Armenian, Greek, Persian, Serbian, and Ukrainian churches), and Seventh-day Adventist. Approximately 90 percent of "evangelicals" are Pentecostal. Anglican, Baptist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Reformed Evangelical, and Wesleyan groups constitute the remaining 10 percent. Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Jews, Muslims, and members of the Unification Church collectively constitute less than 5 percent of the population.

|According to Bureau of Statistics information as of 1 November 2010, the population of mainland China is 1,339,725,000. In its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council during its Universal Periodic Review in February 2009, the government stated that there were "more than 100 million followers of different religious faiths and the religious population is steadily increasing." However, accurate estimates of the numbers of religious believers vary widely depending on the source. For example, a 2007 survey conducted by East China Normal University states that 31.4 percent of citizens aged 16 and over, or 300 million people, are religious believers. The same survey estimates that there are 200 million Buddhists, Taoists, or worshippers of folk gods, although accurate estimates are difficult to make because many adherents practice exclusively at home.
According to the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA), there are more than 21 million Muslims in the country; unofficial estimates range as high as 50 million. Hui Muslims are concentrated primarily in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces. Uighur Muslims live primarily in Xinjiang. According to Xinjiang Statistics Bureau data from 2010, there are approximately 10 million Uighurs in Xinjiang.
The 2011 Blue Book of Religions, produced by the Institute of World Religions at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a research institution directly under the State Council, reports the number of Protestant Christians to be between 23 and 40 million. A June 2010 SARA report estimates there are 16 million Protestants affiliated with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM). According to 2010 Pew Research Center estimates, there are 67 million Protestant Christians, of whom 23 million are affiliated with the TSPM.
According to SARA, more than six million Catholics worship in sites registered by the Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA). The Pew Center estimates that there are nine million Catholics on the mainland, 5.7 million of whom are affiliated with the CPA.
In addition to the five nationally recognized religions, local governments have legalized certain religious communities and practices, such as Orthodox Christianity in Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. Some ethnic minorities retain traditional religions, such as Dongba among the Naxi people in Yunnan and Buluotuo among the Zhuang in Guangxi. Worship of the folk deity Mazu reportedly has been reclassified as "cultural heritage" rather than religious practice.
Prior to the government's 1999 ban on Falun Gong, a self-described spiritual discipline, it was estimated that there were 70 million adherents.

||According to official data from China's sixth decennial national census, conducted in November 2010, the TAR's 2,716,400 ethnic Tibetans make up 91 percent of the TAR's total population. Official census data also show ethnic Tibetans constituting 1.8 percent of the total population of Gansu Province, 24.4 percent in Qinghai Province, 2.1 percent in Sichuan Province, and 0.3 percent in Yunnan Province.
Most ethnic Tibetans practice Tibetan Buddhism, although a sizeable minority practices Bon, an indigenous religion, and very small minorities practice Islam, Catholicism, or Protestantism. Some scholars estimate that there are as many as 400,000 Bon followers across the Tibetan Plateau. Scholars also estimate that there are up to 5,000 ethnic Tibetan Muslims and 700 ethnic Tibetan Catholics in the TAR.
Many Tibetan government officials and CCP members in Tibet are religious believers, despite government and CCP prohibitions against officials’ holding religious beliefs or participating in religious activities.
Other residents of traditionally Tibetan areas include ethnic Han Chinese, many of whom practice Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, or traditional folk religions; Hui Muslims; and non-ethnic Tibetan Catholics and Protestants. Approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslims worship at mosques in the TAR. A Catholic church with 560 members is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the eastern TAR. Cizhong (Tsodruk), in Diqing (Dechen) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP), Yunnan Province, is also home to a large Tibetan Catholic congregation. The TAR is home to a small number of Falun Gong adherents, as well as unregistered Christian churches.
According to the State Council Information Office's 2011 White Paper "Sixty Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the TAR has over 1,700 "venues for religious activities and about 46,000 monks and nuns." While no recent data on the number of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in other Tibetan areas of China are available, according to a 2009 article in the People's Daily (the official newspaper of the CCP), altogether in the TAR and in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, there are 3,000 Tibetan Buddhist monasteries with 120,000 Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns.

|The population is 47 million, according to a 2011 World Bank estimate. The government does not keep statistics on religious affiliation, and estimates from religious leaders varied. The Roman Catholic Bishops’ Conference estimates that 90 percent of the population is Catholic, while the Colombian Evangelical Council (CEDECOL) states that approximately 15 percent of the population is Protestant. According to a 2007 press report, 80 percent of the population is Catholic, 14 percent is non-Catholic Christian, 2 percent is agnostic, and the remaining 4 percent belongs to other religious groups, including Islam and Judaism. Other observers estimate that the non-Catholic population consists of five million members of Protestant, including evangelical, groups; 261,000 Seventh-day Adventists; 150,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church); 10,000 Muslims, and 5,000 Jews. There is also a small population of adherents to animism and various syncretic beliefs.
Some religious groups are concentrated in certain geographical regions. Most of those who blend Catholicism with elements of African animism are Afro-Colombians and reside on the Pacific coast. Most Jews reside in major cities, most Muslims on the Caribbean coast, and most adherents of indigenous animistic religions in remote rural areas. A small Taoist commune is located in a mountainous region of Santander Department.

|According to the country's National Office of Statistics’ 2012 publication on demographics, the population is approximately 11 million. There is no independent authoritative source on the size or composition of religious groups. The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 60 to 70 percent of the population is Catholic, but only 4 to 5 percent regularly attend mass. Membership in Protestant churches is estimated at 5 percent of the population. Baptists and Pentecostals are likely the largest Protestant denominations. Jehovah's Witnesses report approximately 95,400 members; Methodists estimate 35,000; Seventh-day Adventists 33,000; Anglicans, 22,000; Presbyterians, 15,000; Quakers, 300; and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), 50.

According to the 2001 census, the latest year for which disaggregated figures have been released, Hindus constitute 80.5 percent of the population, Muslims 13.4 percent, Christians 2.3 percent, and Sikhs 1.9 percent. Groups that together constitute less than 1 percent of the population include Buddhists, Jains, Parsis (Zoroastrians), Jews, and Bahá'ís. So-called "tribal" groups, which are indigenous groups historically outside the caste system and generally included among Hindus in government statistics, often practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs (animism).
There are large Muslim populations in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala; Muslims constitute the majority in the states of Jammu and Kashmir. Although Muslims are a minority nationally, the country has the world's third-largest Muslim population based on the 2001 census. Slightly more than 85 percent of Muslims are Sunni; most of the rest are Shia. Christian populations are found across the country but in greater concentrations in the northeast, as well as in the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Goa. Three small northeastern states (Nagaland, Mizoram, and Meghalaya) have large Christian majorities. Sikhs constitute the majority in the state of Punjab.

|According to the 2010 government census, the most recent available, the population is approximately 237 million. Approximately 87 percent of the population is Muslim, 7 percent Protestant, 3 percent Roman Catholic, and 1.5 percent Hindu. Other religious groups (Buddhism, followers of traditional indigenous religions, Confucianism, other Christian denominations, and those who did not respond to the census question) comprise approximately 1.25 percent of the population.
The country's Muslim population is overwhelmingly Sunni. Of the more than 207 million Muslims, an estimated one to three million are Shiites. Many smaller Muslim groups exist, including approximately 200,000-400,000 members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.
An estimated 20 million people, primarily in Java, Kalimantan, and Papua, practice various traditional belief systems, often referred to collectively as "Aliran Kepercayaan." There are approximately 400 different Aliran Kepercayaan communities throughout the archipelago. Many combine their beliefs with one of the government-recognized religions and register under that recognized religion.
The country has a small Sikh population, estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000, residing primarily in Medan and Jakarta. There are small Jewish communities in Jakarta, Manado, and Surabaya. The Bahá'í community reports thousands of members, but no reliable figures are available. Falun Dafa (or Falun Gong), which considers itself a spiritual organization rather than a religion, claims several thousand followers, but specific numbers are unavailable. The number of atheists is also unknown, but the group Indonesian Atheists claims to have more than 500 members.
Sunni Islam is the majority religion throughout most of the country. Notable exceptions include the province of Bali, which is predominantly Hindu, and the provinces of Papua, West Papua, East Nusa Tenggara, and North Sulawesi, which are predominantly Protestant Christian.

|Bahá'í 0.3%, Christian 0.4%, Muslim 98.8%, Agnostic 0.3%
|According to the Statistical Center of Iran's 2011 National Population and Housing Census, the population is 75.2 million. Muslims constitute 99 percent of the population; 90 percent are Shia and 9 percent are Sunni (mostly Turkmen, Arabs, Baluchs, and Kurds living in the southwest, southeast, and northwest, respectively). There are no official statistics available on the size of the Sufi Muslim population; however, some reports estimate between two and five million people practice Sufism.
Groups together constituting the remaining 1 percent of the population include Bahá'ís, Christians, Jews, Sabean-Mandaeans, and Zoroastrians. The two largest non-Muslim minorities are Bahá'ís and Christians. The Bahá'ís number approximately 300,000, and are heavily concentrated in Tehran and Semnan. According to UN figures, 300,000 Christians live in the country, though some NGOs estimate there may be as many as 370,000. The Statistical Center of Iran reports there are 117,700. The majority of Christians are ethnic Armenians concentrated in Tehran and Isfahan. Unofficial estimates of the Assyrian Christian population range between 10,000 and 20,000. There are also Protestant denominations, including evangelical groups. Christian groups outside the country estimate the size of the Protestant Christian community to be less than 10,000, although many Protestant Christians reportedly practice in secret. There are from 5,000 to 10,000 Sabean-Mandaeans. The Statistical Center of Iran estimates there are 25,271 Zoroastrians, who are primarily ethnic Persians; however, Zoroastrian groups report they have 60,000 members.

note: while there has been voluntary relocation of many Christian families to northern Iraq, recent reporting indicates that the overall Christian population may have dropped by as much as 50 percent since the fall of the Saddam HUSSEIN regime in 2003, with many fleeing to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (2010 est.) 
|Christian 1.5%, Muslim 97.5%, Neoreligionists 0.2%, Atheist 0.2%, Agnostic 0.5%
|According to a July 2012 U.S. government estimate, the population is approximately 31.1 million. Religious demography statistics vary due to violence, internal migration, and governmental tracking capability. Numbers are often estimates from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community leaders, as the government has not yet taken a census.
According to 2010 government statistics, 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Shia Muslims, predominantly Arabs but including Turkmen, Faili (Shia) Kurds, and others, constitute 60 to 65 percent. Arab and Kurdish Sunni Muslims make up 32 to 37 percent of the population. From 18 to 20 percent are Sunni Kurds, 12 to 16 percent are Sunni Arabs, and the remaining 1 to 2 percent are Sunni Turkmen. Approximately 3 percent of the population is composed of Christians, Yezidis, Sabean-Mandaeans, Bahá'ís, Shabaks, Kakais (sometimes referred to as Ahl-e Haqq), and a very small number of Jews. Shia, although predominantly located in the south and east, are the majority in Baghdad and have communities in most parts of the country. Sunnis form the majority in the west, center, and the north of the country.
Christian leaders estimate there are between 400,000 and 850,000 Christians. Approximately two-thirds are Chaldeans (an eastern rite of the Catholic Church), nearly one-fifth are Assyrians (Church of the East), and the remainder are Syriacs (Eastern Orthodox), Armenians (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox), Anglicans, and other Protestants. Evangelical Christians reportedly number approximately 5,000.
Yezidi leaders report that most of 500,000 to 700,000 Yezidis reside in the north, with 15 percent in Dahuk Province and the rest in Ninewa Province. Shabak leaders state there are 200,000 to 500,000 Shabaks, who reside mainly near Mosul in Ninewa Province. Estimates of the size of the Sabean-Mandaean community vary widely; according to Sabean-Mandaean leaders, about 4,000 remain in the country, generally along the Tigris and its tributaries. According to a leader in the Sabean-Mandaean community in Basrah, the Sabean-Mandaean population in Basrah has fallen dramatically over the last decade to an estimated 500-750 people. The Bahá'í leadership report fewer than 2,000 members, spread throughout the country in small groups. The Kakai community around Kirkuk is estimated at 24,500 people. Fewer than 10 Jews reportedly reside in Baghdad, and there are unconfirmed reports that very small Jewish communities exist in other parts of the country.
UNHCR reports that 82,260 Iraqi refugees and 218,800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) registered returns in 2012. The Ministry of Migration and Displacement (MOMD) reports that 304 of those returns were minorities. A majority of these refugees originally fled Iraq and sought asylum in Syria and Jordan due to sectarian violence triggered by the 2006 bombing of the Samara shrine. According to UNHCR's 2012 monitoring report, the majority of the Iraqi refugees who sought asylum in Iran were Shia families who had fled Iraq before 2003; those who returned in 2012 mostly settled in Najaf and Karbala.
In addition to Iraqi refugees, an estimated 1.1 million people of diverse religious backgrounds remain internally displaced due to sectarian violence between 2006 and 2008. The number of religious minorities internally displaced by violence remains uncertain because many stay with relatives and friends. An international NGO reports that 6,156 Christian families remain internally displaced in the country's northern governorates. The NGO largely attributes the high number to Iraqi Christians fleeing Syria where they had previously found refuge. The NGO attributes the decision of families to resettle in northern Iraq due to the area's relative security compared with elsewhere in the country. Humanitarian organizations working with displaced Christian families note that this vulnerable population is often unable to sell their homes at a reasonable price if they choose to migrate. They also face increasing rental costs in their area of displacement.

|According to the 2011 report of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population is 7.9 million (including settlers living in the Occupied Territories), of which approximately 76 percent are Jews, 19 percent are Muslims, 2 percent are Christians, and 1.6 percent are Druze. The remaining 1.4 percent consists of relatively small communities of Bahá'ís, Samaritans, Karaites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and those classified as "other"—mostly persons who identify themselves as Jewish but do not satisfy the Orthodox Jewish definition of "Jewish" the government uses for civil procedures. The majority of non-Jewish citizens are of Arab origin.
According to the CBS report, 9 percent of the Jewish population identifies as Haredi (also known as "ultra-Orthodox"), 10 percent identifies as Orthodox, 15 percent describe themselves as "traditional, religious," 23 percent call themselves "traditional, not so religious," and 43 percent describe themselves as "nonreligious/secular" Jews, most of whom observe some Jewish traditions. Although not differentiated in official statistics, a 2012 Guttman Institute poll shows that approximately 500,000 traditional and secular Jews associate themselves with the beliefs of the Conservative or Reform streams of Judaism. There is also a community of approximately 20,000 Messianic Jews.
Religious communities often are concentrated in geographical areas according to religious beliefs. The country continues to undergo demographic changes due to the higher birth rate of the Haredi and Muslim communities.
There are approximately 95,000 foreigners permitted to work in the country and an additional 120,000 illegal foreign workers. Foreign workers were members of many different religious groups, including: Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim.

Religious groups accounting for less than 5 percent of the population include non-Catholic Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Bahá'ís, and Buddhists. Non-Catholic Christian groups include Orthodox, Jehovah's Witnesses, Assemblies of God, the Confederation of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a number of small Protestant groups.
The number of Muslims continues to grow with immigration from North Africa, South Asia, Albania, and the Middle East. Most Muslims live in the northern part of the country. According to the research branch of the Caritas nongovernmental organization (NGO), of an estimated five million resident foreigners, 1.6 million are Muslim, 1.5 million Orthodox, one million Catholic, and 0.2 million Protestant. The Jewish community is estimated to be 30,000.

Many Christians and Muslims also adhere to some aspects of indigenous religious beliefs.
Traditionally, the north is associated with Islam and the south with Christianity, although practitioners of both religions live throughout the country. In general, political and religious affiliations tend to follow ethnic lines.
Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Harrists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Southern Baptists, Copts, and members of the Assemblies of God.
Other religious groups include Buddhists, Bahá'ís, adherents of the Celestial Church of Christ, followers of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and Bossonists, who follow traditions of the Akan ethnic group.

|The Statistics Bureau estimates the population to be 127.5 million as of October. Because the government does not require religious groups to report their membership, it is difficult to determine the number of members of different groups. A 2009 report by the Agency for Cultural Affairs (ACA) indicates that membership claims by religious groups totaled 207 million. This number, substantially more than the country's population, reflects many citizens’ affiliation with multiple religions. For example, it is common to practice both Buddhist and Shinto rites.
According to the ACA's 2009 statistics, 106 million persons identified themselves as Shinto, 90 million as Buddhist, and 2.1 million as Christian, while nine million followed "other" religions. The category of "other" includes Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Judaism, or no religion. The government does not compile statistics on the number of Muslims in the country specifically, but a 2005 report by academic sources estimates the Muslim population at 63,000.
There is no significant correlation between religious affiliation and ethnicity, politics, or socio-economic status; the society is relatively ethnically and religiously homogeneous. The indigenous Ainu people, who practice an animist faith, are concentrated mainly in Japan's northern island, Hokkaido. Some immigrants and foreign workers practice religions other than Shintoism, the indigenous religion, or Buddhism.

Unrecognized Christian denominations not registered as "societies" include the United Pentecostal Church and Jehovah's Witnesses. The government refers to Chaldean and Syriac Christians among the Iraqi refugee population as "guests." The Baptist Church is registered as a "denomination," but does not enjoy the full privileges of other registered religious groups in the country. The government does not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as a religion.

|According to U.S. government sources, the population is estimated at 24.6 million. In a 2002 report to the UN Human Rights Commission, the country's government reports there are 12,000 Protestants, 10,000 Buddhists, and 800 Roman Catholics. The report also notes that the Cheondogyo Young Friends Party, a government-approved group based on a traditional religious movement, has approximately 15,000 members. South Korean and other foreign religious groups estimate there is a considerably higher number of religious practitioners in the country.
In Pyongyang there are four state-controlled Christian churches: two Protestant churches (Bongsu and Chilgol Churches), the Changchun Roman Catholic Church, and the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church. The Chilgol Church is dedicated to the memory of former leader Kim Il-Sung's mother, Kang Pan-sok, who was a Presbyterian deaconess. The number of regular worshippers at these churches is unknown. Defectors from outside of Pyongyang have no knowledge of these churches.
As part of its 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the government reports the existence of religious organizations such as the Korea Christian Federation, Korea Buddhists’ Federation, Korea Roman Catholic Association, Korea Chondoist Society, and Korea Religionists’ Society.
The government-established Korean Catholic Association (KCA) provides for basic services at the Changchun Church, but has no ties with the Vatican. There are no Catholic priests residing in the country. Visiting priests occasionally provide Mass at the Changchun Church.
According to religious leaders who have traveled to the country, there are Protestant pastors at the Bongsu and Chilgol Churches, although it is not known whether they are resident or visiting pastors.
In its July 2002 report to the UN Human Rights Committee, the government reports the existence of 500 "family worship centers." However, according to the 2012 Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU) White Paper, defectors were unaware of any such centers. Observers stated that "family worship centers" may be part of the state-controlled Korean Christian Federation, while an unknown number of "underground churches" operate apart from the federation and are not recognized by the government. The 2012 KINU White Paper and the 2007 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report, "A Prison Without Bars," include defector testimonies referencing the existence of underground churches, but conclude that their existence was hard to verify.
In July 2009 the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported an estimated 30,000 Christians, while some NGOs and academics estimate there may be up to several hundred thousand "underground" Christians. Others question the existence of a large-scale underground church or conclude that it is impossible to estimate accurately the number of underground religious believers. Individual underground congregations are reportedly very small and typically confined to private homes.
According to the 2012 KINU White Paper, there are an estimated 60 Buddhist temples. Most are regarded as cultural relics, but religious activity is permitted in some. Monks serve as caretakers in many of these temples and foreign visitors find these monks to be knowledgeable about Buddhism. Based on defector testimony, the 2012 KINU White Paper reports that most residents of the country have not heard about Buddhist scriptures and have never seen a Buddhist monk. State-controlled press reported on several occasions that Buddhist ceremonies took place in various locations.
The Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church opened in Pyongyang in 2006.

|According to official government census data released in October, the population is 1.74 million. Census data shows 95.6 percent of the population identifies as Muslim, 2.2 percent as Roman Catholic, and 1.4 percent as Serbian Orthodox. Census categories for "Other," "None," or "No Response" each constitute less than 1 percent. The largest Catholic communities live in Gjakove/Djakovica, Kline/Klina, Prizren, Janjevo, and Pristina. Most members of the SOC reside in ethnically Serb towns and enclaves. Small populations of Protestants live in most cities, with the largest concentration located in Pristina. The largest Jewish community resides in Prizren. The Kosovo Islamic Community is the officially recognized Islamic umbrella group and is known by its Albanian-language acronym BIK; it is responsible for training Muslim clergy and appointing them to mosques throughout the country.
Religion and ethnicity are closely linked; Serbs generally belong to the SOC, while the majority of religiously active citizens of Albanian descent identify themselves as Muslim.
Critics of the census note it does not include residents in the northern region of Mitrovice/Mitrovica and thus significantly under-represents Serbs who belong to the SOC. Anecdotal information also suggests census takers at times automatically assigned Islam to persons without soliciting explicit answers or over their verbal objections.

Most of the remaining 30 percent of citizens are Shia Muslims. There are approximately 150-200 Christian citizens and a small number of Bahá'í citizens. An estimated 150,000 noncitizen residents are Shia. While some areas have relatively high concentrations of either Sunnis or Shia, most areas are religiously well integrated.
There are an estimated 600,000 non-citizen Hindus. The largely non-citizen Christian population is estimated to be more than 450,000. The government-recognized Christian churches include the Roman Catholic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the National Evangelical (Protestant) Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Church (referred to in Arabic as the Roman Orthodox Church), the Greek Catholic (Melkite) Church, and the Anglican Church.

The remainder of the population belongs to at least 48 distinct ethnic minority groups, most of which practice animism and ancestor worship. Animism is predominant among Sino-Thai groups, such as the Thai Dam and Thai Daeng, as well as among Mon-Khmer and Burmo-Tibetan groups. Even among lowland Lao, many pre-Buddhist animist beliefs are incorporated into Theravada Buddhist practice, particularly in rural areas. Roman Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Bahá'ís, Mahayana Buddhists, and followers of Confucianism constitute less than 3 percent of the population.

|According to the Beirut-based research firm Statistics Lebanon, the population is approximately 4.3 million. An estimated 27 percent is Sunni Muslim, 27 percent Shia Muslim, 21 percent Maronite Christian, 8 percent Greek Orthodox, 5.6 percent Druze, and 5 percent Greek Catholic, with the remaining 6.5 percent belonging to smaller Christian groups. There are also very small numbers of Jews, Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
The 18 officially recognized religious groups include four Muslim groups, 12 Christian groups, the Druze, and Judaism. The main branches of Islam practiced are Shia and Sunni. The Alawites and the Ismaili ("Sevener") Shia order are the smallest Muslim communities. The Maronite community, the largest Christian group, maintains its centuries-long affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church but has its own patriarch, liturgy, and ecclesiastical customs. The second-largest Christian sect is Greek Orthodox. Other Christians are divided among Greek Catholics, Armenian Orthodox (Gregorians), Armenian Catholics, Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites), Syriac Catholics, Assyrians (Nestorians), Chaldeans, Copts, evangelicals (including Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists), and Latins (Roman Catholic). The Druze, who refer to themselves as al-Muwahhideen, or "believers in one God," are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Beirut.
Many persons fleeing religious mistreatment and discrimination in neighboring states are immigrants in the country, including Kurds, Shia, and Chaldeans from Iraq, as well as Coptic Christians from Egypt and Sudan. According to the secretary-general of the Syriac League, approximately 10,000 Iraqi Christians and 3,000 to 4,000 Coptic Christians reside in the country.

The estimated percentage of the Muslim population is a source of contention. Unofficial reports and surveys estimate Muslims constitute between 10 and 20 percent of the population. Many members of religious groups incorporate elements of indigenous beliefs into their religious practices. Christian groups include Lutherans, Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and members of the United Methodist, African Methodist Episcopal (AME), AME Zion, and a variety of Pentecostal churches.
Christians reside throughout the country. Muslims belong mainly to the Mandingo ethnic group, which resides throughout the country, and the Vai ethnic group, which lives predominantly in the west. There is also a predominantly Muslim Fula community throughout the country. The Fula people are referred to as a community not by location, but as a tribal segment of society. Ethnic groups in most regions participate in the indigenous religious practices of secret societies.

Small Christian communities consist almost exclusively of sub-Saharan African and Egyptian migrants and a small number of U.S. and European workers. Bishops in Tripoli, Misrata, and Benghazi lead an estimated 50,000 Coptic Christians who are mostly Egyptian foreign residents. Roman Catholic clergy are present in larger cities, working primarily in hospitals, orphanages, and with the elderly or physically impaired. A priest in Tripoli and a bishop resident in Tunis lead the Anglican community. A Greek Orthodox archbishop in Tripoli and priests in Tripoli and Benghazi serve approximately 80 regular Orthodox churchgoers. The Ukrainian embassy in Tripoli also maintains a small Orthodox church for Tripoli's Russian-speaking population. There are nondenominational, evangelical Unity churches in Tripoli and Benghazi, as well as small Unity congregations located throughout the country. Nondenominational churches in Tripoli serve primarily African and Filipino migrant workers. The overwhelming majority of Libya's Jewish population, estimated at 40,000, fled the country between 1948 and 1967. David Gerbi, a Libyan Jew active in the exiled Jewish community in Italy, estimates that there are around 200,000 Libyan Jews and their descendants living outside of the country. While there are reports of some Jews remaining, there are no known estimates of the current population. Representatives from the Jewish diaspora are unable to return to reopen the synagogue in Tripoli due to security concerns.
There are no known places of worship for members of other non-Muslim religious groups, although adherents are allowed to practice their religion in their homes.

Churches are well supported by their congregations and play a significant role in civil society.
The majority of foreign workers are Filipino Catholics who have joined local Catholic churches. The Filipino Iglesia ni Cristo has a church in Pohnpei.
Historic interdenominational rivalry and the conversion of clan leaders in Pohnpei resulted in religious divisions along clan lines that continue today, although intermarriage has blurred the lines considerably. More Protestants live on the western side of the island, while more Catholics live on the eastern side.

|Sunni Muslim, small Christian minority
|Christian 19.0%, Ethnoreligionist 10.3%, Muslim 69.8%, Atheist 0.1%, Agnostic 0.8%
|The population is approximately 26 million, according to the 2008 census. The Culture and Information Ministry estimates that 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Almost all Muslims are Sunni, although there are significant distinctions between followers of different Sunni traditions, particularly among Sufi orders. In addition, there are small Muslim minorities, including Shia and the Republican Brothers, based predominantly in Khartoum, and a growing, yet still small, percentage of Salafists.
The Culture and Information Ministry estimates that Christians make up 3 percent of the population. Christians primarily reside in Khartoum, the north, and the Nuba Mountains. It is unclear whether these numbers include residents of Southern Sudanese origin whose citizenship status remains under review. Khartoum's significant Christian population decreased with the migration of many Christians of southern heritage to South Sudan.
There are very small but long-established groups of Orthodox Christians in Khartoum and other cities, including Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox. There are also Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox communities, largely made up of refugees and migrants, in Khartoum and the east. Other smaller Christian groups include the Africa Inland Church, Armenian (Apostolic) Church, Sudan Church of Christ, Sudan Interior Church, Sudan Pentecostal Church, Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Presbyterian Church of the Sudan, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Anglicans, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
The Culture and Information Ministry indicates that less than 1 percent of the population adheres to African traditional religious beliefs. Some Christians and Muslims also adhere to some aspects of traditional beliefs.

|According to a 2011 World Bank estimate, the population is 530,000. Approximately 41 percent of the population is Christian, of which half are Roman Catholics, according to the 2004 census. A wide range of other groups, including Moravian, Lutheran, Dutch Reformed, evangelical Protestant, Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah's Witnesses, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), make up the remaining Christian population. Twenty percent of the population is Hindu, including the Sanathan Dharma and the Arya Dewaker. Muslims, including Sunni, Ahmadiyya, and the World Islamic Call Society, make up 13.5 percent. Approximately 3 percent adhere to indigenous religions. Bahá'ís, Jews, Buddhists, Brahma Kumaris, and Hare Krishnas are also present in small numbers. There are three Rastafarian organizations: Aya Bingi Order, 12th Tribe, and Bobo Shanti.
Some Amerindian and Maroon populations adhere to indigenous religions. Some Amerindians, concentrated principally in the interior and to a lesser extent in coastal areas, practice shamanism through a medicine man (piaiman). Many Maroons, who inhabit the interior, worship nature through a practice that has no special name. Other Maroons, as well as some Creoles in urban areas, worship their ancestors through a rite called wintie. Citizens of Amerindian and Maroon origin who identify as Christian often combine Christian practices with indigenous religious customs with the tacit approval of Christian leaders.
There is a correlation between ethnicity and religion. Many political parties have strong ethnic ties, and members tend to belong to the same religious group. With the exception of those following indigenous practices, religious groups are not concentrated in any particular region.

Membership in the Church of Sweden has decreased steadily since it separated from the state in 2000. Researchers estimate that approximately 6 percent of the population is Muslim.
According to the Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities, the number of Jews is approximately 20,000. The Swedish Commission for Government Support to Faith Communities estimates there are 9,000 practicing Jews in the country. Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform synagogues are found mostly in large cities.
Smaller religious communities are concentrated in larger cities and include Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Hare Krishnas, and members of the Church of Scientology, Word of Faith, and Unification Church.

|According to the Federal Office of Statistics, the population is 8.01 million. The June update of the 2010 census estimates religious group membership as 38.6 percent Roman Catholic, 28 percent Protestant, 4.5 percent Muslim, and 1.8 percent Christian Orthodox. Over 20 percent self-identifies as atheist. Religious groups constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Old Catholics, other Christian denominations, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jews. Although actual church attendance rates are much lower, 80 percent report being religious, including 22 percent being very religious, in a 2007 Religion Monitor survey sponsored by the Bertelsmann Foundation.
Most immigrants are members of religious groups different from native-born citizens. Over 90 percent of Muslims are of foreign origin, with nearly 100 nationalities represented. Most come from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania, Turkey, and North Africa. The majority of the Muslim community is Sunni, interspersed with some Shia and Alawites. Most of the Muslim population lives in urban areas. Over 75 percent of Jewish households are located in Zurich, Geneva, Basel, and Bern.

|Christian 5.2%, Muslim 92.8%, Atheist 0.1%, Agnostic 1.9%
|According to a U.S. government source, the population is approximately 22.5 million, although emigration increased throughout the year due to ongoing violence, unrest, and economic hardship. Sunni Muslims constitute 74 percent of the population and are present throughout the country. The Sunni population includes Arabs, Kurds, Circassians, Chechens, and some Turkomans. Other Muslim groups, including Alawis, Ismailis, and Shia, together constitute 13 percent. Druze account for 3 percent of the population. Various Christian groups constitute the remaining 10 percent, although the Christian population may be closer to 8 percent due to emigration as Christians flee the country. There is also a small Jewish population in major urban areas.
Most Christians belong to the autonomous Orthodox churches, the Uniate churches (which recognize the Roman Catholic Pope), or the independent Nestorian Church. There is a Yezidi population of approximately 80,000, but the government does not recognize the Yezidi as belonging to a group distinct from Islam. Many of the approximately 100 Jews in the country at the beginning of the year have reportedly emigrated due to the ongoing conflict.
Most Christians live in and around Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and Latakia, or in the Hasaka governorate in the northeast section of the country. Iraqi Christians frequently migrated to Syria in past years, but very few entered during the year due to ongoing unrest and violence. The majority of the Iraqi Christian population in the country either moved to neighboring states or returned to Iraq. The majority of Alawis live in the mountainous areas of the coastal Latakia governorate, but they also have significant presence in the cities of Latakia, Tartous, Homs, and Damascus. Many Druze live in the rugged Jabal al-Arab region in the southern governorate of Suweida, where they constitute the vast majority of the local population. The few remaining Jews are concentrated in Damascus and Aleppo. Yezidis are found primarily in the northeast and Aleppo. The Kurdish population is located in the northern and eastern border areas with Turkey and Iraq, largely in Hassakeh, Raqqah, and Halab.

|According to Ministry of Interior figures from October, the population is 23,293,600. Based on a comprehensive study conducted in 2005, the Religious Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) estimates that 35 percent of the population considers itself to be Buddhist and 33 percent Taoist. Although MOI has not tracked data on religious adherence since the 2005 study, it states this estimate might still reflect the situation. MOI does not include religious adherence as a census question, as doing so would constitute an invasion of privacy according to the Personal Data Protection Law. While the overwhelming majority of religious adherents categorize themselves as either Buddhist or Taoist, many adherents consider themselves to be both Buddhist and Taoist.
In addition to organized religious groups, many persons also practice traditional Chinese folk religions, which include some aspects of shamanism, ancestor worship, and animism. Researchers and academics estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population believes in some form of traditional folk religion. Such folk religions may overlap with an individual's belief in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or other traditional Chinese religions. There also may be an overlap between practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese religions, and Falun Gong practitioners. Falun Gong is a self-described spiritual discipline that combines qigong (a traditional Chinese exercise discipline) with the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi. Falun Gong is registered as a civic rather than a religious organization. According to an academic source, Falun Gong membership exceeds one million and continues to grow.
Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include I Kuan Tao, Tien Ti Chiao (Heaven Emperor Religion), Tien Te Chiao (Heaven Virtue Religion), Li-ism, Hsuan Yuan Chiao (Yellow Emperor Religion), Tian Li Chiao (Tenrikyo), Universe Maitreya Emperor Religion, Hai Tze Tao, Zhonghua Sheng Chiao (Chinese Holy Religion), Da Yi Chiao (Great Changes Religion), Pre-cosmic Salvationism, Huang Chung Chiao (Yellow Middle Religion), Roman Catholicism, Islam, the Church of Scientology, the Bahá'í Faith, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mahikari Religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and the Unification Church, all of which are registered. Unregistered denominations include the Presbyterian, True Jesus, Baptist, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, and Episcopal churches. The majority of the indigenous population of 507,000 aborigines is Protestant or Roman Catholic. Jews number approximately 130 persons, although they are predominantly foreign residents. Some 400,000 migrant workers, primarily from Southeast Asia, differ in religious adherence from the general population. The largest single group of migrant workers is from Indonesia, with a population of more than 200,000 persons who are largely Muslim. Migrant workers from the Philippines are predominantly Christian.

|The population is 7.7 million, according to a State Statistics Agency estimate from October 2011. According to local academics, the population is more than 90 percent Muslim. Active observance of Islam appears to be increasing steadily, especially among youth. The majority adhere to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam as traditionally practiced in Central Asia. Approximately 4 percent of Muslims are Ismaili Shia, the majority of whom reside in the remote eastern Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The country has approximately 3,452 "five-time" prayer mosques and 357 "Friday prayer" mosques (larger facilities built for weekly prayers).
There are 75 registered non-Muslim religious groups. There are approximately 150,000 Christians. The largest Christian group is Russian Orthodox; there are also Baptists, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans, and Korean Protestants. There are a small number of Bahá'ís, fewer than 300 Jews and approximately 700 Jehovah's Witnesses.

|The National Bureau of Statistics estimates the population is nearly 45 million. The government does not collect data on religious identification. The Interfaith Council (also known as the Inter-Religious Council for Peace Tanzania, a nongovernmental organization bringing together Christian, Muslim, Bahá'í, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders to foster peace and strengthen relationships) does not keep statistics on religious identity. Many religious groups are reluctant to estimate religious demographics, but most religious leaders estimate that the population is 50 percent Christian and 50 percent Muslim. A 2010 Pew Forum survey estimates that approximately 60 percent of the population is Christian, 36 percent Muslim, and 4 percent members of other religious groups.
On the mainland, large Muslim communities are concentrated in coastal areas, with some large Muslim minorities also located inland in urban areas. Zanzibar is approximately 98 percent Muslim. Between 80 and 90 percent of the Muslim population is Sunni. The remainder consists of several Shia subgroups, mostly of Asian descent. Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Protestants (including Pentecostals), Seventh-day Adventists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and Jehovah's Witnesses. Other religious groups include Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, and Bahá'ís.
The country's three largest political parties are secular, but include the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) party, often associated with Zanzibar's Muslim community, and the opposition Chama cha Mapinduzi na Maendeleo (Chadema) party, often associated with the Christian majority on the mainland.

|According to the 2010 census, the population of 66 million is 93 percent Buddhist and 5 percent Muslim. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and religious groups claim that 85 to 95 percent of the population is Theravada Buddhist and 5 to 10 percent is Muslim. Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include animist, Christian, Confucian, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and Taoist populations.
Theravada Buddhism, the dominant religion, is not an exclusive belief system and most Buddhists also incorporate Brahmin-Hindu and animist practices. The Buddhist clergy (Sangha) consists of two main schools: Mahanikaya and Dhammayuttika. The former is older and more prevalent within the monastic community than the latter. The same ecclesiastical hierarchy governs both groups.
Islam is the dominant religion in four of the five southernmost provinces. The majority of Muslims in those provinces are ethnic Malay, but the Muslim population nationally also includes descendants of immigrants from South Asia, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and those who consider themselves ethnic Thai. The Ministry of Interior's Islamic Affairs Section reported that, as of October, 3,744 mosques are registered in 68 of the country's 77 provinces, of which 3,179 are located in the 14 southern provinces. According to the Religious Affairs Department (RAD) of the Ministry of Culture, 99 percent of these mosques are associated with the Sunni branch of Islam. Shia mosques make up 1 percent and are in Bangkok and the provinces of Nakhon Sithammarat, Krabi, and Phatthalung. There are 39 Provincial Islamic Committees nationwide.
The majority of ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese practice Mahayana or Theravada Buddhism. Many ethnic Chinese, as well as members of the Mien hill tribe, practice forms of Taoism.

Protestant denominations include the Assemblies of God, Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Christian Vision Church. There are also several small nondenominational Protestant congregations. Many citizens also retain animistic beliefs and practices, which they do not see as incompatible with their formal religious affiliation.

In 2004, the University of Lome estimated the population is 33 percent traditional animist, 28 percent Roman Catholic, 14 percent Sunni Muslim, 10 percent Protestant, and 10 percent other Christian denominations. The remaining 5 percent includes persons not affiliated with any religious group. Many Christians and Muslims continue to perform indigenous religious practices. Reliable figures are difficult to obtain because of migration and because the government does not collect religious and ethnic data.
Most Muslims live in the central and northern regions. Christians live mainly in the southern part of the country. The Muslim Union of Togo reports a large surge in immigrants from Muslim countries, but the government does not collect the statistics needed to confirm or deny that claim.

|Christian 1.5%, Muslim 94.7%, Atheist 0.7%, Agnostic 3.0%
|According to 2006 government estimates, the population is 6.7 million. Statistics regarding religious affiliation are not available.

There also are small communities of the following unregistered religious groups: Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Shia Muslims, and evangelical Christians, including Baptists and Pentecostals.
The 1995 census indicates that ethnic Russians make up almost 7 percent of the population; however, subsequent emigration to Russia and elsewhere continues to reduce this proportion. Most ethnic Russians and Armenians are Christian and are generally members of the Russian Orthodox Church. Ethnic Russians and Armenians also make up a significant percentage of unregistered religious congregations; however, ethnic Turkmen are increasingly represented among these unregistered groups.
There are small pockets of Shia Muslims, many of whom are ethnic Iranians, Azeris, or Kurds living along the border with Iran and in the western city of Turkmenbashi.
An estimated 300 Jews live in the country. Local Jews consider Judaism an ethnic rather than a religious identity. There are no synagogues or rabbis, and Jews do not gather for religious observances.

According to the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), 84 percent of the population is Christian. The EFZ's 2004 census estimates the Christian population is 33 percent Catholic; 42 percent evangelical or Pentecostal; 17 percent Anglican, Methodist, or Presbyterian, and 8 percent apostolic. There are a significant number of independent Pentecostal and syncretic African churches.
The majority of the population also adheres to indigenous religions. Religious leaders reported a continued increase in observance of indigenous religious practices, often simultaneously with Christianity. Approximately 14 percent of the population adheres solely to indigenous religious beliefs.
Approximately 3 percent of the population is Muslim, primarily immigrants of Mozambican and Malawian descent. The Muslim population is concentrated in rural areas and in some high-density suburbs. Small numbers of Greek Orthodox, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and Bahá'ís make up less than 1 percent of the population.
Political elites tend to be members of established Christian mainstream or Pentecostal churches. Some apostolic groups, along with the CPZ, support the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and are especially prevalent in ZANU-PF political strongholds.

'''Salman the Persian''' or '''Salman al-Farsi''' ({{lang-ar|سلمان الفارسي}} Salmān al-Fārisī), born '''Rouzbeh''' ({{lang-fa|روزبه}}), was a companion of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and the first [[Persian people|Persian]] who converted to Islam. During some of his later meetings with the other [[Sahabah]], he was referred to as Abu Abdullah ("Father of Abdullah"). He is credited with the suggestion of digging a trench around Medina when it was attacked by Mecca in the [[Battle of the Trench]]. He was raised as a [[Zoroastrian]], then attracted to [[Eastern Christianity|Christianity]], and then converted to Islam after meeting [[Muhammad]] in the city of Yathrib, which later became Medina. According to some traditions, he was appointed as the governor of [[Al-Mada'in]] in Iraq. According to popular tradition, Muhammad considered Salman as part of his household (''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'').&lt;ref name="Jestice"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jestice|first1=Phyllis G.|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1576073551|page=761|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a renowned follower of [[Ali]] ibn Abi Talib after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adamec|first1=Ludwig W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Islam|date=2009|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland • Toronto • Plymouth, UK|pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early life==
Salman was a Persian born either in the city of [[Kazerun]] in [[Fars Province]], or [[Isfahan]] in [[Isfahan County|Isfahan Province]], [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref name="Jestice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houtsma &amp; Wensinck"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houtsma &amp; Wensinck|title=First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|date=1993|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-9004097964|page=116|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brills-First-Encyclopaedia-1913-1936-Volume/dp/9004097961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakeri"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zakeri|first1=Mohsen|title=Sasanid Soldiers in Early Muslim Society: The Origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|date=1993|location=Jremany|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=persian+Salman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUr3VPp6zP9okcuBqAo&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20Salman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hadith, Salman also traced his ancestry to [[Ramhormoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milad Milani|title=Sufism in the Secret History of Persia|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317544593|page=180|quote=In one particular hadith, Salman mentions he is from Ramhormoz, though this is a reference to his ancestry as his father was transferred from Ramhormoz to Esfahan, residing in Jey (just outside the military camp), which was designed to accommodate the domestic requirements of military personnel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sameh Strauch (Translator)|title=Mukhtaṣar Sīrat Al-Rasūl|date=2006|publisher=Darussalam|isbn=9789960980324|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari, Book 5, Volume 58, Hadith 283 (Merits of the Helpers in Madinah [Ansaar])|url=http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/058-sbt.php|quote=Narrated Salman: I am from Ram-Hurmuz (i.e. a Persian town).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the first sixteen years of his life were all about studying to become a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[magus]]'' or [[priest]] after which he became the guardian of a [[fire temple]], which was a well-respected job. Three years later in 587 he met a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christian group and was so impressed by them. Against the wishes of his father, he left his family to join them.&lt;ref name="Navarr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Navarr|first1=Miles Augustus|title=Forbidden Theology: Origin of Scriptural God|date=2012|publisher=Xlibris|isbn=978-1477117521|pages=124–125|url=https://www.amazon.com/Forbidden-Theology-Origin-Scriptural-God/dp/1477117520}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} His family imprisoned him afterwards to prevent him but he escaped.&lt;ref name="Navarr"/&gt;

He traveled around the Middle East to discuss his ideas with priests, theologians and scholars in his quest for the truth.&lt;ref name="Navarr"/&gt; During his stay in [[Syria]], he heard of [[Muhammad]], whose coming has been predicted by Salman's last Christian teacher on his deathbed.&lt;ref name="Houtsma &amp; Wensinck"/&gt; Afterwards and during his journey to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], he was betrayed and sold to a Jew in [[Medina]]. After meeting Muhammad, he recognized the signs that the monk had described to him. He converted to Islam and secured his freedom with the help of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Jestice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houtsma &amp; Wensinck"/&gt;
[[Abu Hurairah]] said to have referred to Salman as "Abu Al Kitabayn" (The father of the two books, i.e., the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]]) and Ali is said to have referred to him as [[Luqman]] al-Hakeem (Luqman the wise - reference to a wise man in the Quran known for his wise statements)&lt;ref name="aljayyash1"/&gt;

==Career==
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}
{{further| Battle of the Trench}}
[[File:Mosque Salaman pharsi, battle of trench, Medina.JPG|thumb|Mosque Salman al-Farsi, battle of trench, Medina]]
It was Salman who came up with the idea of digging a great trench around the city of [[Medina]] to defend the city against the army of 10,000 [[Arabs|Arabian]] non-Muslims. Muhammad and his companions accepted Salman's plan because it was safer and there would be a better chance that the non-Muslim army would have a larger number of casualties.&lt;ref name="Jestice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houtsma &amp; Wensinck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakeri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Navarr"/&gt;

Salman participated in the conquest of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and became the first governor of Sasanid capital after its fall at the time of the second Rashidun Caliph.&lt;ref name="Zakeri"/&gt; According to some other sources,&lt;ref name="Navarr"/&gt; however, he disappeared from public life after Muhammad's death; until 656 when [[Ali]] became Caliph, and appointed Salman as the governor of [[Al-Mada'in]] at the age of 88.&lt;ref name="Navarr"/&gt;

While some sources gather Salman with the ''[[Muhajirun]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/7.2.html |title=Seventh Session, Part 2 |publisher=Al-islam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sources narrate that during the Battle of the Trench, one of Muhajirun stated "Salman is one of us, Muhajirun", but this was challenged by the Muslims of Medina (also known as the ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''). A lively argument began between the two groups with each of them claiming Salman belonged to their group and not to the other one. Muhammad arrived on the scene and heard the argument. He was amused by the claims but soon put an end to the argument by saying: "Salaman is neither Muhajir nor Ansar. He is one of us. He is one of the People of the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akramulla Syed |url=http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/salman.asp |title=Salman the Persian details: Early Years in Persia (Iran) |publisher=Ezsoftech.com |date=2010-03-20 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He [[Quran translations|translated the Quran]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], thus becoming the first person to interpret and translate the Quran into a foreign language.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Death==

When exactly Salman died is unknown, however it was probably during [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s reign or the second year of Ali's reign. One source states that he died in 32 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]/652 or 653 AD in the [[Julian calendar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamstory.com/|title=موقع قصة الإسلام - إشراف د/ راغب السرجاني|work=islamstory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calcon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/|title=Calendar Converter|author=John Walker|work=fourmilab.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another source says he died during Uthman's era in 35 AH/655 or 656 AD.&lt;ref name="calcon"/&gt; Other sources state that he died during Ali's reign.&lt;ref name="aljayyash1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.aljayyash.net/encyclopedia/book-9-28 |title=سلمان الفارسي - الصحابة - موسوعة الاسرة المسلمة |publisher=Islam.aljayyash.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His tomb is located in [[Al-Mada'in]], or according to some others in [[Isfahan]], [[Jerusalem]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Jestice"/&gt;

==Views==

===Shia view===
[[Shia Islam|Shias]], [[Twelver]]s in particular, hold Salman in high esteem for a [[hadith]] attributed to him, in which all [[Imamah (Shia Twelver doctrine)|twelve Imāms]] were mentioned to him by name, from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Jarir ibn Rustom al-Tabari. ''Dalail al-Imamah.'' p.447.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Asgher Razwy, a 20th-century Shia Twelver Islamic scholar states:
{{Quote|If anyone wishes to see the real spirit of Islam, he will find it, not in the deeds of the nouveaux riches of Medina, but in the life, character and deeds of such companions of the Apostle of God as Ali ibn Abi Talib, Salman el-Farsi, [[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari|Abu Dharr el-Ghiffari]], [[Ammar ibn Yasir]], [[Uwais al-Qarani|Owais Qarni]] and [[Bilal Ibn Rabah|Bilal]]. The [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] will change their assessment of the spirit of Islam if they contemplate it in the austere, pure and sanctified lives of these latter companions.|Ali Asgher Razwy|''A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims''&lt;ref&gt;A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims on Al-Islam.org [http://al-islam.org/restatement/57.htm Umar bin al-Khattab, the Second Khalifa of the Muslims]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sufi view===
Salman is also well known as prominent figure in [[Sufi]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Jestice"/&gt; Sufi orders such as Qadriyya and Baktashiyya and [[Naqshbandi]] have Salman in their Isnad of their brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Zakeri"/&gt; In the [[Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi]] order and [[Naqshbandi]] order, Salman is the third person in the chain connecting devotees with Muhammad.
He also founded Futuwwa along with Ali ibn abi Talib.&lt;ref name="Zakeri"/&gt;

===Bahá’í view===
In the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], Bahá'u'lláh honours Salman for having been told about the coming of the prophet Muhammad:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the signs of the invisible heaven, there appeared four men who successively announced unto the people the joyful tidings of the rise of that divine Luminary. Rúz-bih, later named Salmán, was honoured by being in their service. As the end of one of these approached, he would send Rúz-bih unto the other, until the fourth who, feeling his death to be nigh, addressed Rúz-bih saying: 'O Rúz-bih! when thou hast taken up my body and buried it, go to Hijáz for there the Day-star of Muhammad will arise. Happy art thou, for thou shalt behold His face!'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:SBmural.jpg|thumb|right|King (impersonating the hero Hunahpu) piercing his penis with a spear to spill sacrificial blood. Fragment of west mural, San Bartolo]]
'''San Bartolo''' is a small [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] located in the [[Petén (department)|Department of Petén]] in northern [[Guatemala]], northeast of [[Tikal]] and roughly fifty miles from the nearest settlement.&lt;ref name="hno"&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/03.21/01-mayan.html Harvard Gazette: Oldest Mayan mural found by Peabody researcher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; San Bartolo's fame derives from its splendid Late-Preclassic mural paintings still heavily influenced by [[Olmec]] tradition and from examples of early and as yet undecipherable [[Maya script]].

==Site==
The [[List of Maya sites|Maya site]] includes an 85-foot [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] named "Las Ventanas" (The Windows); the [[Maya architecture#Pyramids and temples|Temple]] of "Las Pinturas" (The Paintings); an early royal [[tomb]] in the "Tigrillo Complex" (Ocelot Complex); and (in the "Jabalí" [Wild Boar] group some 500 mt. to the east from the central Plaza) a [[Triadic pyramid|triadic complex]] similar to the H group in [[Uaxactún]] and [[Tikal]]'s [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]]. The pyramid was constructed from ca 300 BC (base rooms) and was completed ca 50 AD.

==Murals==
===Discovery and Reconstruction===
In 2001, in the base of a pyramid, a team led by [[William Saturno]] (a researcher for the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]])&lt;ref name="hno"/&gt; discovered a room with murals that were [[carbon dating|carbon-dated]] as from 100 BC, making them the oldest ones to date. Excavation started in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The murals were stabilized and a special technique was used for photographically recording the paintings. Fallen fragments were pieced together and also photographed. Detailed reconstruction drawings were made by Heather Hurst. The iconography of the mural scenes was subsequently analyzed and interpreted by project iconographer [[Karl Taube]].&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Taube, Stuart 2005; Taube, Saturno, Stuart, Hearst 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the murals, the oldest known Maya royal tomb was discovered in San Bartolo, by archaeologist [[Monica Pellecer Alecio]].

===Twin Myth (Popol Vuh) and Maize Myth===
As Saturno, Stuart and Taube have argued, the murals on the northern and western walls of the chamber in the base of the temple pyramid ('Pinturas Sub-1') depict elements of Maya creation mythology reminiscent of the [[Popol Vuh]] as well as of Yucatec cosmological traditions.

The north wall mural&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Taube, Stuart 2005&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two scenes. One scene is situated in front of a mountain cave (belonging to the [[Flower Mountain]]); several persons are walking and kneeling on a large serpent. The [[Maya maize god]] is shown in the midst of a group of men and women, while receiving (or perhaps bequeathing) a vine calabash. The other scene shows four babies, with their umbilical cords still attached, surrounding a calabash, which has now split up and from which a fifth, and fully clothed male emerges. A large deity figure watches the scene.

The west wall mural&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Taube, Stuart 2004&lt;/ref&gt; has a far greater number of scenes. One part of the mural has four successive images of trees with birds, kings with the markings of the [[Maya Hero Twins|Maya Hero Twin]] Hunahpu, and sacrifices (consisting of fish, deer, turkey, and fragrant blossoms), to which a fifth tree has been added. The five trees are comparable to the directional trees of the [[Codex Borgia]] and to those mentioned in the Book of [[Chilam Balam]] of Chumayel; the associated birds represent the [[Principal Bird Deity]]. The sacrifices are comparable to those in the Year Bearer section of the [[Maya codices|Dresden Codex]]. The first four kings are shown piercing their penises (see fig.), spilling sacrificial blood, then offering a sacrifice. The fifth figure, associated with a fifth tree belonging to the centre - the tree of life itself - is the [[Maya maize god]]. The directional representation as a whole might refer to the initial arrangement of the world.

Another part of the western mural depicts three scenes from the life of the [[maize god]] and the coronation of a king, showing divine right to rule coming from the gods, and providing evidence that the Maya had full-fledged monarchies centuries earlier than previously thought. The three maize god scenes show (i) a maize baby held by a man kneeling in the waters; (ii) the maize god inside a turtle cave, dancing before two enthroned, aquatic deities; and (iii) the maize god flying in the sky, or perhaps falling from the sky down into the water. Scene (iii) has been suggested to represent the death of the maize deity.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Taube, Stuart 2004: 9; Taube et al. 2010: 81-83&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may refer to the maize god's role as a rain bringer.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 2014: 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Other Mythological Parallels===
For an explanation of many of the mural scenes, the Popol Vuh hardly offers clues, and scholars have started to look in other directions. The three maize god scenes of the western mural, for example, have been suggested to refer to present-day Gulf Coast myths about a maize god subduing the gods of thunder and lightning and creating the conditions for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The calabash scene of the northern mural, on the other hand, may constitute (as Van Akkeren has suggested)&lt;ref&gt;Akkeren 2006: 48-51&lt;/ref&gt; an illustration of a Pipil myth concerning a group of young boys (rain deities) born, together with their 'youngest brother' ([[Nanauatzin|Nanahuatzin]]), from a gourd tree. In this myth, Nanahuatzin is the one who opens the Maize Mountain and introduces agriculture. At the same time, the author interprets the calabash - now taken as a vine gourd (Maya ''tsu[y]'') - together with its four surrounding babies as a symbol for a place of origins often mentioned in Highland Maya sources, ''Suywa'' or ''Tsuywa'',&lt;ref&gt;Akkeren 2006: 36-40, 53--55&lt;/ref&gt; to be situated somewhere in the Gulf Coast region.&lt;ref&gt;Akkeren 2006: 55-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest Maya inscriptions==
The earliest inscriptions which are identifiably Maya have been found at San Bartolo; they date to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Saturno2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saturno|first=William A.|author2=David Stuart |author3=Boris Beltrán |title=Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala|journal=Science|date=3 March 2006|volume=311|issue=5765|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1126/science.1121745|pmid=16400112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Skidmore, [http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/SanBartoloWriting.html Evidence of Earliest Maya Writing] mesoweb.com&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, an important stone block text has been found dating to around 300 BC. It has been argued that this text celebrates an upcoming time period ending celebration. This time period may have been projected to end sometime between 7.3.0.0.0 and 7.5.0.0.0 &amp;mdash; 295 and 256 BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Giron-Abrego, Mario  |date=2012 |title=An Early Example of the Logogram TZUTZ at San Bartolo |url=http://www.wayeb.org/notes/wayeb_notes0042.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |work=Wayeb Notes |publisher=Wayeb |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this being the earliest Maya hieroglyphic text so far uncovered, it would arguably be the earliest existing glyphic evidence of a [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] notation in Mesoamerica.

The [[Seventh-day Sabbath]] is seen as an important aspect of worship. Seventh-day Adventist believe it is day which God set aside from the beginning, specifically for holy purposes, on which all [[Human|Mankind]] should rest from their labor during the week and come together to worship the Creator.  One Adventist author wrote, "Worship involves an attitude of mind and heart which enables man to love God with all his being."&lt;ref name="Beach"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

== Worship service ==
The major weekly church worship service occurs on Saturday, typically commencing with [[Sabbath School]] which is a structured time of [[Small group learning|small-group]] study at church. Most Adventists make use of an officially produced "Sabbath School Lesson", which deals with a particular biblical text or doctrine every quarter. Special meetings are provided for children and youth in different age groups during this time (analogous to Sunday school in other churches).

After a brief break, the community joins together again for a church service that follows a typical evangelical format, with a [[sermon]] as a central feature. Corporate singing, Scripture readings, prayers and an offering, including tithing (or [[collection plate|money collection]]), are other standard features. They would normally have bible class and AY (Adventist Youths) and vespers to close the Sabbath.

==Special religious ceremonies==
The weekly church service can also include a [[baptism]] which is done in the form of [[immersion baptism|immersion]], in which the candidate is submerged completely under the water. Adventist teach that baptism symbolizes and declares our new faith in Christ and our trust in His forgiveness, and buried in the water, we arise to a new life in Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/church/baptism/article/go/-/baptism-by-the-book/&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th Fundamental Belief states "By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.)."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/church/baptism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssnet.org/about-us/fundamental-beliefs-seventh-day-adventists/baptism-fundamental-belief-15/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music style &amp; Guidelines===
Adventist worship is generally restrained and carefully organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen White]], on the topic of appropriate music, referred Adventists to the Bible and her writings. She encouraged believers to use judgement and hindsight when considering music that is uplifting. She said, "Those things which have been in the past will be in the future. Satan will make music a snare by the way in which it is conducted. God calls upon His people, who have the light before them in the Word and in the Testimonies, to read and consider, and to take heed. Clear and definite instruction has been given in order that all may understand. But the itching desire to originate something new results in strange doctrines, and largely destroys the influence of those who would be a power for good if they held firm the beginning of their confidence in the truth the Lord had given them. " &lt;ref&gt;[http://sdadefend.com/Defend-foundation/counsel-Celebation.htm ''2nd Selected Messages'', p. 36-38., Ellen White]&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Education,'' White writes about the use of music for the uplift of souls. She writes that music "is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth. . . . As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. . . . Heaven's communion begins on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise." &lt;ref name="Adventist Music Guidelines"&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music-guidelines.html#_ftn4 ''Education'', pg. 168]&lt;/ref&gt; According to White, "Music, when not abused, is a great blessing; but when it is put to a wrong use, it is a terrible curse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music-guidelines.html#_ftn4 ''Testimonies, vol. 1,'' pg. 497.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adventist leaders used her advice and have based a theory of Adventist worship music on verses such as Job 38:7, 2 Samuel 6:15, Psalm 150:3, 1 Corinthians 10:31, Phillipians 4:8, Revelation 4:9-11, 14:1-3, and 19:1-8. These verses advocate the use of music to uplift and praise God. The [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]] voted to propose a list of general music guidelines based on the principles that "music is not morally and spiritually neutral" and that "we cannot be indifferent to it." This led to the following nine principles, summarized here:
# Music should actively glorify God. Anything else weakens a relationship with Him.
# Music should strive for heavenly perfection.
# Music should be socially acceptable.
# Music should be appealing and uplifting.
# Music should implement melody, harmony, and rhythm effectively and enjoyably.
# Lyrical music should be rich in content and of sound Biblical qualities.
# Lyrical and instrumental musical elements should complement.
# It maintains a judicious balance of spiritual, intellectual, and emotional elements.
# We should recognize and acknowledge the contribution of different cultures in worshiping God. Musical forms and instruments vary greatly in the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist family, and music drawn from one culture may sound strange to someone from a different culture.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music-guidelines.html#_ftn4, "Seventh-day Adventist Philosophy of Music - Guidelines," General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Annual Council on October 13, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holy Communion service===
Adventists usually practice communion four times a year. The communion is an [[Open communion|open service]] that is available to members and Christian non-members. It commences with a [[foot washing]] ceremony, known as the "Ordinance of Humility", based on the Gospel account of {{bibleverse||John|13|NIV}}. The Ordinance of Humility is meant to symbolize Christ's washing of his disciples' feet at the [[Last Supper]] and remind participants of the need to humbly serve one another. Participants segregate by gender to separate rooms to conduct this ritual, although some congregations allow married couples to perform the ordinance on each other and families are often encouraged to participate together{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. After its completion, participants return to the main sanctuary for consumption of the Lord's Supper, which consists of the pastor and elders consecrating and sharing [[unleavened bread]] and unfermented grape juice with the members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">'''Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov''' (c. 1390 &amp;ndash; c. 1440) ([[Hebrew]]: '''שם טוב אבן שם טוב''') was a Spanish [[kabbalist]] and fierce opponent of rationalistic philosophy.

Tov was president of a [[yeshivah]] in [[Spain]]. He lived about 1390-1440 ([[Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya]], ''Shalshelet ha-Ḳabbalah,'' ed. Venice, p.&amp;nbsp;62b). He was the father of [[Joseph ibn Shem-Tov]] and Isaac ibn Shem-Tov.

==Works==
He wrote: ''Sefer ha-Emunot,'' on religious dogmas (Ferrara, 1556); ''Sefer Yesodot'' (perhaps only another title for the preceding); a commentary on the ''[[Pesach Haggadah]]'' (Steinschneider, ''Cat. Munich,'' 264, 3; idem, ''Cat. Bodl.'' col. 99). The ''Sefer ha-Emunot'' is an attack on the [[Aristotelian philosophy]] and on the rationalistic conception of Judaism. It is also a eulogy of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]], "the true teaching, which has lived on through tradition and which alone can help Israel." Shem Tov endeavors to prove that, from the standpoint of positive Judaism, there is not the agreement between religion and philosophy that is claimed by many [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]]. In the introduction he makes the philosophical investigators and the "enlightenment" brought about by them responsible for the defection from Judaism and for the political persecutions of the times. He renders especially severe judgments upon [[Maimonides]] (whom he understood to be withholding belief in resurrection), upon [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], upon [[Levi ben Gershon]], and upon other men of liberal views.

In his survey of the historical development of the Kabbala, Shem Tov cites a number of older kabbalistic writers, whose existence, however, is not thereby proved. This reference to them is appended to a short passage from the [[Zohar]]. [[Moses Alashkar]] vehemently opposed Shem Tov's dogmatic system in his ''Hassagot Al Mah She-Katab R. Shem-Tov Neged ha-RaMbaM'' (Ferrara, 1556). The ''Sefer ha-Emunot'' has been much cited by both old and modern authors, and is valuable for the history of the Kabbala. To judge from a remark on page 31b it would seem that Ibn Shem-Tov wrote other works, but nothing is known concerning them.

'''Shivaduti''' is a powerful manifestation of Mother Goddess [[Shakti]]. Shivaduti means one who has [[Shiva]] as her messenger. Goddess Shivaduti made her appearance in the battle against demons [[Shumbha]] and [[Nishumbha]]. She symbolically represents the unfathomable power of Mother Goddess Shakti. As per [[Devi Mahatmyam]], in the battle against the forces of Shumbh and Nishumbh, Mother Goddess took the manifestation of the Saptamatrikas. They were Shaktis of the male gods. After this appeared Shivaduti, the Shakti of Mother Goddess. This form is not associated with any male form. Devi Mahatmyam states that she appeared from the body of Mother Goddess in the most gruesome form – yelping like a hundred jackals. She then asked Lord Shiva to carry the message to Shumbha and Nishumbha that if they desire to battle against her out of arrogance and false belief in their strength, then they and their forces be ready to be devoured by her jackals. It must be noted here that Goddess Shivaduti is a symbolic representation of what form Goddess Shakti can take to put down [[Adharma]].

According to [[Kalika Purana]],Shivadooti is described as having red complexion,matted hair with three eyes and four arms. She wears a garland of skulls and tiger skin. She holds a trident,a sword,a chowry and a noose;while standing with right foot on the back of a wolf and left foot on the chest of a corpse. She possesses ten incarnations([[Yogini]]s)- Kshemankari,Shantaa,Devamata,Mahodari,Karali,Kamada,Bhagasya,Bhagamalini,Bhagavaha and Subhaga.

'''Shreekrishna Kirtana Kabya''' ({{lang-bn|শ্রীকৃষ্ণকীর্তন কাব্য}}) or '''Sri Krishna Kirtana Kabya''' is a pastoral [[Vaishnava]] drama in verse composed by [[Boru Chandidas]]. It is considered to be the most significant work after [[Charyapada]] in the history of [[Bengali literature]]. These verses are believed to be written in the pre-Chaitanya era of the later half of 14th century CE.

==History of publication==
In 1909, Basanta Ranjan Roy Bidvatballava retrieved the ''punthi'' (manuscript) of Sri Krishna Kirtana from a shelf in the cowshed of Debendranath Mukhopadhyay, a resident of Kankilya Village, [[Bankura]]. Since the ''punthi'' was found shorn of its pages including the opening and ending ones, its original name could not be ascertained. A slip inside the ''punthi'' reveals that it was initially preserved in the royal library of [[Bishnupur, Bankura|Bishnupur]] under the name of Sri Krishna Sandarva. However, the ''punthi'', edited and rechristened as Shreekrishna Kirtana by Bidvatballava, was published by [[Vangiya Sahitya Parishad]] in 1916.

==Origin==
The Sri Krishna Kirtana of Boru Chandidas was deeply influenced by the [[Vishnu Purana]], the popular folk-literature of the period&lt;ref name=s1&gt;Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007). ''Bangala Sahityer Itihas'', Vol.I, {{Bn icon}}, Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, {{ISBN|81-7066-966-9}}, pp.120-154&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gitagovindam]] by [[Jaydeva]]. The influence of other [[Purana]]s like the [[Padma Purana]] and the [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]] and the Vaishnava scriptures is also substantial. There is a strong affinity of popular folk literature of the time in the style of the verse.

==Contents==
Sri Krishna Kirtana consists of 417 Bengali ''pada''s (verses) and 133 (total 161, 28 shlokas are repeated twice) Sanskrit ''shloka''s, which were also probably composed by the poet. The extant work is divided into 13 ''khanda''s (sections), namely, ''Janma'' (birth), ''Tamvula'' (piper betel which was considered as a token of love in that time), ''Dana'' (tax-collection), ''Nauka'' (boat), ''Bhara'' (burden), ''Vrindavana'', ''Yamuna'', ''Bana'' (arrow), ''Vamshi'' (flute) and ''Radha Viraha'' (estrangement of Radha) (the last khanda is not named by the poet).&lt;ref name=s1/&gt; ''Yamuna khanda'' is further divided into three sub-sections. The first sub-section is ''Kaliya Damana khanda'' (coercion of Kaliya, the snake-demon section), and the third sub-section is ''Hara khanda'' (necklace section). The name of the second sub-section has not been found in the manuscript, but its subject matter is Radha's ''vastraharana'' (stealing Radha's robes). ''Bhara Khanda'' consists of  a sub-section, named ''Chatra khanda'' (umbrella section). Three characters, [[Krishna]], [[Radha]] and Badayi, the messenger interrelate the plot of the play. Dialogues and counter-dialogues in ''payar'' and ''tripadi'' meters have added to the dramatic quality of Sri Krishna Kirtana.

==Story==
{{Hinduism}}
Shrikrsnakirtan is a lyrical composition involving Radha and Krishna; its storyline is not based on the [[Bhagavata Purana]], but the popular erotic folk-songs, known as the ''dhamali''s.&lt;ref name=s1/&gt; However, Baru Chandidas managed to add substantial originality, making it a masterpiece of medieval [[Bengali literature]]. He gives the yearning of Radha a distinctly [[Bengal]]i rendition, and in the process captures much of the social conditions of the day.

'''Spiritism''' is a [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualistic]] [[philosophy]] and religion codified in the 19th century by the French [[educator]] Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail, under the [[pen name]] [[Allan Kardec]]; it proposed the study of "the nature, origin, and destiny of spirits, and their relation with the corporeal world".&lt;ref name=proceedings&gt;Moreira-Almeida, Alexander (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cinemanafloresta.com.br/paralisia-do-sono/ “Paralisia do sono"] Revisado.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1619158/Allan_Kardec_and_the_Development_of_a_Research_Program_in_Psychic_Experiences ''Allan Kardec and the development of a research program in psychic experiences'']. Proceedings of the Parapsychological Association &amp; Society for Psychical Research Convention. Winchester, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritism soon spread to other countries, having today 35 countries represented in the [[International Spiritist Council]].&lt;ref&gt;International Spiritist Council, Members website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritism postulates that humans are essentially [[Soul|immortal spirits]] that temporarily inhabit physical bodies for several necessary incarnations to attain moral and intellectual improvement. It also asserts that spirits, through passive or active [[mediumship]], may have beneficent or malevolent influence on the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Lucchetti G, Daher JC Jr, Iandoli D Jr, Gonçalves JP, Lucchetti AL. [http://www.amebrasil.org.br/2011/sites/default/files/34_8_Lucchetti_745-755%20published.pdf ''Historical and cultural aspects of the pineal gland: comparison between the theories provided by Spiritism in the 1940s and the current scientific evidence.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409002849/http://www.amebrasil.org.br/2011/sites/default/files/34_8_Lucchetti_745-755%20published.pdf |date=2014-04-09 }}. Neuro Endocrinol Lett. 2013;34(8):745-55. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522019 Indexed on PubMed].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term first appeared in Kardec's book, ''[[The Spirits Book]]'', which sought to distinguish Spiritism from [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref name=proceedings/&gt;

Spiritism has influenced a social movement of healing centers, charity institutions and hospitals involving millions of people in dozens of countries, with the greatest number of adherents in Brazil.&lt;ref name=proceedings/&gt;
Spiritism was also very influential in the new Vietnamese religion called [[Cao Đài]] or Caodaism, born in 1926 after three spirit mediums received messages that identified Allan Kardec as a prophet of a new universal religion.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Janet Alison 2015. The Divine Eye and the Diaspora: Vietnamese Syncretism Becomes Transpacific Caodaism. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. p. 15, 36, 45, 51,63. {{ISBN|978-0-8248-5140-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Spiritism is based on the five books of the [[Spiritist Codification]] written by French educator Hypolite Léon Denizard Rivail under the [[pseudonym]] Allan Kardec, in which he reported observations of phenomena at [[séance]]s that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence (spirits). His work was later extended by writers such as [[Léon Denis]], [[Gabriel Delanne]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Ernesto Bozzano]], [[Gustav Geley]], [[Chico Xavier]], [[Divaldo Pereira Franco]], [[Emídio Brasileiro]], [[Alexandr Aksakov]], [[William Crookes]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Albert de Rochas]], and [[Amalia Domingo Soler]]. Kardec's research was influenced by the [[Fox sisters]] and the use of [[ouija|talking boards]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Interest in [[Mesmerism]] also contributed to early Spiritism.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Swedenborg===
{{Main|Emanuel Swedenborg}}
[[File:Emanuel Swedenborg full portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Emanuel Swedenborg]], 75, holding the manuscript of ''Apocalypsis Revelata'' (1766).]]
Emanuel Swedenborg (January 29, 1688 – March 29, 1772) was a [[Christian]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[scientist]], [[philosopher]], [[clairvoyance|seer]], and [[theologian]]. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.

Swedenborg, however, warned against seeking contact with spirits. In his work ''Apocalypse Explained,'' #1182.4, he wrote, "Many persons believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. But those who believe this, and desire to do so, are not aware that it is associated with danger to their souls."&lt;ref&gt;http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/apocalypsis-explicata/contents/11820&lt;/ref&gt; See also ''Heaven and Hell'' #249&lt;ref&gt;http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/de-coelo-et-de-inferno/contents/2490&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Swedenborg is often cited by Spiritists as a major precursor for their beliefs.

===Fox sisters===
{{Main|Fox sisters}}
[[File:Fox sisters.jpeg|thumb|[[Fox sisters]], ''left to right:'' Margaret, Kate, Leah]]

Sisters Catherine (1838–92), Leah (1814–90) and Margaretta (1836–93) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism. The daughters of John and Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family began to hear unexplained rapping sounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Kate and Maggie conducted channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or [[psychography]], and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Skeptics suspected this was deception and fraud, and sister Margaretta eventually confessed to using her toe-joints to produce the sound. Although she later recanted this confession, she and her sister Catherine were widely considered discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called Spiritualism, which contributed significantly to Kardec's ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Talking boards===
{{Main|Ouija}}
{{See also|Table-turning}}
After the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the "Spiritual Telegraph".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Planchette]], the precursor of the pencil-less [[Ouija]] boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.&lt;ref name="sargent"&gt;[[Epes Sargent (poet)|Sargent, Epes]], [https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich ''Planchette or, The Despair of Science''], Roberts Brothers, Boston, 1869&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Mesmer===
{{Main|Franz Mesmer}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Anton Mesmer]]]]

Franz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 – March 5, 1815) discovered what he called ''magnétisme animal'' ([[animal magnetism]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which became known as ''mesmerism''. The evolution of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] (1795–1860) to develop [[hypnotism]] in 1841.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Spiritism incorporated various concepts from [[Mesmerism]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} among them [[faith healing]] and the energization of water to be used as a medicine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Difference from spiritualism==
Although there are many similarities, Spiritism differs from spiritualism in a number of ways.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In ''[[What Is Spiritism?]]'', Kardec calls spiritism a science dedicated to the relationship between incorporeal beings (spirits) and human beings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Thus, some Spiritists see themselves as not adhering to a religion, but to a philosophical doctrine with a scientific fulcrum and moral grounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Another author in the Spiritualist movement, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] included a chapter&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1926). ''The History of Spiritualism''. New York: G.H. Doran, Co&lt;/ref&gt; about Spiritism in his book ''History of Spiritualism'', in which he states that Spiritism is Spiritualist, but not vice versa.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} As a consequence, many Spiritualist works are widely accepted in Spiritism, particularly the works of 19th-century physicists [[William Crookes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[William Crookes]]. (1874). ''Researches on the Phenomena of Spiritualism''. Burns, London&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oliver Lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Lodge]]. (1930). ''The Reality of a Spiritual World''. E. Benn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Spiritist Codification===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
{{Main|Spiritist Codification}}
The basic doctrine of Spiritism ("the Codification") is defined in five of Allan Kardec's books:

* ''[[The Spirits Book|The Spirits' Book]]''—defines the guidelines of the doctrine, covering concepts such as [[God]], [[Spirit]], [[Universe]], [[Man]], [[Society]], [[Culture]], [[Morals]] and [[Religion]];
* ''[[The Mediums' Book]]''—makes claims about the mechanics of the spiritual world, such as the processes involved in channeling spirits, techniques to be developed by [[Mediumship|mediums]];
* ''[[The Gospel According to Spiritism]]''—comments on the [[Gospel]]s, highlighting passages that Kardec believed represent the ethical fundamentals shared by all religious and philosophical systems;
* ''[[Heaven and Hell (Allan Kardec)|Heaven and Hell]]''—purports to provide interviews with spirits of deceased people intending to establish a correlation between the lives they led and their conditions in the beyond;
* ''[[The Genesis According to Spiritism]]''—attempts to reconcile religion and science, dealing with three major conflicts between the two: the origin of the universe (and of life, as a consequence) and the concepts of [[miracle]] and [[premonition]].

Kardec also wrote a brief introductory pamphlet (''[[What Is Spiritism?]]'') and was the most frequent contributor to the ''Spiritist Review''. His essays and articles were posthumously collected into the ''Posthumous Works''.

===Fundamental principles===
As defined in ''[[The Spirits' Book]]'', the main principles of spiritism are:
* "God is the Supreme Intelligence-[[Primum movens|First Cause]] of all things."&lt;ref name=Kardec63&gt;Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "God is eternal, immutable, immaterial, unique, all powerful, sovereignly just and good."&lt;ref name=Kardec32&gt;Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A spirit is not an abstract, undefined being, only to be conceived of by our thought; it is a real, circumscribed being, which, in certain cases, is appreciable by the senses of sight, hearing, and touch."&lt;ref name=Kardec32 /&gt;
* "All Spirits are destined to attain perfection by passing through the different degrees of the spirit-hierarchy. This amelioration is effected by incarnation, which is imposed on some of them as an expiation, and on others as a mission. Material life is a trial which they have to undergo many times until they have attained to absolute perfection"&lt;ref name=Kardec33&gt;Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A spirit's successive corporeal existences are always progressive, and never retrograde; but the rapidity of our progress depends on the efforts we make to arrive at the perfection."&lt;ref name=Kardec33 /&gt;
* "The soul possessed its own individuality before its incarnation; it preserves that individuality after its separation from the body."&lt;ref name=Kardec33 /&gt;
* "On its re-entrance into the spirit world, the soul again finds there all those whom it has known upon the earth, and all its former existences eventually come back to its memory, with the remembrance of all the good and of all the evil which it has done in them."&lt;ref name=Kardec33 /&gt;
* "Spirits exert an incessant action upon the moral world, and even upon the physical world; they act both upon matter and upon thought, and constitute one of the powers of nature, the efficient cause of many classes of phenomena hitherto unexplained or misinterpreted."&lt;ref name=Kardec33 /&gt;
* "Spirits are incessantly in relation with men. The good spirits try to lead us into the right road, sustain us under the trials of life, and aid us to bear them with courage and resignation; the bad ones tempt us to evil: it is a pleasure for them to see us fall, and to make us like themselves."&lt;ref name=Kardec33-34&gt;Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 33, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The moral teaching of the higher spirits may be summed up, like that of Christ, in the gospel maxim, 'Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you;' that is to say, do good to all, and wrong no one. This principle of action furnishes mankind with a rule of conduct of universal application, from the smallest matters to the greatest."&lt;ref name=Kardec35&gt;Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kardec, the Spiritist [[moral]] principles are in agreement with those taught by [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kardec, Allan, ''The Gospel Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine'' {{ISBN|0-9649907-6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals such as [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Paul the Apostle]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Gandhi]] are also sometimes considered{{clarify|date=December 2014}} by the Spiritists.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Spiritist philosophical inquiry is concerned with the study of moral aspects in the context of an eternal life in spiritual evolution through reincarnation, a process believers hold as revealed by Spirits.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Sympathetic research on Spiritism by scientists{{weasel inline|date=December 2014}} can be found in the works of [[Oliver Lodge]], [[William Crookes]], [[William Fletcher Barrett]], [[Albert de Rochas]], Emma Bragdon, Alexander Moreira-Almeida and others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--four people born in the nineteenth century and two relatively unknown 'doctors' sounds like a misleading appeal to authority--&gt;

===Basic tenets===
The five chief points of the Spiritism are:&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Schofield. (2003) ''Modern Spiritism: Its Science and Religion''. Kessinger Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is a God, defined as "The Supreme Intelligence and Primary Cause of everything";
# There are Spirits, all of whom are created simple and ignorant, but owning the power to gradually perfect themselves;
# The natural method of this perfection process is [[reincarnation]], through which the Spirit faces countless different situations, problems and obstacles, and needs to learn how to deal with them;
# As part of Nature, Spirits can naturally communicate with living people, as well as interfere in their lives;
# Many planets in the universe are inhabited.

The central tenet of Spiritism is the belief in ''spiritual life''. From this perspective, the spirit is eternal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorespiritism.com/Philisophy_What%20are%20Spirits_Origin.htm|title=New Page 1|website=www.explorespiritism.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018}} and evolves through a series of incarnations in the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorespiritism.com/REINCARNATIONANDSPIRITISM.htm|title=Reincarnation According to Spiritism|website=www.explorespiritism.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritist views of Jesus===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Spiritists consider [[Jesus]] to be the greatest moral example for humankind. They believe he incarnated on earth to demonstrate the path to achieve spiritual perfection.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In this way, Spiritism identifies as a form of Christianity, claiming it is based on Jesus Christ's teachings,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} despite having an interpretation that differs from those held by mainstream Christian denominations. The Gospels are studied and interpreted in Spiritism;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} it asserts that some of Jesus' words and actions are clarified in the light of the spiritual phenomena (presented as law of nature, and not as something miraculous).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Mediumship===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Spiritists assert that communication between the spiritual world and the material world happens all the time, to varying degrees{{clarify|date=December 2014}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} They believe that some people barely sense what the spirits tell them in an entirely instinctive way, and are not aware about their influence. In contrast, they believe that [[Mediumship|mediums]] have these natural abilities highly developed, and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly, or through writing (known by Kardecists as [[psychography]] or [[automatic writing]]).(See The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec Chapters X to XIII)&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Mediums&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritist practice==
{{Main|Spiritist practice}}
Kardec's works do not establish any rituals or formal practices. Instead, the doctrine suggests that followers adhere to some principles common to all religions. The religious experience within spiritism is, therefore, largely informal.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Meetings===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The most important types of practices within Spiritism are:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* Regular meetings&amp;mdash;with a regular schedule, usually on evenings, two or three times a week. They involve a short lecture followed by some interactive participation of the attendees. These meetings are open to anyone;
* [[Spiritist séance|Medium meetings]]&amp;mdash;usually held after a regular meeting, only those deemed prepared or "in need" are expected to attend;
* Youth and children's meetings&amp;mdash;once a week, usually on Saturday afternoons or Sunday mornings; the Spiritist equivalent to Protestant Christian Sunday schools;
* [[Spiritist healing|Healing]];
* Lectures&amp;mdash;longer, in-depth lectures to a broader audience on subjects thought to be "of general interest", sometimes at theatres or ballrooms, often given by guest speakers;
* Special meetings&amp;mdash;séances held discretely, intended to conduct some worthy work;
* Spiritist week and book fairs.

===Organization===
{{Main|Spiritist centre}}

Spiritist associations have various degrees of formality, with some groups having local, regional, national or international scope.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Local organizations are usually called ''[[Spiritist centre]]s'' or ''Spiritist societies''. Regional and national organizations are called ''federations''{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, such as the Federação Espírita Brasileira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.febnet.org.br|title=Federação Espírita Brasileira / FEB - Conteúdo espírita em artigos, notícias, estudo, pesquisa, especialmente para você.|author=FEB TI|work=febnet.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Federación Espírita Española;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espiritismo.cc|title=Federación Espírita Española - Espiritismo|work=espiritismo.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; international organizations are called ''unions''{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, such as the Union Spirite Française et Francophone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perso.orange.fr/union.spirite|title=Orange|work=orange.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--need better source indicating that the examples given are actually *representative* of broader usage of 'federation' and 'union'--&gt; Spiritist centres (especially in Brazil) are often active book publishers and promoters of [[Esperanto]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--Is Esperanto ''relevant'' to spiritism, or this just TRIVIA?--&gt;

For many of its followers, the description of Spiritism is three-fold:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} science&lt;!--this is pseudoscience, not science--&gt;, for its studies on the mechanisms of mediumship; philosophy, for its theories on the origin, meaning and importance of life; and religion&lt;!--this contradicts the opening statement of the paragraph--&gt;, for its guidance on Christian behavior which will bring spiritual and moral evolution to mankind. Spiritism is not considered a [[religion]] by some of its followers because it does not endorse formal adoration, require regular frequency or formal membership&lt;!-- and claims not to be opposed to science, instead trying to harmonize with it [no distinction - many unscientific religions make this claim]--&gt;. However, the mainstream scientific community does not accept Spiritism as scientific, and its belief system fits within the definition of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Smith. (2009). ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit''. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Spiritism has adherents in many countries, including Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Jamaica, Japan, Portugal, Spain, United States, and particularly in [[Latin America]]n countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers.&lt;ref&gt;David Hess.

In Brazil, the movement has become widely accepted, largely due to [[Chico Xavier]]'s works.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The official Spiritist community there has about 20 million [[adept]]s,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} although some elements of spiritism are more broadly accepted and practiced in various ways by three times as many people across the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Some statistics{{weasel inline|date=December 2014}} suggest an adherence to Spiritist practices by 40 million people in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Kardec's Spiritism: Home for Healing and Spiritual Evolution - Emma Bragdon, PhD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--can we have an impartial source?--&gt;

In the Philippines, there is the Union Espiritista Cristiana de Filipinas, Incorporada (Union of Christian Spiritists in the Philippines, Inc.), which was founded at the turn of the 1900s and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1905. The religious organization, which uses human mediums to communicate with spirits that have already attained purity or divinity for moral and spiritual guidance, has tens of thousands of members and worship centers in many parts of the country, mostly in Northern Luzon, Central Luzon and the National Capital Region. Its motto: "Towards God through wisdom and love." Its doctrine: "Without charity (good deed), there is no possible salvation." It uses the Holy Bible as the basis of its teachings, supplemented by messages from divine spirits.

==Criticisms==

===Before World War I===
{{one source|section|date=June 2014}}
Since its early development, Spiritism has attracted criticism. Kardec's own introductory book on Spiritism, ''[[What is Spiritism?]]'', published only two years after ''[[The Spirits' Book]]'', includes a hypothetical discussion between him and three idealized critics, "The Critic", "The Skeptic", and "The Priest", summing up much of the criticism Spiritism has received. The broad areas of criticism relate to [[charlatan]]ism, [[pseudoscience]], [[Christian heresy|heresy]], [[witchcraft]], and [[Satanism]]. Until his death, Kardec continued to address these issues in various books and in his periodical, the ''Revue Spirite''.

Later, a new source of criticism came from [[Occult]]ist movements such as the [[Theosophical Society]], a competing new religion,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even naïve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/corson/cors-lt1.htm |title= Letter to Prof. Hiram Corson |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Blavatsky |first= H. P. |authorlink= Madame Blavatsky |date= 1875-02-16 |work= Some Unpublished Letters of H. P. Blavatsky |publisher= Theosophical University Press Online Edition |quote= In my eyes, Allan Kardec and Flammarion, Andrew Jackson Davis and Judge Edmonds, are but schoolboys just trying to spell their A B C and sorely blundering sometimes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar period===
{{one source|section|date=June 2014}}
During the [[interwar period]] a new form of criticism of Spiritism developed. [[René Guénon]]'s influential book ''The Spiritist Fallacy'' criticized both the more general concepts of [[Spiritualism]], which he considered to be a superficial mix of [[moralism]] and [[spiritual materialism]], as well as Spiritism's specific contributions, such as its belief in what he saw as a [[René Descartes#Dualism|post-Cartesian]], [[Modernity|modernist]] concept of [[Reincarnation#Contemporary perspectives|reincarnation]] distinct from and opposed to its two western predecessors, [[metempsychosis]] and [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Guénon |first= René |authorlink= René Guénon |others= trans. Alvin Moore, Jr. and Rama P. Coomaraswamy |title= The Spiritist Fallacy |origyear= 1923 |series= Collected Works of René Guénon |date= 2004-06-25 |publisher= Sophia Perennis Books |location= Hillsdale, NY |isbn= 0-900588-71-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post–World War II===
The Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraph 2117) states that "''Spiritism'' often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it".&lt;ref name="Catechism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm#2117 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |accessdate= 2015-02-02 |publisher=Holy See }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], Catholic priests [[Carlos Kloppenburg]] and [[Oscar González Quevedo]], among others, have written extensively against Spiritism from both a doctrinal and parapsychological perspective. Quevedo, in particular, has sought to show that Spiritism's claims of being a science are invalid. In addition to writing books on the subject,&lt;ref name="paranobr"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ceticismoaberto.com/paranormal/parapsicologia_brasil.htm |title= Parapsicologia no Brasil: Entre a cruz e a mesa branca |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Machado |first= Dr. Fátima Regina |publisher= Ceticismo Aberto |language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also hosted television programs debunking supposed paranormal phenomena, most recently in a series that ran in 2000 on [[Rede Globo|Globo]]'s news program, [[Fantástico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.terra.com.br/istoegente/24/reportagens/rep_quevedo.htm |title= Quevedo, o Mr. M de batina |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Guerrero |first= Cesar |date= 2000-01-17 |work= IstoÉ Gente |publisher= Editora Três |language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian Spiritist, Hernani Guimarães Andrade&lt;!--Unless a person's *doctorate* is directly related to the field, citing them as a Dr is an *appeal to authority*--&gt;, has in turn written rebuttals to these criticisms.&lt;ref name="paranobr" /&gt;

[[Scientific skepticism|Scientific skeptics]] also frequently target Spiritism in books, media appearances, and online forums, identifying it as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;!--identification of spiritism as pseudoscience is a widely held mainstream view, not an 'accusation'--&gt; &lt;!--Former Spiritist [[Waldo Vieira]], accepting this criticism but not the idea that it cannot become a science, left Spiritism willing to investigate the [[Out-of-body experience|OBE]]-phenomenon in a new approach, called Projectiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Stoll |first = Sandra Jacqueline |year = 2002 |title = Religião, ciência ou auto-ajuda? trajetos do Espiritismo no Brasil |journal = Revista de Antropologia |volume = 45 |issue = 2 |publisher = Departamento de Antropologia FFLCH/USP |location = São Paulo, Brazil |doi = 10.1590/S0034-77012002000200003 |language = Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; [If he "left Spiritism", his defense of OBE is out-of-scope]--&gt;

==Chico Xavier==
{{Main|Chico Xavier}}
[[File:Statue de Chico Xavier, ville de Pedro Leopoldo.jpg|thumbnail|Monument to [[Chico Xavier]] in '' Chico Xavier Square'', [[Pedro Leopoldo]] City.]]

[[Chico Xavier]] (April 2, 1910 – June 30, 2002) was a popular Spiritist [[Mediumship|medium]] and [[philanthropist]] in [[Brazil]]'s spiritism movement who wrote more than 490 books and over 10,000 letters to family members of deceased people, ostensibly using [[Automatic writing|psychography]]. His books sold millions of copies, all of which had their proceeds donated to charity. They purportedly included poetry, novels, and even scientific treatises, some of which are considered by Brazilian Spiritist followers to be fundamental for the comprehension of the practical and theoretical aspects of [[Allan Kardec]]'s doctrine. One of his most famous books, ''[[Astral City: A Spiritual Journey|The Astral City]]'', details one experience after dying. The book became a movie in 2010 available in multiple languages in addition to over 15 other movies.&lt;!--Dead promotional web link removed--&gt;

==In popular culture==
The following works contain concepts related to Spiritist beliefs:

===Films===
* ''[[Chico Xavier (film)|Chico Xavier]]'', Brazilian film, casting [[Nelson Xavier]] and Ângelo Antônio. A box office success in Brazil, it tells the story of Brazilian medium Chico Xavier.
* ''[[Nosso Lar (film)|Nosso lar]]'', (literally "Our Home", but distributed under the title ''Astral City: A Spiritual Journey'' internationally) is a 2010 Brazilian film directed by Wagner de Assis, based on the novel of the same name by Chico Xavier about spiritual life after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467388/|website=IMDB|title=Astral City: A Spiritual Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soap operas===
In Brazil, a number of [[soap opera]]s have plots incorporating Spiritism.
* "A Viagem" (''The Journey''), produced in 1976/77 by [[Tupi TV]], involving mediumship, death, obsession, reincarnation, etc. It was remade by Globo TV in 1994.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* "Alma Gêmea" (''Soulmate''), produced in 2005/06 by [[Rede Globo]], tells of a woman who dies and is reborn to find her soulmate again.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* "O Profeta" (''The Prophet''), produced in 1977/78 by Tupi TV and remade by Globo TV (2006/07), included spiritism as one of the philosophies trying to explain the main character's gifts, including being able to predict the future.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* "Duas Caras" (''Two-Face''), aired by Rede Globo in 2007/8, includes a character named Ezekiel, who is a [[Pentecostalism|born-again Christian]] challenged by manifestations of his [[mediumship]].&lt;!--'includes a character...' [if it is only a tenuous subplot, should not be listed]--&gt;
* "Escrito nas Estrelas" (''Written in the Stars''), ongoing as of July 2010, includes various Spiritist themes including reincarnation, spirit evolution, and mediumship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* "Além do Tempo" (''Beyond Time''), ongoing as of October 2015, also includes many Spiritist themes, including a second phase in which the characters reincarnate, in order to show the ongoing fights between them, and also that in future incarnations, your social class changes, being that low class characters come back as rich people and vice versa.

'''St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church''' is a Roman Catholic parish on the southwest side of Belize City, [[Belize]], Central America. 
[[File:San Martin de Porres huaycan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|St. Martin de Porres]]
==Foundation==
In 1968 [[History of Roman Catholicism in Belize#Jesuits|Jesuit]] Fr. Bill Messmer, pastor of St. Ignatius Church in South [[Belize City]], opened a school to accommodate students in the west part of his parish. Jesuit Fr. Thomas Thro began celebrating Mass in homes in the area and in 1971 construction began on a building to accommodate a church on the ground floor and rectory above, the beginning of [[St. Martin de Porres]] parish. St. Martin was chosen as the church’s patron because of his lifelong care for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Belize| url =http://www.jesuit.org/Assets/Publications/File/JBSummer2013.pdf|page=10|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
By 2015 parish grounds covered a square block and included a new church, with the original building housing the parish office and Jesuit residence. There is also a day care center, three school buildings housing pre-school through eighth grade accommodating 825 students, a soccer field, and a basketball court. Community service programs include Hand in Hand Ministries of Belize, which has built hundreds of homes for those in need,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Hand in Hand| url =http://myhandinhand.org/immersion-trips/belize/|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]] program with its Drop-In Center for seniors and its Outreach Center to feed the hungry and serve the youth of the southwest side. Further programs include Project Heal counselling and remedial learning program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Project Heal| url =http://stmartinsbelize.org/page/project-heal|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Centre for Community Resource Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =CCRD| url =http://stmartinsbelize.org/page/ccrd|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sisters of Mercy|Mercy Clinic]] began at St. Martin's but moved to a new residence off Coney Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =St. Martins video| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFa7YpgGAmE

'''''The Jewish Post &amp; News''''' of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]], is [[Western Canada]]'s first Anglo-Jewish newspaper, so described because its language was English rather than [[Yiddish]] though its concerns were those of the [[Jewish]] community.

Founded in 1925, it fought a heated battle with the Winnipeg-based ''Western Jewish News'', another English-language weekly begun a few weeks after ''The Post'' in 1925, and ''Der Yiddishe Vorte'' (''The Israelite Press''), a Yiddish-language weekly started in 1911 that for many years was published as a daily. All three served Jewish communities from Northern Ontario to the [[Rocky Mountains]] with both news and advertising.

''The Israelite Press'' reverted to a weekly half-English, half-Yiddish weekly in the early post-[[Second World War]] years, finally ceasing publication in 1976.

''The Western Jewish News'' was founded in 1926 by Sam Berg and engaged in a fierce fight for advertising with the ''Post'' for the next six decades until it was purchased by ''The Jewish Post'' in 1986, resulting in the paper's current name of ''The Jewish Post &amp; News''.

''The Jewish Post &amp; News'' is owned by Bernie Bellan. He had owned it with his late brother its former editor, Matt Bellan.

In August 2007, the newspaper changed its publication schedule from weekly to bi-weekly.

'''''The Yokai King''''' is an American 13-episode television miniseries starring [[Shin Koyamada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qab.co.jp/news/2013111147701.html |title=Begun filming The Yokai King, starring by Shin Koyamada |publisher=Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series created by Mark Hattori is based on the  Japanese supernatural [[folklore]] characters called [[Yōkai]]. It was mainly filmed in various locations of [[Okinawa, Japan]] in 2014.

==Plot==
[[Yokai]] are a class of supernatural creatures that have long held a prominent place in [[Japanese folklore]]. They come in a variety of forms - from hideous demons to mischievous creatures to heroes with supernatural powers. They are sometimes dangerous to humans since Yokai are not restrained by the laws of nature and those who are not already part animal, have the ability to shape shift.

The legend goes that IPPEI (Shin Koyamada) was found by his foster father in a coconut shell on a beach. Although he was brought up as a normal boy, IPPEI could see nature’s spirits, including [[Kijimuna]] invisible to human eyes. As with many legendary heroes Ippei was initially unaware of his supernatural talents and therefore his destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/articles/TKY201311120321.html |title=沖縄発ドラマ「妖怪キング」米で放映へ |publisher=The Asahi Shimbun Company |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=November 13, 2013 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Scientology==
===Celebrity Centre===
Davis previously worked for the [[Sea Org]] as a non-uniformed member.&lt;ref name="inside" /&gt; According to a Church of Scientology [[press release]], in 2001 Davis was the [[Celebrity Centre]]'s Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =[[Church of Scientology]]  | title =Celebration Gives Clue Why Young Hollywood Loves Scientology - 'Joy of Creating' Inspires Artistic Creations at Star-Studded Event  | work =[[Press release]]  | publisher =PR Newswire  | date =2001-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the chief spokesperson of the [[Church of Scientology]] from 2005 to 2011, a position previously held by [[Mike Rinder]].&lt;ref name="lwright" /&gt;

On June 13, 2003, Davis went with actor and Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Kurt Weiland]], director of external affairs for Scientology's [[Office of Special Affairs]] and Scientology vice president of communications,&lt;ref name="morton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyp0825" /&gt; to meet with then-[[United States]] [[Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]].&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;{{cite book|last =Morton| first =Andrew| authorlink =Andrew Morton (writer)| title =[[Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography]]| publisher =[[St. Martin's Press]]| year =2008| location =[[New York City|New York]] | pages =243, 317| isbn =0-312-35986-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyp0825"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Staff | title =Tom 'Incensed' Sumner's Wife | work =[[New York Post]] | page =14 | publisher =N.Y.P.

===Representative to the media===
Davis accompanied ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Janet Reitman along with former head of Scientology's [[Office of Special Affairs]] [[Mike Rinder]] on a tour of the [[Gold Base]] in [[Hemet]], [[California]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/inside-scientology-20110208  | title=Inside Scientology | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | date= February 23, 2006 | first=Janet | last=Reitman | accessdate = 2006-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Davis gained international attention from events surrounding the making of a [[Documentary (film)|documentary]] about Scientology entitled "[[Scientology and Me]]", screened as an installment of the [[BBC]] public affairs series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]''.&lt;ref name="bbcman"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2078503,00.html | title=The BBC man, the Scientologist&amp;nbsp;— and the YouTube rant | publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' | date= May 13, 2007 | accessdate =2006-07-16 | location=London | first=David | last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Panorama'' reporter, [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]], reported that he met with Davis early on and could not reach agreement with him on whether individuals attacking Scientology should be interviewed for the film, and whether the program should refer to Scientology as a "cult".&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt; As the BBC documentary was filmed, Scientologists made a parallel documentary, a camera crew shadowing Sweeney and chronicling his work.&lt;ref name="bbcman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21751818-601,00.html  | title=Nine denies church motive | publisher=[[The Australian]] | date= May 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rebuked"/&gt; Davis made allegations against ''Panorama'' and the [[BBC]] that they were "spying" on the church of Scientology and harassed the reporter, [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] by stalking him to various meetings with critics but he never filed a report against Sweeney.

While Sweeney was visiting the Scientology exhibition "[[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death]]", Davis accused him of being biased and of having been too easy on one of his interviewees.&lt;ref name="bbcman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rebuked"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a46509/bbc-man-rebuked-over-scientology-show.html | title=BBC man rebuked over Scientology show | publisher=[[Digital Spy]] | date= May 14, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeney lost his temper.&lt;ref name="bbcman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rebuked"/&gt; The Church of Scientology released the resulting footage, showing Sweeney becoming angry, on [[YouTube]], and the counter-documentary attacking Sweeney's methods was posted to UK politicians and media organizations.&lt;ref name="bbcman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rebuked"/&gt; ''Panorama'' responded by posting its own YouTube clip, showing Davis losing his temper and abruptly ending an interview when Sweeney used the words "sinister cult".&lt;ref name="bbcman"/&gt; The BBC subsequently stated it was happy that on the whole, Sweeney had performed his work in a fair and proper manner.&lt;ref name="bbcman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rebuked"/&gt;

In the same BBC documentary, Davis interrupted when celebrity members are asked about [[Xenu]], saying: "None of us know what you're talking about. It's loony. It's weird." In a May 8, 2008 appearance on [[CNN]], Davis was asked by CNN's [[John Roberts (television reporter)|John Roberts]] if "... the basic tenet of the Church of Scientology is to rid the body of space-alien parasites, to clear oneself"; Davis responded: "Well, John, does that sound silly to you? I mean it’s unrecognizable to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2008/05/08/sot.davis.interview.cnn?iref=videosearch|title=Scientologists decry threats: CNN's John Roberts talks to a Scientology spokesman who says an anonymous group is terrorizing the church|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=May 8, 2008

Tommy Davis is just doing what other mouthpieces have said in the past."&lt;ref name="ortega0508"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2008/05/scientology_spo.php|title=Scientology Spokesman Gives Non-Answers on CNN|work=Runnin' Scared|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=May 8, 2008|last=Ortega|first=Tony|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161008/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2008/05/scientology_spo.php|archivedate=May 9, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 Davis was interviewed by [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] Nathan Baca for [[KESQ-TV]] and was again asked about the [[Operating Thetan|OT III]] materials containing the Xenu myth.&lt;ref name="kesq"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Baca  | first =Nathan  | title =Scientology Official Addresses Works of L. Ron Hubbard|work =[[KESQ-TV]]  | publisher =www.kesq.com  | date =March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When read an excerpt from Hubbard's writing, Davis told Baca "I'm familiar with the material," and said that the issue at hand was "the confidential scriptures of the Church,"&lt;ref name="kesq" /&gt; and thus refused to elaborate on the issue.

After the death of [[Jett Travolta]], son of celebrity Scientologist [[John Travolta]], the Church of Scientology came under fire from critical groups accusing it of being irresponsible; Jett had died of a seizure soon after being taken off his medication.&lt;ref name="tanner" /&gt; Davis responded by denying that Scientology keeps people from taking medications, and also denying that it [[Medical claims in Scientology doctrine|claims to cure disease]].&lt;ref name="tanner" /&gt; He stated in one interview, "The bottom line is that Scientologists seek conventional medical treatment for medical conditions."&lt;ref name="tanner"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Tanner  | first =Lindsey ([[Associated Press]])  | title =Silence fuels speculation over death of Travolta's son  | work =Waterloo Region Record  | page =C10  | date =January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was interviewed by journalist [[Martin Bashir]] for the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'', in a piece called "Inside Scientology", which aired in October 2009.&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; Davis ripped off his microphone and stormed off the set of the interview after he was questioned about whether he believed that 75 million years ago a galactic ruler called Xenu brought individuals to Earth and killed them in volcanoes.&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Wallace  | first =Kenyon   | title =Canadian filmmaker Haggis renounces Scientology  | work =[[National Post]]  | publisher =The National Post Company  | date =October 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An hour before the segment aired he appeared at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] headquarters and demanded that a security guard let him in.&lt;ref name="Flackout"&gt;{{cite news  | last =  | first =   | title =Scientology flack strikes out | work =[[New York Post]]  | publisher =[[New York Post]]  | date =October 27, 2009  | url =http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/scientology_flack_strikes_out_SJRNhKFTPOnH567DZ4Q4CO  | accessdate =  2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security called ''Nightline'' representatives, and they met with Davis who demanded the segment not be aired and he be allowed to speak with Bashir.&lt;ref name="Flackout"/&gt; Davis was told that Bashir could not meet with him and that the interview was already edited and would air.&lt;ref name="Flackout"/&gt; The following week director [[Paul Haggis]] accused Davis of lying on [[CNN]], when Davis said [[disconnection]] did not happen, but Haggis and his wife were "ordered" by Scientology to disconnect from family.&lt;ref name="HaggisDavisLie"&gt;{{cite news   | last =  | first =   | title =Paul Haggis on Scientology: 'Morally reprehensible' | work =[[The Los Angeles Times]]  | publisher =  | date =October 27, 2009  | url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2009/10/paul-haggis-on-scientology-morally-reprehensible.html | accessdate =  2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haggis, in the same letter, announced he was leaving the organization.&lt;ref name="HaggisDavisLie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =  | first =   | title =Director Haggis says he's leaving Scientology | work =[[CNN]]  | publisher =  | date =October 27, 2009  | url =http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/27/paul.haggis.scientology/ | accessdate =  2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis responded that Haggis's claims were based on misunderstandings.&lt;ref name="NewFace"&gt;{{cite news   | last =  | first =   | title =Scientology's New Face | work =[[The Daily Beast]]  | publisher =  | date =October 27, 2009  | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-27/scientologys-new-face/  | accessdate =  2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Larry Anderson (actor)|Larry Anderson]], an actor, spoke with Davis about getting his money and leaving Scientology, which was reported in the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| title =Larry Anderson says he's leaving Scientology| work =[[St. Petersburg Times]]| language =| publisher =| page =| date =January 24, 2010| url =http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2010/reports/scientology_anderson/| accessdate =2010-03-16| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100819084259/http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2010/reports/scientology_anderson/| archivedate =August 19, 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Childs | first = Joe | author2 = Thomas C.

Davis was raised as a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]], but his mother joined Scientology when he was 3 years old. Davis claims that after taking two courses at the Celebrity Centre, he became a Scientologist at the age of 17. He attended Harvard School For Boys in Los Angeles, a private Episcopal church-affiliated college preparatory school (now called Harvard-Westlake School). In 1990, he was accepted at [[Columbia University]]. He attended college for a semester, but dropped out to join the Sea Org.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early life===
William Lee Barefield III was born and raised in Dallas, TX. As a young boy, Lee had dreams of being a professional athlete or a famous rapper, and he began to hone his lyrical skills at the age of 12. "I rapped about random stuff… how hot I was, how many girls I could pull," Lee says.&lt;ref name="reachrecords1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reachrecords.com/artists/show/Trip-Lee |title=Reach Records |publisher=Reach Records |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But upon giving his life to Christ, at age 14, his focus changed from fortune, fame, and women to serving and ministering the Gospel.

Lee slowly recognized that all of his life should be centered around Christ. "One day, I just decided, I'm only doing Christian hip hop. Rappers like [[The Ambassador (rapper)|Ambassador]] and [[Da' T.R.U.T.H.]] helped provide a model for how I would begin to do that," he says.&lt;ref name="reachrecords1"/&gt; He also had an immense desire to learn and teach the Word of God, so he became a leader in his youth group where he preached his first sermon at age 17.&lt;ref name="reachrecords1"/&gt;

In 2004, Lee met [[Lecrae]] at a concert; months later, after talking and building with each other, Lecrae began to disciple him. While still in high school, Lee was given the opportunity to pen a few devotionals for the [[Reach Records]] website that dealt with theological matters and showcased his spiritual maturity.&lt;ref name="reachrecords1"/&gt;

===Music career===
Lee signed with Reach Records, and his debut album, ''[[If They Only Knew]]'', was released a few days after his high school graduation.&lt;ref name="reachrecords1"/&gt; His first full-length album introduced hip-hop fans to his distinct southern sound, unique delivery, and gospel-saturated lyrics. That same year, he was also featured on the Dove Award-nominated, ''[[Jesus Muzik]]'' with label mate Lecrae.

His second album, ''[[20/20 (Trip Lee album)|20/20]]'', was released in 2008 and garnered much success, breaking into the Billboard Top 200 and reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Christian albums chart and No. 4 on the Gospel chart. Back with his third studio album, ''[[Between Two Worlds (Trip Lee album)|Between Two Worlds]]'', Lee offers a collection of reflections on life in a fallen world. His hope is that his reflections not only resonate with listeners, but also point to Jesus as the hero.

Since his first album release, Lee has traveled the world doing concerts for thousands of listeners, and his last three summers have been spent on national and international tours with his Reach label mates. His Christ-centered hip-hop message has also built a platform for him among churches and other Christian organizations, which has led to numerous opportunities to preach and teach at conferences and other events.

Lee released two new singles "Brag On My Lord" and "King Like Mine", the latter featuring Alex Medina, on March 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoiland|first=Tim|title=Two New Singles Released|url=http://reachrecords.com/blog/post/Heat-3-Trip-Lee-Brag-On-My-Lord|publisher=Reach Records|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trip Lee released his fourth full-length studio album, entitled ''[[The Good Life (Trip Lee album)|The Good Life]]'' on April 9, 2012. The album featured various notable Christian artists, such as [[Sho Baraka]] (formerly signed with Reach Records), [[J.R. (musician)|J.R]]., Lecrae, J.Paul, [[KB (rapper)|KB]], [[Andy Mineo|Andy "C-Lite" Mineo]], [[Jimmy Needham]], [[V. Rose]], [[Natalie Sims|Suzy Rock]], Jai, and Leah Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bradley |url=http://reachrecords.com/blog/post/Trip-Lee-The-Good-Life-In-Stores-Now |title=Trip Lee - The Good Life in Stores Now |publisher=Reach Records |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a continuation to the album, Lee has worked with Moody Publishers and has authored a book titled ''The Good Life'', to be released October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bradley |url=http://reachrecords.com/blog/post/Trip-Lees-Debut-Book-Release-The-Good-Life |title=Trip Lee's Debut Book Release The Good Life  |publisher=Reach Records |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2012 Lee announced he would be "stepping away" from music altogether.&lt;ref name="away from music"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rood|first=Philip|title=Trip Lee talks Unashamed Tour 2012, 'The Good Life' book, and what's next.|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/features/interviews/5155-trip-lee-talks-unashamed-tour-2012-the-good-life-book-and-whats-next|work=[[Rapzilla]]|accessdate=November 21, 2012|date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unashamed 2012 tour with the Reach Records roster was his final tour before pursuing a career as an author and pastor.&lt;ref name="away from music" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Though I'm excited we have...|url=https://twitter.com/djofficialdj/status/269654690386542592|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=November 21, 2012|author=DJ Official|date=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=@nbferraro His last tour.

On October 27, 2014, Trip Lee released his fifth studio album, ''Rise''. On January 27, 2015 he released his second book called ''Rise: Get Up and Live in God's Great Story'' to accompany the album. He was part of the Winter Jam Tour 2016 along with KB and [[Tedashii]] in the central and eastern parts of the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

On December 9, 2016 Trip Lee released the album titled, "The Waiting Room." The title was inspired by a line in the song, "Take Me There" from his, "The Good Life" album. He says the album highlights the fact that, as a Christian, his life is much like sitting in a waiting room, looking for what God has ahead.

'''Women's mosques''' ({{zh|t=[清真]女寺|p=[Qīngzhēn] nǚ sì}}) have existed in [[China]] for several hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Jaschok: "[http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps124.pdf Religious Women in a Chinese City: Ordering the past, recovering the future - Notes from fieldwork in the central Chinese province of Henan]". ''QEH Working Paper Series - QEHWPS125'', S.8&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in the Chinese provinces of [[Henan]], [[Shanxi]] and [[Hebei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icampus.ucl.ac.be/claroline/backends/download.php?url=L1RyYXZhdXhfMjAwNS0yMDA2L011c3VsbWFucy5kb2M%3D&amp;cidReset=true&amp;cidReq=ASI2302 icampus.ucl.ac.be "Les minorités musulmanes en Chine" ("Les mosquées féminines")] (accessed April 1st, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries beyond China also have women-only mosques, but they are rare.

In China, separate women-only mosques were built by the Muslim communities there. This is in contrast to Muslim communities outside China, where usually men and women will use the same mosque, with gender-segregated washing and prayer rooms. At the end of the [[Ming dynasty]] and early [[Qing dynasty]], [[Hui people|Hui women]] had begun to form their own mosques.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.chinalink.de/service/pinboard/messages/15173.shtml chinalink.de: Die chinesische Frau] (accessed April 1st, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving ''nǚsì'' in China, is Wangjia Hutong Women's Mosque of [[Kaifeng]], which dates to 1820.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/07/21/128628514/female-imams-blaze-trail-amid-chinas-muslims NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;

For religious reasons, Hui communities had started to cultivate more theological learning among the women. As a result, a portion of the female Muslims who had experienced a religious education, gradually incorporated Islamic observances into their daily religious activities, and this produced the establishment of women's mosques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-GHJS200706053.htm cnki.com.cn: Beijing lishi shang de Qingzhen nüsi] ((accessed April 1st, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 20th century, there were separate places of worship as women-only mosques. They are a special form of the sacred building, either as a separate institution or mosque attached to an existing larger mosque. Their managers are women, wives of the [[imam]] of a larger mosque. The commonly used title for it is ''Shiniang'' (师娘).&lt;ref&gt;cf. "[http://www.1001-idee.eu/de/unterrichtsmaterialien/nach-themen/geschichte/muslime-in-china/weibliche-imame.html Weibliche Imame]", source: Jaschok, Maria and Jingju Shui, p. 287-292, German translation from English: C. Schneider (accessed April 1st, 2010) and Ingrid Mattson: "[http://macdonald.hartsem.edu/muslimwomensleadership.pdf Can a Woman be an Imam?]" - macdonald.hartsem.edu (accessed April 1st, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Female Islamic clerics are referred to as ''nü [[ahong]]'' (女阿訇) in Chinese.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5233">The presence of a group of [[female disciples of Jesus]] at the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] is found in all four [[Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]. There have been different interpretations how many and which women were present. It may be different from different gospels

==Interpretations==
Matthew and Mark, who speak of "many women" present at the crucifixion, mention three individually at the death of Jesus and two at his burial. Matthew describes the third individual present at the death as the mother of the sons of Zebedee, without naming her. Mark's third individual is called Salome. Luke mentions none individually. John mentions four individually, including Jesus' mother Mary, who is not mentioned by the other evangelists.

The indication in {{bibleverse||John|19:25}} could be interpreted as referring to two, three or four women. There are difficulties against taking it as presenting a double apposition, with "his mother" being Mary of Clopas, and "his mother's sister" being Mary Magdalene. If the women are three, then there is a single apposition, with Mary of Clopas presented as the sister of Jesus' mother (despite the awkwardness of having two sisters bearing the same name) or else, since Hebrew and Aramaic had no specific word for "cousin", presented as her cousin or her sister-in-law, with Clopas considered the brother of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. If there is no apposition, the women are four, as understood by [[Tatian]] and the [[Peshitta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown]], ''The Death of the Messiah'' (Chapman 1994 {{ISBN|0-225-66748-7}}), pp. 1014–15&lt;/ref&gt; If the last interpretation is chosen, the accounts that the four evangelists give of individual women present at the crucifixion are:

Mary Magdalene is mentioned by all the evangelists apart from Luke, who mentions no individual.  Mary, mother of James and Joseph/Joses is mentioned by Matthew and Mark. The others are mentioned by one evangelist only: Mary, the mother of Jesus; Mary, the mother of the sons of Zebedee; Salome; a sister of Mary, mother of Jesus; Mary of Clopas. Attempts have been made to consider all these, except Mary, the mother of Jesus, as different designations of the same woman.

Thus Salome has been supposed to be the same as Mary of Clopas and to have been the mother of Zebedee's sons [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], and a half-sister or sister-in-law of Mary the mother of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Clarke]], ''The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments'', Volume 3 1837. p. 794: "That Cleophas, called also Alpheus, married a sister of the blessed virgin, called also Mary, by whom he had the above issue ; and that ... among whom were Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome was"&lt;/ref&gt; See [[The Three Marys#The three daughters of Saint Anne]].

==Etymology and significance==
Yoni (Sanskrit: योनि), states Monier Monier-Williams, appears in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and other Vedic literature in the sense of feminine life-creating regenerative and reproductive organs, as well as in the sense of "source, origin, fountain, place of birth, womb, nest, abode, fire pit of incubation".&lt;ref name=mmw858/&gt;&lt;ref name=renou&gt;Louis Renou (1939), ''L'acception première du mot sanskrit yoni (chemin)'', Bulletin de la Société de Linguistique de Paris, volume 40, number 2, pages 18-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders1985p229&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Dale Saunders|title=Mudra: A Study of Symbolic Gestures in Japanese Buddhist Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeE9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA229|year=1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01866-9|pages=88-89, 229 note 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contextual meanings of the term include "race, caste, family, fertility symbol, grain or seed".&lt;ref name=mmw858/&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders1985p229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Davenport|title=Tel quel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTgXAQAAMAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Éditions du Seuil|pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a spiritual metaphor and icon in Hinduism for the origin and the feminine regenerative powers in the nature of existence.&lt;ref name=lochtefeld784/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazzone2012p27"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Amazzone|title=Goddess Durga and Sacred Female Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PM_TNDu8NHUC |year=2012|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5314-5|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' metaphorically calls the metaphysical concept ''[[Brahman]]'' as the "yoni of the universe",&lt;ref name=Klostermaier214/&gt; which [[Adi Shankara]] states in his commentaries means the material cause and "source of the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Cornille|title=Criteria of Discernment in Interreligious Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpkNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|date=1 August 2009|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-63087-441-4|page=148}}, Quote: "In his commentaries on BSBh 1.4.27, Sankara cites various passages where brahman is described as the yoni (source) of the universe: 'The word yoni is understood in the world as signifying the material cause as in 'the earth is the yoni (source) of the herbs and trees'. The female organ too (called yoni) is a material cause of the foetus by virtue of its constituents."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Indologists Constance Jones and James D.

==History==
[[File:Linga-Yoni.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Lingam]]-yoni at the [[Cát Tiên sanctuary]], Lâm Đồng province, Vietnam]] 
The reverence for yoni, state Jones and Ryan, is probably pre-Vedic. Figurines recovered from Zhob valley and dated to the 4th millennium BCE show pronounced breasts and yoni, and these may have been fertility symbols used in prehistoric times that ultimately evolved into later spiritual symbols.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p516"/&gt; According to David Lemming, the yoni worship tradition dates to the pre-Vedic period, over the 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE period.&lt;ref name="Leeming2001p205"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leeming|title=A Dictionary of Asian Mythology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QRwgAQAAQBAJ |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-512053-0 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yoni has served as a divine symbol from ancient times, and it may well be the oldest spiritual icon not only in India but across many ancient cultures.&lt;ref name="Amazzone2012p27"/&gt; Some in the orthodox Western cultures, states the Indologist Laura Amazzone, have treated the feminine sexual organs and sexuality in general as a taboo subject, but in Indic religions and other ancient cultures the yoni has long been accepted as profound cosmological and philosophical truth, of the feminine potential and power, one mysteriously interconnected with the natural periodic cycles of moon, earth and existence.&lt;ref name="Amazzone2012p27"/&gt;

[[File:Jatalinga sur cuve à ablution (musée Guimet) (5153565239).jpg|thumbnail|A ''jatalinga'' with ''yoni''.]]
The yoni is considered to be an abstract representation of [[Shakti]] and [[Devi]], the creative force that moves through the entire universe.

=== Archaeology ===
The colonial era archaeologists [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] and [[Ernest J. H. Mackay|Ernest Mackay]] proposed that certain polished stones with holes found at Harappan sites may be evidence of yoni-linga worship in Indus Valley Civilization.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985&gt;{{cite journal|author=Asko Parpola|authorlink=Asko Parpola|title = The Sky Garment - A study of the Harappan religion and its relation to the Mesopotamian and later Indian religions| journal= Studia Orientalia| publisher= The Finnish Oriental Society| volume=57| year=1985|pages=101-107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham]] dispute whether such artifacts discovered at the archaeological sites of Indus Valley sites are yoni.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Llewellyn Basham|title=The Wonder that was India: A Survey of the History and Culture of the Indian Subcontinent Before the Coming of the Muslims|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LscvuQEACAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson (1986 Reprint)|isbn=978-0-283-99257-5|page=24}}, Quote: "It has been suggested that certain large ring-shaped stones are formalized representations of the female regenerative organ and were symbols of the Mother Goddess, but this is most doubtful."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jones and Ryan state that lingam/yoni shapes have been recovered from the archaeological sites at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], part of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|page=516|author=Constance Jones, James D.

Later discoveries at the Dholavira site, and further studies, have proven that these were pillar components because the "truncated ring stones with holes" are integral architectural components of the pillars. However, states McIntosh, the use of these structures in architecture does not rule out their simultaneous religious significance as yoni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane McIntosh|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PA287 |year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-907-2|pages=286–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Indologist [[Asko Parpola]], "it is true that Marshall's and Mackay's hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable".&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states "with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall's report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually-oriented aspects of Harappan religion".&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; However, adds Parpola, a re-examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay's hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; The "finely polished circular stand" found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, maybe because it was made from wood which did not survive.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt;

===Sanskrit literature===
The term ''yoni'' and its derivatives appear in ancient medicine and surgery-related Sanskrit texts such as the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' and ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''. In this context, ''yoni'' broadly refers to "female sexual and procreative organs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld|title=The Sitapitta Group of Disorders (Urticaria and Similar Syndromes) and Its Development in Ayurvedic Literature from Early Times to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhc028gqXKIC |year=2010|publisher=Barkhuis|isbn=978-90-77922-76-7|pages=106 note 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Indologists Rahul Das and Gerrit Meulenbeld known for their translations and reviews of ancient Sanskrit medical and other literature, ''yoni'' "usually denotes the vagina or the vulva, in a technical sense it also includes the uterus along with these; moreover, yoni- can at times mean simply 'womb, uterus' too, though it [Cakrapanidata's commentary on ''Sushruta Samhita''] does so relatively seldom".&lt;ref name="MeulenbeldLeslie1991p57"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rahul Das|author2=Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld|editor=Johannes Bronkhorst|title=Medical Literature from India, Sri Lanka, and Tibet (Volume VIII)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujeZuPyMNYEC |year=1991|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-09522-5|pages=57 note 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amit Rupapara et al, ''yoni-roga'' means "gynecological disorders" and ''yoni-varti'' means "vaginal suppository".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rupapara | first=Amit | last2=Donga | first2=Shilpa | last3=Harisha | first3=CR | last4=Shukla | first4=Vinay | title=A preliminary physicochemical evaluation of Darvyadi Yoni Varti: A compound Ayurvedic formulation | journal=AYU (An International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda) | volume=35 | issue=4 | year=2014 | doi=10.4103/0974-8520.159048 | pmid=26195915| pages=467-470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' dedicates its 30th chapter in Chikitsa Sthana to ''yoni-vyapath'' or "gynecological disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bhavana KR| title=Medical geography in Charaka Samhita |journal=Ayu |year= 2014 |volume= 35 |issue= 4 |pages= 371-377 | pmid=26195898 | doi=10.4103/0974-8520.158984| pmc=4492020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Charaka-samhita : translated into English (Part IV) | author1 = Charaka|author2= Avinash Chandra Kaviratna (Translator)| year=1978| volume=4|pages=1852-1863 with footnotes}}, Quote: "Yoni literally means vulva, and vyapat means disease, but the term yonivyapat has been used in a larger sense - meaning all diseases of the female organs of generation manifested in vulva. The chapter [of Charaka Samhita] comprises treatment of the diseases of uterus, vagina [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In sexuality-related Sanskrit literature, as well as Tantric literature, yoni connotes many layers of meanings. Its literal meaning is "female genitalia", but it also encompasses other meanings such as "womb, origin and source".&lt;ref name="Blackledge2004p45"/&gt; In some Indic literature, yoni means vagina,&lt;ref name="Blackledge2004p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Korda | first=Joanna B. | last2=Goldstein | first2=Sue W. | last3=Sommer | first3=Frank | title=Sexual Medicine History: The History of Female Ejaculation | journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=7 | issue=5 | year=2010 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01720.x | pages=1968–1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organs regarded as "divine symbol of sexual pleasure, the matrix of generation and the visible form of Shakti".&lt;ref name="Blackledge2004p45"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Blackledge|title=The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f2d-11Y_u3cC&amp;pg=PA45|year= 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3455-8|pages=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalist literature===
The colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas T.

Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to "proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction".&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p56"/&gt;

According to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first ''Kamasutra'' translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to "anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away."&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=500-502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had "a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies" and they became "ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature".&lt;ref name=doniger2011p505&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=499-505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p505/&gt;

== Iconography and temples ==
Within [[Shaivism]], the sect dedicated to the god [[Shiva]], the Shakti is his consort and both have aniconic representations: lingam for Shiva, yoni for Shakti. The yoni iconography is typically represented in the form of a horizontally placed round or square base with a lipped edge and an opening in the center usually with a cylindrical lingam. Often, one side of this base extends laterally, and this projection is called the ''yoni-mukha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=H. Daniel Smith|author2=Mudumby Narasimhachary|title=Handbook of Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints: popular in contemporary South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3_XAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate symbol for yoni that is commonly found in Indic arts is the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]], an icon found in temples.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p516"/&gt;

The yoni is one of the sacred icons of the Hindu Shaktism tradition, with historic arts and temples dedicated to it. Some significant artworks related to yoni include the [[Lajja Gauri]] found in many parts of India and the [[Kamakhya Temple]] in Assam. Both of these have been dated to the late 1st millennium CE, with the major expansion of the Kamakhya temple that added a new sanctum above the natural rock yoni attached to an older temple being dated to the 16th-century Koch dynasty period.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p45"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imma Ramos|title=Pilgrimage and Politics in Colonial Bengal: The Myth of the Goddess Sati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRhdDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-84000-2|pages=45–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:6th century Lajja Gauri relief from Madhya Pradesh India, lotus head with female body.jpg|thumb|6th-century Lajja Gauri icon from [[Madhya Pradesh]].

The Lajja Gauri is an ancient icon that is found in many Devi-related temples across India and one that has been unearthed at several archaeological sites in South Asia. The icon represents yoni but with more context and complexity. According to the Art Historian Carol Bolon, the Lajja Gauri icon evolved over time with increasing complexity and richness. It is a fertility icon and symbolizes the procreative and regenerative powers of mother earth, "the elemental source of all life, animal and plant", the vivifier and "the support of all life".&lt;ref name=bolon1997/&gt; The earliest representations were variants of aniconic pot, the second stage represented it as the three-dimensional artwork with no face or hands but a lotus-head that included yoni, chronologically followed by the third stage that added breasts and arms to the lotus-headed figure. The last stage was an anthropomorphic figure of a squatting naked goddess holding lotus and motifs of agricultural abundance spread out showing her yoni as if she is giving birth or sexually ready to procreate.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p50"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imma Ramos|title=Pilgrimage and Politics in Colonial Bengal: The Myth of the Goddess Sati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRhdDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-84000-2|pages=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bolon1997&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Radcliffe Bolon|title=Forms of the Goddess Lajjā Gaurī in Indian Art|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XW0fPQAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1311-3|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodrigues2003p272"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillary Rodrigues|title=Ritual Worship of the Great Goddess: The Liturgy of the Durga Puja with Interpretations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUlNAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272 |year=2003|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5400-8|pages=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bolon, the different aniconic and anthropomorphic representations of Lajja Gauri are symbols for the "yoni of  Prithvi (Earth)", she as womb.&lt;ref name=bolon1997p40&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Radcliffe Bolon|title=Forms of the Goddess Lajja Gauri in Indian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIZADNu6U-MC |year=2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-04369-2|pages=40–47, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lajja Gauri iconography – sometimes referred to by other names such as Yellamma or Ellamma – has been discovered in many South Indian sites such as the [[Aihole]] (4th to 12th-century), [[Nagarjunakonda]] (4th century Lajja Gauri inscription and artwork), [[Balligavi]], [[Elephanta Caves]], [[Ellora Caves]], many sites in [[Gujarat]] (6th century), central India such as [[Nagpur]], northern parts of the subcontinent such as [[Bhaktapur]] (Nepal), Kausambi and many other sites.&lt;ref name="Bolon2010p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Radcliffe Bolon|title=Forms of the Goddess Lajj?

===Kamakhya Temple===
The Kamakhya temple is one of the oldest ''shakta pithas'' in South Asia or sacred pilgrimage sites of the Shaktism tradition.&lt;ref name="Urban2009p2"/&gt; Textual, inscriptional and archaeological evidence suggests that the temple has been revered in the Shaktism tradition continuously since at least the 8th-century CE, as well as the related esoteric tantric worship traditions.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban2009p2"/&gt; The Shakta tradition believes, states Hugh Urban – a professor of Religious Studies primarily focusing on South Asia, that this temple site is the "locus of goddess' own yoni".&lt;ref name="Urban2009p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh B.

The regional tantric tradition considers this yoni site as the "birthplace" or "principal center" of tantra.&lt;ref name="Urban2009p2"/&gt; While the temple premises, walls and mandapas have numerous depictions of goddess Kamakhya in her various roles, include those relating to her procreative powers, as a martial warrior, and as a nurturing motherly figure (one image near the western gate shows her nursing a baby with her breast, dated to 10th-12th century). The temple sanctum, however, has no idols.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p45"/&gt; The sanctum features a yoni-shaped natural rock with a fissure and a natural water spring flowing over it.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban2009p2"/&gt; The Kamakhya yoni is linked to the Shiva-Sati legend, both mentioned in the early puranic literature related to Shaktism such as the ''Kalika Purana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh B.

Every year, about the start of monsoons, the natural spring turns red because of iron oxide and ''sindoor'' (red pigment) anointed by the devotees and temple priests. This is celebrated as a symbol of the menstruating goddess, and as the [[Ambubachi Mela]] (also known as ''Ambuvaci'' or ''ameti''), an annual fertility festival held in June.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban2009p170"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh B.

The temple stays closed for three days and then reopens to receive [[pilgrim]]s and worshippers. The sanctum with the yoni of the goddess is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for the Shakti tradition, attracting between 70000 to 200000 pilgrims during the ''Ambubachi Mela'' alone from the northeastern and eastern states of India such as West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It also attracts yogis, tantrikas, sadhus, aghoris as well as other monks and nuns from all over India.&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban2009p170"/&gt;

[[Darśana|Darshan]] at this temple is performed not by sight as in most temples, but by touch. There is a large cleft, a yoni in the bedrock moistened by water flowing upward from an underground spring, generally covered by cloths and ornate [[dupatta|chunris]], flowers, and red [[sindoor]] powder.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Devotees and pilgrims offer items for worship directly to the [[goddess]], then touch her and drink water from the [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]. They then receive a [[tilak]] and [[prasad]] by the attending [[priest]]. After completing darshan, devotees light lamps and incense outside the temple. Like other temples, worship is not considered complete until the temple is circumambulated clockwise.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Yantra===
