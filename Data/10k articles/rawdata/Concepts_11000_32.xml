{{Buddhism|collapsed=1}}
'''Āsava''' is a [[Pali]] term ([[Sanskrit]]: Āśrava) that is used in Buddhist scripture, philosophy, and psychology, meaning "influx, canker." It refers to the mental defilements of sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and ignorance, which perpetuate ''samsara'', the beginningless cycle of rebirth, ''dukkha'', and dying again.

''Asavas'' are also translated as "karmic predilections" and "karmic propensities" in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97342-3|pages=73–74 with notes 1 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also common in Jainism literature, and sometimes appears equivalently as ''Asrava'' or ''Anhaya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Govind Chandra Pande|title=Studies in the Origins of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__1kiAonBzIC|year=1995|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1016-7|pages=361–362 with note 253}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buddhism rejects the karma and asava theories of Jainism, and presents a different version instead.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;

==Etymology==
According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]],
{{quote|The commentaries derive the word from a root ''su'' meaning "to flow." Scholars differ as to whether the flow implied by the prefix ''ā'' is inward or outward; hence some have rendered it as "influxes" or "influences," others as "outflows" or "effluents."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}}}

==Meaning==

===Samsara===
{{main|Samsara (Buddhism)}}
The āsavas are mental defilements that perpetuate ''samsara'', the beginningless cycle of rebirth, ''dukkha'', and dying again. Carr and Mahalingam:
{{quote|inflow, influx, influence; mental bias or canker, cankers that keep one bound to the world of ''[[samsāra]]; used particularly in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Carr|Mahalingam|1997|p=948}}}}

Bikkhu Bodhi:
{{quote|A stock passage in the suttas indicates the term's real significance independently of etymology when it describes the ''āsavas'' as states "that defile, bring renewal of existence, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, aging and death" (MN 36.47; I 250). Thus other translators, bypassing the literal meaning, have rendered it "cankers," "corruptions," or "taints."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}}}

De Silva further explains:
The word canker suggests something that corrodes or corrupts slowly. These figurative meanings perhaps describe facets of the concept of ''āsava'': kept long in storage, oozing out, taint, corroding, etc.{{sfn|De Silva|2000|p=75}}

===Number of ''āsavas''===
Some Pali canons mention three ''āsava'' that sustain karmic flow. These three mentioned in the Nikāyas are "karmic propensities for sensual pleasures (''kāmāsava''), karmic propensities for existence (''bhavāsava''), and karmic propensities for ignorance (''avijjāsava'')".&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}

Other Pali texts mention four ''āsava'', adding ''diṭṭhāsava'' or "karmic propensities for a viewpoint or perspective".&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;{{sfn|De Silva|2000|p=75}}

In either case, these texts assert that the complete destruction of all these asavas is synonymous with complete Awakening.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;

===Liberation===
According to Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), "Freedom from the 'Āsavas' constitutes [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arahantship]]."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921–25|p=115-16}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi,
{{quote|When the disciple's mind is liberated from the taints by the completion of the path of arhantship, he reviews his newly won freedom and roars his lion's roar: "Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming back to any state of being."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}}}

==Textual appearance==
[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], in his [[Dhammapada (Radhakrishnan translation)|translation of the Dhammapada]], notes that the word "asava" appears in the ''[[Dhammapada]]'' in verses 93, 226, 253, 292, and 293.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1950|p=189}} Verse 226 (chapter 17, verse 6) has been translated by Acharya Buddharakkhita as follows:
{{quote|Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night,&lt;br&gt; 
and are ever intent upon Nibbana – their defilements fade away.{{sfn|Buddharakkhita|1985|p=39}}{{refn|group=note|Radhakrishnan: "6. sadā jāgaramānānam, ahorattānusikkhinam&lt;br&gt;nibbāṇam adhimuttānam, atthaṁ gacchanti āsavā 226."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1950|p=132}}}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6768">'''Asquith Camile Xavier''' was a West Indian-born Briton who ended a [[colour bar]] at [[British Railways]] in [[London]] by fighting to become the first non-white [[train guard]] at [[Euston railway station]] in [[1966]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/15/newsid_3043000/3043439.stm|title=Euston staff 'colour bar' ended|accessdate=2018-07-17|date=1966-07-15|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307123432/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/15/newsid_3043000/3043439.stm|archivedate=2008-03-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oona King]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zzr8r "Asquith's Fight for Equality"], [[BBC Radio 4]], 2016-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= RAILWAY COLOR BAR IS BROKEN IN LONDON |date= July 16, 1966| url=https://nyti.ms/2LsIzEX|publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Phillips]], the chairman of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], said in 2006: "Asquith's stand against discrimination brought to light the inadequacy of early race discrimination laws and persistent widespread discrimination faced by ethnic minorities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-class-hero-633709|title= FIRST-CLASS HERO: Forty years ago, this man changed the face of race relations in Britain after beating a colour bar on the railways |accessdate=2018-07-26|date=2006-07-15|work=The Mirror|publisher=MGN | }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque at the station commemorates his achievement. 

Xavier was born on 18 July 1920 in [[Dominica]], which was then a British colony. He was a member of the [[Windrush generation]] of British African-Caribbean people who migrated to the United Kingdom after the second world war to fill vacancies in service industries. 

==Discrimination==

Xavier joined [[British Railways]]. In 1966 he was working as a guard at [[Marylebone station]] in central London. He applied for a promotion and transfer to work at Euston, but was rejected. A letter from a staff committee at Euston—which was dominated by members of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]]—explained it was because of his colour. Unions and management had informally agreed in the 1950s to ban non-white people from jobs at Euston that involved contact with the public; they could be cleaners and labourers, but not guards or ticket collectors.

The [[Race_Relations_Act_1965|Race Relations Act]] of 1965 had made discrimination on "grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins" unlawful in public places in [[Great Britain]] (but not [[Northern Ireland]]). Xavier could not use this legislation to further his case as it did not cover workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/8/newsid_4457000/4457112.stm|title=1965: New UK race law 'not tough enough' |accessdate=2018-07-26|date=1965-12-08|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier persisted. A union official publicised the rejection by writing a letter of protest to the head of the National Union of Railwaymen on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Colour bar protest over railman.|last=|first=|date=11 July 1966|work=The Times (London, England)|access-date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] wrote to the [[secretary of state for transport]], [[Barbara Castle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1966-07-15/debates/b65aca94-436b-4d17-90a6-3a40aaa9716c/ColouredWorkers|title=Coloured Workers - Hansard|website=hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ask her to direct British Railways to end racial discrimination. 
On 15 July 1966 British Railways announced that colour bars at stations in London had been abandoned. Xavier was offered the job with his pay backdated to May, which was when he had been originally rejected.
Xavier could not take up the job immediately as he was recovering from hospital treatment for an ulcer. He received hate mail and death threats, and asked for police protection. He started work on 15 August 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Mirror Reporter |title=CLOCKING ON .. A RAIL PIONEER |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19660816/024/0004 |accessdate=19 August 2018 |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=16 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Xavier died in 1980 in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;"England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837-2007," database, ''FamilySearch''(&lt;nowiki&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVZ9-G3T1&lt;/nowiki&gt; : 4 September 2014), Asquith Camile Xavier, 1980; from "England &amp; Wales Deaths, 1837-2006," database, ''findmypast''(&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.findmypast.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; : 2012); citing Death Registration, Chatham, Kent, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
[[Oona King]] presented a [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary, "Asquith's Fight for Equality", about his story in 2016—the fiftieth anniversary of his victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oona King]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zzr8r "Asquith's Fight for Equality"], [[BBC Radio 4]], 2016-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[The One Show]] on [[BBC One]] television interviewed Xavier's family and covered the unveiling of the plaque at Euston station that marked his fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b5rtp|title=Busting the colour bar, 06/10/2016, The One Show - BBC One|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bottling''' is when a concert audience throws various objects at the performers onstage. This generally happens at festivals when one act in the lineup is of a different genre or audience from the rest of the bands, especially festivals where the majority of bands are related to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]] music styles.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/readingandleeds2007/story/0,,2155832,00.html|title=Hitting rock bottom|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-06-19 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Jonze | date=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While bottling generally involves empty or full bottles of water, it is also common for bottles to contain [[urine]]. Other items such as garden furniture, [[mud]], [[fireworks]], broken glass, shoes and dead animals have also been recorded as thrown items.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

'''Chakras''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चक्र, [[IAST]]: cakra, [[Pali]]: cakka, lit. ''wheel, circle'') are the various focal points in the [[Subtle Body|subtle body]] used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as [[Tantra]], or the esoteric or inner traditions of [[Indian religion]], Chinese Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Japanese Esoteric Buddhism, and in postmodernity, in [[New Age medicine]], and originally psychologically adopted to the western mind through the assistance of [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref name=britchakra&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/chakra Chakra: Religion], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Etymology==

The very concept of the so-called chakra, etymologically originates directly from the [[Sanskrit]] root चक्र. The "tsschakra" remained in virtual linguistic conformity throughout possible adaptations throughout the relative temporal and linguist adversity of two thousand years.

==History==
{{see also| Yoga|Nadi (yoga)}}
The term ''Chakra'' appears to first emerge within the Vedas, the most authoritative Hindu text, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as ''chakravartin'' or the king who "turns the wheel of his empire" in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography popular in representing the ''Chakras'', states White, trace back to the five symbols of [[yajna]], the Vedic fire altar: "square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Tantra in Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1778-4|page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn 10.136 of the ''Rigveda'' mentions a renunciate [[yogi]] with a female named ''kunamnama''. Literally, it means "she who is bent, coiled", representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the ''Rigveda''. Some scholars, such as David Gordon White and Georg Feuerstein interpret this might be related to [[kundalini]] shakti, and an overt overature to the terms of esotericism that would later emerge in Post-Aryan Bramhanism. the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White|title=Kiss of the Yogini: "Tantric Sex" in its South Asian Contexts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5RwARVMg2_4C |year=2006| publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02783-8|pages=33, 130, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georg Feuerstein 1998 15–17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Georg Feuerstein |title=Tantra: Path of Ecstasy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O6_AwAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2545-1|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D.

Breath channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nāḍi]]) of [[Yoga]] practices are mentioned in the classical [[Upanishads]] of Hinduism dated to 1st millennium BCE,&lt;ref name="YIP14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trish O’Sullivan (2010), ''Chakras''. In: D.A. Leeming, K. Madden, S. Marlan (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'', Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; but not psychic-energy Chakra theories.

The chakra theories of Buddhism and Hinduism differs from the historic Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p102"/&gt; Unlike the latter, the ''chakra'' relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection. The tantric systems envision it as a continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy.

An important subset of subtle-body practices, found particularly in Indian and Tibetan Tantric traditions, and in similar Chinese practices, involves the idea of an internal 'subtle physiology' of the body (or rather of the body-mind complex) made up of channels through which substances of some kind flow, and points of intersection at which these channels come together.

===Contrast with classical yoga===
Chakra and related theories have been important to the esoteric traditions, but they are not directly related to mainstream [[yoga]].

The classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe ''nadi'' and ''cakra'' in a "subtle body" context.&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt; To them, they are the parallel dimension of psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real.

===Hindu Tantra===
{{Main article|Kundalini energy}}
Different esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements chakras, of which a classical system of seven is most prevalent.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p137"/&gt; This seven-part system, central to the core texts of hatha yoga, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature.

The Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called [[Shaktism]]. It is an important concept along with yantras, mandalas and kundalini yoga in its practice. Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an "energy center" within, as well as being a term of group rituals such as in ''chakra-puja'' (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=June McDaniel|title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|pages=96–97, 101–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cakra-based system is one part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as [[laya yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philipp H.

Beyond its original [[Shakta]] milieu, various sub-traditions within the [[Shaiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] schools of Hinduism also developed texts and practices on Nadi and Chakra systems. Certain modern Hindu groups also utilize a technique of circular energy work based on the chakras known as ''kriya yoga''. Followers of this practice include the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] and [[Self Realization Fellowship]], and practitioners are known as ''kriyaban''. Although [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] claimed this was the same technique taught as kriya yoga by [[Patañjali]] in the [[Yoga Sūtras]] and by [[Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (as karma yoga), [[Swami Satyananda]] of the Bihar school disagreed with this assessment and acknowledged the similarities between kriya and taoist inner orbit practices. Both schools claim the technique is taught in every age by an [[avatar]] of god known as [[Mahavatar Babaji|Babaji]]. The historicity of its techniques in India prior to the early twentieth century are not well established. It believed by its practitioners to activate the chakras and stimulate faster spiritual development.

[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]
The esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach five chakras.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; It must be noted, that is possible that a system of Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha and the Usnisa Kamala chakras was absorbed into Tibetan thought, yet any source which alleges the employment of 3rd or manipura, chakra, within the context of thousand year history of broad Tantric monasticism, is here, not only conceptually inadequate, but technically misguided.&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"/&gt; In one development within the Nyingma lineage of the ''Mantrayana'' of Tibetan Buddhism a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: Nirmanakaya (gross self), Sambhogakaya (subtle self), Dharmakaya (causal self), and Mahasukhakaya (non-dual self), each vaguely - yet by no means directly - corresponding to the categories within the [[Shaiva]] ''Mantramarga'' universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|page=40, Table 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"/&gt;

And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamete of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the "organic harmony" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geshe Gelsang Kyatos]], ''Clear Light of Bliss''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as "central to their [[soteriology|soteriological]] process".&lt;ref name=samuel38/&gt; The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called ''yantra yoga'' or '''phrul 'khor''. 

The Chakras in the Tibetan practice are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated buddha counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory Mackenzie|title=New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an Understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or99AgAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-13262-1|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson2009p78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=Historical Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwTnQcFjCQsC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6317-0|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chakras, according to the [[Bon]] tradition, ennable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the [[six realms]] of woe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|page=84}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa lung]] practice embodied in the [[Trul khor]] lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana. [[Yoga]] awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities. In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and a attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.&lt;ref name=twr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Tenzin Wangyal|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlby|first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark|title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion Pub.|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1-55939-176-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light. The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.&lt;ref name=twr/&gt;

===Qigong===
[[Qigong]] ({{linktext|氣功}}) also relies on a similar model of the human body as an [[Energy (esotericism)|esoteric energy system]], except that it involves the circulation of [[qì]] ({{linktext|氣}}, also ''ki'') or life-energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Luk]],  ''Taoist Yoga&amp;nbsp;– Alchemy and Immortality'', Rider and Company, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; The qì, equivalent to the Hindu prana, flows through the energy channels called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], equivalent to the nadi, but two other energies are also important: ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jīng]]'', or primordial essence, and ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'', or spirit energy.

In the principle circuit of qì, called the [[microcosmic orbit]], energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various [[dantian]] (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng, Philip Clart. The Story of Han Xiangzi: the alchemical adventures of a Taoist immortal&lt;/ref&gt; These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or jīng, into qì. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qì into shén, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms shen into [[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], infinite space of void.&lt;ref&gt;Andy James. The Spiritual Legacy of Shaolin Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silat===
Traditional spirituality in the Malay Archipelago borrows heavily from Hindu-Buddhist concepts. In Malay and Indonesian metaphysical theory, the chakras' energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Defensive energy emits outwards from the centre line, while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. This can be applied to energy-healing, meditation, or martial arts. [[Silat]] practitioners learn to harmonise their movements with the chakras, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements.&lt;ref name="Tua"&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of each chakra==
{{Tantric chakras}}

[[File:BalineseChakraBanner.jpg|thumb|A Balinese chakra banner.]]
The more common and most studied esoteric system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra. These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|sushumna nadi]] in Hindu texts, Avadhuti in some Buddhist texts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Samuel|author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this chakra system that was translated in early 20th century by [[Sir John Woodroffe]] (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text ''The Serpent Power''. Avalon translated the Hindu text ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' meaning the examination (nirūpaṇa) of the six (ṣaṭ) chakras (cakra).&lt;ref name="White 2003 221"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids. The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent.&lt;ref name="Banerjea175"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akshaya Kumar Banerjea|title=Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljn1koKa0CQC&amp;pg=PA175|year=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0534-7|pages=175–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the Hindu and Buddhist kundalini or candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra. In Hindu texts she is known as [[Kundalini]], while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or [[Tummo]] (Tibetan: ''gtum mo'', "fierce one").&lt;ref name=johnston40/&gt;

Below are the common new age description of these six chakras and the seventh point known as sahasrara. This new age version incorporates the newtonian colors that were completely unknown when these systems were created. The actual colors for the chakras vary from text to text and do not conform to the newtonian spectrum:

===Sahasrara===

|valign=top|'''[[Sahasrara]]''' ({{lang-sa|सहस्रार}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|Sahasrāra}}, {{lang-en|"thousand-petaled"}}) or '''crown chakra''' is the topmost chakra in the subtle body, located in the crown of the head. In esoteric Hinduism and New Age western systems, it is generally considered to be the highest spiritual center and the state of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the feminine [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] Shakti rises to this point, it unites with the masculine [[Shiva]], the yogi or yogini achieves self-realization and a state of liberating [[samadhi]] is attained. The chakra is symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

|valign=top|'''[[Ajna]]''' ({{lang-sa|आज्ञा}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|Ājñā}}, {{lang-en|"command"}}) also called '''guru chakra or third-eye chakra''' is the subtle center of energy, believed to be located between the eyebrows, located behind it along the subtle (non-physical) spinal column. It is so called because this is the spot where the tantra [[guru]] touches the seeker during the initiation ritual (''saktipata''). He or she commands the awakened kundalini to pass through this center.&lt;ref name=grimes22&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

It is symbolised by a lotus with two petals.&lt;ref name=grimes22/&gt; It is at this point that the two side nadi [[Ida (yoga)]] and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality, the characteristic of being dual (e.g. ''light'' and ''dark'', or ''male'' and ''female'').

It is symbolised by a lotus with twelve petals.&lt;ref name=grimes30/&gt; Within it is a yantra of two intersecting triangles, forming a [[hexagram]], symbolising a union of the male and female as well as being the esoteric symbol for the element of air ([[vayu]]). The seed mantra of air, ''Yam'', is at its center. The presiding deity is Ishana Rudra Shiva, and the Shakti is Kakini.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In esoteric Buddhism, this Chakra is called '''Dharma''' and is generally considered to be the petal lotus of "Essential nature" and corresponding to the second state of [[Four Noble Truths]].&lt;ref name=johnston40/&gt;

In 1918, the translation of two Indian texts: the ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' and the ''Pādukā-Pañcaka'', by Sir [[John Woodroffe]], alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled ''The Serpent Power'' introduced the [[shakta]] theory of seven main chakras in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, ''The Serpent Power'', Dover Publications, pp.317ff&lt;/ref&gt; This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] in his book ''The Chakras''. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular [[Johann Georg Gichtel]], a disciple of [[Jakob Böhme]], and his book ''Theosophia Practica (1696)'', in which Gichtel directly refers to inner ''force centres'', a concept reminiscent of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304194144/http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html|date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hesychasm===

A completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is [[Hesychasm]], a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. Yoga, Immortality and Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.

===New Age===

[[File:Nervous plexi.jpg|thumb|Chakra positions in relation to nervous plexi, from a 1927 textbook]]
In ''[[Anatomy of the Spirit]]'' (1996), [[Caroline Myss]] describes the function of chakras as follows: "Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myss.com/library/chakras/ |title=Myss Library &amp;#124; Chakras |publisher=Myss.com |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the top of the head. [[New Age]] practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of [[consciousness]], a [[classical element]], and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.

The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered [[Wiktionary:locus|loci]] of life [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or [[prana]] (which New Age belief equates with ''[[shakti]]'', ''[[qi]]'' in Chinese, ''ki ''in Japanese, ''koach-ha-guf''&lt;ref&gt;Helena Blavatsky (1892). Theosophical Glossary. Krotona.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hebrew, ''bios ''in Greek, and [[aether (classical element)|''aether'']]'' ''in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Rudolf Steiner]] considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving. He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_c01.html |title=GA010: Chapter I: The Astral Centers |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html |title=GA010: Initiation and Its Results|location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction. He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''How to Know Higher Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chakras and their importance are posited to reside in the psyche. However, there are those who believe that chakras have a physical manifestation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sivananda|first1=Swami|title=Kundalini Yoga: illustrated|date=1991|publisher=Divine Life Society|location=Sivanandanagar, U.P.|isbn=81-7052-052-5|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Osborn, for instance, has described the chakras as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] counterparts to the [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Philip|last2=Osborn|first2=Gary|title=The Shining Ones: the world's most powerful secret society revealed|date=2006|publisher=Watkins|location=London|isbn=1-84293-150-4|pages=44–45|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anodea Judith]] noted a marked similarity between the positions of the two and the roles described for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5n4dkTw7e0QC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Endocrine+chakra#v=onepage&amp;q=Endocrine%20chakra&amp;f=false |title=Wheels of Life: A User's Guide to the Chakra System - Anodea Judith - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Sturgess also links the lower six chakras to specific nerve plexuses along the spinal cord as well as glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgess|first1=Stephen|title=The Yoga Book: a practical guide to self-realization|date=1997|publisher=Element|location=Rockport, Mass.|isbn=1-85230-972-5|pages=19–21}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W.

A '''classification scheme''' is the product of arranging things into kinds of things (classes) or into ''groups'' of classes.

In the abstract, the resulting structures are a crucial aspect of [[metadata]],  often represented as a hierarchical structure and accompanied by descriptive information of the classes or groups. Such a classification scheme is intended to be used for an arrangement or division of individual objects into the classes or groups, and the classes or groups are based on characteristics which the objects (members) have in common.

In [[linguistics]], [[subordinate]] concepts are described as [[hyponym]]s of their respective superordinates; typically, a hyponym is 'a kind of' its superordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Allan (2002, p. 260), Natural language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO/IEC 11179]] metadata registry standard uses classification schemes as a way to classify administered items, such as [[data element]]s, in a [[metadata registry]].

Some quality criteria for classification schemes are:
* Whether different kinds are grouped together. In other words, whether it is a grouping system or a pure classification system. In case of grouping, a subset (subgroup) does not have (inherit) all the characteristics of the superset, which makes that the knowledge and requirements about the superset are not applicable for the members of the subset.
* Whether the classes have overlaps.
* Whether subordinates (may) have multiple superordinates. Some classification schemes allow that a kind of thing has more than one superordinate others don't. Multiple supertypes for one subtype implies that the subordinate has the combined characteristics of all its superordinates. This is called multiple inheritance (of characteristics from multiple superordinates to their subordinates).
* Whether the criteria for belonging to a class or group are well defined.
* Whether the kinds of relations between the concepts are made explicit and well defined.
* Whether subtype-supertype relations are distinguished from composition relations (part-whole relations) and from object-role relations.

==Benefits of using classification schemes==
Using one or more classification schemes for the classification of a collection of objects has many benefits.  Some of these include:
* It allows a user to find an individual object quickly on the basis of its kind or group.
* It makes it easier to detect duplicate objects.
* It conveys [[semantics]] (meaning) of an object from the definition of its kind, which meaning is not conveyed by the name of the individual object or its way of spelling.
* Knowledge and requirements about a kind of thing can be applied to the members of the kind.

==Kinds of classification schemes==
The following are examples of different kinds of classification schemes.  This list is in approximate order from informal to more formal:
* [[thesaurus]] - a collection of categorized concepts, denoted by words or phrases, that are related to each other by narrower term, wider term and related term relations.
* [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] - a formal list of concepts, denoted by controlled words or phrases, arranged from abstract to specific, related by subtype-supertype relations or by superset-subset relations.
* [[data model]] - an arrangement of concepts (entity types), denoted by words or phrases, that have various kinds of relationships. Typically, but not necessarily, representing requirements and capabilities for a specific scope (application area).
* [[network (mathematics)]] - an arrangement of objects in a random graph.
* [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] - an arrangement of concepts that are related by various well defined kinds of relations. The arrangement can be visualized in a [[directed acyclic graph]].

One example of a classification scheme for [[data element]]s is a [[representation term]].

'''Control limits''', also known as '''natural process limits''', are horizontal lines drawn on a [[statistical process control|statistical process]] [[control chart]], usually at a distance of ±3 [[standard deviation]]s of the plotted [[statistic]] from the statistic's [[mean]].

Control limits should not be confused with ''tolerance limits'' or ''specifications,'' which are completely independent of the [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of the plotted sample statistic. Control limits describe what a process is capable of producing (sometimes referred to as the “voice of the process”), while tolerances and specifications describe how the product should perform to meet the customer's expectations (referred to as the “voice of the customer”).

== Use ==

Control limits are used to detect signals in process data that indicate that a process is not in control and, therefore, not operating predictably. 

There are several sets of rules for detecting signals - see [[Control chart]] - in one specification:

A signal is defined as any single point outside of the control limits. A process is also considered out of control if there are seven consecutive points, still inside the control limits but on one single side of the mean.

For [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] statistics, the area bracketed by the control limits will on average contain 99.73% of all the plot points on the chart, as long as the process is and remains in statistical control. A false-detection rate of at least 0.27% is therefore expected.

It is often not known whether a particular process generates data that conform to particular distributions, but the [[Chebyshev's inequality]] and the [[Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality]] allow the inference that for any [[unimodal]] distribution at least 95% of the data will be encapsulated by limits placed at 3 sigma.

'''DRAKON''' is an [[algorithm]]ic [[visual programming language]] developed within the [[Buran program|Buran space project]] following [[ergonomic]] design principles. The language provides a uniform way to represent [[flowchart]]s of any complexity that are easy to read and understand.

The DRAKON Editor, which was released in September 2011, is an implementation of the language available in the public domain. It can be used for creating documentation, or for creating visual programs that can be converted to [[source code]] in other languages.

Unlike [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]'s philosophy, DRAKON's language philosophy is based on being augmented if needed, by using a hybrid language, which can be illustrated as "incrustating code snippets from text language used into shape DRAKON requires". This way, DRAKON always remains a simple visual language that can be used as an augmentation for a programmer who is interested in making their own project code easier to support or other long-term needs for example improving the ergonomics of the coding process or to making code easier to review and understand.

The name DRAKON is the Russian acronym for "Дружелюбный Русский Алгоритмический [язык], Который Обеспечивает Наглядность", which translates to "Friendly Russian algorithmic [language] that illustrates (or provides clarity)". 
The word "наглядность" (pronounced approximately as "naa-glya-dno-st-th") refers to a concept or idea being easy to imagine and understand, and may be translated as "clarity".

The DRAKON language can be used both as a modelling/"markup" language (which is considered a standalone "pure DRAKON" program) and as a programming language (as part of a hybrid language).

Integration of a stricter, "academic", variant of a markup language into programming, such as provided by DRAKON, adds [[syntactic sugar]] allowing users of different programming languages to comprehend each other's contributions to the overall project and even provide commentary if needed.

== History ==
The development of DRAKON started in 1986 and was directed by Vladimir Parondzhanov with the participation of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Academician [[Nikolay Pilyugin|Pilyugin]] [[Academician Pilyugin Center|Center, Moscow]]) and [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] ([[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]]). The language was constructed by formalization, ergonomization and nonclassical structurization of [[flowchart]]s described in the [[ISO]] 5807-85 standard and Russian standard «Гост 19.701-90» and for the development of [[Realtime Programming Language|real time]] programs.&lt;ref name="конференция.com.ua"&gt;[http://конференция.com.ua/pages/view/730 Окулова Л.

''(Here is an incorrect translation. This should be read as "DRAKON language.")''&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal was to replace the specialized languages PROL2 (ПРОЛ2) (used for developing onboard complex software for embedded computer system Biser-4 (Бисер-4) on board Buran),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Штурманы ракет / Под общей редакцией Е.

The work was finished in 1996 (3 years after the Buran project was officially closed), when an automated [[Computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] programming system called "Grafit-Floks" was developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.oberoncore.ru/lib/paper/grafit_A4.pdf Technique of development of algorithms and programms "Grafit-Floks."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This CASE is used since 1996 in many major space programs: an international project [[Sea Launch]], Russian [[orbit insertion]] upper stage [[Fregat]] (Russian: Фрегат, frigate),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laspace.ru/upload/iblock/db0/db01beb741f3e811d58abadbb4fae34a.pdf Морозов В.В., Трунов Ю.В., Комиссаров А.И., Пак Е.А., Жучков А.Г., Дишель В.Д., Залихина Е.Е., Паронджанов В.Д.

The actual real-world experience of building systems with DRAKON remains extremely scarce as only a few very short snippets of code are publicly available.

== Family of DRAKON-languages (hybrid languages) ==
[[File:Icons of Visual Programming Language --DRAKON--.png|thumb|Icons of DRAKON language]]
[[File:Macroicons of Visual Programming Language DRAKON.png|thumb|Macroicons of DRAKON language.]]
DRAKON ({{lang-ru|ДРАКОН}}) is designed with humanistic ideas in mind, as usage of three different languages for the same project was a source of human factor-related hardships such risks of having a mutual misunderstanding.

DRAKON is used not as a single stand-alone language but as a family of hybrid languages, such as DRAKON-C, DRAKON-ASM, DRAKON-Java, etc. All hybrid languages of the DRAKON-family have the uniform graphical syntax, based on flowcharts. The standard graphical syntax provides similarity of drakon-charts for different hybrid languages. The text language used uses its own syntax.

Strict distinction of the graphical and textual syntax along with rich graphics improves flexibility and variety of expressive means of the language. The unification of the rules of the graphical syntax in the hybrid languages secures their conceptual unity.

The basis of the graphical syntax is a graphical alphabet. Graphical elements (graphical letters) of the DRAKON alphabet are called ''icons'' (not symbols). There are 27 icons in the DRAKON graphical alphabet.

DRAKON has not only icons, but also ''macroicons.'' Macroicons are the graphical words of the DRAKON language. Just as words are made up of letters, macroiсons (graphical words) consist of the icons (graphical letters). There are 21 macroicons in the DRAKON language.

Icons and macroiсons are the building blocks for constructing drakon-charts.

The important parts of maсroiсons are valence points ''(in the illustration to the right, they are depicted as little black circles).'' Into these points, icons or microicons can be successively entered and arranged by drakon-editor in neat, orderly vertical rows.

== Design ==
DRAKON was created as a language with a set of rules that would allow to depict algorithms in fields, not necessarily related to computing, being easy to learn. 
* The main reason to the development of the language was emerging risk of misunderstanding, and following errors upon interaction between users of different programming languages in same project (namely, DIPOL, LAX and PROL2, used in the 1980s in Russian space program development).

DRAKON initially uses drakon-chart, which is initially based on a formalization of a traditional flowchart yet with additional functionality for handling code in text language. This technique allows to produce and keep readable flowchart at hand simultaneously with process of making the program in question. 
* It is to note a large multi-purpose program with too large drakon-chart may be harder to be comprehended that a set of small programs that serve same purposes separately; similar problem of maintaining code of a single large program is occasionally referred to as "rule of 30 [lines of code]" among programmers.

=== Purposes ===
While DRAKON is designed to be a tool that allows to comprehend purposes of programs in different programming languages, for illustrative, planning and strategy purposes (mirrored to [[Perl]] programming language's primary function). Drakoncharts can also be made in spoken language with same tools. [http://lurkmore.to/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:Algoritm_pohudeniya_(univ).jpg Example of medical program on reducing body fat] (not translated).

"DRAKON editor" is popular in Russia for being used as a tool for making 'charts without programming language syntax in the medicine field in Russia as a markup language for algorithms of performing actions in certain cases and scenarios. DRAKON allows both create a map-like guide for patients and form instructions for medical personnel.

DRAKON editor takes infographics and flowchart together in a some way: for some purposes DRAKON icons can be augmented a photo inside an icon (which will be placed under icon's text).

== DRAKON algorithm execution animation ==

The picture below illustrated the execution of the silhouette DRAKON algorithm. The algorithm execution is animated by highlighting diagram elements in the running order.

The 'Fishing' silhouette consists of four trees:
* Preparing for fishing.
* Waiting for a bite.
* Fishing work.
* Way back.
The main path of each tree is shown by highlighting thick vertical line which is called a ''skewer.''
Note that each path from the "Fishing" Headline icon (start point) to the End icon (stop point) goes smoothly and continuously without any breaks or interruptions. This animation shows that any human can slide his finger along any route from the Headline icon  to the End one without lifting his finger (or pencil) from the paper or screen.

It means that silhouette control flow graph always has a path from the Headline icon to each vertex (node) of the control flow graph.  Consequently, a silhouette can't have unreachable code in any conditions.

[[File:DRAKON algorithm animation.gif||none|DRAKON algorithm execution is animated by highlighting diagram elements in the running order.]]

== DRAKON Editor ==
DRAKON Editor is software for making DRAKON [[flowchart]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net/|title=DRAKON Editor|website=drakon-editor.sourceforge.net|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for two purposes: documenting [[algorithm]]s and programming. DRAKON Editor is written in [[Tcl|Tcl/Tk]] and runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]].
As a documentation tool, DRAKON Editor helps create diagrams that capture algorithmic knowledge. Such knowledge covers both behaviour of computer systems and procedures not directly related to computers, for example [[medical algorithm]]s and [[business process]]es.
DRAKON Editor can generate [[source code]] from diagrams. This way, DRAKON Editor can be used as an [[Integrated development environment|IDE]].

===Features===
The process of editing in DRAKON Editor is based on free drawing. The user inserts and manipulates primitive shapes such as rectangles, vertical and horizontal lines. The user experience is similar to that of business drawing tools. DRAKON Editor does not prevent the user from violating the rules of DRAKON language. It is possible, however, to perform an automated check of the visual syntax at any time.

DRAKON Editor has an alternative editing algorithm, called "smart mode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net/smart.html|title=Smart editing mode in DRAKON Editor|website=drakon-editor.sourceforge.net|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in the ''smart mode'', the user can change the visual appearance of the diagram without breaking its [[topology]]. In other words, the ''smart mode'' allows to fine-tune the layout of the diagram while keeping the underlying algorithm intact.

DRAKON Editor supports the following [[programming language]]s:
* [[AutoHotKey]]
* [[C (programming language)|C]]
* [[C++]]
* [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]
* [[D (programming language)|D]]
* [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]
* [[Go (programming language)|Go]]
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* [[JavaScript]]
* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]
* [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [[Tcl]]
* [[Verilog]]

For some programming languages, DRAKON Editor generates source code for [[ERIL]] [[data modeling]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net/eril.html|title=The ERIL Language|website=drakon-editor.sourceforge.net|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRAKON Editor can also generate source code for [[Finite-state machine|finite state machines]] represented with the ''silhouette'' construct of DRAKON language.

For Erlang, DRAKON Editor generates [[boilerplate code]] from a visual representation of a ''supervision tree''.

Thanks to the nature of the free drawing principle, DRAKON Editor can produce other types of diagrams including [[class diagram]]s and [[sequence diagram]]s.

== In the German Aerospace Center ==

DRAKON language is used in the [[German Aerospace Center]] for implementation of some critical functions dictated by the safety regulations of the flight tests, where automation is important because of maximum distance to the ground station and the process needs quick automatic execution.

The DRAKON Editor software was using to graphically program flowcharts which were specially checked. C-code was generated from the drakon-charts, for instance, for DRAKON representation of launch detection code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drakon.su/_media/ballon_ap_final.pdf|title=Marc Schwarzbach, Sven Wlach, Maximilian Laiacker.

'''Demico Boothe''' is an [[African American|African-American]] bestselling author of several books.

==Biography==
Born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], he spent nearly 13 years in [[List of U.S. federal prisons|federal prison]] and was released in 2003. He wrote his first book, entitled ''Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?'' while incarcerated, and to date has written and published two other books entitled, ''Getting Out &amp; Staying Out: A Black Man's Guide to Success After Prison'' and ''The Top 25 Things Black Folks Do That We Need To Stop!!!''. The latter was published in January 2009 and received much critical acclaim within the [[African-American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullsurfacepublishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Demico Boothe is a noted expert on many subjects and issues concerning the African-American community, with an emphasis on the U.S. [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]] as it relates to [[Black people|black males]]. On the back of his book ''Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?'', he states that he read and studied over 500 books while he was incarcerated, including the entire [[Webster's dictionary]], [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]], and every alphabetic entry of the 1998 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].

He is slated to release his fourth title with Full Surface Publishing in late 2012.

In [[computer science]] and [[logic]], a '''dependent type''' is a type whose definition depends on a value. A "pair of integers" is a type. A "pair of integers where the second is greater than the first" is a dependent type because of the dependence on the value. It is an overlapping feature of [[type theory]] and [[type system]]s.  In [[intuitionistic type theory]], dependent types are used to encode logic's [[Generalized quantifier|quantifiers]] like "for all" and "there exists". In [[functional programming languages]] like [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Coq]], [[F*_(programming_language) | F*]] , [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], and [[Shen (programming language)|Shen]], dependent types prevent bugs by allowing extremely expressive types.

Two common examples of dependent types are dependent functions and dependent pairs.  A dependent function's return type may depend on the ''value'' (not just type) of an argument.  A function that takes a positive integer "n" may return an array of length "n".  (Note that this is different from [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] and [[generic programming]], both of which include the type as an argument.)  A dependent pair may have a second value that depends on the first.  It can be used to encode a pair of integers where the second one is greater than the first.

Dependent types add complexity to a type system.  Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence [[type checking]] may become [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]].

==History==

Dependent types were created to deepen the connection between programming and logic.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In 1934, [[Haskell Curry]] noticed that the types used in [[typed lambda calculus]], and in its [[combinatory logic]] counterpart, followed the same pattern as axioms in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]].  Going further, for every proof in the logic, there was a matching function (term) in the programming language.  One of Curry's examples was the correspondence between [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref name=curry_howard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sørensen|first=Morten Heine B.|author2=Pawel Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism|year=1998|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.17.7385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predicate logic]] is an extension of propositional logic, adding quantifiers. [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] and [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|de Bruijn]] extended lambda calculus to match this more powerful logic by creating types for dependent functions, which correspond to "for all", and dependent pairs, which correspond to "there exists".&lt;ref name=dep_types_at_work&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bove|first=Ana|author2=Peter Dybjer|title=Dependent Types at Work|year=2008|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/DependentTypesAtWork.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Because of this and other work by Howard, propositions-as-types is known as the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]].)

==Formal definition==
===&lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; type===
Loosely speaking, dependent types are similar to the type of an indexed family of sets. More formally, given a type &lt;math&gt;A:\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; in a universe of types &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, one may have a '''family of types''' &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, which assigns to each term &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt; a type &lt;math&gt;B(a):\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. We say that the type ''B(a)'' varies with ''a''.

A function whose type of return value varies with its argument (i.e. there is no fixed [[codomain]]) is a '''dependent function''' and the type of this function is called '''dependent product type''', '''pi-type''' or '''dependent function type'''&lt;ref name='without-sugar'/&gt;.  For this example, the dependent function type is typically written as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\prod_{x:A} B(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math display="block"&gt;\prod\nolimits_{x:A} B(x).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function, the corresponding dependent product type is equivalent to an ordinary [[function type]]. That is, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\prod_{x:A}B&lt;/math&gt; is judgmentally equal to &lt;math&gt;A\to B&lt;/math&gt; when ''B'' does not depend on ''x''.

The name 'pi-type' comes from the idea that these may be viewed as a [[Cartesian product]] of types. Pi-types can also be understood as [[model theory|models]] of [[Universal quantification#As adjoint|universal quantifiers]].

For example, if we write &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Vec}(\mathbb{R},n)&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''-tuples of [[real numbers]], then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} \operatorname{Vec}(\mathbb{R},n)&lt;/math&gt; would be the type of a function which, given a [[natural number]] ''n'', returns a tuple of real numbers of size ''n''. The usual function space arises as a special case when the range type does not actually depend on the input. E.g. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} {\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of functions from natural numbers to the real numbers, which is written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; in typed lambda calculus.

===&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; type===
The [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of the dependent product type is the '''dependent pair type''', '''dependent sum type''', '''sigma-type''', or (confusingly) '''dependent product type'''&lt;ref name='without-sugar'/&gt;. Sigma-types can also be understood as [[Universal quantification#As adjoint|existential quantifiers]]. Continuing the above example, if, in the universe of types &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a type &lt;math&gt;A:\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and a family of types &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a dependent pair type &lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{x:A} B(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The dependent pair type captures the idea of an ordered pair where the type of the second term is dependent on the value of the first. If &lt;math display="block"&gt;(a,b):\sum_{x:A} B(x),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b:B(a)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''B'' is a constant function, then the dependent pair type becomes (is judgementally equal to) the [[product type]], that is, an ordinary Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;A\times B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref follow='without-sugar'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztxa/publ/pisigma-new.pdf| title=ΠΣ: Dependent Types without the Sugar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example as existential quantification====
Let &lt;math&gt;A:\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; be some type, and let &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], ''B'' can be interpreted as a logical [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] on terms of ''A''. For a given &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt;, whether the type ''B(a)'' is inhabited indicates whether ''a'' satisfies this predicate. The correspondence can be extended to existential quantification and dependent pairs: the proposition &lt;math&gt;\exists{a}{\in}A\,B(a)&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]] the type &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{a:A}B(a)&lt;/math&gt; is inhabited.

For example, &lt;math&gt;m:\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;n:\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists another natural number &lt;math&gt;k:\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''. In logic, this statement is codified by existential quantification: &lt;math display="block"&gt;m\le n \iff \exists{k}{\in}\mathbb{N}\,m+k=n.&lt;/math&gt; This proposition corresponds to the dependent pair type: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{k:\mathbb{N}} m+k=n.&lt;/math&gt; That is, a proof of the statement that ''m'' is less than ''n'' is a pair that contains both a number ''k'', which is the difference between ''m'' and ''n'', and a proof of the equality ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''.

==Systems of the lambda cube==
[[Henk Barendregt]] developed the [[lambda cube]] as a means of classifying type systems along three axes.  The eight corners of the resulting cube-shaped diagram each correspond to a type system, with [[simply typed lambda calculus]] in the least expressive corner, and [[calculus of constructions]] in the most expressive.  The three axes of the cube correspond to three different augmentations of the simply typed lambda calculus: the addition of dependent types, the addition of polymorphism, and the addition of higher [[kind (type theory)|kinded]] type constructors (functions from types to types, for example).  The lambda cube is generalized further by [[pure type system]]s.

===First order dependent type theory===
The system &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi&lt;/math&gt; of pure first order dependent types, corresponding to the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]], is obtained by generalising the function space type of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to the dependent product type.

===Second order dependent type theory===
The system &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi 2&lt;/math&gt; of second order dependent types is obtained from &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi&lt;/math&gt; by allowing quantification over type constructors. In this theory the dependent product operator subsumes both the &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; operator of simply typed lambda calculus and the &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; binder of [[System F]].

===Higher order dependently typed polymorphic lambda calculus===
The higher order system &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi \omega&lt;/math&gt; extends &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi 2&lt;/math&gt; to all four forms of abstraction from the [[lambda cube]]: functions from terms to terms, types to types, terms to types and types to terms. The system corresponds to the [[calculus of constructions]] whose derivative, the [[calculus of inductive constructions]] is the underlying system of [[Coq|the Coq proof assistant]].

== Simultaneous programming language and logic ==

The [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] implies that types can be constructed that express arbitrarily complex mathematical properties.  If the user can supply a [[constructive proof]] that a type is ''inhabited'' (i.e., that a value of that type exists) then a compiler can check the proof and convert it into executable computer code that computes the value by carrying out the construction.  The proof checking feature makes dependently typed languages closely related to [[proof assistant]]s.  The code-generation aspect provides a powerful approach to formal [[program verification]] and [[proof-carrying code]], since the code is derived directly from a mechanically verified mathematical proof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="924">'''Dianoia''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:διάνοια|διάνοια]], ''[[ratio]]'' in Latin) is a term used by [[Plato]] for a type of [[thinking]], specifically about mathematical and technical subjects. It is the capacity for, process of, or result of discursive thinking, in contrast with the immediate apprehension that is characteristic of [[noesis]]. In [[Aristotle]], knowledge is further divided into the theoretical ([[episteme]]), and the practical, which includes [[techne]] and [[phronesis]].

'''Elizabeth F. Schwartz''' is an American attorney, author and advocate for the legal rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.

== Life and career == 
Schwartz served as co-counsel on the case challenging Florida's [[same-sex marriage]] ban brought by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] ([[National Center for Lesbian Rights|NCLR]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sageusa.org/newsevents/release.cfm?ID=109|title=SAGE – SAGE Welcomes Two New Members to its Board of Directors|first=|last=SAGEusa.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of six [[same-sex couple]]s seeking the [[Rights|right]] to marry ([[Same-sex marriage in Florida|Pareto v. Ruvin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442148968/gay-parents-face-issues-with-birth-certificates-in-some-states|title=Gay Parents Face Issues With Birth Certificates in Some States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/bay-area-prepares-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses/2208997|title=Tampa Bay area prepares to issue same-sex marriage licenses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[lawsuit]] resulted in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel's finding that [[Same-sex marriage in Florida|Florida's same-sex marriage ban]] deprived [[same-sex couple]]s [[due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] under the law, and in the ordering of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] to issue marriage licenses to [[same-sex couple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Miami-Dade-Judge-Rules-in-Favor-of-Gay-Marriage-268659482.html|title=Miami-Dade Judge Strikes Down Gay Marriage Ban|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz has also filed suit in Florida for fair issuance of [[birth certificate]]s to same-sex married couples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclrights.org/cases-and-policy/cases-and-advocacy/chin-v-armstrong/|title=Case: Chin v. Armstrong|date=August 13, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and handled the first case for [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couple]] divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/tampa-lesbian-couple-will-be-allowed-to-divorce-20150529/|title=Tampa lesbian couple will be allowed to divorce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her legal work Elizabeth F. Schwartz has supported the LGBT community through local and national lectures on the importance of [[LGBT]] couples protecting their families through [[second parent adoption]] and [[estate planning]].&lt;ref name="ironarrow.com"&gt;http://www.ironarrow.com/newsletters/2015Spring.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  She writes about issues concerning the LGBT community for the [[Huffington Post]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whats-next-lgbt-equality-in-a-trumpocalypse_us_582a2b08e4b0852d9ec21bd7&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-things-lgbt-people-should-consider-before-getting_us_57ffa722e4b06f314afeaf21&lt;/ref&gt;  

Schwartz is featured in The Day It Snowed In Miami (2014) a 2014 Emmy-nominated documentary that traces the political activism behind an equal-rights statute in Miami. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seYFHXnCSo0&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=The Day It Snowed In Miami (2014) - YouTube=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth received her Bachelor of Arts from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1993 and her [[Juris Doctor]], [[Latin honors|cum laude]], from the [[University of Miami]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="lgbtbar.org"&gt;http://www.lgbtbar.org/assets/Program-Book-Middle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She started practicing law in 1997.&lt;ref name="ironarrow.com"/&gt;

Elizabeth Schwartz was born in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] and currently lives with her wife, writer Lydia Martin, in [[Miami, FL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/mrd12/schwartz.html|title=Elizabeth F. Schwartz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16555">'''Embryo donation''' is a form of [[third party reproduction]]. It is defined as the giving—generally without compensation—of [[embryos]] remaining after one couple's [[in vitro fertilisation]] to either another person or couple for implantation or to research. Where it is given for the purpose of implantation, the donation is followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman's uterus to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth in the recipient. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor. This is the same principle as is followed in [[egg donation]] or [[sperm donation]]. Most often, the embryos are donated after the woman for whom they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies to term.

==For implantation==
Embryo donation can be handled on an anonymous basis (donor and recipient parties are not known to each other), or on an open basis (parties' identities are shared and the families agree to a relationship). Occasionally, a "semi-open" arrangement is used in which the parties know family and other information about each other, but their real names and locating information are withheld, in order to provide a layer of privacy protection.

=== Embryo donation or adoption ===

Some writers use the term "embryo donation" to refer strictly to anonymous embryo donation, and "embryo adoption" to refer to the open process.&lt;ref&gt;Snowflake Program, Nightlight Christian Adoptions&lt;/ref&gt; Others use the terms synonymously because regardless of whether the arrangement is open or anonymous, the donation of embryos and a clinical assisted reproduction procedure is involved, and the recipient couple is preparing to raise a child not genetically related to them.&lt;ref&gt;National Embryo Donation Center&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who assist couples who are trying to acquire an embryo state the term "embryo adoption" is a misnomer because the transfer of an embryo is handled as property transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Charles P. Kindregan &amp; Maureen McBrien}}, {{smallcaps|Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Lawyer's Guide to Emerging Law and Science}} 109-10 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Rob Blackhurst}}, ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10353338/The-pro-lifers-adopting-spare-embryos-created-during-IVF.html The pro-lifers adopting 'spare' embryos created during IVF]'', {{smallcaps|Telegraph (London)}}, Oct. 8, 2013 (hereinafter cited as Blackhurst, ''Pro-lifers'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Wetzstein, ''[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/19/embryo-adoption-becoming-rage/?page=all#pagebreak Embryo adoption becoming the rage]'', {{smallcaps|Wash. Times}}, Apr. 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion rights advocates, advocates of embryonic stem cell research, and members of the fertility industry object to referring to the transfer as an "adoption" because they feel it gives an embryo the same status as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Pam Belluck, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/national/02embryo.html?pagewanted=1 From Stem Cell Opponents, an Embryo Crusade]'', {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, June 2, 2005 (hereinafter cited as Belluck, ''Crusade'').&lt;/ref&gt; Most doctors describe the process as "embryo donation".&lt;ref&gt;Jessie Beauchaine, ''[http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/1209675/ The Next Frontier of the Stem Cell Debate:"Snowflake" babies, embryo "adoption," and being pre-born again]'', {{smallcaps|Village Voice}}, June 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donor options ===

According to a survey by the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]], 54% of fertility patients want to preserve their remaining embryos for future use.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Another 21% want to donate leftover embryos for research.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Pamela Brown ''[http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/05/controversial-embryo-adoptions-on-the-rise--75501.html Controversial embryo adoptions on the rise]''  May 1, 2012 WJLA.COM&lt;/ref&gt; Donating embryos for research may be a good alternative when patients receive proper, honest and clear information about the research project, the procedures and the scientific value of the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Dr. Jeffrey Nelson is Director of the Huntington Reproductive Center, one of California's largest IVF clinics. He reports that "Twenty-five per cent of patients want to donate their [spare] embryos – not as many as I'd like." He added, "People tend to hold on to their embryos because they don't want to make a decision. We started buying more and more cryopreservation tanks, and we finally had to say that there's a fee for a certain number of years' storage, and beyond that the price starts to escalate."&lt;ref name="Blackhurst, Pro-lifers"&gt;Blackhurst, ''Pro-lifers''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It costs up to $1,200 a year to store frozen embryos.&lt;ref&gt;Blackhurst, ''Pro-lifers''&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2012, there were about 600,000 frozen embryos stored in laboratories and fertility clinics,&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; costing the donor families about $72 million annually for storage fees.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Young ''[http://www.nightlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Loveland-Reporter-Herald-Article.pdf Funding cut threatens Loveland-based program that encourages adoption of frozen embryos; women tell adoption stories]''  March 10, 2012 {{smallcaps|Loveland Reporter-Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donor screening ===

In the United States, donors must, if possible, be screened for a series of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/TissueTissueProducts/QuestionsaboutTissues/ucm136397.htmhttp://www.miracleswaiting.org/explorembryo.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) administers the rules for screening donors. If the donors are not available to be screened, the embryos must be given a label that indicates that the required screening has not been done, and the recipients must agree to accept the associated risk. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own embryologist conduct further testing.

or donating them for use in [[embryonic stem cell research]]. Although embryos can, theoretically, survive indefinitely in frozen storage, as a practical reality someone must eventually decide on a permanent disposition for them.

A US study concluded that donating an embryo is approximately twice as cost-effective as [[oocyte]] donation in terms of cost per live birth, with a cost of $22,000 per live delivery compared to $41,000 for oocyte donation.

=== History ===

Soon after [[in vitro fertilization]] became a common clinical practice, clinicians discovered a way to [[cryopreserve|preserve]] embryos in frozen storage and thaw them for implantation later. This procedure can spare a woman donor from a second egg harvesting procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Trounson A, Freemann L. The use of embryo cryopreservation in human IVF programmes. Clin Obstet Gynaecol 1985 Dec;12(4):825-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downing BG, Mohr LR, Trounson AO, Freemann LE, Wood C. Birth After Transfer of Cryopreserved Embryos. Med J Aust 1985 Apr 1;142(7):409-11&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, clinicians reasoned that more couples could be helped toward parenthood by substituting donor sperm for men who have no viable sperm, or donor eggs for women who have no viable oocytes – or both. Thus what was called gamete and embryo donation, came into being. A careful reading of the 1983 clinical report often cited as the first instance of embryo donation  reveals that the donated embryo was actually created for the recipient at the same time that four embryos were made for the donor couple's own use.  The menstrual cycles of the donor and recipient women were synchronized using medications, and the transfers occurred on the same day. None of these embryos had been cryopreserved.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Soon thereafter, reports were published documenting successful pregnancies and births from cryopreserved donor embryos. Again, however, these were embryos made from donor gametes specifically for the recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sauer | first1 = MV | last2 = Paulson | first2 = RJ | date = Nov 1990 | title = Human Oocyte and Preembryo Donation: an Evolving Method for the Treatment of Infertility | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 163 | issue = 5| pages = 1421–1424 | doi=10.1016/0002-9378(90)90599-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Steirteghem | first1 = AC | last2 = Van den Abbeel | first2 = E | last3 = Braeckmans | first3 = P | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1987 | title = Pregnancy With a Frozen-thawed Embryo in a Woman With Primary Ovarian Failure | url = | journal = NEJM | volume = 317 | issue = | page = 113 | doi=10.1056/nejm198707093170210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one knows for sure when the first true embryo adoption occurred. The term was used as early as the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson JA. Embryos, Families, and Procreative Liberty: the Legal Structure of the New Reproduction. Southern California Law Review. 1986. 59: 939-1041&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wurmbrand MJ. Frozen embryos: moral, social, and legal implications. South Calif Law Rev 1986 Jul;59(5):1079-1100&lt;/ref&gt;  in the legal literature. Devroey et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Devroey P, Camus M, van den Abbeel E, van Waesberghe L, Wisanto A, van Steirteghem AC. Establishment of 22 Pregnancies After Oocyte and Embryo Donation. Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1989 Aug;96(8):900-906&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Maria Bustillo in Florida, and Dr. Howard Jones in Virginia have reported embryo transfers occurring between 1986 and 1990 that clearly represented adoption of remaining embryos.

Prior to this, thousands of women who were [[Infertility|infertile]] had regarded adoption as the only available path to parenthood. These scientific advances set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of embryo donation and transfer as a solution to infertility.  In some ways, it is similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations.  Some see the embryo as "tissue", others see it as a "gift of a potential life",&lt;ref&gt;National Embryo Donation Center:  Questionnaire Study of Prospective Embryo Donors&lt;/ref&gt; while still others believe that a new human life begins at the time of fertilization.  The third group sees embryo donation as little different from traditional adoption, except that the recipient woman has the experience of pregnancy and childbirth, and that no court action is required to establish legal parentage for the recipient.

The matter gained another political dimension in the [[United States]] when Congress and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] budgeted $1 million to promote embryo adoption.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. President Discusses Stem Cell Research. Office of the Press Secretary, August 9, 2001. https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

Embryo donation is legally considered a property transfer and not an adoption by state laws. However, Georgia enacted a statute called the "Option of Adoption Act" in 2009 which provided a procedure for, but (importantly) did not require—a confirmatory court order of parentage following embryo adoption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/archive/20665/&lt;/ref&gt;  One advantage some embryo adoption couples in Georgia have derived from this law is that they have become eligible for the federal Adoption Tax Credit.

Embryo donation can be carried out as a service of an individual infertility clinic (where donor and recipient families typically live in the local area and are both patients of the same clinic) or by any of several national organizations. The process described below is typical of an "adoption-agency-based" national program.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Genetic parents entering an embryo adoption program are offered the benefits of selecting the adoptive parents from the agency's pool of prescreened applicants. Embryo ownership is transferred directly from the genetic parents to the adoptive parents. Genetic parents may be updated by the agency when a successful pregnancy is achieved and when a child(ren) is/are born. The genetic parents and adoptive parents may negotiate their own terms for future contact between the families.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Prospective adoptive parents entering a program complete an application,  and may also complete a traditional [[adoption home study]], fertility or adoption education, background and health checks and in some cases, depending on the requirements of both the home study and placement agencies, court certification of adoption eligibility. Their completed paperwork and fees are submitted to the placement agency, which reviews their file. Some agencies allow the donors to choose the recipient while others match the recipient parents with similar preferences including desired level of openness post-adoption. Genetic and prospective parents are then given the chance to approve the match. Once all parties agree, the embryo is transferred to the adoptive mother's clinic for a frozen embryo transfer.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

None of the procedures involved with embryo adoption by either the genetic or adopting parents are legal requirements of embryo transfer. The process is entered into willingly by both sets of parents because of the added safeguards, knowledge and communication offered to both parties by the system.&lt;ref&gt;Embryo Adoption &amp; Donation&lt;/ref&gt;

==For research==
Embryo donation to research provides a major source of [[stem cells]] for [[stem cell research]]. The hope is that stem cell research will aid in finding cures for various major diseases such as [[Alzheimer]], [[cancer]], [[Spinal muscular atrophy|SMA]], and [[Parkinson's]] diseases.  Some stem cell research is done by using human embryos, and one option that parents have once they are done with [[In vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] is to donate their unused embryos to stem cell research. One review came to the result that the proportion of IVF users who donated embryos for research varied geographically, from 7% in France to 73% in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="SamorinhaPereira2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samorinha|first1=C.|last2=Pereira|first2=M.|last3=Machado|first3=H.|last4=Figueiredo|first4=B.|last5=Silva|first5=S.|title=Factors associated with the donation and non-donation of embryos for research: a systematic review|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=5|year=2014|pages=641–655|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu026|pmid=24907125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in the United States revealed that 60% of American donors would donate the unused embryos to science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stemcellumbilicalcordblood.com/resources/60-of-donors-would-donate-unused-embryos-for-stem-cell-research/ 60% of Donors Would Donate Unused Embryos for Stem Cell Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

People who donate embryos for research often have been found in a review to report feelings of reciprocity towards science and medicine, positive views of research and high levels of trust in the medical system. They have described the decision to donate as better than the destruction of embryos, and as an opportunity to help others or to improve health and IVF technology. On the other hand, reported factors that make people refrain from embryo donation to research include a perception of risks, a lack of information concerning research projects and the medical system, as well as conceptualization of embryos in terms of [[personhood]]. The influence of sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive and gynecological history have mainly been found to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name="SamorinhaPereira2014"/&gt;

'''Feminist epistemology''' is an examination of the subject matter of [[epistemology]] from a [[feminist]] standpoint. [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]] describes feminist epistemology as being concerned with the way in which [[gender]] influences our concept of knowledge and "practices of inquiry and justification".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = Elizabeth S. | author-link = Elizabeth S. Anderson | contribution = Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science | editor-last = Zalta | editor-first = Edward N. | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta |title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2004 Edition) | year = 2004 | url = http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/archives/sum2004/entries/feminism-epistemology/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally regarded as falling under the umbrella of [[social epistemology]].

==Overview==
Feminist epistemology emphasizes how important ethical and political values are in shaping epistemic practices, and interpretations of evidence. Feminist epistemology studies how gender influences our understanding of knowledge, justification and theory of knowledge; it describes how knowledge and justification disadvantage women. Scientists of feminist epistemology claim that knowledge discriminate women by: preventing them from inquiry and presenting women as an inferior, because these theories of knowledge satisfy only male interests, which strengthen gender hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = I. M. | contribution = Throwing like a girl and other essays in feminist political theory. |title = Bloomington: Indiana University Press  | year = 1990 | url = https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central idea of feminist epistemology is that knowledge reflects the particular perspectives of the theory. The main interest of feminist philosophers is how gender stereotypes situate knowing subjects. They approach this interest from three different perspectives: feminist standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and feminist empiricism. Standpoint theory defines a specific social perspective as epistemically privileged. Feminist postmodernism emphasizes the instability of the social identity explorers and therefore their representations. Empiricism focuses on combining the main ideas of feminism and their observations to prove feministic theories through evidence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Elizabeth Anderson argues that the concept of [[situated knowledge]] is central to feminist epistemology. [[Donna Haraway]] asserts that most knowledge (in particular academic knowledge) is always situated and "produced by positioned actors working in/between all kinds of locations, working up/on/through all kinds of research relation(ships)" (Cook, ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cook, 'Positionality/Situated Knowledge'  for David Sibley ''et al.'' (eds)''Critical Concepts in Cultural Geography''. London, IB: Taurus http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925160741/http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus what is known and the ways in which this knowledge can be known is subject to the position—the situation and perspective—of the knower.

The English feminist philosopher [[Miranda Fricker]] has argued that in addition to social or political injustices, there can be [[epistemic injustice|''epistemic'' injustices]] in two forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. ''Testimonial injustice'' consists in prejudices that cause one to "give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker gives the example of a woman who due to her gender is not believed in a business meeting. She may make a good case, but prejudice causes the listeners to believe her arguments to be less competent or sincere and thus less believable. In this kind of case, Fricker argues that as well as there being an injustice caused by possible outcomes (such as the speaker missing a promotion at work), there is a testimonial injustice: "a kind of injustice in which someone is ''wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''hermeneutical injustice'', "speakers' knowledge claims fall into lacunae in the available conceptual resources, thus blocking their capacity to interpret, and thence to understand or claim a hearing for their experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Code, 2008. [https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23398-epistemic-injustice-power-and-the-ethics-of-knowing/ Review of Epistemic Injustice.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when the language of '[[sexual harassment]]' or '[[homophobia]]' were not generally available, those who experienced these wrongs lacked the resources to make a claim to being wronged in morally relevant ways.

The philosopher [[Susan Haack]] is a notable critic of feminist epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ezeTXOlQngC |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31137-1 |origyear=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lynn Hankinson Nelson|title=The Very Idea of Feminist Epistemology|jstor=3810236|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|number=3|pages=31–49|year=1995|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb00736.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] organized feminist epistemology into three categories: feminist empiricism, standpoint epistemology, and post-modern epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Doucet, A., &amp; Mauthner, N. (2006). Feminist methodologies and epistemology. ''Handbook of 21st Century Sociology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage'', 36-45.
&lt;/ref&gt; While potentially a limited set of categories, post-modern feminism was a transitional ideology that denounced absolute objectivity and asserted the death of the meta-narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While these three categories of feminist epistemology have their place in history (see [[feminist empiricism]], [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]]), as ideological frameworks they hold epistemic insights in contemporary feminist method. Feminist theorist [[Nina Lykke]], has expanded upon these three categories to include "''postmodern feminist (anti-)epistemology''...[and]...''postconstructionist feminist epistemology''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7THBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nina+lykke+feminist+epistemology&amp;lr=|title=Feminist Studies: A Guide to Intersectional Theory, Methodology and Writing|last=Lykke|first=Nina|date=2010-04-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136978982|location=|pages=126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist empiricism ==
Feminist empiricism emerged from a feminist critique that gave attention to male bias in positivistic practices of science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2nd Wave feminist researchers identified how quantification and objectivity, as facets of positivism, have been held as the “gold standard” for social and political science research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = C. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = R. L. | year = 2010 | title = Feminists really do count: The complexity of feminist methodologies | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 189–196 | doi = 10.1080/13645579.2010.482249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantification, and its political relationships to notions of objectivity, maintains methodological dominance and preference primarily in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is perpetuated by how funding authorities tend to prioritize quantitative research with positivist frameworks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists believe in the concept of positivism; that all knowledge can be understood objectively and can be accessed through empirical research.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. (2007). Feminist empiricism: challenging gender bias and “setting the record straight”. In Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. ''Feminist research practice'' (pp. 26-52). : SAGE Publications Ltd doi: 10.4135/9781412984270.n2
&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that pre-feminist positivism was actually not objective at all, since traditional positivism’s ‘androcentric bias’ led to only partial or ‘subjective’ knowledge of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In essence, all empirical inquiry is inherently skewed by value judgments and biased interpretation of evidence by male-biased authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it was not until retrieving statistical data on the prevalence of women in the workplace experiencing (what is now known to be) ‘sexual harassment’ through surveys in the 1970s that sexual harassment became identified by political authorities as a commonality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Without this intervention of feminists in an empirical field, this commonality would never have been identified as an issue, since males had no reason to pursue this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Londa Schiebinger further asserts that empirical research “embodies many core feminist values”, in that feminist empiricists are actively seeking out and eliminating exploitative research whilst resisting strategic, oppressive explanations of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiebinger | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Introduction: Feminism inside the sciences | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 859–886 | doi=10.1086/345319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist empiricism is critiqued for its belief that “objectivity” is best achieved through quantification, whether or not viewed through a feminist lens or utilized for feminist ideals.  The division between quantitative and qualitative data has historically reinforced gendered dichotomies of “hard/soft, emotional/rational, worthy/worthless”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many assert that ‘objective truth’ is a false concept, and thus feminist empiricists may overestimate the extent to which they can increase objectivity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bart, J. (1998, January 19). Feminist Theories of Knowledge: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Retrieved October, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, positivism and quantitative research has been critiqued as a “detached” philosophical framework that inherently objectifies its research subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists respond to the problem of value-neutrality by lengthening Quine's argument: theory is not determined by evidence. Any observation counts as proof for
particular thesis only if connected with certain background presumptions, because similar observation might support different hypotheses. In daily life, scientists face some restrictions in selecting the background assumptions, that are based on cognitive values like simplicity and conservatism, which a political and social philosophy that is based on retaining traditional social establishments. Feminist empiricists state that no logical or methodological principle categorically prohibits scientists from choosing their background assumptions as their political and social values or other interests. Therefore, feminist scientists may select their background presumptions on account of their opinions on some feminist values.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Two paradoxes ===
There are two central paradoxes with feminist empiricism

The first paradox is that many feminist empiricists advocate for exposing the androcentric and sexist biases in scientific research, namely that people have a bias towards gender difference and sexuality.  However, while feminist empiricists would claim that the feminist inquiry helps the development of science, their own perspective adopts certain bias about gender and science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''The paradox of social construction'''
The second paradox is about many science criticisms expose that the scientific inquiry is influenced by both social and political factors.The theories of androcentric and sexist are influenced by the most society are what they advocate, which can be understood as in order to eliminate the bias, the term like “ individualist epistemology” would be used.  However, they want scientific to be open to different social influences, which the bias of female is also a part of social influence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''Criticism of empiricism theory:''' It is the most criticized theory by others, for its assumptions that transhistorical subject of knowledge exists outside of social determination ([[Sandra Harding|Harding]] 1990). Also feminist empiricism theory states that science will correct all the biases and errors in theories about women and other groups by itself.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

== Standpoint epistemology ==
At a basic level, standpoint epistemology asserts that marginalized groups such as women are bestowed with an “epistemic privilege”, where there exists the potential for less distorted understandings of the world than dominant groups, such as men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This methodology presents many new ideas to the Feminist Empiricist notion that androcentric dominance and bias presents an incomplete understanding of the world.  A “standpoint” is not so much about a subject’s biased perspective, but instead the ‘realities’ that structure social relationships of power.

Standpoint theories portray the universe from a concrete situated perspective. Every standpoint theory must specify: the  social location from the  feminist perspective, the  scope of its privileges, the social role and the identity that generates knowledge and the justification of these privileges. Feminist standpoint theory states a privilege in gender relations, various feminist standpoint theories are based on the statement about the epistemic privilege in different feministic situations. Feminist standpoint theory is one of the types of critical theory, their main intention is to improve their situation. In order to achieve this critical aim, social theories must represent the understanding of feministic problems and try to improve their condition. Critical theory is theory of, by, and for the subjects of study. Feminism and feminist epistemology is all about inquiry, assumptions, and theories. Through these methods feminist epistemology overcomes the tension between bias on which feminist empiricism is based on.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Harding, S. (1996). Borderlands Epistemologies. In A. Ross (ed.), ''Science wars''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press 331-340.  &lt;nowiki&gt;https://femmethodsuwyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/hardingborderlandsepist.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It presents an elaborate map or method for maximizing “strong objectivity” in natural and social science,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; yet does not necessarily focus on encouraging positivistic scientific practices, like is central to Feminist Empiricism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although standpoint epistemology has been critiqued for focusing too closely on a distinctive women’s perspective which may render invisible concepts of historically and sociologically variable knowledge,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Harding strongly asserts that standpoint epistemology does not essentialize any particular marginalized identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Harding further argues that the methodology does not subscribe to notions of “maximizing neutrality” between groups in an effort to maximize objectivity, but instead recognizes that the power relations between groups are what complicate these relationships.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is in some ways contrary to Doucet’s assertion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that the controversy of ''how'' power influenced knowledge production is a post-standpoint, more contemporary debate. Standpoint epistemology also poses a necessity to ask critical questions about the lives and social institutions created by dominant groups; where the field becomes a sociology ''for'' women and not solely ''about'' women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In practicality, standpoint theory has widespread use as "a philosophy of knowledge, a philosophy of science, a sociology of knowledge, a moral/political advocacy of the expansion of democratic rights".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although it has been asserted that “epistemic privilege” is inherent to marginalized groups,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harding poses standpoint theory as an explanatory means for both marginalized and dominant group individuals to be able to achieve liberatory perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In building her standpoint epistemology, Sandra Harding used and built on the work of philosophers of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]]. Harding's standpoint theory is also grounded in Marxism, although she largely rejected Marxism for it's portrayal of women in merely class terms.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinnick|first=Cassandra L.|date=1994|title=Feminist Epistemology: Implications for Philosophy of Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/188340|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=646–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn argued that scientific progress does not occur through gradual accumulation of correct ideas. Rather, he believed that there were occasionally large revolutions that completely overturned the previous scientific theories. When a crisis occurs within the prevailing theory of a time, revolutionary scientists will challenge them and build new scientific theories. For example, in his view, the transition from the geocentrism of Ptolemy to the heliocentric theory of Copernicus did not occur through a gradual series of challenges and improvements to the previous model. Rather, it was a sudden and complete revolution because it is impossible to conceptualize the theory of heliocentrism within the dominant geocentric theory. Kuhn argued that together, the ideas of Newton, Galileo, and Kepler completed the revolution that Copernicus started. However, most students of science do not learn of the many failed and alternative scientific paradigms. They are taught a version of the history of science where progress is guaranteed and linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 4th Edition|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=9780226458120|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Harding’s view, Kuhn’s theories showed that all science was situated within its historical context, and that any theory could remain accepted if its believers held power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HARDING|first=SANDRA|date=1992|title=After the Neutrality Ideal: Science, Politics, and "Strong Objectivity"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40970706|journal=Social Research|volume=59|issue=3|pages=567–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of standpoint theory:''' Philosopher [[Helen Longino]] is against standpoint theory, because she claims that standpoint theory can not provide the knowledge of which standpoints have the most privilege. Bar On (1993) said that if feminine ethics of care provides privileged perspective on morality, then our moral knowledge is convinced only by existence of gender relations. Bar On also claims that theory which explains structural relationship between advanced and less developed, which dictates epistemic privilege can not be applied to women. [[Marx]] claimed that class conflict derives other conflicts such as racism, sexism, national and religious conflicts.

Feminist epistemology is criticized by different philosophers. Feminist postmodernists blame feminist empiricists for assuming the existence of an individual and for admitting an uncritical concept of experience. Naturalized Quine epistemology of some feminist empiricists perceives knowers as socially situated; Hundleby, a standpoint theorist, criticizes feminist empiricism for disregarding the key role of women in political activities.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Standpoint theory is often criticized for the lack of evidence available to support it and the ideas underlying it, such as the lack of justification for the [[underdetermination]] theory Harding uses. Pinnick, to illustrate her point about Harding's poor evidence, points to standpoint theory’s claim that science is more objective if it is politically motivated, which Pinnick claims runs contrary to what has happened in the past when scientists deliberately injected politics into their theories (she cites eugenics and intelligence test designs as examples of politicized science). She also criticizes Harding for claiming that marginalized groups produce better, less biased scientific results because, according to Pinnick, Harding fails to provide any empirical evidence for this idea.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Post-modernism ==
Post-modern thought marks a feminist group shift away from dominant, positivistic ideals of objectivity and universal understanding.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instead, it acknowledges a diversity of unique human perspectives, none of which can claim absolute knowledge authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has thus been critiqued for having a relativist-stance, where ongoing power relations between key identities have been often neglected attention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible to see this political stance in direct opposition to the “emancipatory aspirations” of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, [[Saba Mahmood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahmood | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: Some Reflections on the Egyptian Islamic Revival | url = | journal = Cultural Anthropology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 202–236 | doi = 10.1525/can.2001.16.2.202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would argue this critique is in some ways oppositional to global understandings of female desire, where the idea of ‘freedom’ is an essential, conditionally oppressive component to western feminism which may wrongly assume that women of eastern countries dominated by male power are victims needing to be liberated.

[[Donna Haraway]], a post-modern feminist, shows how post-modern feminism recognizes positivism as an inherently oppressive ideology, where science’s rhetoric of truth was used to undermine marginalized people’s agency and delegitimize ‘embodied’ accounts of truth.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haraway | first1 = D | year = September–October 1988 | title = Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/HARSKT| journal = Feminist Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 575–599 | doi = 10.2307/3178066 | jstor = 3178066 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they argue that ‘objectivity’ is an external, disembodied point of view left only to privileged (unmarked bodies), because marginalized (marked bodies) cannot have perspectives dissociated from ‘who they are’.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Despite post-modern relativist criticism,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this theory resists relativism in firmly recognizing power relations in that objectivity is a privilege of unmarked bodies. Haraway’s theory of “situated knowledges” holds true to post-modern ideology, where knowledge should be placed in context; this creates a more limited range of knowledge than theoretical “objectivity”, but is richer in allowing for exchange of understanding between individual experiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Positivism inherently gives way to authoritarian positions of knowledge which hinder discussion and render limited understanding of the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both positivist science and relativism have been recognized as contrary to post-modern feminist thought, since both minimize the significance of context (geographic, demographic, power) on knowledge claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = P. H. | year = 1990 | title = Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 221–238 | doi = 10.2307/2074808 | jstor = 2074808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of postmodernism:''' Key features of postmodernism: “Women” not the category of analysis and contains of perspectives which are controversial with feminist theory. The fact that women are in different social position can experience sexism differently, does not mean that they do not suffer from it ([[MacKinnon]] 2000). The postmodernism theory dissolves all groups, and supports the ideas that knowledge from any source is  better than no knowledge at all ([[Susan Bordo|Bordo]] 1990).&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Theory in the flesh ===
Post-modern feminism’s assertion of “situated knowledges”,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; plays well into [[Cherríe Moraga|Cherrie Moraga]]’s piece “Theory in the Flesh”, where the ‘physical realities’ of indigenous peoples’ lives are said to be the means of creating a decolonial politic against oppressive, inaccessible, Eurowestern academic methods of knowledge production.&lt;ref&gt;Moraga, C., &amp; Anzaldúa, G. (1983). Theory in the Flesh. In ''This bridge called my back: Writings by radical women of color''. New York: Kitchen Table, Women of Color Press. 23.
&lt;/ref&gt; This epistemological framework has been utilized by feminists like [[bell hooks]], who claims that theorizing is often tied to a process of self-recovery and collective liberation; it is not thus limited to those in the western academic realm, nor does it require ‘scientific’ research.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Theory as a Liberatory Practice. In ''Teaching to transgress: Education as the practice of freedom''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks asserts that theory and practical application of emancipatory politics can, and often do, exist simultaneously and reciprocally.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has given way to the question of whether or not there should be any particular feminist ways of knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 'theory in the flesh' seems to suggest that prioritizing or normalizing any specific feminist epistemology would in itself be, and has been, oppressive.

=== Feminist epistemic virtue theory ===
This theory focuses on how power and gender relations behave in terms of value theory and epistemology. [[Susan Bordo|Bordo]]’s (1990) and [[Genevieve Lloyd|Lloyd]]’s (1984) examined how “maleness” and “femaleness” are used in philosophical theories and discussions about relationship such as, reason/unreason, reason/emotion and objectivity/subjectivity. [[Lorraine Code]]’s (1987, 1991, 1995, 1996) with other feminist co-workers determined in which ways political and social routine shapes our identities and perspectives of our world and especially gender, how it leads to understanding of epistemic responsibility. Code’s works also have been influential in epistemological fields, which can be described as version of naturalism takes and reinvents simple and uncontroversial empirical beliefs, for example the belief like “I know that I am seeing a bird”, deforms the epistemic animal nature. Feminist epistemic virtue theorists rejects almost all the assumptions. Skeptical problems can not get any connections with it, so it is ignored and considered as a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref&gt;Feminist Epistemology. (n.d.). Retrieved February 9, 2017 from Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-epis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist science criticism and feminist science==

=== Feminist science criticism: bias as error ===
Feminist science criticism mainly has five different kinds of research about gender and science to address five identified biases.  These are studies of how:
* Exclusion or marginalization of women scientists impair scientific progress.
* Applications of science and technology disadvantage women and other vulnerable groups and treat their interests as less important.
* Science has ignored women and gender, and how turning attention to these issues may require revisions of accepted theories.
* Biases toward working with “masculine” cognitive styles (and in some cases even the words related to them) that may — through limiting, partial, or incomplete perspective — lead to errors of omission or unjustified conclusions.
* Research into sex differences that reinforces sex stereotypes and sexist practices fail to live up to standards of good science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Feminist science: bias as resource ===

Feminist science argues that the inquiry of science which informed by feminist epistemology is based on legalizing and produce the limiting partial bias.
Pluralist feminist scientists and philosophers of science define feminist science as preferred content and “feminine” method.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

An '''ideal''' is a [[principle]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] that one actively pursues as a [[goal]], usually in the context of [[ethics]], and one's prioritization of ideals can serve to indicate the extent of one's dedication to each. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]], but is willing to [[lie]] to protect a friend, demonstrates not only devotion to [[friendship]], but also belief in its supersedence of honesty in importance.

The belief in ideals is called '''ethical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry into the Nature and Function of Ideals|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=0520078888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied ethics==
In some theories of [[applied ethics]], such as that of [[Rushworth Kidder]], there is importance given to such orders as a way to [[dispute resolution|resolve disputes]].  In [[law]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness.

==In politics==
In [[politics]] ideals play a pivotal role.  During the [[French Revolution]], the principles of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood]]" were raised to the status of ideals. The [[Green_Party_of_the_United_States#Ideology|Ten Key Values of the US Green Party]] are likewise raised to such status today. In fact, most political movements have a certain set of ideals. However, in many cases, one can easily find instances where ideals were "not lived up to" - some of which are cases where one simply proved to outweigh another for some specific decision, or where all were compromised simply to retain the [[power (sociology)|power]] to continue to pursue them.

==Idols and heroes==
A different form of ideal is an [[idolatry|idol]] or [[hero]], who is held up as a [[moral example]].  Since this is an actual person or fictional character, it is too complex and multi-faceted to be considered an ideal in the abstract sense. However, when they are encountered in the form of a story, with only a few traits on display, they are a simplified [[archetype]] from which one can very easily derive [[stereotype]]s or mimicry.  In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of [[Muhammad]] is held up as "ideal", but must be interpreted for believers through the tale of his life, or [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], and his many sayings, the [[hadith]].

==Ideal and virtue==
Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, and resolving conflicts between them, it is not uncommon to see them reduced to [[dogma]]. One way to avoid this, according to [[Bernard Crick]], is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a process, rather than an outcome.  His [[political virtues]] try to raise the practical habits useful in resolving disputes into ideals of their own.  A [[virtue]], in general, is an ideal that one can make a [[habituation|habit]].

==Relative ideal==
In formal axiology, [[Robert S. Hartman]] contended that being ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as "good" as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In [[ethics]], by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.

'''Isa Soares''' (born 1953) is a Brazilian-born Argentine dancer and activist involved in creating awareness of the African traditions of Argentina and fighting racism against [[Afro-Argentines|Afro-Argentine]] peoples. She was one of the pioneers in developing [[African dance]] interpretation and instruction in Argentina.

==Early life==
María Isabel Soares Sousa was born in 1953 &lt;!-- on 4 May 1953 --&gt; in [[Maragogipe]], of the Brazilian state of [[Bahia]] to [[Afro-Brazilian]] parents Iraildes Sousa Gomes and Fernando Bispo Soares. Her father had degrees in both biochemistry and music, and her mother was a dressmaker and [[tobacconist]]. After completing her primary and secondary education, Soares attended the [[Federal Institute of Bahia]] in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], earning her teaching credentials in 1972. She moved to [[São Paulo]] and had a son, while continuing her education at the [[University of São Paulo]]. The focus of her studies was on the socio-cultural and historic development of dance and the impact of the [[slave trade]] upon cultural practices.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}

==Career==
While continuing her studies, Soares worked as a primary school teacher.{{sfn|Más|2016}} She took dance lessons with [[Wilson Silva]], who taught her the basic techniques of African dance and how those spread into the Americas through ''[[candombe]]'' in Uruguay, ''[[samba]]'' from Brazil and [[Tap dance|tap dancing]] in the United States. In 1982, she married and as was expected of women in her generation, followed her husband to Argentina, giving up her career in 1983.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Más|2016}} The couple settled in [[Bahía Blanca]] and Soares returned to her studies through the National Technical Education Council ({{lang-es|Consejo Nacional de Educación Técnica (CONET)}}), earning her technical instructor's certification. As there were few prospects for a black woman in the arts to earn a living in Bahía Blanca, she left the area in 1985 and moved to [[Buenos Aires]]. Between 1985 and 1987, Soares studied and worked as a dance instructor on a scholarship in the dance school of [[Aida Prestifilippo]], the principal dancer of the [[Teatro Colón]]. In addition to providing the scholarship Prestifilippo helped introduce Soares to the dance circuit in Buenos Aires, allowing her to perform at various local venues.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}} 

The era was one of cultural expansion, following the suppression of individual expression throughout the period of [[National Reorganization Process]] from 1973-1983.{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}} From the end of the dictatorship, Soares gave lessons in African dance at a small salon on Corrientes Street in Buenos Aires and organized performances and events to expand the knowledge of black culture in Argentina.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}} Beginning in 1987, she worked as a dance instructor of a course ''Dance of Orixás'' ({{lang-es|Danza de Orixás}} for the Centro Cultural Rector Ricardo Rojas, an organization affiliated with the [[University of Buenos Aires]].{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}} Between 1990 and 2006, Soares was the coordinator for African dance at the Centro{{sfn|Más|2016}} and began traveling to places like [[Rosario, Santa Fe]] in the [[Santa Fe Province]] to teach and back to Brazil for students to train in Bahia.{{sfn|Florencia|2013|p=3}}{{sfn|Montenegro|2017}} She also hosted annual summer courses on dances with African roots through the Municipal Institute of Education for Art in the [[Avellaneda Partido|Municipality of Avellaneda]].{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2006}} Forming an association with activists, artists and intellectuals, Soares actively worked to fight racial discrimination and bring back an awareness of the roots of black culture in Argentina.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Montenegro|2017}}

At the end of 2006, Soares left the Center, though she continued with private dance instruction and taught a seminar which consolidated Afro-Brazilian and [[Afro-Cuban]] dance styles.{{sfn|Más|2016}} In 2007, she began teaching courses at the [[Instituto Universitario Nacional del Arte]]{{sfn|Infante|2010|p=86}} as well as directing an independent project, known as the Alábase Project, which focuses on the study and performance of the methodology of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruban]] dance based upon the tradition of ''xiré''.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}} She is considered one of the pioneering dancers who brought African cultural expression back to Argentina after the close of the dictatorship.{{sfn|Fernández Bravo|2016}}{{sfn|Plaza|2006}}

[[File:Jiv.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Jivas'']]
In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], a '''jiva''' ({{lang-sa|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīva}}, alternative spelling ''jiwa''; {{lang-hi|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīv}}, alternative spelling ''jeev'') is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Hall|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqzkqnETEVYC|year=2011|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3430-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, ''jiva'' is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii/&gt; The concept of ''Ajiva'' in Jainism means "not soul", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii&gt;{{cite book|author=J Jaini|title=Outlines Of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54A9AAAAIAAJ|year=1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, a ''Jiva'' is either ''samsari'' (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or ''mukta'' (liberated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN82XwAACAAJ|title=Gommatsara Jiva-kanda|first1=Jagmandar-lāl|last1=Jaini|archive-url=https://archive.org/download/sacredbooksofthe029558mbp|archive-date=2006|year=1927|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-0852-2_100397|title=Buddhism and Jainism|last=|first=|date=2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789402408515|editor-last=Sarao|editor-first=K.

The concept of ''jiva'' in Jainism is similar to ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with ''jiva'' considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=varenne46&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Varenne|title=Yoga and the Hindu Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUWxDDqzuAC&amp;pg=PA46|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0543-9|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Myers|title=Brahman: A Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfvaAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83565-0|pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kO8-980xGk8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hiranyagarba&amp;ei=gCnrSaGyLZLQMu3AmaQB ''The Philosophy of Person: Solidarity and Cultural Creativity'', Jozef Tichner and George McClean, 1994, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is sometimes referred to as ''jiva-atman'' (a soul in a living body).&lt;ref name=varenne46/&gt;

The word itself originates from the [[Sanskrit]] ''jivás'', with the root ''jīv-'' "to breathe". It has the same Indo-European root as the Latin word ''vivus'', meaning "alive".

[[Image:Johann August Ernesti - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|Johann August Ernesti]]
'''Johann August Ernesti''' (4 August 1707 – 11 September 1781) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Rationalist]] [[theology|theologian]] and [[philology|philologist]]. Ernesti was the first who formally separated the [[hermeneutics]] of the [[Old Testament]] from those of the [[New Testament|New]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Davidson, ''Sacred Hermeneutics Developed and Applied: Including a History of Biblical Interpretation from the Earliest of the Fathers to the Reformation'', Thomas Clark, 1843, p. 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ernesti was born in [[Bad Tennstedt|Tennstedt]] in present-day [[Thuringia]], where his father, [[Johann Christoph Ernesti]], was pastor, besides being superintendent of the electoral dioceses of Thuringia, Salz and Sangerhausen. At the age of sixteen, Ernesti was sent to the celebrated Saxon [[cloister school]] of [[Pforta]] (''Schulpforta''). At twenty he entered the [[University of Wittenberg]], and studied afterwards at the [[University of Leipzig]]. In 1730 he was made master in the faculty of philosophy. In the following year he accepted the office of conrector in the [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig|Thomas school of Leipzig]], of which [[Johann Matthias Gesner]] was then rector, an office to which Ernesti succeeded in 1734. He was, in 1742, named professor extraordinarius of ancient literature in the university of Leipzig, and in 1756 professor ordinarius of [[rhetoric]]. In the same year he received the degree of doctor of [[theology]], and in 1759 was appointed professor ordinarius in the faculty of theology. Through his learning and his manner of discussion, he co-operated with [[Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten|S. J. Baumgarten]] of [[university of Halle|Halle]] (1706–1757) in disengaging the current dogmatic theology from [[Lutheran Orthodoxy]], along with any [[Lutheran scholasticism|Lutheran scholastic]] or mystical influences, and thus paved a way for a Rationalist revolution in theology. He died in [[Leipzig]], after a short illness, in his seventy-sixth year.

==Work==
Apart from the quality of his own writing, Ernesti is notable for his influence on [[Sacred–profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] criticism in Germany. With [[Johann Salomo Semler|JS Semler]] he co-operated in the Rationalist revolution of [[Lutheran]] theology, and in conjunction with Gesner he instituted a new school in ancient literature. He detected grammatical niceties in [[Latin]], in regard to the consecution of tenses which had escaped preceding critics.

As an editor of the Greek classics, Ernesti does not compare with his Dutch contemporaries, [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]], [[L. C. Valckenaer]], [[David Ruhnken]] or his colleague [[Johann Jakob Reiske|J. J. Reiske]]. The [[higher criticism]] was not even attempted by Ernesti. But to him and to Gesner is due the credit of having formed, by discipline and by example, philologists greater than themselves, and of having kindled the national enthusiasm for ancient learning.

It is chiefly in [[hermeneutics]] that Ernesti has any claim to eminence as a theologian. But here his merits are distinguished, and, at the period when his ''Institutio Interpretis Novi Testamenti'' (Principles of New Testament Interpretation) was published (1761), almost peculiar to himself. In it we find the principles of a general interpretation, formed without the assistance of any particular philosophy, but consisting of observations and rules which, though already enunciated, and applied in the criticism of the profane writers, had never rigorously been employed in [[biblical exegesis]]. He was, in fact, the founder of the grammatico-historical school. He admits in the sacred writings as in the classics only one acceptation, and that the grammatical, convertible into and the same with the logical and historical. Consequently, he censures the opinion of those who in the illustration of the Scriptures refer everything to the illumination of the Holy Spirit, as well as that of others who, disregarding all knowledge of the languages, would explain words by things. The "analogy of faith," as a rule of interpretation, he greatly limits, and teaches that it can never afford of itself the explanation,of words, but only determine the choice among their possible meanings. At the same time he seems unconscious of any inconsistency between the doctrine of the inspiration of the Bible as usually received and his principles of hermeneutics.

== Conflict with J.S. Bach ==
Beginning in 1736, Ernesti became involved in a protracted dispute with J.S. Bach, who was cantor at the Thomas school at the time. The dispute concerned the appointment of a student prefect to lead musical performances whom Bach objected to, on grounds Ernesti considered spurious. This acrimonious conflict resulted in multiple letters to city officials and ultimately the king, despite the fact that Ernesti had served as godfather to Bach's children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42682699|title=Johann Sebastian Bach : the learned musician|last=Christoph.|first=Wolff,|date=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=9780393322569|location=New York|oclc=42682699}} pp. 349-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Ernesti's most notable follower was the German theologian {{Interlanguage link multi|Samuel Friedrich Nathanael Morus|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Palmer, ''Hermeneutics'', Northwestern University Press, 1969, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work influenced [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Vidal, ''The Sciences of the Soul: The Early Modern Origins of Psychology'', University of Chicago Press, 2011, p. 193 n. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C.

'''Judith Lorber''' (born November 28, 1931) is Professor Emerita of Sociology and Women’s Studies at The [[CUNY Graduate Center]] and [[Brooklyn College]] of the [[City University of New York]]. She is a foundational theorist of [[social construction of gender difference]] and has played a vital role in the formation and transformation of gender studies. She has more recently called for a de-gendering of the social world.

Lorber was actively involved in [[Sociologists for Women in Society]] from the early 1970s. She developed and taught some of the first courses in the [[sociology of gender]], [[women's studies]], and [[feminist theory]] at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School, where she was the first Coordinator of the Women's Studies Certificate Program in 1988–1991. She was Chair of the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] Sex and Gender Section in 1992–93 and was awarded the [[Jessie Bernard Award]] in 1996 “in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.”

== Biography ==

Judith Lorber was born in [[Brooklyn]] New York where she attended public elementary and high school. She graduated from [[Queens College]], CUNY in 1952, and received an M.A. and Ph.D. from [[New York University]] in 1971. She started developing and teaching courses in [[women’s studies]] in 1972, and taught at [[Fordham University]] in the [[Bronx]] and at [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[CUNY Graduate School]] until she retired from teaching in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-the-Study-of-Women-and-Society/Faculty-and-Staff#Profiles|title=Faculty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in New York/NY. She is the sister of artist Stephen Lorber (born 1943).

== Work ==

=== Gender, mental health and illness ===

The main perspective of Lorber’s work has been [[social construction]]—the idea that in social interaction, people produce their identities and statuses, and at the same time, reproduce the structure and constraints of their social world. This perspective analyzes illnesses as social states in which norms and expectations for behavior while ill emerge from the interaction of patients and health-care workers with each other and with family members, friends, and co-workers. Lorber’s next research project (with Roberta Satow) was interviewing psychiatric residents, social workers, and indigenous paraprofessionals in a ghetto community mental health center on issues of cultural congruity with patients and the stratification of prestige and work assignments.&lt;ref&gt;see co-authored articles out of this project under publications http://www.robertasatow.com/author.html#books&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Lorber’s last work on gender and health care, ''Gender and the Social Construction of Illness'', was published in 1997 as part of the Gender Lens series. A second edition, which she co-authored with Lisa Jean Moore, was published by [[Rowman and Littlefield]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and the Social Construction of Illness – Second Edition | publisher=Rowman Altamira |author1=Lorber, Judith  |author2=Moore, Lisa Jean | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-7591-0237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book shows that because gender is embedded in the economy, the family, politics, and the medical and legal systems, it is a major factor in the behavior of patients and health care professionals. She also co-authored ''Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives'' with Lisa Jean Moore. The first edition was published by Roxbury in 2007, and the second edition by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2011. The overall perspective is that of the transformation of the body through gendered social practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gendered bodies: feminist perspectives | publisher=Roxbury Pub. Co. |author1=Lorber, Judith  |author2=Moore, Lisa Jean | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-933220-41-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women physicians ===

Her work on [[women physicians]], which culminated in ''Women Physicians: Careers, Status, and Power'', published in 1984, as well as a series of papers published from 1981 to 1987, was a logical combination of her feminism and [[medical sociology]]. In it, she showed how the difficulties [[women physicians]] encountered in their career advancement when compared to a matched sample of men physicians were the result of the processes of sponsorship and patronage in the informal organization of the medical profession. She thus expanded the analysis of the informal structure of the medical profession, which had been applied only to men physicians, to women, who were, at that point, entering [[medical school]] in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Book Reviews | journal=Sociology of Health &amp; Illness | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=100 | doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep11346518| year=1986 | last1=Elston | first1=Mary Ann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the physicians that Lorber met in the course of her work on women physicians, Florence Haseltine, set her on the road to her next research project—on patient's experiences with one of the new procreative technologies -- [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF), doctor-assisted conception. The research she conducted with Lakshmi Bandlamudi and Dorothy Greenfeld found that couples shaped their experiences through their behavior with clinic staff and other caretakers and with each other, creating meaning and some sense of control for themselves. Judith Lorber applied a [[feminist analysis]] to the growing use of IVF in male infertility, where the woman is fertile but the man isn’t. This situation sets the stage for marital bargaining, in which the woman seemingly is in a strong position, but which turns out to the man's advantage because of his dominance in the gender politics of the family. The [[feminist]], [[ethical]], and medical implications of this research were explored in papers published in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;for instance: 1991. "Can Women Physicians Ever Be True Equals in the American Medical Profession?" In Current Research in Occupations and Professions, vol. 6, edited by Judith A. Levy.  Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, https://books.google.com/books/about/Current_Research_on_Occupations_and_Prof.html?id=ZnAS_gAACAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist politics ===

Lorber’s feminism (and love of science fiction thinking) appeared in print as early as 1975 in "Beyond Equality of the Sexes: The Question of the Children," followed by "Dismantling Noah's Ark" in 1986. In 1987, she became the Founding Editor of [[Gender &amp; Society]], the official publication of  [[Sociologists for Women in Society]](SWS). As a hands-on editor, Judith Lorber shaped the papers, the linguistic style, and the emerging themes. The journal was (and still is) extremely successful and is the main source of SWS’s current finances. She and Susan Farrell edited the first Gender &amp; Society reader, ''The Social Construction of Gender'', published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16138663.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpWxAAAAIAAJ|title=The Social construction of gender|first=Judith|last=Lorber|date=1 December 1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-3956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, Lorber made a significant contribution to [[gender studies]] by writing her own book that has since then become a bible and mandatory reading in women’s studies classes.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2782284|title=Review of Paradoxes of Gender|first=Rosanna|last=Hertz|date=1 January 1995|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=100|issue=5|pages=1336–1338|doi=10.1086/230645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/9405277778/gender-question|title=The Gender Question|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradoxes of Gender'', published by [[Yale]] in 1994, contends that sex, sexuality, and gender are all socially constructed but that gender is the overarching category—a major [[social status]] that organizes almost all areas of social life. Therefore, bodies and sexuality are gendered—biology, physiology, and sexuality do not add up to gender, which is a [[social institution]] that establishes patterns of expectations for individuals, orders the social processes of everyday life, is built into the major social organizations of society, and is also an entity in and of itself. Lorber's theoretical approach to gender is masterful and unusual by  mainstream empirical social science standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3175205|title=Review of Feminist Theory Today: An Introduction to Second-Wave Feminism, ; Modern Feminist Thought: From the Second Wave to "Post-Feminism.", ; Paradoxes of Gender|first=Christine|last=Di Stefano|date=1 January 1998|publisher=|journal=Signs|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1068–1072|doi=10.1086/495303}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradoxes'' has been translated into Italian and German and has influenced a generation of graduate students in the United States and other countries.

''Gender Inequalities: Feminist Theories and Politics'' was first published in 1998 by Roxbury and is now in its fifth edition, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2012. It sums up the last 35 years of feminist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socqrl.niu.edu/myers/feminisms.html | title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics. | year=1998 | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | author=Lorber, Judith | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401165143/http://www.socqrl.niu.edu/myers/feminisms.html | archivedate=April 1, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revisioning Gender'', which she co-edited with Beth Hess and [[Myra Marx Ferree]], was published by [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] in 1999. It is a collection of original essays in different areas of social research that have been changed by the use of gender as a conceptual framework. She co-edited the ''Handbook of Gender and Women’s Studies'', published by Sage UK in 2006 with [[Mary Evans]] and [[Kathy Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies | publisher=SAGE |author1=Lorber, Judith |author2=Davis, Kathy |author3=Evans, Mary | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7619-4390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Toward a World Beyond Gender" ===

Lorber’s current work is to go “beyond.” In "Beyond the Binaries: Depolarizing the Categories of Sex, Sexuality, and Gender," published in Sociological Inquiry in 1996, she argued that sociological data would be more accurate if it used more than the two polarized categories of sex, sexuality, and gender. In “Crossing Borders and Erasing Boundaries: Paradoxes of Identity Politics,” published in Sociological Focus in 1999, she pulled apart racial and transgender categories. In fact, Judith Lorber has gone so far as to argue that we should imagine a social world that is not organized by gender. She explored this idea in “Using Gender to Undo Gender: A Feminist Degendering Movement, ” published in Feminist Theory in 2000. ''Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Social Change'' puts together all the “beyond” ideas and asks us to imagine a world without gender. It was published in 2005 by [[W.W. Norton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csx.sagepub.com/content/35/3/246.full.pdf%20html|title=Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Feminist Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Feminist Change|first=Bandana|last=Purkayastha|date=1 April 2006|publisher=|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=286–288|doi=10.1177/0891243205285013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[American Sociological Association]] Annual Meetings, held in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], the theme was “utopias.” Judith Lorber gave an invited presentation at the opening plenary: “Gender Equality: Utopian and Realistic.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://videoarchive.asanet.org/presentations/2012ondemand_opening_plenary_session_equality.html?plist=2012 | title=Video of Lorber's opening lecture at ASA plenary 2012 Denver | publisher=American Sociological Association | people=Crenshaw, Kimberlé  Lorber, Judith  van Parijs, Philippe | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222001648/http://videoarchive.asanet.org/presentations/2012ondemand_opening_plenary_session_equality.html?plist=2012 | archivedate=2013-02-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also presented an invited paper, “Toward a World Beyond Gender: A Utopian Vision,” with [[Barbara J. Risman]] and Jessica Holden Sherwood. Recently, she has written and given presentations about the heroine of the popular [[Stieg Larsson]] trilogy -- “The Gender Ambiguity of [[Lisbeth Salander]]: Third-wave Feminist Hero?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Men Who Hate Women and Women Who Kick Their Asses: Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy in Feminist Perspective | publisher=Vanderbilt University Press | author=King, Donna | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-8265-1849-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology" ===

Judith Lorber is published in Chapter 3 of "The Gendered Society Reader," an anthology edited by Michael S. Kimmel; Amy Aronson; and Amy Kaler, with a text titled “Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.”

In the text, Lorber discusses the social constructs built into our society differentiating the genders. Lorber argues that “bodies differ in many ways physiologically; but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are ‘female’ and ‘male and ‘women’ and ‘men’".&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith (2011). Ch.3 "Seeing Is Believing: Biology as Ideology," pp. 11-18 in ''The Gendered Society Reader'', Ed. Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, Amy Kaler. Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2011; p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lorber points out that though the physiological differences of the sexes are there, each individual body does not always fit into its own category and “neither sex nor gender are pure categories”.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber exemplifies this by separating the genders and discussing differences within the separate ‘female’ and ‘male’ categories; she argues some women do not have ovaries and uteri, menopause differentiates menstruating women for those who do not, some men lactate, and some men cannot produce sperm. As she discusses the blurred lines surrounding individual bodies within their gender categories, she continues to exemplify the pre-determined social classifications surrounding gender in our society by using competitive sports.

In Lorber’s section of this Chapter 3 headed ‘What Sports Illustrate,’ she argues that the pre-determined societal beliefs surrounding gender have turned competitive sports into a way for men to legitimize aggression and create their masculine identity. Conversely, Lorber believes that the female sex in competitive sports is made a mockery of and continually takes a “secondary status” to competitive male sports.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber uses the example of basketball to confirm her belief. She correlates the female secondary status to assumptions surrounding women’s physiology. As well Lorber believes this assumption of physiology influences rules in women's sports, rules in sporting competitions, and how women are treated in sporting competitions.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

However, Lorber connects these social barriers that continually separate the sexes in sports, with the economical barriers oppressing the female sex. She compares competitive sports to big businesses and therefore argues that they are no longer just a social construct but an economic, political, and ideological issue developed by those who define and profit from competitive sports.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lorber (2011), pp. 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorber continues to describe social boundaries set up by gender using technology; she brings up two examples—computers and cars. When computers first came into use, office jobs involving them were given to women, as it appeared to be a clerical duty. It was not until computers were revealed to be complex and intellectually demanding that they became the domain of men. “By the 1960s programing was split into more and less skilled specialties, and the entry of women into the computer field in the 1970s and 1980s was confined to the lower paid specialties…employers invoked women and men’s purportedly natural capabilities for the jobs for which they were hired”.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; This means women will do the more menial tasks, where men will shape the industry and control it. Lorber also describes how this has influenced young people; for example we see far more young men and boys playing computer games and getting involved in computer clubs. In this way we are furthering women’s supposed natural disadvantage with computers by allowing boys to get more education and comfort with computers than girls.

This pattern of male control over technology continues when it comes to cars. Lorber references the fact that in couples a man will almost always be the more frequent driver, regardless of aptitude. This may seem like an inconsequential example, but Lorber asks us to consider in different contexts what a vehicle can mean. She describes the importance of the mobility, literally and figuratively, given to women by driving. Feminists used driving “to campaign for women’s suffrage in parts of the United States not served by public transportation and they effectively used motorcades and speaking from cars as campaign tactics”.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Lorber also describes the sense of liberation felt by many women when they first experienced driving, while participating in First World War efforts. This gendering of who a driver can be does limit women’s options in the world more than we consider when we simply see the male in a couple taking the wheel.

Lorber finalizes her arguments discussing the paradoxes of human nature. She confirms, “gendered people do not emerge from physiology or hormones, but from the exigencies of the social order”.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber points out that the diversity of humans could be categorized, regrouped and broken up into different ways of comparison than the traditional sex differentiation that disregards the real issues of who is truly like whom.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; She argues that the problem of basing knowledge on presumptions of gender differences reaffirms the categorization of the ‘male’ versus ‘female’. When relying on the conventional categorization of gender, one is able to find what they are looking for.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber states, “we see what we believe, whether it is that ‘female’ and ‘males’ are essentially different or that ‘women’ and ‘men’ are essentially the same.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

== Selected honors and awards ==

Judith Lorber received the [[American Sociological Association]]’s [[Jessie Bernard]] Career Award in 1996 for “scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/about/awards/bernard.cfm | title=Jessie Bernard ASA Major Award | accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was President of the [[Eastern Sociological Society]] in 2001–2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essnet.org/OfficersPast.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010002414/http://www.essnet.org/OfficersPast.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the Sex and Gender Section of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1993, and President of [[Sociologists for Women in Society]] in 1981–82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socwomen.org/web/about/leadership/3003-past-presidents-and-officers.html | title=Past Presidents and Officers | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415214534/http://www.socwomen.org/web/about/leadership/3003-past-presidents-and-officers.html | archivedate=April 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3740">In [[category theory]], a '''Krull–Schmidt category''' is a generalization of categories in which the [[Krull–Schmidt theorem]] holds. They arise, for example, in the study of finite-dimensional [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over an [[algebra over a field|algebra]].

== Definition ==

Let ''C'' be an [[additive category]], or more generally an additive [[preadditive category#R-linear categories|{{mvar|R}}-linear category]] for a [[commutative ring]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}}. We call ''C'' a '''Krull–Schmidt category''' provided that every object decomposes into a finite direct sum of objects having local endomorphism rings. Equivalently, ''C'' has [[split idempotent]]s and the endomorphism ring of every object is [[perfect ring#semiperfect ring|semiperfect]].

== Properties ==

One has the analogue of the Krull–Schmidt theorem in Krull–Schmidt categories:

An object is called ''indecomposable'' if it is not isomorphic to a direct sum of two nonzero objects. In a Krull–Schmidt category we have that
*an object is indecomposable if and only if its endomorphism ring is local.
*every object is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposable objects.
*if &lt;math&gt;X_1 \oplus X_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus X_r \cong Y_1 \oplus Y_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus Y_s&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_j&lt;/math&gt; are all indecomposable, then &lt;math&gt;r=s&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X_{\pi(i)} \cong Y_i&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|i}}.

One can define the [[Auslander–Reiten quiver]] of a Krull–Schmidt category.

== Examples ==

* An [[abelian category]] in which every object has [[finite length]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the classical case, see for example Krause (2012), Corollary 3.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes as a special case the category of finite-dimensional modules over an algebra.
* The category of finitely-generated modules over a '''finite'''&lt;ref&gt;A finite {{mvar|R}}-algebra is an {{mvar|R}}-algebra which is finitely generated as an {{mvar|R}}-module.&lt;/ref&gt; [[associative algebra|{{mvar|R}}-algebra]], where {{mvar|R}} is a [[commutative]] [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[complete local ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiner (2003), Section 6, Exercises 5 and 6, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The category of [[coherent sheaves]] on a [[complete variety]] over an [[algebraically closed|algebraically-closed field]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah (1956), Theorem 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A non-example ===

The category of finitely-generated [[projective module]]s over the integers has split idempotents, and every module is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the regular module, the number being given by the [[invariant basis number|rank]]. Thus the category has unique decomposition into indecomposables, but is not Krull-Schmidt since the regular module does not have a local endomorphism ring.

Liberalism became a distinct [[Political movement|movement]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when it became popular among [[Western world|Western]] philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[Nobility|hereditary privilege]], [[state religion]], [[absolute monarchy]], the [[divine right of kings]] and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]] with [[representative democracy]] and the [[rule of law]]. Liberals also ended [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies, [[Legal monopoly|royal monopolies]] and other [[Trade barrier|barriers to trade]], instead promoting free markets.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Philosopher [[John Locke]] is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, arguing that each man has a [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]] to [[life, liberty and property]],&lt;ref&gt;"All mankind [...] being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions", John Locke, ''Second Treatise of Government''&lt;/ref&gt; adding that governments must not violate these [[rights]] based on the [[social contract]]. While the [[Gladstonian liberalism|British liberal tradition]] has emphasised expanding democracy, [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|French liberalism]] has emphasised rejecting [[authoritarianism]] and is linked to [[Nationalism|nation-building]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"&gt;Kirchner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-15605-7|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Revolution]] of 1776 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of royal [[tyranny]]. Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across [[Liberalism in Europe|Europe]] and [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|South America]], whereas it was well-established alongside [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in the [[Liberalism in the United States|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC&amp;pg=PA237|year=2007|publisher=Brill|page=237|isbn=9004160523}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Victorian Britain]], it was used to critique the political establishment, appealing to science and reason on behalf of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Politics of Cognition: Liberalism and the Evolutionary Origins of Victorian Education|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=2017|volume=50|pages=677–699|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000863|url=https://www.academia.edu/31947844/The_Politics_of_Cognition_Liberalism_and_the_Evolutionary_Origins_of_Victorian_Education_British_Journal_for_the_History_of_Science_50_2017_677_699}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 19th and early 20th century, [[Liberalism in Turkey|liberalism in the Ottoman Empire]] and Middle East influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Al-Nahda]] as well as the rise of secularism, [[constitutionalism]] and [[nationalism]]. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within [[Islam]], which continues to this day, leading to [[Islamic revivalism]]. Before 1920, the main ideological opponent of [[classical liberalism]] was [[conservatism]], but liberalism then faced major ideological challenges from new opponents: [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. However, during the 20th century liberal ideas also spread even further—especially in Western Europe—as [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] found themselves on the winning side in both world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conway. "The Limits of an Anti-liberal Europe". In {{cite book|author=Dieter Gosewinkel, ed.|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECIfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184|year=2014|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=184|isbn=9781782384267|quote=Liberalism, liberal values and liberal institutions formed an integral part of that process of European consolidation.

In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"] by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] (1956) from: ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962). "Liberalism in the U.S. usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any other country, save possibly Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Liberal Party|liberal parties]] continue to wield power and influence [[Liberalism by country|throughout the world]]. However, liberalism still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. The fundamental elements of [[Modernity|contemporary society]] have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding [[constitution]]al [[government]] and [[parliament]]ary authority.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"&gt;Gould, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]], such as  [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]]; an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]] and public [[Jury trial|trial by jury]]; and the abolition of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privileges.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights.&lt;ref name="Worell470"&gt;Worell, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals have [[Advocacy|advocated]] gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a [[Civil rights movements|global civil rights movement]] in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Continental European liberalism is divided between [[moderate]]s and [[Progressivism|progressives]], with the moderates tending to [[elitism]] and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as [[universal suffrage]], [[Universal access to education|universal education]] and the expansion of [[Property|property rights]]. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"/&gt;

== Etymology and definition ==
Words such as [[wikt:Liberal|liberal]], [[wikt:Liberty|liberty]], [[wikt:Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[libertine]] all trace their history to the Latin ''[[wikt:Liber|liber]]'', which means "[[wikt:Free|free]]".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"&gt;Gross, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded instances of the word "liberal" occurs in 1375, when it was used to describe the [[liberal arts]] in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; The word's early connection with the classical education of a medieval university soon gave way to a proliferation of different denotations and connotations. "Liberal" could refer to "free in bestowing" as early as 1387, "made without stint" in 1433, "freely permitted" in 1530 and "free from restraint"—often as a pejorative remark—in the 16th and the 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 16th century [[Kingdom of England|England]], "liberal" could have positive or negative attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of "a liberal villaine" who "hath [...] confest his vile encounters".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; With the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as "free from narrow prejudice" in 1781 and "free from bigotry" in 1823.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 1815, the first use of the word "liberalism" appeared in English.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberales]]'', the first group to use the liberal label in a political context,&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; fought for decades for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. From 1820 to 1823 during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] was compelled by the ''liberales'' to swear to uphold the Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, "liberal" was used as a politicised term for parties and movements worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Kirchner, ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe'', "Liberal parties were among the first political parties to form, and their long-serving and influential records, as participants in parliaments and governments, raise important questions [...]", Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32394-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the meaning of the word "liberalism" began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [[individualism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics previously associated with classical liberalism became the basis for the emerging school of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html ''The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and are key components of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]].

Unlike Europe and Latin America, the word "liberalism" in North America almost exclusively refers to social liberalism. The dominant Canadian party is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the United States' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is usually considered liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, p. 142. "After a dozen years of centre-left Liberal Party rule, the Conservative Party emerged from the 2006 parliamentary elections with a plurality and established a fragile minority government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 106–07. [Talking about the Democratic Party] "Its liberalism is for the most part the later version of liberalism – modern liberalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 3. "Modern liberalism occupies the left-of-center in the traditional political spectrum and is represented by the Democratic Party in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Liberalism—both as a political current and an intellectual tradition—is mostly a modern phenomenon that started in the 17th century, although some liberal philosophical ideas had precursors in [[classical antiquity]] and in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]].&lt;ref name="BevirSAGE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"/&gt; The [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] praised, "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also recognised a number of principles familiar to contemporary liberals in the works of several [[Sophism|Sophists]] and in the ''Funeral Oration'' by [[Pericles]].&lt;ref name="Young, pp. 25–6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal philosophy symbolises an extensive intellectual tradition that has examined and popularised some of the most important and controversial principles of the modern world. Its immense scholarly and academic output has been characterised as containing "richness and diversity", but that diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone looking for a clear definition.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major themes ===
{{Individualism sidebar|expanded=Philosophies}}
Though all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain "separate and often contradictory streams of thought".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"/&gt; The objectives of [[List of liberal theorists|liberal theorists and philosophers]] have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the numerous adjectives that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term "liberalism", including [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Economic liberalism|economic]], [[Social liberalism|social]], [[welfare state]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Deontological ethics|deontological]], [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]], [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[institution]]al,  to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these variations, liberal thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions. At its very root, liberalism is a philosophy about the meaning of humanity and society.

Political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, [[meliorism|meliorist]] and [[Universalism|universalist]]. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same [[Morality|moral]] worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local [[Culture|cultural]] differences.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"&gt;Gray, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy, defended by thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves through social [[cooperation]] would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it "has been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation&amp;nbsp;[...] it has exalted the power of reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural rights and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian theory]], although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"/&gt; Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [[individual liberty]], supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[toleration]], autonomy, [[bodily integrity]] and [[Consent of the governed|consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical and modern ===
Enlightenment philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"&gt;Delaney, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"&gt;Godwin et al., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature—a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state—he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical authority (the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]] which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life—[[liberty]] and [[private property]] among them—required the formation of a "sovereign" authority with universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas. Once humans moved out of their [[State of nature|natural state]] and formed societies, Locke argued as follows: "Thus that which begins and actually constitutes any [[State (polity)|political society]] is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The stringent insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated the divine right of kings&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and echoed the earlier thought of [[Aristotle]]. One political scientist described this new thinking as follows: "In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Zvesper, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the ''First Treatise'', Locke aimed his guns first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [[Robert Filmer]]. Filmer's ''Patriarcha'' (1680) argued for the [[divine right of kings]] by appealing to [[Bible|biblical]] teaching, claiming that the authority granted to [[Adam]] by [[God]] gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with Filmer that the ''First Treatise'' is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of ''Patriarcha''. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that "conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women".&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"&gt;Kerber, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was not to [[Male privilege|men over women]], as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt; Locke was certainly no [[feminism|feminist]] by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [[social theory]].&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt;

[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644) argued for the importance of [[freedom of speech]]]]
Locke also originated the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''. Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could, enforcing a single "[[Supremacism#Religious|true religion]]" would not have the desired effect because belief cannot be compelled by [[Religious violence|violence]]; (3) coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke was also influenced by the liberal ideas of [[Presbyterian]] politician and poet [[John Milton]], who was a staunch advocate of freedom in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Bornkamm | language = German | contribution = Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1962}}, 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 942&lt;/ref&gt; Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]]. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges. ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8'' (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71, 72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As assistant to [[Oliver Cromwell]], Milton also took part in drafting a constitution of the [[Independent politician|independents]] (''Agreement of the People''; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans as a consequence of democratic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Wertenbruch | contribution = Menschenrechte | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | language = German | place = Tübingen, DE | year = 1960}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 869&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Areopagitica]]'', Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech—"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in "[[Marketplace of ideas|a free and open encounter]]" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.

In a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and [[self-preservation]] and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.&lt;ref name="Young 30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This power could be formed in the framework of a [[civil society]] that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong justification.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers decried government outright, with [[Thomas Paine]] writing "government even in its best state is a necessary evil".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the project to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as [[James Madison]] and [[Montesquieu]] conceived the notion of [[separation of powers]], a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31" /&gt; Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and [[revolution]], if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited [[Constitution#Governmental constitutions|constitutional government]] while also advocating for [[Social services|state services]] and [[Provisioning|provisions]] to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [[Economic interventionism|greater role for government]] in the administration of economic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order emanated [[Consent of the governed|from human interactions]], not from [[Divine law|divine will]].&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"&gt;Gould, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals were openly hostile to [[religious belief]] itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"/&gt;

Beyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have obsessed over the meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th century until the 19th century, liberals (from [[Adam Smith]] to [[John Stuart Mill]]) conceptualised liberty as the absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, "the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"/&gt; Support for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]] is often associated with this principle, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] arguing in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thomas Hill Green]] was an influential [[List of liberal theorists|liberal philosopher]] who in ''Prolegomena to Ethics'' (1884) established the first major foundations for what later became known as [[positive liberty]] and in a few years his ideas became the [[Liberal welfare reforms|official policy]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|Britain]], precipitating the rise of social liberalism and the modern [[welfare state]]]]
The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|in Britain]] and was based on the following core concepts: [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], ''laissez-faire'' government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"&gt;Vincent, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 19th century, a new conception of liberty entered the liberal intellectual arena. This new kind of liberty became known as [[positive liberty]] to distinguish it from the prior [[negative liberty|negative version]] and it was first developed by [[British philosophy|British philosopher]] [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by [[self-interest]], emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our [[moral character]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"&gt;Adams, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine [[choice]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"/&gt; Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: {{quote|If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to do what one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Wempe, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Rather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all individuals have a [[duty]] to promote the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] and [[John A. Hobson]]. In a few years, this ''New Liberalism'' had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand [[Universal suffrage|suffrage rights]], liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the [[Voting|democratic decision-making process]] were liable to the "[[tyranny of the majority]]", a concept explained in Mill's ''On Liberty'' and in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"/&gt;

Besides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, [[Voltaire]] commented that "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are [[Equality before the law|equal subjects before the law]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher [[John Rawls]] emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their [[Motivation|aspirations]] in life.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt; Libertarian thinker [[Robert Nozick]] disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of [[Equal opportunity|Lockean equality]] instead.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt;

To contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=42–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a governing framework that [[Conflict resolution|harmonises and minimises conflicting views]], but still allows those views to exist and flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to disagree.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [[religious toleration]], with [[Baruch Spinoza]] condemning "the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt; Toleration also played a central role in the [[Kantianism|ideas of Kant]] and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own choices without interference from the state or other individuals.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt;

=== Liberal economic theory ===
{{main|Economic liberalism}}
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"&gt;Mills, pp. 63, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [[Pricing|prices]] and the [[distribution of wealth]] and the [[Economic policy|policies]] the state should follow in order to maximise [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith wrote that as long as [[Supply and demand|supply, demand]], [[price]]s and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22 The Wealth of Nations]'', Strahan and Cadell, 1778&lt;/ref&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"/&gt;

Smith assumed that workers could be [[Salary|paid]] as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [[international trade]], which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed restrictive [[trade preference]]s, state grants of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[employers' organisation]]s and [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Government should be limited to defence, [[public work]]s and the [[administration of justice]], financed by [[Income tax|taxes based on income]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [[globalisation]] literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 69"&gt;Mills, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's iron law of wages became central doctrines of classical economics.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several liberals, including Adam Smith and Richard Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith argued that as societies progressed the spoils of war would rise, but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.

[[Utilitarianism]] provided the [[Legitimacy (political)|political justification]] for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that [[public policy]] should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government [[social control]], including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.

==== Keynesian economics ====
{{main|Keynesian economics}}
[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times and whose ideas, which are still [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which [[Keynesian Revolution]] took place (the image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in California, taken in March 1936)]]
During the [[Great Depression]], the definitive liberal response to it was given by the English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946). Keynes had been "brought up" as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal.&lt;ref&gt;See studies of Keynes by, e.g., [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], Donald Moggridge, and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's [[austerity]] measures [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|during the Great Depression]]. He believed that [[budget deficit]]s were a good thing, a product of [[recession]]s. He wrote: "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[multiplier effect]].&lt;ref name="Skid30s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman|year=2003|isbn=0-330-488678|pages=494–500, 504, 509–510|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', was published in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tribe, ''Economic careers: economics and economists in Britain, 1930–1970'' (1997), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a theoretical justification for the [[Economic interventionism|interventionist policies]] Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [[Market (economics)|market]] would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] had believed in [[Say's law]], which simply put states that "[[supply creates its own demand]]" and that in a [[free market]] workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]], i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[[aggregate demand]]" and "[[aggregate supply]]" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he wrote: "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"/&gt; Where the market failed to properly allocate resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing again—a "prime the pump" kind of strategy designed to boost [[industrial production]].&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 808.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal feminist theory ===
{{main|Liberal feminism}}
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], widely regarded as the pioneer of [[liberal feminism]]]]
[[Liberal feminism]], the dominant tradition in [[History of feminism|feminist history]], is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]] which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal feminists hope to eradicate all barriers to [[gender equality]], claiming that the continued existence of such barriers eviscerates the individual rights and freedoms ostensibly guaranteed by a liberal social order.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that society holds the false belief that women are by nature [[Gender inequality|less intellectually and physically capable]] than men; thus it tends to [[Sexism|discriminate against women]] in the [[Sexism in academia|academy]], the forum and the [[Occupational sexism|marketplace]]. Liberal feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie. 1989. Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction. Oxon, United Kingdom: Unwin Human Ltd. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[List of women philosophers|philosopher]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) is widely regarded as the pioneer of liberal feminism, with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) expanding the boundaries of liberalism to include women in the political structure of liberal society.&lt;ref&gt;Falco, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In her writings such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft commented on society's view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft "denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that "until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1869). The Subjection of Women (1869 first ed.). London: Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer. Retrieved 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same "genuine unselfishness" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one "that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being.

[[File:Jean Charles de Sismondi.png|thumb|upright|[[Sismondi]] in 1819 wrote the first critique of the free market from a liberal perspective]]
[[Jean Charles Léonard Simonde de Sismondi]]'s ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population'' (1819) represents the first comprehensive liberal critique of early capitalism and laissez-faire economics, and his writings, which were studied by [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] among many others, had a profound influence on both liberal and socialist responses to the failures and contradictions of industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Ross E. |title=Sismondi's Forgotten Ethical Critique of Early Capitalism |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=1984 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=227–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spiegel |first1=Henry William |title=The Growth of Economic Thought |date=1991 |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stedman Jones, Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l'Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

The ideal of the [[Self-made man|self-made individual]], who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]] and ''laissez-faire'' capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some [[Victorian literature|Victorian writers]], including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]], became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an [[equal opportunity]] of success.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]
[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [[tyranny of the majority]], respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of liberty, influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), "The Contest in America". Harper's New Monthly Magazine. Volume 24. Issue 143. pp. 683–684. Harper &amp; Bros. New York. April 1862.

Another early liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Seeing the effects of alcohol, he believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., "T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation", ''History of Political Thought'', 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'' (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt; Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.

The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse and [[John A. Hobson]], saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; It supports a [[mixed economy]] that includes both [[public property|public]] and private property in [[capital good]]s.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G.

=== Anarcho-capitalist theory ===
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
[[File:Gustavedemolinari.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819–1912)]]
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1863) b 269.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julius Faucher]] (1820–1878)]]
[[Classical liberalism]] advocates [[free trade]] under the rule of law.  [[Anarcho-capitalism]] goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being provided by private companies.  Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of [[privatizing]] protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: "No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society versus state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Molinari-1849"&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QjP50k9o?url=http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm |date=31 July 2007 }} (trans. J. Huston McCulloch). Retrieved 15 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]]. However, the first person to use the term anarcho-capitalism was [[Murray Rothbard]], who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the [[Austrian School]] of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (while rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the norms they derived from it).&lt;ref&gt;"A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker." Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]], [[private property]] and [[free markets]]. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of [[statute]] (law by [[decree]] or [[legislation]]), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents describe as a "[[voluntary society]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Morris |first=Andrew |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n8 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=13–14 |quote= |ref= |chapter=Anarcho-Capitalism |title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham, ''Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nft4e62nicsC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anarcho-capitalism+libertarian&amp;sa=X&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20libertarian p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anarcho-capitalist society, [[law enforcement]], [[court]]s and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through [[taxation]]. [[Money]], along with all other [[goods and services]], would be [[free banking|privately and competitively provided]] in an [[open market]]. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based [[dispute resolution organizations]] under [[tort]] and [[contract]] law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies.&lt;ref name="libertarianpapers"&gt;[http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-3.pdf "Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics – Don Stacy"] Libertarian Papers VOL. 3, ART.

[[File:John Locke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]] was the first to develop a liberal philosophy, including the [[Right to property|right to private property]] and the [[consent of the governed]]]]
Isolated strands of liberal thought had existed in [[Western philosophy]] since the [[Ancient Greeks]] and in [[Eastern philosophy]] since the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct ideology, by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Edmund S.

These ideas began to coalesce at the time of the [[English Civil War]]s. The [[Levellers]], a radical political movement, during the war called for [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|freedom of religion]], frequent convening of parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the [[Early modern Britain|17th century in England]], culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]] and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-15605-7 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The [[United States in Congress Assembled|Confederation Congress]] called a [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new [[Constitution of the United States]] establishing a [[Federation|federal]] government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC|year=2007|publisher=Brill|pages=237–38|isbn=90-04-16052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.

In Europe, liberalism has a long tradition dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;German songs like ''[[Die Gedanken sind frei]]'' (''Thoughts Are Free'') can be dated even centuries before that.&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution began in 1789. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions as well as the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Meacham|title=Thomas Jefferson: President and Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvBMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|year=2014|publisher=Random House|page=131|isbn=9780385387514}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]] and equality under the law for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; His most lasting achievement, the [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]], served as "an object of emulation all over the globe",&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but it also perpetuated further discrimination against women under the banner of the "natural order".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, pp. 98–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution in Britain.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"/&gt; [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"/&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and [[popular sovereignty]]. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]], liberal unrest dates back to the 18th century, when liberal agitation in Latin America led to [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Ardao, "Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515–522. [http://pics3441.upmf-grenoble.fr/articles/cult/assimilation_and_transformation_of_positivism_in_latin_america.pdf Online]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190612/http://pics3441.upmf-grenoble.fr/articles/cult/assimilation_and_transformation_of_positivism_in_latin_america.pdf|date=12 February 2015}}; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707981 also in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a [[American Civil War|vicious war]] ensured the integrity of the nation and the abolition of slavery in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Al-Nahda]]; the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism; and different intellectuals and religious group and movements, like the [[Young Ottomans]] and [[Islamic Modernism]]. Prominent of the era were [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]], [[Namık Kemal]] and [[İbrahim Şinasi]]. However, the reformist ideas and trends did not reach the common population successfully as the books, periodicals and newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class while many [[Muslim]]s saw them as foreign influences on the [[Liberalism and progressivism in the Muslim world|world of Islam]]. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref name="Abdelmoula"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdelmoula|first1=Ezzeddine|title=Al Jazeera and Democratization: The Rise of the Arab Public Sphere|year=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1317518470|pages=50–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vP7qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderic.

[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]] and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'' in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuit order]]. By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly implausible. Victorian writers like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]] were early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"/&gt;

Liberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of [[autocracy]], the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]]. The Allied victory in the [[First World War]] and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, not just among the [[Allies of World War I|victorious allies]], but also in Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]".

In the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First]] and [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] and the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Persian constitutional period]], but it declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of [[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=Liberal Islam: A Source Book|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195116224|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8HSe9SfXMC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moaddel1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moaddel|first1=Mansoor|title=Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226533336|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6BLopmn3gC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lapidus"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies |last=Lapidus |first=Ira Marvin |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521779332 |page=496 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LorentzIran"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=1461731917|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"/&gt; However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.

In the United States, [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] traces its history to the popular presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who initiated the [[New Deal]] in response to the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and won an [[List of Presidents of the United States|unprecedented four elections]]. The [[New Deal coalition]] established by Roosevelt left a decisive legacy and influenced many future American presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alterman, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide Great Depression, starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and [[communism]], especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, pp. 218–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in [[World War II]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945 and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the [[Communist state|Communist]] [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc]].

[[Liberalism in Iran|In Iran]], liberalism enjoyed wide popularity. In April 1951, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] became the governing coalition when democratically elected [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], a liberal nationalist, took office as the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]]. However, his way of governing entered in conflict with Western interest and he was removed from power in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup on 19 August 1953]]. The coup ended the dominance of liberalism in the country's politics.&lt;ref name="jrisen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html|publisher=The New York Times|title=Secrets of History: The C.I.A. in Iran|author=[[James Risen]]|date=16 April 2000|accessdate=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Clandestine Service History: Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran'' (March 1954). p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CN-IC-01"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781845113476|pages=775 of 1082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQnpQNKeKKAC&amp;pg=PA775&amp;lpg=PA775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FP 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CIA Admits It Was Behind Iran's Coup|first=Malcolm|last=Bryne|date=18 August 2013|journal=Foreign Policy |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/19/cia-admits-it-was-behind-irans-coup/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The CIA's history of the 1953 coup in Iran is made up of the following documents: a historian's note, a summary introduction, a lengthy narrative account written by Dr. Donald N.

Among the various regional and national movements, the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States during the 1960s strongly highlighted the liberal efforts for [[Social equality|equal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Society]] project launched by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] oversaw the creation of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], the establishment of [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] and the [[Job Corps]] as part of the [[War on Poverty]] and the passage of the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], an altogether rapid series of events that some historians have dubbed the "Liberal Hour".&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nizhny Novgorod. Anti-Corruption Rally (26 March 2017).jpg|thumb|[[2017 Russian protests]], organized by Russia's liberal opposition]]
The Cold War featured extensive ideological competition and several [[proxy war]]s, but the widely feared [[World War III]] between the Soviet Union and the United States never occurred. While communist states and liberal democracies competed against one another, an [[1973 oil crisis|economic crisis]] in the 1970s inspired a move away from [[Keynesian economics]], especially under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States. This trend, called "[[neoliberalism]]" by its opponents, lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th century communist states in Eastern Europe [[Revolutions of 1989|collapsed precipitously]], leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms of government in the West.

At the beginning of World War II, the number of democracies around the world was about the same as it had been forty years before.&lt;ref&gt;Colomer, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, liberal democracies spread very quickly, but then retreated. In ''The Spirit of Democracy'', Larry Diamond argues that by 1974 "dictatorship, not democracy, was the way of the world" and that "barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free, and fair elections". Diamond goes on to say that democracy bounced back and by 1995 the world was "predominantly democratic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Diamond|title=The Spirit of Democracy: The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx3JTGSB5JcC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2008|publisher=Henry Holt|page=7|isbn=978-0-8050-7869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2016|publisher=Freedom House|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2016?gclid=COLduYD4ys4CFVUvgQodDPkNvw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has drawn both criticism and support in its history from various ideological groups. Less friendly to the goals of liberalism has been [[conservatism]]. [[Edmund Burke]], considered by some to be the first major proponent of modern conservative thought, offered a blistering critique of the French Revolution by assailing the liberal pretensions to the power of rationality and to the natural equality of all humans.&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"&gt;Grigsby, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion remains about the relationship between social liberalism and [[socialism]], despite the fact that many variants of socialism distinguish themselves markedly from liberalism by [[anti-capitalism|opposing capitalism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[private property]]. Socialism formed as a group of related yet divergent ideologies in the 19th century such as [[Christian socialism]], [[communism]] (with the writings of [[Karl Marx]]) and [[social anarchism]] (with the writings of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]), the latter two influenced by the [[Paris Commune]]. These ideologies—as with liberalism and conservatism—fractured into several major and minor movements in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx rejected the foundational aspects of liberal theory, hoping to destroy both the state and the liberal distinction between society and the individual while fusing the two into a collective whole designed to overthrow the developing capitalist order of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, socialist parties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents leading national governments in many countries.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that—in contrast with [[Marxism]]—liberal science defends [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selsam|first1=Howard|last2=Martel|first2=Harry|authorlink1=Howard Selsam|title=Reader in Marxist Philosophy|year=1963|publisher=[[International Publishers]]|isbn=0717801675|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenin|first1=Vladimir|authorlink1=Vladimir Lenin|title=On Culture and Cultural Revolution|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=1434463524|page=34|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some proponents of liberalism like [[George Henry Evans]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Thomas Paine]] were critics of wage slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html Social Security Online History Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|authorlink1=Junius P.

In the same vein, conservatives have also attacked what they perceive to be the reckless liberal pursuit of progress and material gains, arguing that such preoccupations undermine traditional social values rooted in community and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few variations of conservatism, like [[liberal conservativism]], expound some of the same ideas and principles championed by classical liberalism, including "small government and thriving capitalism".&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"/&gt;

[[Social democracy]], an ideology advocating progressive modification of [[capitalism]], emerged in the 20th century and was influenced by socialism. Broadly defined as a project that aims to correct through government reformism what it regards as the intrinsic defects of capitalism by reducing inequalities,&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; social democracy was also not against the state. Several commentators have noted strong similarities between social liberalism and social democracy, with one political scientist even calling American liberalism "bootleg social democracy" due to the absence of a significant social democratic tradition in the United States that liberals have tried to rectify.&lt;ref&gt;Susser, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Another movement associated with modern democracy, [[Christian democracy]], hopes to spread [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic social ideas]] and has gained a large following in some European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The early roots of Christian democracy developed as a reaction against the [[industrialisation]] and [[urbanisation]] associated with ''laissez-faire'' liberalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complex relationships, some scholars have argued that liberalism actually "rejects ideological thinking" altogether, largely because such thinking could lead to unrealistic expectations for human society.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fascism and ideology#Liberalism|Fascists accuse liberalism]] of materialism and a lack of spiritual values.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society – From 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 pp. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness,&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"/&gt; but many fascists agree with liberals in their support of [[private property rights]] and a [[market economy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"/&gt;

Scholars have praised the influence of liberal internationalism, claiming that the rise of [[globalisation]] "constitutes a triumph of the liberal vision that first appeared in the eighteenth century" while also writing that liberalism is "the only comprehensive and hopeful vision of world affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Venturelli, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lifting diagram.png|right|thumb|100px|Lift of ''f'' ([[commutative diagram]])]] In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[category theory]], given a [[morphism]] ''f'' from an object ''X'' to an object ''Y'', and a morphism ''g'' from an object ''Z'' to ''Y'', a '''lift''' or '''lifting''' of ''f'' to ''Z'' is a morphism ''h'' from ''X'' to ''Z'' such that ''f'' = ''g ∘ h''. We then say that ''f'' [[List of mathematical jargon#factor through|factors through]] ''h''. 

A basic example in [[topology]] is lifting a [[path (topology)|path]] in one space to a path in a [[covering space]]. Consider, for instance, mapping opposite points on a [[sphere]] to the same point, a continuous map from the sphere covering the [[projective plane]]. A path in the projective plane is a continuous map from the unit interval, [0,1]. We can lift such a path to the sphere by choosing one of the two sphere points mapping to the first point on the path, then maintain continuity. In this case, each of the two starting points forces a unique path on the sphere, the lift of the path in the projective plane. Thus in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f\colon&amp; [0,1] \to \mathbb{RP}^2 , &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{(projective plane path)} \\
 g\colon&amp; S^2 \to \mathbb{RP}^2 , &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{(covering map)} \\
 h\colon&amp; [0,1] \to S^2 . &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{(sphere path)} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Lifts are ubiquitous; for example, the definition of [[fibration]]s (see [[homotopy lifting property]]) and the valuative criteria of [[separated morphism|separated]] and [[proper map]]s of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] are formulated in terms of existence and (in the last case) [[Uniqueness theorem|uniqueness]] of certain lifts.

In [[algebraic topology]] and [[homological algebra]], [[tensor product]] and the [[Hom functor]] are [[tensor-hom adjunction|adjoint]]; however, they might not always lift to an [[exact sequence]]. This leads to the definition of the [[Ext functor]] and the [[Tor functor]].

{{Marxian economics}}
'''Marxian class theory''' asserts that an individual’s position within a class hierarchy is determined by his or her role in the production process, and argues that political and ideological consciousness is determined by class position.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, F. Marx’s Theory of History: A Bourgeois Critique. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social class|class]] is those who share common economic interests, are [[class consciousness|conscious]] of those interests, and engage in [[collective action]] which advances those interests.&lt;ref name=CJPSEA&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edward Andrew|title=Class in Itself and Class against Capital: Karl Marx and His Classifiers|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=September 1983|volume=16|issue=3|pages=577–584|jstor=3227396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Marxian class theory, the structure of the production process forms the basis of class construction.

To Marx, a class is a group with intrinsic tendencies and interests that differ from those of other groups within society, the basis of a fundamental antagonism between such groups. For example, it is in the laborer's best interest to maximize wages and benefits and in the capitalist's best interest to maximize profit at the expense of such, leading to a contradiction within the capitalist system, even if the laborers and capitalists themselves are [[False consciousness|unaware of the clash of interests]].

Marxian class theory has been open to a range of alternate positions, most notably from scholars such as E. P. Thompson and Mario Tronti. Both Thompson and Tronti suggest class consciousness within the production process precedes the formation of productive relationships. In this sense, Marxian class theory often relates to discussion over pre-existing class struggles.

==Origins of Marx's theory==
[[Karl Marx]]'s class theory derives from a range of philosophical schools of thought including left Hegelianism, Scottish Empiricism, and Anglo-French political-economics. Marx's view of class originated from a series of personal interests relating to social alienation and human struggle, whereby the formation of class structure relates to acute historical consciousness.  Political-economics also contributed to Marx's theories, centering on the concept of "origin of income" where society is divided into three sub-groups: Rentier, Capitalist, and Worker. This construction is based on [[David Ricardo]]'s theory of capitalism. Marx strengthened this with a discussion over verifiable class relationships.

Marx sought to define class as embedded in productive relations rather than social status. His political and economic thought developed towards an interest in production as opposed to distribution, and this henceforth became a central theme in his concept of class.

==Class structure==
Marx distinguishes one class from another on the basis of two criteria: ownership of the [[means of production]] and control of the [[labor power]] of others. From this, Marx states "Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other":

I. Capitalists, or bourgeoisie, own the means of production and purchase the labor power of others

II. Workers, or proletariat, do not own any means of production or the ability to purchase the labor power of others. Rather, they sell their own labor power.

Class is thus determined by property relations, not by income or status. These factors are determined by distribution and consumption, which mirror the production and power relations of classes.

[[The Manifesto of the Communist Party]] describes two additional classes that “decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry”:

iii. A small, transitional class known as the [[Petite Bourgeoisie|petite bourgeoisie]] own sufficient means of production but do not purchase labor power.  Marx's [[Communist Manifesto]] fails to properly define the petite bourgeoisie beyond “smaller capitalists” (Marx and Engels, 1848, 25).

iv. The “dangerous class”, or [[Lumpenproletariat]], “the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society.”

==The nature of class relations: conflict==
"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles… Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.” – Communist Manifesto

Marx established conflict as the key driving force of history and the main determinant of social trajectories (Kingston).  However, in order to understand the nature of “[[class conflict]],” we must first understand that such conflict arises from a unified class interest, also known as class consciousness.  [[Class consciousness]] is an aspect of Marxist theory, referring to the self-awareness of social classes, the capacity to act in its own rational interests, or measuring the extent to which an individual is conscious of the historical tasks their class (or class allegiance) sets for them.

Moreover, by definition, the objective interests of classes are fundamentally in opposition; consequently, these opposing interests and consciousnesses eventually lead to class conflict.

Marx first saw the development of class conflict confined to individual factories and capitalists.  However, given the maturation of capitalism, the life conditions of bourgeoisie and proletariat began to grow more disparate.  This increased polarization and homogenization within classes fostered an environment for individual struggles to become more generalized.  When increasing class conflict is manifested at the societal level, class consciousness and common interests are also increased.  Consequently, when class consciousness is augmented, policies are organized to ensure the duration of such interest for the ruling class.  Here begins the use of the struggle for political power and classes become political forces.

Since the distribution of political power is determined by power over production, or power over capital, it is no surprise that the bourgeois class uses their wealth to legitimatize and protect their property and consequent social relations.  Thus the ruling class is those who hold the economic power and make the decisions ([[Dahrendorf]]).

== Class structure of capitalism ==
In [[Marxist theory]], the [[capitalist]] stage of production consists of two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the means of production, and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or 'working class') who must sell their own labour power (See also: [[wage labour]]). This is the [[relations of production|fundamental economic structure of work and property]] (See also: [[wage labour]]), a state of inequality that is normalised and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]]. Thus the proletariat, in itself, is forced into a subservient position by the power of capital, which has stripped the means of production from them. As the proletariat becomes conscious of its situation and power, organizes itself, and takes collective political action it becomes a class for itself which has the revolutionary potential to become the ruling class.&lt;ref name=CJPSEA/&gt;

[[Max Weber]] critiqued [[historical materialism]], positing that stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities but on other status and power differentials. Social class pertaining broadly to material wealth may be distinguished from status class based on honour, prestige, religious affiliation, and so on. The conditions of capitalism and its class system came together due to a variety of "elective affinities". {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Marxism|Marxists]] explain the history of "civilized" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and [[working class|wage-workers]] (the [[proletariat]]). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods—in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the [[bourgeoisie]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: "..the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." ([[Communist Manifesto]]) This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

For Marx, class has three primary facets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanagan, Michael P.|chapter=Class|editor=Stearns, Peter N.|title=Encyclopedia of social history|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8153-0342-8|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Objective factors: A class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]].  That is, all people in one class make their living in a common way in terms of ownership of the things that produce social goods.  A class may own things, own land, own people, be owned, own nothing but their labor.  A class will extract tax, produce agriculture, enslave and work others, be enslaved and work, or work for a wage.
;Subjective factors: The members will necessarily have some perception of their similarity and common interest. Marx termed this [[Class consciousness]].  Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest (for instance, the maximisation of shareholder value; or, the maximization of the wage with the minimization of the working day), class consciousness also embodies deeply shared views of how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically.
;Reproduction of class relations: Class as a set of social relationships that is reproduced from one generation to the next.

The first criterion divides a society into the owners and non-owners of means of production. In capitalism, these are capitalist (bourgeoisie) and [[proletariat]]. Finer divisions can be made, however: the most important subgroup in capitalism being [[petite bourgeoisie]] (small bourgeoisie), people who possess their own means of production but utilize it primarily by working on it themselves rather than hiring others to work on it. They include self-employed [[artisan]]s, small shopkeepers, and many [[professional]]s. Jon Elster has found mention in Marx of 15 classes from various historical periods.&lt;ref&gt;''The classes are: "bureaucrats and theocrats in the Asiatic mode of production; freemen, slaves, plebeians, and patricians under slavery; lord, serf, guild master and journeyman under feudalism; industrial capitalists, financial capitalists, landlords, peasantry, petty bourgeoisie, and wage laborers under capitalism."'' Jon Elster, ''An Introduction to Karl Marx'', (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] has defined classes as "large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organization of labor, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/jun/19.htm ''A Great Beginning'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proletarianisation ==
The most important transformation of society for Marxists has been the massive and rapid growth of the proletariat over the last two hundred and fifty years. Starting with agricultural and domestic textile laborers in England and Flanders, more and more occupations only provide a living through wages or salaries. Private manufacturing, leading to self-employment, is no longer as viable as it was before the industrial revolution, because automation made manufacturing very cheap. Many people who once controlled their own labor-time were converted into proletarians through industrialization. Today groups which in the past subsisted on stipends or private wealth—like doctors, academics or lawyers—are now increasingly working as wage laborers.  Marxists call this process [[proletarianization]], and point to it as the major factor in the proletariat being the largest class in current societies in the rich countries of the "first world."&lt;ref&gt;this is the main thesis of Marx's "Capital"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inevitability of socialist revolution==
Marx assumes the inevitability of the revolution of capitalist society into socialist society because of eventual discontent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  The socialization of labor, in the growth of large-scale production, capitalist interest groups and organizations, as well as in the enormous increase in the dimensions and power of finance capital provides the principal material foundation for the unavoidable arrival of socialism. The physical, intellectual and moral perpetrator of this transformation is the proletariat.  The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie inevitably becomes a political struggle with the goal of political conquest by the proletariat. With the domination of the proletariat, the socialization of production cannot help but lead to the means of production to become the property of society.  The direct consequences of this transformation are a drop in labor productivity, a shorter working day, and the replacement of small-scale unified production by collective and improved labor conditions.  
Capitalism breaks for all time the ties between producer and owner, once held by the bond of class conflict.  Now a new union will be formed based on the conscious application of science and the concentration of collective labor.

He also extended this redistribution to the structure of power in families.  Marx imagined that with [[socialism]] women’s status would increase, leading to the break-up of the patriarchal family...

"Modern industry, by assigning as it does, an important part in the socially organized process of production, outside the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes… Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of human development; although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the laborer, that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery." (Capital, Vol. I, Chapter 13).

==Objective and subjective factors in class in Marxism==
Marxism has a rather heavily defined dialectic between  [[objective factors]] (i.e., material conditions, the social structure) and [[subjective factors]] (i.e. the conscious organization of class members). While most forms of Marxism analyses people's class based on objective factors (class structure), major Marxist trends have made greater use of subjective factors in understanding the history of the working class. [[E.P. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is a definitive example of this "subjective" Marxist trend. Thompson analyses the English working class as a group of people with shared material conditions coming to a positive self-consciousness of their social position. This feature of social class is commonly termed [[class consciousness]] in Marxism, a concept which became famous with [[Georg Lukács]]' ''History and Class Consciousness'' (1923). It is seen as the process of a "class in itself" moving in the direction of a "class for itself", a collective agent that changes history rather than simply being a victim of the historical process. In Lukács' words, the proletariat was the "[[subject (philosophy)|subject]]&amp;ndash;[[object (philosophy)|object]] of history", and the first class which could separate [[false consciousness]] (inherent to the [[bourgeois]]'s consciousness), which [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]] [[law (principle)|economic laws]] as [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] (whereas they are only a consequence of historic capitalism).&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class''; Georg Lukács (1923) ''History and Class Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2012}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2012}}

==Transnational capitalist class==
Globalization theorists, such as [[William I. Robinson]], [[Leslie Sklair]], [[Kees Van Der Pijl]], and Jerry Harris, argue that today a [[transnational capitalist class]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf Transnational Capitalist Class] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816014925/http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf |date=2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Meno''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|n|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Μένων|Μένων]]}}, ''Menōn'') is a [[Socratic dialogue]] written by [[Plato]].  It appears to attempt to determine the definition of [[virtue]], or ''[[arete (excellence)|arete]]'', meaning virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work is written in the [[Socratic method|Socratic dialectical style]] and [[Meno (general)|Meno]] is reduced to confusion or [[aporia]]. In response to Meno's paradox (or the learner's paradox), however, Socrates introduces positive ideas: the immortality of the soul, the theory of knowledge as recollection (''[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]''), which Socrates demonstrates by posing a mathematical puzzle to [[Meno's slave|one of Meno's slaves]], the method of hypothesis, and, in the final lines, the distinction between knowledge and true belief.

==Characters==
Plato's ''Meno'' is a Socratic dialogue in which the two main speakers, [[Socrates]] and [[Meno (general)|Meno]] (also transliterated as Menon), discuss human virtue: whether or not it can be taught, and what it is.  Additional participants in the dialogue include [[Meno's slave|one of Meno's slaves]] and the Athenian politician [[Anytus]], a [[Trial of Socrates|prosecutor of Socrates]] with whom Meno is friendly.

Meno is visiting Athens from [[Thessaly]] with a large entourage of slaves attending him. Young, good-looking and well-born, Meno is a student of [[Gorgias]], a prominent [[sophist]] whose views on virtue clearly influence Meno's. He claims early in the dialogue that he has held forth many times on the subject of virtue, and in front of large audiences.

One feature of the dialogue is Socrates' use of one of Meno's [[Slavery in antiquity|slaves]] to demonstrate his idea of ''[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', that certain knowledge is innate and "recollected" by the soul through proper inquiry.

==Dialogue==
===Introduction of virtue===
The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates to tell him if virtue can be taught.  Socrates says that he does not know what virtue is, and neither does anyone else he knows.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 71b&lt;/ref&gt; Meno responds that, according to Gorgias, virtue is different for different people, that what is virtuous for a man is to conduct himself in the city so that he helps his friends, injures his enemies, and takes care all the while that he personally comes to no harm.  Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men—free or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 71e&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings.

Socrates rejects the idea that human virtue depends on a person's sex or age. He leads Meno towards the idea that virtues are common to all people, that temperance (''sophrosunê''- exercising self-control) and justice (''dikê, dikaiosunê''- refraining from harming other people) are virtues even in children and old men.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 73b&lt;/ref&gt; Meno proposes to Socrates that the "capacity to govern men" may be a virtue common to all people. Socrates points out to the slaveholder that "governing well" cannot be a virtue of a slave, because then he would not be a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 73c–d&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the errors that Socrates points out is that Meno lists many particular virtues without defining a common feature inherent to virtues which makes them thus. Socrates remarks that Meno makes many out of one, like somebody who breaks a plate.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 77a&lt;/ref&gt;

Meno proposes that virtue is the desire for good things and the power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not recognize evil.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 77d–e&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the fact that so many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 78b&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.

No satisfactory definition of virtue emerges in the ''Meno''. Socrates' comments, however, show that he considers a successful definition to be unitary, rather than a list of varieties of virtue, that it must contain all and only those terms which are genuine instances of virtue, and must not be circular.&lt;ref name=jmd&gt;Jane Mary Day. ''Plato's Meno in Focus''. Routledge, 1994, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-415-00297-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meno's paradox&lt;!--'Meno's paradox' redirects here--&gt;===
Meno asks Socrates: "And how will you inquire into a thing when you are wholly ignorant of what it is? Even if you happen to bump right into it, how will you know it is the thing you didn't know?"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 80d1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the canonical statement of the paradox: "[A] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know[.] He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, there is no need to search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 80e, Grube translation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue with Meno's slave===
[[File:Meno (Socrates) drawing 29.gif|thumb|The blue square is twice the area of the original yellow square]]
Socrates responds to this [[sophism|sophistical]] paradox with a ''mythos'' (poetic story) according to which souls are immortal and have learned everything prior to transmigrating into the human body.  Since the soul has had contact with real things prior to birth, we have only to 'recollect' them when alive.  Such recollection requires Socratic questioning, which according to Socrates is not teaching.  Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by interrogating a slave who is ignorant of geometry.

Socrates begins one of the most influential dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for [[Innatism|inborn knowledge]]. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must be in order to double the area of a square with two-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (four feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be three feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss.

Socrates claims that before he got hold of him the slave (who has been picked at random from Meno's entourage) might have thought he could speak "well and fluently" on the subject of a square double the size of a given square.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 84c&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates comments that this "numbing" he caused in the slave has done him no harm and has even benefited him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 84b&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates then draws a second square figure using the diagonal of the original square. Each diagonal cuts each two foot square in half, yielding an area of two square feet. The square composed of four of the eight interior triangular areas is eight square feet, double that of the original area. He gets the slave to agree that this is twice the size of the original square and says that he has "spontaneously recovered" knowledge he knew from a past life&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 85d&lt;/ref&gt; without having been taught. Socrates is satisfied that new beliefs were "newly aroused" in the slave.

After witnessing the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates that he thinks that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates replies, “I think I am. I shouldn’t like to take my oath on the whole story, but one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can, in word and act—that is, that we shall be better, braver, and more active men if we believe it right to look for what we don’t know...”&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 86b&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Anytus===
Meno now beseeches Socrates to return to the original question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, whether or not it is acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. They turn to the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none.

Coincidentally [[Anytus]] appears, whom Socrates praises as the son of [[Anthemion]], who earned his fortune with intelligence and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as [[Themistocles]], [[Aristides]], [[Pericles]] and [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]], and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of [[slander]], warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his [[Trial of Socrates|trial]].) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.

===True belief and knowledge===
After the discussion with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno for his own thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests that they have made a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between "true belief" and "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to "stay in their place" and must be "tethered" by what he calls ''aitias logismos'' (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is ''anamnesis'', or recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, ''Studies in Greek Philosophy: Socrates, Plato, and their tradition, Volume 2'', Princeton University Press, 1996, p 155. {{ISBN|0-691-01938-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not Plato intends that the tethering of true beliefs with reasoned explanations must ''always'' involve ''anamnesis'' is explored in later interpretations of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Inquiry in the ''Meno''", in Richard Kraut, ''The Cambridge Companion to Plato'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, p 221. {{ISBN|0-521-43610-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kahn, "Plato on Recollection", in Hugh H. Benson, ''A Companion to Plato, Volume 37'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2006, p 122. {{ISBN|1-4051-1521-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates' distinction between "true belief" and "knowledge" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]". [[Myles Burnyeat]] and others, however, have argued that the phrase ''aitias logismos'' refers to a practical working out of a solution, rather than a justification.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Knowledge and True Belief in the ''Meno''", in [[David Sedley]], ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy: Volume XXVII: Winter 2004'', Oxford University Press, 2004, pp 61–62. {{ISBN|0-19-927712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates concludes that, in the virtuous people of the present and the past, at least, virtue has been the result of divine inspiration, akin to the inspiration of the poets, whereas a knowledge of it will require answering the basic question, 'What is virtue?'.  In most modern readings these closing remarks are "evidently ironic",&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Waterfield]] in Plato, ''Oxford World Classics: ''Meno'' and Other Dialogues'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pxliv. {{ISBN|0-19-280425-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Socrates' invocation of the gods may be sincere, albeit "highly tentative".&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Scott, ''Plato's'' Meno, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p 193. {{ISBN|0-521-64033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meno and Protagoras==
''Meno'''s theme is also dealt with in the dialogue ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', where Plato ultimately has Socrates arrive at  the opposite conclusion, that virtue ''can'' be taught. And, whereas in ''Protagoras'' knowledge is uncompromisingly this-worldly, in  ''Meno'' the theory of recollection points to a link between knowledge and eternal truths.&lt;ref name=jmd /&gt;

A '''mudra''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-mudra-2.ogg|m|u|ˈ|d|r|ɑː}}; [[Sanskrit]] "seal", "mark", or "gesture"; {{bo|t=ཕྱག་རྒྱ་|s=chakgya}}) is a symbolic or ritual gesture in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. (2010). [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/396017/mudra "mudra (symbolic gestures)"]. Retrieved October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While some mudras involve the entire body, most are performed with the hands and fingers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/m.html Word ''mudrā'' on Monier-William Sanskrit-English on-line dictionary: "N. of partic. positions or intertwinings of the fingers (24 in number, commonly practised in religious worship, and supposed to possess an occult meaning and magical efficacy ''Daś'' (''Daśakumāra-carita''). ''Sarvad''. ''Kāraṇḍ''. RTL. 204 ; 406)"]&lt;/ref&gt; A mudrā is a spiritual gesture and an energetic seal of authenticity employed in the [[iconography]] and [[spiritual practice]] of [[Indian religions]].

In [[hatha yoga]], mudras are used in conjunction with [[pranayama]] (yogic breathing exercises), generally while in a seated posture, to stimulate different parts of the body involved with breathing and to affect the flow of [[prana]], [[shukra|bindu]] (male psycho-sexual energy), boddhicitta, [[amrita]] or consciousness in the body. Unlike older tantric mudras, hatha yogic mudras are generally internal actions, involving the pelvic floor, diaphragm, throat, eyes, tongue, anus, genitals, abdomen, and other parts of the body. Examples are [[Mula Bandha]], [[Mahamudra (Hatha Yoga)]], [[Viparita Karani]], [[Khecarī mudrā]], and [[shambavi]]. These expanded in number from 3 in the Amritasiddhi, to 25 in the [[Gheranda Samhita]], with a classical set of ten arising in the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]].

==Nomenclature==
The Chinese translation is ''yin'' ({{zh|c=印|p=yìn}}) or ''yinxiang'' ({{zh|c=印相|p=yìnxiàng}}). Both these Chinese words also appear as loanwords in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (as ''in'' and ''inzō'' or ''insō'', respectively) and [[Korean language|Korean]] (as ''in'' and ''insang'', respectively). Two other Chinese-based compounds, 印契 (read as ''ingei'' or ''inkei'' in Japanese and as ''ingye'' in Korean) and 密印 (read as ''mitsuin'' or ''mitchin'' in Japanese and as ''mirin'' in Korean), are also used. In Japanese, the former compound may also be used with the order of the characters reversed (''i.e.'' 契印 ''keiin'').

==Iconography==
Mudra is used in the [[iconography]] of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist art]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and described in the scriptures, such as [[Natya Shastra|Nātyaśāstra]], which lists 24 ''{{IAST|asaṁyuta}}'' ("separated", meaning "one-hand") and 13 ''{{IAST|saṁyuta}}'' ("joined", meaning "two-hand") mudras. Mudra positions are usually formed by both the hand and the fingers. Along with ''[[asana|āsanas]]'' ("seated postures"), they are employed statically in the [[meditation]] and dynamically in the {{IAST|Nāṭya}} practice of Hinduism.

Hindu and Buddhist iconography share some mudras. In some regions, for example [[Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand|in Laos and Thailand]], these are distinct but share related iconographic conventions.

According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgotn Kongtrul]] in his commentary on the ''[[Hevajra|Hevajra Tantra]]'', the ornaments of [[wrathful deities]] and witches made of human bones (Skt: {{IAST|aṣṭhimudrā}}; {{bo|w=rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya}}) are also known as mudra "seals".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jamgon Kongtrul|Kongtrul, Jamgön]] (author); (English translators: Guarisco, Elio; McLeod, Ingrid) (2005).

==Indian classical dance==
{{See also|List of mudras (dance)}}
In [[Indian classical dance]], the term "Hasta Mudra" is used. The ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' describes 24 mudras, while the ''Abhinaya Darpana'' of [[Nandikeshvara]] gives 28.&lt;ref&gt;Devi, Ragini. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC Dance dialects of India]''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990. {{ISBN|81-208-0674-3}}. Pp. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In all their forms of Indian classical dance, the mudras are similar, though the names and uses vary. There are 28 (or 32) root mudras in [[Bharatanatyam]], 24 in [[Kathakali]] and 20 in [[Odissi]]. These root mudras are combined in different ways, like one hand, two hands, arm movements, body and facial expressions. In [[Kathakali]], which has the greatest number of combinations, the vocabulary adds up to c. 900. Sanyukta mudras use both hands and asanyukta mudras use one hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barba|1991|pp=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic mudras==
{{See also|List of mudras (yoga)}}
The classical sources for the mudras in yoga are the ''[[Gheranda Samhita]]'' and the ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]''.&lt;ref name=APMB1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Satyananda|title=Asana Pranayama Mudrā Bandha|year=1997|publisher=Bihar Yoga Bharti|location=Munger, Bihar India|isbn=81-86336-04-4|page=422|url=https://www.amazon.com/Asana-Pranayama-Bandha-Fourth-Revised/dp/8186336141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hatha Yoga Pradipika states the importance of mudras in yoga practice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Therefore the goddess sleeping at the entrance of Brahma's door should be constantly aroused with all effort, by performing mudra thoroughly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 20th and 21st centuries, the yoga teacher [[Satyananda Saraswati]], founder of the [[Bihar School of Yoga]], continued to emphasize the importance of mudras in his instructional text ''Asana, Pranayama, Mudrā, Bandha''.&lt;ref name=APMB1997/&gt;

=== Basic mudra: Chin Mudrā ===
[[File:JagadguruRamabhadracharya010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rambhadracharya|Rāmabhadrācārya]] meditating on the banks of the [[Mandakini River]] with fingers folded in the chin mudrā.|200px]]
The thumb and forefinger on each of the hands are joined, forming a zero. The rest of the fingers are extended. The hands are placed palms-up on the thighs or knees while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|vajrasana]] for meditation, or palm-down for pranayama. This mudrā supposedly activates the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], making for deep "stomach-breathing" as the diaphragm pushes out the internal organs when it descends towards the pelvis on inhalation{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Slow breathing in a 5-2-4-2 mentally counted rhythm (counting to 5 during the exhalation, to 2 while holding the breath, and to 4 on the inhalation) causes [[prana]] flow in the pelvis and in the legs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Basic mudra: Chinmaya Mudrā ===
The thumb and forefinger are the same as in Chin Mudrā. The rest of the fingers are folded into a fist. The non-folded part of the forefinger and the middle finger should still be touching. As in Chin Mudrā, the hands are placed palms-up on the thighs while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]] for meditation, or palm-down for pranayama. This mudra supposedly activates the ribs, making them expand sideways on inhalation. Slow breathing in a 5-2-4-2 counted rhythm (counting to 5 during the exhalation, to 2 while holding the breath, and to 4 on the inhalation) causes [[prana]] flow in the torso and in the throat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Basic mudra: Adi Mudrā ===
The thumb is folded into the palm, touching the base of the small finger. The rest of the fingers are folded over the thumb, to create a fist. The hands are placed palms down on the thighs while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]]. This mudra supposedly activates the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, making the chest expand forward on inhalation. Slow breathing in a 5-2-4-2 counted rhythm (counting to 5 during the exhalation, to 2 while holding the breath, and to 4 on the inhalation) makes [[prana]] flow in the throat and in the head.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Basic compact mudra: Brahma Mudrā ===
The hands are as in Adi Mudrā, but the palms face upwards and are located at the level of the navel, with the left and right knuckles and first finger joints touching. This is done while sitting in [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]]. Breathing becomes full: in inhalation, the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] descends, the ribs then expand, and then the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles move forward. Exhalation works in the same order, which creates a "wave" or ripple effect{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

=== Advanced compact mudra: Prana Mudrā ===
A complicated mudra combining hand gestures, synchronized movement from gesture to gesture within the breath cycle, and meditation. The mudrā is practiced sitting in [[Siddhasana]]. Even a single breath cycle of this mudra can significantly stimulate the body{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. It is described in the book, ''Theories of the Chakras'', by [[Hiroshi Motoyama]].

==Common Buddhist mudrās==

=== Abhaya Mudrā ===
[[File:「연가 칠년」이 새겨진 금동불입상 02.jpg|right|thumb|[[Korea]]'s National Treasure 119. The right hand shows abhaya mudra while the left is in the varada mudra.]]
The ''[[Abhayamudra]]'' "gesture of fearlessness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear. In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] it is usually made while standing with the right arm bent and raised to shoulder height, the palm facing forward, the fingers closed, pointing upright and the left hand resting by the side. In Thailand and Laos, this mudra is associated with the walking Buddha, often shown having both hands making a double abhaya mudra that is uniform.

This mudra was probably used before the onset of Buddhism as a symbol of good intentions proposing friendship when approaching strangers. In [[Gandhara]]n art, it is seen when showing the action of preaching. It was also used in China during the [[Northern Wei|Wei]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] eras of the 4th and 7th centuries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

This gesture was used by the Buddha when attacked by an elephant, subduing it as shown in several [[fresco]]es and scripts.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the northern schools' deities often paired it with another mudra using the other hand.

===Bhūmisparśa Mudrā===
[[File:Buddha sitting-MGR Lyon-IMG 9878.jpg|thumb|left|Buddha sitting in bhūmisparśa mudrā. Birmany. White marble with traces of polychromy. [[Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon-Fourvière]]]]
The ''bhūmisparśa'' or "earth witness" mudra of [[Gautama Buddha]] is one of the most common iconic images of Buddhism. It depicts the Buddha sitting in meditation with his left hand, palm upright, in his lap, and his right hand touching the earth. It represents the Buddha asking [[Prithvi|Pṛthivi]], the [[devi]] of the earth, that she witness his enlightenment when he was threatened by demon king Mara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Miranda Eberle|title=Buddhist Goddesses of India|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|pages=17–27|isbn=978-0-691-12758-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvDKOK1h3zMC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodhyangi Mudrā===
[[File:철원_도피안사_철조비로자나불좌상.jpg|thumb|right|Bodhyangi Mudrā]]
The ''Bodhyangi mudrā'', the "mudrā of the six elements," or the "fist of wisdom,"&lt;ref name="LLD.Charles2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.W.

It is commonly seen on statues of the [[Vairocana]] Buddha.

===Dharmachakra Mudrā===

The [[dharmachakra]] or "turning of the wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhas-online.com/mudras.html explanation of Buddhist Mudras]&lt;/ref&gt; mudrā represents that moment. In general, only Gautama Buddha is shown making this mudrā except [[Maitreya]] as the dispenser of the Law. Dharmachakra mudrā is two hands close together in front of the chest in [[vitarka]] with the right palm forward and the left palm upward, sometimes facing the chest.
There are several variants such as in the [[Ajanta Caves]] frescoes, where the two hands are separated and the fingers do not touch. In the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek style]] of [[Gandhara]], the clenched fist of the right hand seemingly overlies the fingers joined to the thumb on the left hand. In pictorials of [[Hōryū-ji]] in Japan the right hand is superimposed on the left. Certain figures of [[Amitābha]], Japan are seen using this mudra before the 9th century.

===Dhyāna Mudrā===
[[File:Amitabha_of_Phat_Tich_pagoda_(reproduction),_Bac_Ninh_province,_1057_AD_DSC04844.JPG|thumb|right|Reproduction of the [[Amitābha]] statue of [[Phật Tích Temple]], [[Hanoi]], demonstrating the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] mudrā]]
[[File:KamakuraDaibutsu3969.jpg|thumb|right|Hands of [[Amitābha]] statue at [[Kōtoku-in]], [[Kamakura]], demonstrating ''mida no jōin'', a variation of the [[Mudra#Dhyāna_Mudrā|Dhyāna Mudrā]]]]

The ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] mudrā'' ("meditation mudra") is the gesture of meditation, of the concentration of the Good Law and the [[sangha]]. The two hands are placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched (four fingers resting on each other and the thumbs facing upwards towards one another diagonally), palms facing upwards; in this manner, the hands and fingers form the shape of a triangle, which is symbolic of the spiritual fire or the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Three Jewels]].
This mudra is used in representations of [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Amitābha]]. Sometimes the dhyāna mudrā is used in certain representations of {{IAST|Bhaiṣajyaguru}} as the "Medicine Buddha", with a medicine bowl placed on the hands. It originated in India most likely in [[Gandhāra]] and in China during the [[Northern Wei]].

It is heavily used in Southeast Asia in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]; however, the thumbs are placed against the palms. Dhyāna mudrā is also known as "[[samadhi|samādhi]] mudrā" or "yoga mudrā", {{cjkv|p=[Chán]dìng yìn|r=jōin, jōkai jōin|c=禅定印}}.

The ''mida no jōin'' (弥陀定印) is the Japanese name of a variation of the dhyāna mudra, where the index fingers are brought together with the thumbs. This was predominately used in Japan in an effort to distinguish Amitābha (hence "mida" from Amida) from the Vairocana Buddha,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]]''. [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/midanojouin.htm "JAANUS / mida-no-jouin  弥陀定印"]. Retrieved 2 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and was rarely used elsewhere.

=== Varada Mudrā ===
The ''[[Varadamudra|Varadamudrā]]'' "generosity gesture" signifies offering, welcome, charity, giving, compassion and sincerity. It is nearly always shown made with the left hand by a revered figure devoted to human salvation from greed, anger and delusion. It can be made with the arm crooked and the palm offered slightly turned up or in the case of the arm facing down the palm presented with the fingers upright or slightly bent. The Varada mudrā is rarely seen without another mudra used by the right hand, typically abhaya mudrā. It is often confused with vitarka mudrā, which it closely resembles. In China and Japan during the [[Northern Wei]] and [[Asuka period]]s, respectively, the fingers are stiff and then gradually begin to loosen as it developed over time, eventually leading to the [[Tang dynasty]] standard where the fingers are naturally curved.

In [[India]], varada mudra is used in images of [[Avalokiteśvara]] from the [[Gupta Empire]] (4th and 5th centuries). Varada mudrā is extensively used in the statues of [[Southeast Asia]].

===Vajra Mudrā===
[[File:VajraMudra.JPG|thumb|left|Vajra Mudrā]]

The ''[[Vajra]] mudrā'' "thunder gesture" is the gesture of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=written|last2=Beer|first2=illustrated by Robert|title=The handbook of tibetan buddhist symbols|date=2003|publisher=Serindia|location=Chicago (Ill.)|isbn=978-1932476033|page=228|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the application of the Vajra mudrā is the seventh technique (out of nine) of the ''[[Kuji-in|Nine Syllable Seals]]''.

===Vitarka Mudrā===
[[File:VitarkaMudra.JPG|thumb|right|Vitarka mudrā, [[Tarim Basin]], 9th century]]

The ''Vitarka mudrā'' "mudra of discussion" is the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching. It is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, and keeping the other fingers straight very much like the abhaya and varada mudrās but with the thumbs touching the index fingers. This mudra has a great number of variants in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it is the mystic gesture of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]]s and [[bodhisattva]]s with some differences by the deities in [[Yab-Yum]]. Vitarka mudrā is also known as ''Vyākhyāna mudrā'' ("mudra of explanation").

===Gyana Mudrā===
The ''gyāna mudrā'' ("mudra of wisdom") is done by touching the tips of the thumb and the index together, forming a circle, and the hand is held with the palm inward toward the heart.&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''{{IAST|jñānamudrā}}'' as "gesture of knowledge" see: {{Harvnb|Stutley|2003|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karana Mudrā===
[[File:Pressapochista14.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseon]] figure on the left makes the karana mudrā.]]
The ''karana mudrā'' is the mudra which expels demons and removes obstacles such as sickness or negative thoughts. It is made by raising the index and the little finger, and folding the other fingers. It is nearly the same as the Western "[[sign of the horns]]", the difference is that in the Karana mudra the thumb does not hold down the middle and ring finger. This mudra is also known as ''tarjanī mudrā''; Japanese: ''Funnu-in'', ''[[Acala|Fudō]]-in''.

==Martial arts and mudra==
Various [[List of martial arts#Asia|Asian martial arts]] forms contain positions identical to these mudras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2000|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muromoto (2003) in discussing his experience of mudra in relation to his martial arts training makes reference to [[Mikkyō]], [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]]:
{{quote|One of the more curious things that I encountered in my martial arts training was the use of mudra in combative arts. Mudra (Japanese: in), for those who aren't familiar with them, are these weird hand gestures that are derived from esoteric Buddhism (mikkyo), particularly the Tendai and Shingon sects. These gestures are supposed to generate spiritual focus and power which then are manifested in some way externally.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"&gt;Muromoto, Wayne (2003) ''[http://www.furyu.com/onlinearticles/mudra.html Mudra in the Martial Arts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215031615/http://www.furyu.com/onlinearticles/mudra.html |date=2007-12-15 }}''. . Retrieved December 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Muromoto (2003) states a lineage of mudra in martial arts and evokes [[Koryū]], [[Ryū (school)|Ryū]], [[Kantō region|Kantō]], [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]], [[:fi:Risuke Ōtake|Risuke Ōtake]] and [[Donn F. Draeger]]:
{{quote|In any case, I had known of the use of mudra in koryu ("old" martial arts) since the time I was privy to a discussion with the training master of the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu, Otake Risuke, and the late Donn F. Draeger. Otake sensei described some of the mudra used in his school, which is one of the oldest martial ryu still in existence in Kanto (Eastern) Japan.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}}}
In relation to charting a historical tributary to mudra within Japanese fighting culture, Muromoto (2003) incorporates [[Shinto|Shintō]], [[Samurai]], [[Tokugawa shogunate]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], [[Zen]], the [[Kamakura shogunate]], the [[Edo]] period, [[Takuan Sōhō]] and [[Hakuin Ekaku]]:
{{quote|The use of mudra and other aspects of mikkyo are found in many instances in many koryu, because mikkyo and Shinto were the religions of the samurai who founded those ryu that were created before the 17th century. Subsequent ryu developed after the imposition of the Tokugawa government were heavily influenced by Neo-Confucianism, and then later by Zen Buddhism. Although Zen was popularized among the warrior class in the Kamakura period, the 14th century, it did not greatly affect martial arts until the latter part of the Edo Period, with the writings of the Zen priests Takuan and Hakuin. And even at that, Edo Period (1600-1868) martial arts were equally influenced by Neo-Confucianism and even, in the latter part, mystical Shinto.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}}}
Muromoto (2003) textually maps the execution of the [[knifehand strike]] mudrā:
{{quote|Mikkyo uses mudra most often in combination with various rituals, chants and so on. One common mudra is that of the "knife hand," or shuto. The first two fingers are extended while the thumb and other fingers are clenched. If you look closely, you may see this movement subtly hidden in some koryu kata, especially by old schools such as the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu, or in statues of divine Buddhist beings. This represents the sword of enlightenment, which cuts away all delusions. Sometimes the tips of the extended fingers are grasped in the fist of the other hand. There is a symbolic meaning for this, derived from mikkyo.&lt;ref name="Muromoto, Wayne 2007"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2018}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">The '''Netherlands Media Art Institute''' ('''NIMk''') (''Nederlands Instituut voor Mediakunst'' in Dutch) is an international institution based in Amsterdam focusing on the presentation, research and collection of [[Media Art]].

Previously known as MonteVideo, the institute was founded in 1978 by René Coelho as one of the first Dutch exhibition spaces and production facilities for artists working and experimenting with art and new technologies.

Nowadays NIMk plays a role in exhibiting, disseminating and researching new technologies in media art.  Its catalogue comprises more than 2000 works, ranging from installations, video performances, software-based and internet art, from recognised international artists such as: [[Marina Abramović]], [[Gary Hill]], [[Juan Downey]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Marcel Odenbach]]. Also a large collection of Dutch artists' works and documentation of performances can be viewed in its mediatheque, among them  are Livinus van de Bundt, Bill Spinhoven, Bert Schutter, [[Han Hoogerbrugge]], [[Bas Jan Ader]], Daniel Brun, Guido van der Werve and [[Erwin Olaf]].&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nimk.nl/&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:NIMk-sky.JPG|thumb|In front of Netherlands Institute of Media Art - 2010]]

==Main areas==
===Presentation===
NIMk has 4 exhibitions per year with Dutch and international artists working with video, film, Internet and other technological media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nimk.nl&lt;/ref&gt; This is to promote new and upcoming artists as well as established artists. The presentation of media art also come in the form of symposiums, screenings and live performances of image and sound. Most events are within NIMks own facilities, but also in collaboration with other institutions and venues.

===Research===
NIMk supports artists researching into the use of new media in the visual arts by a programme called The Artist in Residence (AiR). The programme provides a residing artist with a studio, technical support and exhibition equipment to create new work. Some of the former and current artists in residence are : Dave Griffiths, Aymeric Mansoux and Marloes de Valk, Sonia Cillari, [[Knowbotic Research]], Esther Polak, Linda Hilfling, Lilia Perez Romero, Chris Ziegler, Rob Davis &amp; Usman Haque, ''[[Blender (software)|Blender]]'', Linda Wallace, Simon Yuill, Jaromil, Kelli Dipple, Adam Hyde, Marjorieke Glaudemans &amp; Karen Lancel, Stansfield/Hooykaas. 

NIMk also does research in documentation and preservation of media art. One project is the digitisation of video art work in collaboration with the Foundation for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (SBMK) and Virtueel Platform (VP). Between the years 2004 and 2007 NIMk participated in an international research project concerning preservation and documentation of installations called Inside Installations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inside-installations.org&lt;/ref&gt; from 2007 to 2010 it led the European project "Gateways to Archives of Media Art" (GAMA) providing access to a wealth of information about the works of both well-known and emerging artists from European collections of media art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gama-gateway.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection===
[[File:mediateque.JPG|thumb|The Mediatheque, here works can be viewed from the catalogue - 2010]]
NIMk has built up an extensive collection of video and media art for the last 30 years which constitutes one of the largest video art collections in Europe.  The video collection consists of a distribution and a documentation collection, which are both available in the Mediatheque at NIMk. The catalogue is published online, with short excerpts of most of the works. This way the NIMk seeks to promote media art to a wider audience.

The distribution collection comprises more than 2000 works; varying form the earliest experiments through recent productions. These works are lend out for a wide range of purposes, like international and national festivals, exhibitions at various art institutions and for educational use. The distribution department presents video art, media art and installations to professionals  and they organise and facilitate presentations of works from the collection.
NIMk also maintains the collections of the Appel Foundation ([[De Appel]]), the former Lijnbaan Center in Rotterdam and the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN).

==History==
What was going to become NIMk, started out as MonteVideo, founded in 1978 by René Coelho a former camera man.&lt;ref&gt;Boomgaard, J. &amp; Rutten, B.. The Magnetic Era. Video Art in the Netherlands 1970-1985. NAi Publishers, Rotterdam 2003. {{ISBN|90-5662-299-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; René Coelho made an exhibition space in his own home as well as equipment and documentation available for artists.
In 1983 MonteVideo moved to a bigger space in Amsterdam North and was now showing works of international as well as Dutch artists. The first artist to exhibit was Livinus van de Bundt. Later followed by artists such as Bert Schutter, Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Shelly Silver. MonteVideos collection of contemporary art kept growing into a large collection of works, which was rented out. Another organisation for new media art was founded that year,  by Association of Video Artists, called Time Based Arts. For some time MonteVideo and Time Based Arts where competing against each other to get recognition and funding. 
From 1986-1993 Monte Videos government funding was reduced and René Coëlho continued on his own. During this period the exhibition of Dutch media art "Imago" toured worldwide. 
In the meantime the death of Aart van Barneveld, the director of Time Based Arts, was followed by a lot of conflicts in between the associated artists in Time Based Arts, which almost resulted in the collapse of the organisation. But in 1990 Montevideo and Time based Arts decided to collaborate on a joint art program for Amsterdam cable TV called channel zero.
The two organisations ended up merging in 1993 and became what it is today, Netherlands Media Art Institute. 
The merged Institute moved in 1994 to Spuistraat and in 1997 it moved to its current location on Keizersgracht in Amsterdam.

[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A [[coal mining|coal mine]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. [[Coal]], produced over millions of years, is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]]

A '''non-renewable resource''' (also called a '''finite resource''') is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames. An example is carbon-based, organically-derived fuel. The original organic material, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. [[Earth]] [[mineral]]s and [[metal]] [[ore]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]]) and [[groundwater]] in certain [[aquifer]]s are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual [[Chemical element|element]]s are almost always conserved.

On the other hand, resources such as [[timber]] (when [[Sustainable forest management|harvested sustainably]]) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered [[renewable resource]]s, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==
{{Main article|Mineral|Ore}}
{{Further information|Mining}}

[[Earth]] minerals and [[metal]] ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by [[Ore genesis|natural geological processes]] (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through [[plate tectonics]], [[tectonic subsidence]] and [[crustal recycling]].

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain [[rare earth mineral]]s and [[rare earth element|elements]] that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in [[manufacturing]], particularly for the [[electronics industry]].

Most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels, because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the Earth's near-surface environment, than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish, die, and are quickly buried.

== Fossil fuels ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}
{{Further information|Oil depletion}}

Natural resources such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]] take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see [[renewable energy]].

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/methane-hydrates/ |title=Methane hydrates |website=Worldoceanreview.com |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable [[fossil fuels]].  Since the dawn of [[internal combustion engine]] technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand.  As a result, conventional [[infrastructure]] and [[transport]] systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED) an organization set up by but independent from the [[United Nations]] classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume -i.e. [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, before explaining that radioactive waste from used [[spent fuel]] rods remains radioactive, and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[nuclear technology]] relying on [[Nuclear fission|fission]] requires [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] as fuel. [[Uranium]], the most common fission fuel, and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and [[uranium mining|mined]] in 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with [[Fissile|fissionable]] [[uranium-235]] which generates heat that is ultimately used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/uran.html|title=What is uranium? How does it work?|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in [[pilot program]]s and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of ''Marine Science &amp; Engineering'' suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be [[economy of scale|economically competitive if implemented on a large scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/2/1/81 Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology.

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]. [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665 Another drop in nuclear generation] ''World Nuclear News'', 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous [[radioactive contamination]] as it relies upon unstable elements.  In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of [[low and intermediate level waste]] (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of [[high level waste]] (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |title=Factsheets &amp; FAQs |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062648/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is [[Acute radiation syndrome|highly hazardous]] to people and wildlife.   The United Nations ([[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]]) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 [[millisievert]] (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from [[cosmic ray]]s; all exposures [[Background radiation|vary by location]].&lt;ref name = UNSCEAR&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.

[[Natural resource]]s, known as renewable resources, are replaced by [[Natural phenomenon|natural processes and forces]] persistent in the [[natural environment]]. There are [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] and reoccurring renewables, and [[Recycling|recyclable material]]s, which are utilized during a [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]] across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by [[manufacturing]] [[Product (business)|product]]s in [[economic system]]s creates many [[List of waste types|types of waste]] during production and after the [[consumer]] has made use of it. The material is then either [[Incineration|incinerated]], buried in a [[landfill]] or [[recycled]] for reuse.

The natural environment, with [[soil]], [[water]], [[forest]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately [[Conservation biology|monitored, protected and conserved]]. [[Sustainable agriculture]] is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal [[ecosystem]]s over the long term. The [[overfishing]] of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger [[endangered species|species]] and possibly even determine whether or not a [[fishery]] is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing In Small-Scale Marine and Inland Capture Fisharies|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y3274E/y3274e09.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewable energy from the [[sun]], [[wind]], [[surface wave|wave]], [[biomass]] and [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of [[water]] ([[hydropower]], [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]]), [[wind power|wind]] and [[radiant energy]] from geothermal heat (used for [[geothermal power]]) and solar energy (used for [[Solar energy|solar power]]) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over, wind power could power all of humanity's needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but there is enough out there to power humanity's needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eisenberg and D. Nocera, "Preface: Overview of the Forum on Solar and Renewable Energy," Inorg. Chem. 44, 6799 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Kamat, "Meeting the Clean Energy Demand: Nanostructure Architectures for Solar Energy Conversion," J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2834 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] are no longer niche [[Economic sector|sector]]s that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors, both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by [[climate change]] concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, [[2000s energy crisis|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]] and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are [[renewable energy commercialization|commercializing renewable energy]], enlarging the market and growing demand, the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy-base.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEFI-Global-Trends-in-Sustainable-Energy-Investment-2007.pdf |title=Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3. |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as [[Good (economics)|goods]], where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Salehi-Isfahani 1991:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]] in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by [[Hotelling's rule]], which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.
The [[Hartwick's rule]] provides an important result about the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.

{{Family law}}

'''Paternity law''' refers to body of law underlying [[law|legal]] relationship between a [[father]] and his [[biology|biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]] [[child]]ren and deals with the rights and obligations of both the father and the child to each other as well as to others. A child's paternity may be relevant in relation to issues of [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]], [[inheritance]] and rights to a [[putative father]]'s title or surname, as well as the biological father's rights to [[child custody]] in the case of separation or [[divorce]] and obligations for [[child support]].

Under common law, a child born to a [[marriage|married]] woman is presumed under [[common law]] to be the child of her husband by virtue of a "[[presumption of paternity]]" or [[presumption of legitimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Edward P.|title=The Presumption of Legitimacy|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Books/lbb/x650.htm|website=Law and the Physician|publisher=The Law, Science &amp; Public Health Law Site|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration of a possible [[non-paternity event]] (which may or may not include [[paternity fraud]]) these presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, for example, in disputed child custody and child support cases during divorce, [[annulment]] or [[legal separation]].

In the case of a father not married to a child's mother, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction:
* a man may accept the paternity of the child in what is called an '''acknowledgment of paternity''', '''voluntary acknowledgement of paternity''' or '''affidavit of parentage''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affidavit of Parentage|url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/Parentage_10872_7.pdf|website=State of Michigan|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing Paternity Voluntarily|url=http://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/acknowledging-paternity|website=MassLegalHelp|publisher=Massachusetts Legal Services|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the mother or legal authorities can file a petition for a determination of paternity against a putative father, or&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Establishing and Contesting Paternity|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family_law/paternity.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=17 September 2017|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* paternity can be determined by the courts through [[estoppel]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parentage/Paternity|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-parentage.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, when paternity is in dispute or doubt, [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] may be used to conclusively resolve the issue.

==Overview==
{{see also|List of national legal systems}}

The legal process of determining paternity normally results in the naming of a man to a child's birth certificate as the child's legal father. A paternity finding resolves issues of legitimacy, and may be followed by court rulings that relate to child support and maintenance, custody and guardianship.

==Unmarried fathers==
Generally, under common law, a biological father has a legal obligation for the maintenance or [[child support|support]] of his biological offspring, whether or not he is legally competent to marry the child's mother.&lt;ref name=boy&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/06/us/court-tells-youth-to-support-child-he-fathered-at-age-13.html|title=Court Tells Youth to Support Child He Fathered at Age 13|publisher=New York Times (USA)|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In jurisdictions where there is no [[presumption of paternity]] there is a process for fathers to [[Recognition (family law)|recognise]] their children and become the legal father of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rights of Unmarried Fathers |url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/putative.pdf |website=The Child Welfare Information Gateway |accessdate=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Married fathers==
In the United States, where a child is conceived or born during wedlock, the husband is legally presumed to be the father of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Jana|title=Marriage, Biology, and Paternity: The Case for Revitalizing the Marital Presumption|journal=Maryland Law Review|date=2006|volume=65|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mllr65&amp;div=21&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have a legal process for a husband to disavow paternity, such that a biological father can be named as the parent of a child conceived or born during a marriage. In most states, any claim of non-paternity by a husband must be heard by a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Paula|title=Disestablishing the Paternity of Non - Marital Children|url=http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/0111.pdf|website=CLASP|publisher=Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a parents litigate a divorce case without raising the issue of paternity, in most states they will be barred from disputing the husband's paternity in a later court proceeding. Depending upon state law, it may nonetheless be possible for a man claiming to be the child's biological father to commence a paternity case following the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glennon|first1=Theresa|title=Somebody's Child: Evaluating the Erosion of the Marital Presumption of Paternity|journal=West Virginia Law Review|date=1999|volume=102|page=547|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wvb102&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Where paternity of the child is in question, a party may ask the court to determine paternity of one or more possible fathers (called putative fathers), typically based initially upon sworn statements and then upon [[testimony]] or other [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rights of  Unmarried Fathers|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/putative.pdf|website=Child Welfare Information Gateway|publisher=Children's Bureau|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once paternity has been legally established, if the court finds that to do so would be contrary to the best interest of the child, in most U.S. states a court may deny DNA testing or decline to remove a husband from a child's birth certificate based upon DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strasser|first1=Mark|title=Legislative Presumptions and Judicial Assumptions: On Parenting, Adoption, and the Best Interest of the Child|journal=University of Kansas Law Review|date=1996|volume=45|page=49|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ukalr45&amp;div=11&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful application to the court results in an order assigning paternity to a specific man, possibly including support responsibility and/or [[Contact (law)|visitation]] rights, or declaring that one or more men (possibly including the husband of the mother) are not the father of the child. A disavowal action is a legal proceeding where a putative father attempts to prove to the court that he is not the father; if successful, it relieves the former putative father of legal responsibility for the child.&lt;ref name=disavow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/LawSearch.aspx|title=Louisiana Civil Code article 186 et seq.|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it could be the case where several putative fathers are fighting to establish custody. In such case. In the United States, a state may legally bar a third party from disputing the paternity of a child born within an intact marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 US 110, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1989)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18282912377125168373|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paternity laws assign full parental responsibility to fathers even in cases of women lying about contraception, using deceit (such as [[oral sex]] followed by self-[[artificial insemination]]){{cn|date=January 2016}} or statutory rape by a woman ([[Hermesmann v. Seyer]]).&lt;ref name=boy /&gt;

==Paternity and inheritance rights==
If the context of inheritance rights, it will be the heirs of the deceased person who are attempting to dispute or establish paternity.  In some states, DNA testing will be dispositive to establish paternity.  In many jurisdictions, however, there are a variety of rules and time restrictions that can deny inheritance rights to biological children of a deceased father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beugge|first1=Charlotte|title=Rise in wills disputes over illegitimate children|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/10106145/Rise-in-wills-disputes-over-illegitimate-children.html|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mahapatra|first1=Dhananjay|title=How legitimate is an illegitimate child’s right to property|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/How-legitimate-is-an-illegitimate-childs-right-to-property/articleshow/15788019.cms|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Times of India|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Meredith|title=Intestate Succession Rights and Children Born Out of Wedlock|url=https://civil.sog.unc.edu/intestate-succession-rights-and-children-born-out-of-wedlock/|website=UNC School of Government|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">Neglect is defined as giving little attention to or to leave undone or unattended to, especially through carelessness. Mortuary neglect can comprise many things, such as bodies being stolen from the morgue, or bodies being mixed up and the wrong one was buried. When a mortuary fails to preserve a body correctly, it could also be considered neglect because of the consequences.

[[Insect indicators of abuse or neglect|Patient neglect]] is similar to mortuary neglect with one major difference: that patient neglect has to do with people who are still living and that neglect could ultimately lead to their death. Patient neglect concerns people in hospitals, in nursing homes, or being cared for in home. Usually in nursing homes or home-assisted living, neglect would consist of patients being left lying in their own urine and/or feces, which could, in turn, possibly attract flesh flies and lead to maggot infestation. It also encompasses patients getting rashes, [[lice]], and other sores from being improperly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldi, Kyle. "Noncompliance vs. Medical Neglect." ''American Orthopedic Journal'' 2007: 137-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of mortuary neglect and the law ==
The general sign of mortuary neglect (in terms of forensic entomology) is an infestation of maggots or some other insect (such as cockroaches) of a corpse. This should not be confused with insects found on a body before they are transferred to the morgue.  The following examples are forms of mortuary neglect that pertain to the ethical treatment of a corpse.

=== Improper embalming === 
Improper embalming is the utilization of embalming techniques that cause premature decomposition of the body especially in cases where the body in question is to be presented in an open-casket funeral. In addition, not refrigerating the body immediately following death, but before the embalming process could lead to rapid deterioration of the human remains as well.

==== Washington v. John T. Rhines Co. ====
On August 29, 1994, widow Marian Washington filed suit against funeral home, John T. Rhines Co., for improperly embalming her late husband Vernon W. Washington. She claimed that the embalming fluid was leaking and that her husband’s skin was decomposing at an alarming rate. John T. Rhines Co. re-embalmed Mr. Washington in efforts to make his body presentable. However, they failed to restore Mr. Washington’s body completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail37860/Page1.htm "Washington V. John T. Rhines Co."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cooley v. State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers ====
On May 3, 1956, Cooley, a petitioner of a particular funeral home tried to appeal the revoke of his license by the California state board of funeral directors and embalmers. The case reveals the reasons as to why the license was revoked. Cooley’s practices were described as unsanitary for the following reasons: an infant was discovered improperly embalmed after maggots were seeping out of its orifices, commingling of bodies, blood stains were found on the walls, and tools used were not cleaned from one autopsy to the next. Needless to say, the appeal was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;"Cooley V. State Bd. of Funeral Directors and Embalmers." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 293-296. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fencing stolen organs  ===
This form of abuse consists of selling body parts stolen from carcasses that are sent to the morgue for embalming.

=== Commingling of ashes ===
Commingling of ashes is putting several carcasses in the same crematorium during the same burn cycle. This act undermines the respect due a passed loved one.

=== Unauthorized disposal ===
In this form of abuse, funeral home operators dispose of the body in a manner not authorized by the deceased’s loved ones.

==== Christensen v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County ====
On June 28, 1990, a court heard a case on a class action suit against multiple funeral service operators. These acts included all of the types of mortuary neglect mentioned above in this section. The case contended that the defendants violated conscionable standards regarding the treatment of the deceased.  This practice occurred for nearly a decade and victimized approximately 17,000 decedents and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail38312/Page20.htm "Christensen V. Superior Court of Los Angeles County."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical treatment of the deceased ===
Any violation of the standards that any reasonable person would expect of a Mortuary operator could be considered in this category.

====Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home====
James Dennis, widower of Molly Dennis, sued Robbins Funeral Home on August 24, 1987. Before Mrs. Dennis was to be cremated, Lee Miller, the funeral director of Robbins Funeral Home called the family to see the body. When the family arrived, to their dismay, they found Molly Dennis’s body unprofessionally presented in an unhygienic environment as unspecified limbs were hanging off the dissection table and into a dirty sink. Mr. Dennis was not, however, able to successfully sue the funeral home because the judicial history in the area did not include a precedent for funeral home malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;"Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 698-701. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Funeral Directors Association==
The National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) is an organization in the United States that regulates mortuaries and morgues and their activities regarding the [[embalming]] and interring of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php National Funeral Directors Association Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152454/http://nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php |date=2008-05-10 }} National Funeral Directors Association. 13 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  With any complaint including mortuary neglect, the NFDA has a fifteen step disciplinary process it goes through to determine the severity of the situation. After receiving a complaint, a committee reviews the situation even to the extent of an investigation and then they determine the consequences of the violation. Those considered in violation of the NFDA’s policies could face punitive action ranging from a warning to suspension from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/files/2003FaxBackPDFs/Membership/9506_CodeofProfessionalConductEnforcement.pdf NFDA Code of Professional Conduct.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} National Funeral Directors Association.

== Trends ==
There are certain segments of the health care industry that are seeing downward moves in neglect, while other sections are experiencing unfortunate growth.  In modern hospitals the most prevalent form of neglect deals with the patients themselves neglecting their own care.  However, in other segments such as assisted living for mentally deficient patients the rates of abuse and neglect are still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Graham. "Patients at Risk of Neglect in Mental Health Trusts" ''Nursing Standard'' 7 Jan. 2004: 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortuary neglect is another segment that has peculiar trends. There are relatively few morticians that just refuse to perform their duties. However, cases of ethically questionable practices can be easily found. Morticians only preserving visible body parts, incomplete embalming and defrauding families are just a few examples of reported cases of neglect.

Increasingly medical journals are recommending that doctors become more active in attempting to persuade parents and guardians of children to either accept or continue treatment for diseases or injuries in order to avoid a neglect case.  In the American Orthopedic Journal a case study was presented where a doctor suggested that an effort to convince a girl's mother to adequately treat a case of [[ambylopia]] to avoid potential neglect.  While a viewpoint arguing this was unnecessary, it shows a growing trend to go beyond traditional measures to avoid neglect charges.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, Jane N. "Avoiding Charges of Fraud and Abuse: Developing and Implementing an Effective Compliance Program." ''Journal of Nursing Administration'' Dec. 2004: 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From the times of the ancient [[Egyptians]], cases of mortuary neglect have been recorded. The process of [[embalming]] is to preserve the dead for burial, as the Egyptians believed the afterlife was just as important as life itself. However, if a woman was married to an embalmer, he would likely keep her preserved for his own benefit until obvious [[decomposition]] took place.

Dignity for the dead is now a [[legal]] matter, as patient neglect has always been. Abuse in the healthcare system is another huge problem in today’s society. Nursing homes and hospitals are preying grounds for predators of the weak and disabled. In 2001 a nursing home in Ossining, New York was closed because of neglect and unsafe conditions that existed for the patients.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Katherine. "Nursing Home Shuts Down After U.S. Finding of Danger." ''New York Times'' [New York City] 23 August 2001: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US state laws==
For the most part, mortuary standards are created by the states, not by the federal government. The following are links to state policies (where available) on mortuary practices:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">Trade negotiators generally refer to Article 13 of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Agriculture]] as the '''Peace Clause'''. Article 13 holds that domestic support measures and export [[subsidies]] of a WTO Member that are legal under the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture cannot be challenged by other WTO Members on grounds of being illegal under the provisions of another WTO agreement.

The Peace Clause has expired on January 1, 2004. It is now possible, therefore, for [[developing countries]] and nations favoring [[free trade]] in agricultural goods, such as the [[Cairns Group]], to use the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|WTO dispute settlement]] mechanism in order to challenge, in particular, [[United States|U.S.]] and [[European Union|EU]] [[export subsidies]] on agricultural products.

Another temporary peace clause was made at the WTO Bali conference in December 2013. It stipulated that no country would be legally barred from food security programs for its own people even if the subsidy breached the limits specified in the WTO [[Agreement on Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-peace-clause/article22985323.ece] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180430171655/https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-peace-clause/article22985323.ece])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-Paul Grassé''' (November 27, 1895, [[Périgueux]] ([[Dordogne]]) – July 9, 1985) was a French [[zoologist]], author of over 300 publications including the influential 52-volume ''[[Traité de Zoologie]]''. He was an expert on [[termite]]s and one of the last proponents of [[Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]] evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Théodoridès, Jean.  (1986). ''Obituary: Pierre-Paul Grassé (1895-1985)''. ''History of Science Journal''. Volume 39, No. 1, pp. 79-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loison, Laurent. (2011). ''French Roots of French Neo-Lamarckisms, 1879–1985''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. (Dordrecht, the Netherlands: Springer) 44 (4): 713-744.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Education ===
Grassé began his studies in Périgueux where his parents owned a small business. He went on to study [[medicine]] at the [[University of Bordeaux]] and studied [[biology]] in parallel, including the lectures of the entomologist [[Jean de Feytaud]] (1881–1973). Mobilized during [[World War I]], he was forced to interrupt his studies during four years. By the end of the war he was a military surgeon.

Grassé continued his studies in Paris, focusing exclusively on science. He obtained his [[Licence]] in Biology and frequented the laboratory of biologist [[Étienne Rabaud]] (1868–1956). He abandoned his preparations for the [[agrégation]] to accept a position as professor in the École Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de [[Montpellier]] (1921), where the department of zoology was led by [[François Picard (zoologist)|François Picard]] (1879–1939). There he frequented several [[Phytogeography|phytogeographers]] like [[Charles Flahault]] (1852–1935), [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]] (1884–1980), [[Georges Kuhnholtz-Lordat]] (1888–1965) and [[Marie Louis Emberger]] (1897–1969). He became the assistant of [[Octave Duboscq]] (1868–1943) who oriented the young Grassé toward the study of [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s. After the departure of Duboscq to Paris, Grassé worked for [[Eugène Bataillon]] (1864–1953) and there discovered techniques for experimental embryology.

In 1926, Grassé became vice-director of the École supérieure de [[Sericulture|sériciculture]]. He submitted his theses, ''Contribution à l'étude des flagellés parasites'', in 1926, and it was published in the ''Archives de zoologie expérimentale et générale''.

=== Teaching and research ===
In 1929, Grassé became professor of zoology at the Université de [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. He supervised the  theses of several students on [[insect]]s. He conducted his first field research trip in Africa in 1933-1934, and returned there several times (1938–1939, 1945, 1948). During these trips he studied [[termite]]s, and became one of the great specialists on these insects.

In 1935, he became an Assistant Professor at the [[Université de Paris]] where he worked alongside [[Germaine Cousin (entomologist)|Germaine Cousin]] (1896–1992), and received the Prix Gadeau de Kerville de la Société entomologique de France for his work on [[orthoptera]] and termites. In 1939 he chaired the [[Société zoologique de France]] and in 1941 the [[Société entomologique de France]].

After having been briefly mobilized in [[Tours]], in 1944 he succeeded [[Maurice Caullery]] as Chair in Zoology and the Evolution of Beings. Grassé was elected a member of the [[Académie des sciences (France)|Académie des sciences]] on November 29, 1948, in the anatomy and zoology sector and presided over the institution in 1967. In 1976 he changed sectors, into the newly created animal and vegetal biology sector.

Grassé received numerous honours and titles during his career: commander of the [[Légion d'honneur]], doctor ''honoris causa'' of the universities of [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Brussels]], [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[Ghent University|Ghent]], [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[University of São Paulo|São Paulo]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Société Française de Parasitologie]] in 1962. He was also a member of several academic societies, including the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] and [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]].

=== Publications ===
Grassé began publishing a very big project in 1946 entitled ''[[Traite de Zoologie|Traité de zoologie]]''. The 38 volumes required almost forty years of work, uniting some of the greatest names in zoology. They are still essential references in the field for the groups that are treated in their pages. Ten volumes are dedicated to mammals, nine to insects. Apart from this treatise, he led two collections published by [[Masson (publisher)|Masson]]: the first, entitled ''Grands problèmes de la biologie'', has thirteen volumes and the second is entitled ''Précis de sciences biologiques''. Alongside Andrée Tétry, he composed the two volumes dedicated to zoology in the collection ''[[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]'', published by [[Gallimard]]. He also supervised the edition of the ''Abrégé de zoologie'' (two volumes, Masson).

He also composed the ''Termitologia'' (1982, 1983, 1984), a work in three volumes totalling over 2400 pages. In it Grassé compiles all available knowledge concerning termites. It was by studying symbiotic flagellates in termites that he eventually began studying their hosts. In this publication, Grassé introduced the concept of [[Stigmergy]] :
:"Stigmergy manifests itself in the termite mound by the fact that the individual labour of each construction worker stimulates and guides the work of its neighbour.".&lt;ref&gt;Pesson, Paul. (1985). ''Hommage à Pierre-Paul Grassé (1895–1985), Professeur honoraire à l’Université de Paris, Membre de l’Académie des Sciences''. ''Bulletin de la Société entomologique de France'' '''90''' (9-10): 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also created three scientific reviews: ''Arvernia biologica'' (1932), ''Insectes sociaux'' (1953) et ''Biologia gabonica'' (1964). He participated in several reviews like the ''Annales des sciences naturelles'' and the ''Bulletin biologique de la France et de la Belgique''. Apart from his numerous scientific publications, he published several works popularising science such as ''La Vie des animaux'' ([[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 1968). He also signed the articles "Évolution" and "Stigmergie" of the ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]''.

Grassé also authored many works where he talks of his views on [[evolution]] and [[metaphysics]] such as ''Toi, ce petit Dieu'' (Albin Michel, 1971), ''L’Évolution du vivant, matériaux pour une nouvelle théorie transformiste'' (Albin Michel, 1973), ''La Défaite de l’amour ou le triomphe de Freud'' (Albin Michel, 1976), ''Biologie moléculaire, mutagenèse et évolution'' (Masson, 1978), ''L’Homme en accusation: de la biologie à la politique''  (Albin Michel, 1980)...

== Neo-Lamarckism ==

Grassé was a supporter of the French tradition of [[Lamarckism]]. He occupied the Chair of Evolutionary Biology of the Faculty of Paris, of which the two previous occupiers, [[Alfred Giard]] (1846–1908) and [[Maurice Caullery]] (1868–1958), were both also supporters of Lamarckism. Only after Grassé's retirement did the chair become occupied by a partisan of Darwinism, [[Charles Bocquet]] (1918–1977).&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"&gt;Blanc, Marcel. (1990). ''Les Héritiers de Darwin. L’évolution en Mutation''. Seuil (Paris), collection ''Science'' ouverte: pp. 10-11, p. 238. {{ISBN|2-02-012510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of Lamarck's theories he organised an international congress in Paris in 1947 under the auspices of the [[CNRS]] with the theme "paleontology and transformism". The records were published in 1950 by Albin Michel. He united many of the greatest French authorities on the question including [[Lucien Cuénot]] (1866–1951), [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881–1955), and Maurice Caullery.&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"/&gt; They were all opponents to certain tenets of [[neo-Darwinism]]. Other brilliant biologists present were [[John Burdon Sanderson Haldane]] (1892–1964) and [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1902–1984).&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"/&gt; Grassé stated his support for Lamarck in other ways too, like an article in the ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]'', and by affirming that Lamarck had been unjustifiably slandered and ought to be rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, Rémy Lestienne et Roxanne. (2000). ''Chance, Progress and Complexity in Biological Evolution''. SubStance, 29 (1), 91: 39-55. &lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, like Marcel Blanc explain the strong support of [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck|Lamarck]] by French biologists by giving simple patriotic reasons and the historical and social context: Catholic culture favoring support of Lamarckism whilst [[Protestant culture]] favored support of Darwinism, although Grassé was a Protestant.&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"/&gt;

===Evolution of Living Organisms===

Grassé presents his arguments against [[neo-Darwinism]] in his work ''L'évolution du vivant'' (1973), translated into English as ''Evolution of Living Organisms'' in 1977. Against the idea which states that the evolution of living things is the product of their adapting to changes in their environments, he opposes [[living fossil]]s, meaning species which stopped evolving at some point in time and have remained relatively identical to this day regardless of great climatic or geological changes (he cites numerous examples in ''Les formes panchroniques et les arrêts de l'évolution'', p.&amp;nbsp;133). Therefore, evolution is in his opinion a process which is not ''necessary'', it does not occur in living beings under the constraints of external physical forces (cf. ''Necessity-utility is not the primus movens of biological evolution'', p.&amp;nbsp;302). To explain evolution he instead thinks that you must look at the internal dynamics of living things.

Biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] wrote in a review that Grassé's belief that evolution is directed by some unknown mechanism does not explain anything. He concluded that "to reject what is known, and to appeal to some wonderful future discovery which may explain it all, is contrary to sound scientific method. The sentence with which Grassé ends his book is disturbing: "It is possible that in this domain biology, impotent, yields the floor to metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky, Theodosius]]. (1975). ''Darwinian or 'Oriented' Evolution? L'Evolution du Vivant by Pierre P. Grassé''. ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 376-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]] reviewed ''Evolution of Living Organisms'' for the ''[[New Scientist]]'' stating that the book was a criticism of neo-Darwinism, with the opinion that paleontology is "the only true science of evolution". Patterson a paleontologist disputed this statement. He also noted that Grassé's own theory of neo-Lamarckism was "hard to disentangle, and there were other places where Grassé's reasoning was difficult to follow." According to Patterson the book did not mention [[gene duplication]], but this has been well-established in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]]. (1978). ''Evolution of Living organisms''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. 7, September. p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Geologist [[David B. Kitts]] negatively reviewed the book commenting that all of "Grassé's arguments have been marshaled against Darwinian theory before and, in the opinion of most Darwinians, have been adequately countered." Grassé stated that evolution was driven by an internal factor.  Regarding the identification of this factor, Kitts quotes Grassé as saying "perhaps in this area of biology can go no further: the rest is metaphysics". Kitts found this statement unacceptable commenting that "the fundamental issues raised by Grassé's theory of evolution do not even belong to biology, but to some other discipline."&lt;ref&gt;[[David B. Kitts|Kitts, David B]]. (1979). ''Search for the Holy Transformation. Evolution of Living Organisms: Evidence for a New Theory of Transformation by Pierre-P. Grassé''. ''[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]]''. Vol. 5, No. 3. pp. 353-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[attempt]] to commit an unconsummated crime is viewed as having the same gravity as if the crime had occurred. But preparation that falls short of an actual attempt is not, although it may be punishable in some other way.

Courts have not been able to draw a clear bright line as to when acts committed in preparation for a crime are actually an attempt to commit the crime.

Some approaches, summarized in the case of ''[[United States v. Mandujano]]'', include the [[physical proximity doctrine]], the [[dangerous proximity doctrine]], the [[indispensable element test]], the [[probable desistance test]], the [[abnormal step]] approach, and the [[uneqivocality test]].

The [[Model Penal Code]] approach requires a [[substantial step]], in addition to having a criminal [[purpose]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28597">'''Psychological manipulation''' is a type of [[social influence]] that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker/&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. 

[[Social influence]] is not necessarily negative. For example, people such as friends, family and doctors, can try to [[persuade]] to change clearly unhelpful habits and behaviors. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

==Requirements for successful manipulation==
According to psychology author [[George K. Simon]], successful psychological manipulation primarily involves the manipulator:&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People |first=George K|last=Simon |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-935166-30-6}} (reference for the entire section)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Concealing [[aggression|aggressive]] intentions and behaviors and being affable.
# Knowing the psychological [[vulnerabilities]] of the victim to determine which tactics are likely to be the most effective.
# Having a sufficient level of ruthlessness to have no qualms about causing harm to the victim if necessary.

Consequently, the manipulation is likely to be accomplished through covert aggressive ([[relational aggression|relational aggressive]] or [[passive aggressive]]) means.&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;

==How manipulators control their victims==

===According to Braiker===
Harriet B. Braiker (2004) identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-07-144672-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, [[gifts]], attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. "You won't have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you."
*[[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement; schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], [[screaming|yelling]], the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===According to Simon===
Simon identified the following manipulative techniques:&lt;ref name=simon /&gt;&lt;!--All bulleted information in this section is from Simon's book, needing no further citation--&gt;

* [[Lie|Lying]] (by commission) : It is hard to tell if somebody is lying at the time they do it, although often the truth may be apparent later when it is too late. One way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that some personality types (particularly [[psychopaths]]) are experts at the art of lying and [[cheating]], doing it frequently, and often in subtle ways.
* [[Lie#Lying by omission|Lying by omission]]: This is a very subtle form of lying by withholding a significant amount of the truth. This technique is also used in [[propaganda]].
* [[Denial]]: Manipulator refuses to admit that they have done something wrong.
* [[Rationalization (psychology)|Rationalization]]: An excuse made by the manipulator for inappropriate behavior. Rationalization is closely related to [[Spin (public relations)|spin]].
* [[Minimisation (psychology)|Minimization]]: This is a type of denial coupled with rationalization. The manipulator asserts that their behavior is not as harmful or irresponsible as someone else was suggesting, for example, saying that a taunt or insult was only a joke.
* Selective inattention or selective [[attention]]: Manipulator refuses to pay attention to anything that may distract from their agenda, saying things like "I don't want to hear it".
* [[Distraction|Diversion]]: Manipulator not giving a straight answer to a straight question and instead being diversionary, steering the conversation onto another topic.
* [[Evasion (ethics)|Evasion]]: Similar to diversion but giving irrelevant, rambling, vague responses, [[weasel words]].
* Covert [[intimidation]]: Manipulator throwing the victim onto the defensive by using veiled (subtle, indirect or implied) threats.
* [[Guilt trip]]: A special kind of intimidation tactic. A manipulator suggests to the [[conscientious]] victim that they do not care enough, are too selfish or have it easy. This usually results in the victim feeling bad, keeping them in a [[doubt|self-doubting]], [[anxious]] and [[submissive]] position.
* [[Shaming]]: Manipulator uses [[sarcasm]] and put-downs to increase [[fear]] and [[doubt|self-doubt]] in the victim. Manipulators use this tactic to make others feel unworthy and therefore defer to them. Shaming tactics can be very subtle such as a fierce look or glance, unpleasant tone of voice, rhetorical comments, subtle sarcasm. Manipulators can make one feel ashamed for even daring to challenge them. It is an effective way to foster a sense of inadequacy in the victim.
* [[Victim blaming|Vilifying the victim]]: More than any other, this tactic is a powerful means of putting the victim on the defensive while simultaneously masking the aggressive intent of the manipulator, while the manipulator falsely accuses the victim as being an abuser in response when the victim stands up for or defends themselves or their position.
* Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays themself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain [[pity]], [[sympathy]] or evoke [[compassion]] and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation.
* Playing the servant role: Cloaking a self-serving agenda in guise of a service to a more noble cause, for example saying they are acting in a certain way to be "obedient" to or in "service" to an [[authority figure]] or "just doing their job".
* [[Seduction]]: Manipulator uses [[superficial charm|charm]], [[praise]], [[flattery]] or overtly supporting others in order to get them to lower their defenses and give their [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[loyalty]] to the manipulator. They will also offer help with the intent to gain trust and access to an unsuspecting victim they have charmed.
* [[Psychological projection|Projecting]] the [[blame]] (blaming others): Manipulator [[scapegoats]] in often subtle, hard-to-detect ways. Often, the manipulator will project their own thinking onto the victim, making the victim look like they have done something wrong. Manipulators will also claim that the victim is the one who is at fault for believing lies that they were conned into believing, as if the victim forced the manipulator to be deceitful. All blame, except for the part that is used by the manipulator to accept false guilt, is done in order to make the victim feel guilty about making healthy choices, correct thinking and good behaviors. It is frequently used as a means of psychological and emotional manipulation and control. Manipulators lie about lying, only to re-manipulate the original, less believable story into a "more acceptable" truth that the victim will believe. Projecting lies as being the truth is another common method of control and manipulation. Manipulators love to falsely accuse the victim as "deserving to be treated that way." They often claim that the victim is crazy and/or abusive, especially when there is evidence against the manipulator. (See Feigning, below.)
* Feigning [[innocence]]: Manipulator tries to suggest that any harm done was unintentional or that they did not do something that they were accused of. Manipulator may put on a look of surprise or indignation. This tactic makes the victim question their own [[judgment]] and possibly their own sanity.
* Feigning [[confusion]]: Manipulator tries to play dumb by pretending they do not know what the victim is talking about or is confused about an important issue brought to their attention. The manipulator intentionally confuses the victim in order for the victim to doubt their own accuracy of perception, often pointing out key elements that the manipulator intentionally included in case there is room for doubt. Sometimes manipulators will have used cohorts in advance to help back up their story.
* Brandishing [[anger]]: Manipulator uses anger to brandish sufficient emotional intensity and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] to shock the victim into submission. The manipulator is not actually angry, they just put on an act. They just want what they want and get "angry" when denied. Controlled anger is often used as a manipulation tactic to avoid confrontation, avoid telling the truth or to further hide intent. There are often threats used by the manipulator of going to police, or falsely reporting abuses that the manipulator intentionally contrived to scare or intimidate the victim into submission. Blackmail and other threats of exposure are other forms of controlled anger and manipulation, especially when the victim refuses initial requests or suggestions by the manipulator. Anger is also used as a defense so the manipulator can avoid telling truths at inconvenient times or circumstances. Anger is often used as a tool or defense to ward off inquiries or suspicion. The victim becomes more focused on the anger instead of the manipulation tactic.
* Bandwagon effect: Manipulator comforts the victim into submission by claiming (whether true or false) that many people already have done something, and the victim should as well. These include phrases such as "Many people like you&amp;nbsp;..." or "Everyone does this anyways." Such manipulation can be seen in [[peer pressure]] situations, often occurring in scenarios where the manipulator attempts to influence the victim into trying [[drugs]] or other substances.

===Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators===
According to Braiker's self-help book,&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt; manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities (buttons) that may exist in victims:
* the "disease to please"
* addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others
* Emotophobia (fear of negative emotion; ''i.e.'' a fear of expressing anger, frustration or disapproval)
* lack of [[assertiveness]] and ability to say no
* blurry sense of identity (with soft [[personal boundaries]])
* low [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]
* external [[locus of control]]

According to Simon,&lt;ref name=simon /&gt; manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities that may exist in victims:
* naïveté - victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning, devious and ruthless or is "in [[denial]]" if they are being victimized.
* over-[[conscientiousness]] - victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their side of things in which they blame the victim.
* low self-[[confidence]] - victim is [[doubt|self-doubting]], lacking in confidence and [[assertiveness]], likely to go on the defensive too easily.
* over-[[intellectualization]] - victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some understandable reason to be hurtful.
* emotional [[codependent|dependency]] - victim has a [[submissive]] or dependent personality. The more emotionally dependent the victim is, the more vulnerable they are to being exploited and manipulated.

Manipulators generally take the time to scope out the characteristics and vulnerabilities of their victims.

Kantor advises in his book ''The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People''&lt;ref name=Kantor&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People |first=Martin|last=Kantor |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-275-98798-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that vulnerability to [[psychopathic]] manipulators involves being too:
* [[Dependent personality disorder|dependent]] - dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no.
* [[Maturity (psychological)|immature]] - has impaired judgment and so tends to believe exaggerated advertising claims.
* [[naïve]] - cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world, or takes it for granted that if there are any, they will not be allowed to prey on others.
* [[impressionable]] - overly seduced by [[superficial charm|charmers]]. For example, they might vote for the seemingly charming politician who kisses babies.
* [[trusting]] - people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They are more likely to commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials, etc., and less likely to question so-called experts.
* [[Carelessness]] not giving sufficient amount of thought or attention on harm or errors.
* [[Loneliness|lonely]] - lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price.
* [[narcissistic]] - narcissists are prone to falling for unmerited flattery.
* [[Impulsivity|impulsive]] - make snap decisions about, for example, what to buy or whom to marry without consulting others.
* [[altruistic]] - the opposite of psychopathic: too honest, too fair, too empathetic.
* [[frugal]] - cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason it is so cheap.
* [[materialistic]] - easy prey for [[loan sharks]] or [[get-rich-quick]] schemes.
* [[greed]]y - the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way.
* [[Masochistic personality disorder|masochistic]] - lack self-respect and so unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt.
* the [[elderly]] - the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone with a hard-luck story. See [[elder abuse]].

==Motivations of manipulators==
Manipulators can have various possible motivations, including but not limited to:&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt;
* the need to advance their own purposes and personal gain at virtually any cost to others
* a strong need to attain feelings of [[Abusive power and control|power]] and superiority in relationships with others
* a want and need to feel in [[Abusive power and control|control]]
* a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of [[self-esteem]]
* boredom, or growing tired of their surroundings, seeing it as a game more than hurting others
* covert agenda, criminal or otherwise, including financial manipulation (often seen when the elderly or unsuspecting, unprotected wealthy are intentionally targeted for the sole purpose of obtaining a victim's financial assets)

==Psychopathy ==
{{Main article|Psychopathy}}
Being manipulative is in Factor 1 of the [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]] (PCL).&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1529100611426706 |pmid=26167886 |title=Psychopathic Personality: Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Evidence and Public Policy |year=2011 |last1=Skeem |first1=J.

=== In the workplace ===
{{Main article|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The workplace psychopath may often rapidly shift between emotions – used to manipulate people or cause high anxiety.&lt;ref name=Faggioni&gt;Faggioni M &amp; White M Organizational Psychopaths - Who Are They and How to Protect Your Organization from Them (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase three (manipulation) - the psychopath will create a scenario of "[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]" where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate jargon Variously known as corporate speak, corporate lingo, business speak, business jargon, management speak, workplace jargon, or commercialese, is the jargon often used in large corporations, bureaucracies, and similar workplaces.[1][2] The use of corporate jargon, also known as "corporatese", is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.
 
Sophism In modern useage sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly. A sophism is a specious argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments. 

Impression Management (unethical). In business, "managing impressions" normally "involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them". The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical manipulation.

==Antisocial, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders==
According to [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]], [[Antisocial Personality Disorder|antisocial]], [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]], and [[Narcissistic Personality Disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders are all organized at a borderline level of personality organization,&lt;ref name="Kernberg75"&gt;{{cite book | title=Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism | publisher=Jason Aronson | author=Kernberg, O | year=1975 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-87668-205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the three share some common characterological deficits and overlapping personality traits, with deceitfulness and exceptional manipulative abilities being the most common traits among antisocial and narcissism. Borderline is emphasized by unintentional and dysfunctional manipulation, but stigma towards borderlines being deceitful still wrongfully persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma and Prejudice|last=Aguirre|first=Blaise|date=2016|publisher=Humana Press, Cham|isbn=9783319275789|series=Current Clinical Psychiatry|pages=133–143|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-27580-2_8|chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder: From Stigma to Compassionate Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisocials, borderlines, and narcissists are often [[Pathological lying|pathological liars]].&lt;ref name=Kernberg75 /&gt; Other shared traits may include pathological narcissism,&lt;ref name="Kernberg75"/&gt; consistent irresponsibility, [[machiavellianism]], lack of [[empathy]],&lt;ref name="sbc"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty | publisher=Basic Books | author=Baron-Cohen, S | year=2012 | pages=45–98 | isbn=978-0-465-03142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; cruelty, [[meanness]], impulsivity, proneness to self-harm and addictions,&lt;ref name="C&amp;C02"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casillas, A. |author2=Clark, L.A.k |title=Dependency, impulsivity, and self-harm: traits hypothesized to underlie the association between cluster B personality and substance use disorders |journal=Journal of  Personality Disorders|volume=16 |issue= 5|pages=424–36 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12489309 |doi=10.1521/pedi.16.5.424.22124}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpersonal exploitation, hostility, anger and rage, vanity, emotional instability, rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, and the use of primitive [[defence mechanisms]] that are pathological and narcissistic. Common [[narcissistic defences]] include [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], [[projective identification]], primitive [[idealization and devaluation]], [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] (including [[exaggeration]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] and [[lie]]s), and [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name=OK93&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kernberg|first1=O.|title=Severe Personality Disorders: Psychotherapeutic Strategies|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05349-4|pages=15–18|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Marsha M. Linehan]] has stated that people with borderline personality disorder often exhibit behaviors which are not truly manipulative, but are erroneously interpreted as such.&lt;ref name=marsha2222&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toddlertime.com/mh/terms/manipulation.htm |title=On Manipulation with the Borderline Personality |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=ToddlerTime Network |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, these behaviors often appear as unthinking manifestations of intense pain, and are often not deliberate as to be considered truly manipulative. In the [[DSM-V]], manipulation was removed as a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma and Prejudice|last=Aguirre|first=Blaise|date=2016|publisher=Humana Press, Cham|isbn=9783319275789|series=Current Clinical Psychiatry|pages=133–143|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-27580-2_8|chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder: From Stigma to Compassionate Care}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipulative behavior is intrinsic to narcissists, who use manipulation to obtain power and [[narcissistic supply]]. Those with antisocial personalities will manipulate for material items, power, revenge, and a wide variety of other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Histrionic personality disorder==
{{Main article|Histrionic personality disorder}}
People with histrionic personality disorder are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good [[social skills]], despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of attention.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite web | publisher=The Cleveland Clinic | title =Histrionic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/3700/3795.asp?index=9743 | accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machiavellianism==
{{Main article|Machiavellianism|Machiavellian intelligence}}
Machiavellianism is a term that some [[Social psychology|social]] and [[Personality psychology|personality]] psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach themselves from conventional morality and hence to [[deceive]] and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the ''Machiavelli test'').&lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., and F. L. Geis. (1970) "How devious are you? Take the Machiavelli test to find out." ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 15.4: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Thomas''''' was an Australian court case decided in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victorian Court of Appeal]] on 18 August 2006. It concerned the conviction in February 2006 of [[Joseph Terrence Thomas|Joseph Thomas]] (nicknamed "Jihad Jack" in the media) on [[terrorism]]-related charges, specifically receiving funds from [[Al Qaeda]]. The appeal revolved around the [[admissible evidence|admissibility]] of a [[Confession (law)|confession]] Thomas made during an interrogation in [[Pakistan]] in 2003. The court found that the [[evidence (law)|evidence]], which was crucial to Thomas' convictions, was inadmissible because it had not been given voluntarily. The court accordingly quashed his convictions, but after further hearings ordered on 20 December 2006 that he be retried rather than [[acquittal|acquitted]].

==Background to the case==

Joseph Thomas is an Australian citizen. On 23 March 2001 he left Australia and travelled by air to Pakistan, crossing into [[Afghanistan]] by land. For the next three months, he was alleged to have trained at the [[Al Farouq training camp]] near the city of [[Kandahar]], before travelling to [[Kabul]] in July 2001.&lt;ref name="ruling3"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSC|243|2006|litigants=DPP v Thomas |courtname=auto}} (reasons for Ruling #3, given during the initial trial).&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next eighteen months or so, Thomas stayed in various Al Qaeda safe houses, and is alleged to have made contact with several Al Qaeda officials.&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;

On 4 January 2003, Thomas was apprehended by Pakistani immigration officials at an airport in the city of [[Karachi]], and taken into [[police custody|custody]]. Thomas had with him items including an Australian-issue [[passport]], an airline ticket for travel to [[Indonesia]], and about [[United States dollar|$]] 3,800 in [[cash]]. The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been tampered with, for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001.&lt;ref name="VSCA"/&gt; He was blindfolded, and driven to an unknown location, where he was questioned for about two hours by two Pakistani men and two Americans.&lt;ref name="VSCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|166|2006|litigants=R v Thomas |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was questioned several times over the next few days, before being taken to another location, which Thomas described as "some sort of mansion house", where he was kept in a small cell for the next two weeks and questioned on a number of occasions.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Initially he maintained a fabricated story, that he was a student who had been travelling in Pakistan, but he later revealed the truth, that he had been in contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents, including one in which one of the Pakistani interrogators pulled on the collar of his hood, so as to strangle him, and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be [[electric shock|electrocuted]] and [[execution|executed]]. According to Thomas, he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

After the two weeks, Thomas was blindfolded and shackled, and flown to [[Islamabad]], where he remained in custody. There he was visited by an Australian [[consul (representative)|consular]] representative, who later gave evidence that Thomas did not appear to have been maltreated, or denied food or water. However, the representative did testify that while Thomas was on the phone to his parents in Australia, he told them "I'm not going to [[Cuba]]" (referring to the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]), to which a Pakistani official replied, "No, that's not correct."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas was interviewed four times by members of the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) and by members of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), accompanied by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas "we told you that you have to prove it... that you are not a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of [[Lahore]], where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his [[testicle]]s twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.

On 8 March, Thomas was interviewed again by two members of the AFP, who had made special arrangements with the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) to have the interview conducted pursuant to Australian law, particularly the requirements of the federal ''[[Evidence Act 1995]]'' and ''[[Crimes Act 1914]]'', so that admissible evidence could be gathered. ISI allowed the interview, but with a very limited timeframe, and did not allow Thomas to have access to legal advice.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; During this interview, Thomas made several self-incriminatory statements, which were key to his later convictions and the admissibility of which was the central issue in the appeal. In the statements, Thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal the amount of time he had been in Pakistan, and also admitted that the money and airline ticket had been given to him by [[Tawfiq bin Attash]], a high ranking [[Al Qaeda]] lieutenant involved with the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] and the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]].&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; On 10 March, the AFP wrote again to the ISI, reiterating the requirements of the Australian legislation, and saying that "the admissibility of [the record of interview] in Australian Courts has been seriously compromised."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

On 6 June 2003, Thomas was released from Pakistani custody, at which point he was [[deportation|deported]] to Australia. He spent nearly a year and a half subsequently living with his family in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Werribee, Victoria|Werribee]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], before he was arrested by the AFP on 18 November 2004 and charged with several federal offences, including one count of possessing a false passport (an offence under the ''Passports Act 1938''), and one count of receiving funds from a terrorist organisation and two counts of providing resources to a terrorist organisation (offences under the ''[[Criminal Code Act 1995]]'').

===Trial===

Thomas was tried in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]]. On 26 February, was found guilty of the passport charge and the receiving funds charge (although he was acquitted of the providing funds charges).&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; He was later sentenced on 31 March, to a total of five years' imprisonment with a two-year non-[[parole]] period.&lt;ref name="sentencing"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSC|120|2006|litigants=DPP v Thomas |courtname=auto}} (sentencing remarks).&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the admissibility of the record of the 8 March interview, the trial judge (Justice [[Philip Cummins|Cummins]]) had instructed the [[jury]] that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Normally, failure to avail an interviewee of [the right to legal access] would be fatal to the admission of a subsequent interview... However, the requirement is not absolute, nor can it be... it is not hollow to say that the suspect had the right to choose whether to proceed without that legal access. He had the right to choose not to answer, and wait for the legal bus which might never arrive, or to answer, in the legitimate aim of ultimate return to Australia. To say such a choice is no choice at all is revisionism."&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his assessment, the judge said that the AFP interviewers had conducted the interview "fairly and properly", and had not attempted to use Thomas' lack of legal representation to their favour.&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;

The trial judge also concluded that Thomas had been properly informed of his right to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers to participate in the interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately he decided that Thomas had participated voluntarily in the interview, and that in the circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of the interview inadmissible.&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;

==Arguments==

[[Lex Lasry]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], on behalf of Thomas, argued that the trial judge had made several [[question of law|errors of law]]:
# the trial judge should have found that the 8&amp;nbsp;March interview was not voluntary and hence inadmissible, and
# even if it had been voluntary, the trial judge should have excluded it anyway on grounds of fairness or [[public policy]].
Several other matters were also raised, relating to particular parts of the evidence (specifically, relating to the witness testimony of [[Yahya Goba]], one of the [[Buffalo Six]]), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not.

The other main argument was an alternative argument, that if the court decided that the admissions were in fact voluntary, they should not have been admitted anyway on the basis that to do so would be unfair, because of factors including Thomas' lack of access to legal advice even where he had a right to obtain it, his vulnerability in the circumstances, and "the contamination of the record of interview by the previous joint team interrogations, and their potential or actual use as levers to remind the applicant of his earlier answers."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Two other parties sought to be involved in the case as [[amicus curiae|amici curiae]], [[Amnesty International]] (represented by former [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] Justice [[Ron Merkel]]), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However both their applications were rejected, because they could not assist the court in a way in which they could not otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

==Judgment==

In a unanimous decision, the three judges decided that the appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed ''instanter''&amp;nbsp;– at once), on the basis that the 8&amp;nbsp;March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

===Voluntariness of the interview===

The court quoted from a 1948 judgment of future [[Chief Justice of Australia]] [[Owen Dixon]], followed unanimously by the [[High Court of Australia]] in later decisions, in which he said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At common law a confessional statement made out of court by an accused person may not be admitted in evidence against him upon his trial for the crime to which it relates unless it is shown to have been voluntarily made. This means substantially that it has been made in the exercise of his free choice. If he speaks because he is overborne, his confessional statement cannot be received in evidence and it does not matter by what means he has been overborne. If his statement is the result of [[duress]], [[intimidation]], persistent importunity, or sustained or undue insistence or pressure, it cannot be voluntary. But it is also a definite rule of the common law that a confessional statement cannot be voluntary if it is preceded by an inducement held out by a person in authority and the inducement has not been removed before the statement is made..."&lt;ref name="McDermott"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|1948|litigants=McDermott v The King |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1948/23.pdf (1948) 76 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 501] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court also noted a recent decision of its own, in which it had emphasised that the principles of evidence strike a balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of the state, and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the one hand, there is an obvious need to bring to account those who have committed serious offences if the objectives of the criminal justice system are to be achieved and societal values vindicated, but, on the other, it cannot be forgotten that those values incorporate the rights of the individual and, in part define the nature of the relationship between the citizen and the community in which he or she resides."&lt;ref name="Tofilau"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|40|2006|litigants=R v Tofilau |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court considered that Thomas had been regularly informed by all those who had interrogated him that the degree to which he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that they would be able to help Thomas.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying "[we] might give you another look at that later", comments which were "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

The court rejected the opinion of the trial judge that Thomas viewed the 8&amp;nbsp;March interview differently to the other interviews, which were concerned only with intelligence gathering. Rather, they emphasised how similar the interviews all were: "same place, same AFP personnel, same topics."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; They considered that the inducements offered in the previous interviews, and indeed the threats and intimidation in previous interviews by the American "Joe" and others, all "remained operative, their power undiminished" in 8 March interview.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Lastly, the court rejected the argument that the admissions were voluntary because Thomas knew he had a right to silence, because he did not have any practical opportunity to exercise the right. The court concluded that the trial judge had made an error by separating the interview from the circumstances, and that in the circumstances Thomas had no real choice whether to answer questions: "Even the threat 'Confess or be tortured' can be said to involve a choice, and a chance that torture may not be applied. But it could never be regarded as a free choice in the relevant sense."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Ultimately, the court found that the admissions were not given voluntarily, and so were not admissible.

===Discretion to exclude evidence===

Although it was unnecessary to decide the alternative argument, the court addressed it briefly anyway. After considering previous cases on the issue, the court considered whether the Australian investigators acted fairly. They concluded that "only one course [was] properly open to the investigating officials in the light of the position taken by the Pakistani authorities. It was to acknowledge that no formal record of interview could be conducted so long as the applicant was in Pakistan since, as the investigating officials appreciated, any such interview would be unlawful, that is, would be contrary to Australian law."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

The court also referred to a judgment of Justice [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh]] of the High Court, in which he said that although there is some discretion as to whether evidence obtained where an interviewee does not have access to legal advice should be admitted or not, judges are not free to make the decision "by reference to general notions of fairness."&lt;ref name="pollard"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|69|1992|litigants=Pollard v The Queen |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 177 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded that the trial judge had erred in not exercising his discretion to bar the evidence from being admitted, although it was not necessary to decide the point.

==Consequences==

Thomas' original convictions were quashed, however before the final orders were made the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions]] sought to make a submission as to whether there should be a directed acquittal or whether there should be a retrial. The court heard brief arguments, then set aside the issue for a further hearing, to be held after the parties had made written submissions.&lt;ref name="no2 nexthearing"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|166|2006|litigants=R v Thomas (No 2) |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution sought to introduce as evidence statements Thomas made in an interview with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] for the ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' television program in February  2006.&lt;ref name="AM convictions quashed"&gt;{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Josie | title = 'Jihad Jack' has convictions quashed | work = AM | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=  19 August 2006 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1718994.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties made submissions, and there was an oral hearing on 1 December 2006. All parties accepted that the relevant test to be applied was the test set out in the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case of ''[[DPP (Nauru) v Fowler]]'', which sets out two preconditions for a retrial; the first requiring that the admissible evidence presented at trial be "sufficiently cogent" to support a conviction, the second requiring consideration of circumstances that would make it unjust to put the accused through a retrial.&lt;ref name="no3 retrial"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|300|2006|litigants=R v Thomas (No 3) |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this case had an unusual feature, namely that the evidence that the prosecution would seek to use at a retrial had not been available at the original trial, through no fault of the prosecution, since although the interviews had been taken at that time they had not been published. Ultimately all parties agreed that all evidence, not just evidence submitted in the original trial, should be considered when applying the first part of the Fowler test.&lt;ref name="no3 retrial" /&gt;

The court decided that it would be reasonably possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in [[solitary confinement]], without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="no3 retrial" /&gt; The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.&lt;ref name="no3 retrial" /&gt;

As such, the court ordered on 20 December 2006 that Thomas be retried. Thomas was then released on [[bail]], with requirements to report three times a week and not to leave Australia.&lt;ref name="Age terror retrial"&gt;{{cite news | author = AAP | title = Thomas to face terror retrial | work = The Age | publisher = Fairfax | date=  2006-12-20 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/thomas-to-face-terror-retrial/2006/12/20/1166290588729.html | accessdate = 2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and his family were in court to hear the verdict, his mother crying and Thomas looking "more like a startled rabbit [than a terrorist]."&lt;ref name="Australian rabbit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hedge | first = Mike | title = Thomas 'like a startled rabbit' | work = The Australian | publisher = News Corporation | date=  2006-12-20 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20957911-1702,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the retrial in 2008 Thomas was found not guilty of the terrorism charges but was found guilty of a passport offence, which carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment. Thomas had already served nine months. [[Elizabeth Curtain|Justice Curtain]] ordered that Thomas be imprisoned for nine months but found he was free to go after taking into account time already served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|620|2008|litigants=R v Thomas |date=29 October 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===

The decision was praised by [[Civil liberties|civil libertarians]]. Former President of the [[Victorial Council of Civil Liberties]], Robert Richter QC, said that the decision was important "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case is said to be a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable."&lt;ref name="lateline libertarians"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hermant | first = Norman | title = Civil libertarians welcome decision to release 'Jihad Jack' | work = Lateline | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=  18 August 2006 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1718845.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Melbourne]] evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that "I think that it was a little bit naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really know what they were thinking."&lt;ref name="AM convictions quashed" /&gt;

The decision has also attracted criticism. Conservative columnist [[Piers Akerman]] said that the decision "has handed [[Al Qaeda|al-Qaeda]], [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] and all other terrorist organisations a major victory and confirmed the adage the law is an ass."&lt;ref name="akerman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Akerman | first = Piers | title = Why terrorism loves our justice | work = The Daily Telegraph | publisher = News Corporation | date=  22 August 2006 | url = http://www.mail-archive.com/osint@yahoogroups.com/msg25850.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Akerman emphasised that information about Thomas (including the ''Four Corners'' interview&lt;ref name="4corners copy"&gt;Available here: {{cite web | title = The Transcript: What Thomas told Four Corners | work = The Australian | publisher = News Corporation | date=  21 August 2006 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20199530-601,00.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was already available in the [[public domain]] for the populace to make its own judgment, despite "judicial commands to juries to ignore material [which] may have some minor relevance in their petty fiefdoms."&lt;ref name="akerman" /&gt;

Conservative Melbourne lawyer [[Peter Faris]] QC called for an appeal to the High Court or changes to the laws of  evidence legislation, saying that "this case is bad law", alternatively suggesting that Thomas be handed over to Pakistan, since he stated that the evidence from the interview would in his opinion be admissible in a Pakistani court.&lt;ref name="hun anger"&gt;{{cite news | last = Healey | first = Kelvin | title = Anger on Joseph Thomas | work = Herald Sun | publisher = News Corporation | date=  20 August 2006 | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20186191-661,00.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faris also argued that there was an issue of apparent bias arising with respect to the presiding judge in the appeal, [[Chris Maxwell|Maxwell]] P, which could afford grounds for invalidating the appeal.&lt;ref name="faris judicial bias"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Faris | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Faris | title = Jack Thomas' Appeal and Judicial Bias | journal = Original Law Review | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 53–71  | publisher = Sandstone Academic Press | location = Melbourne | year=  2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that Pakistani law of evidence does not permit a confession made to a police officer to be admitted into evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistanconstitution-law.org/category/11-the-qanun-e-shahadat-order-1984/ Article 38 Qanun-e-Shahdat Order (Law of Evidence)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910023538/http://pakistanconstitution-law.org/category/11-the-qanun-e-shahadat-order-1984/ |date=10 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faris argued that the apparent bias arose because of Maxwell's activities before his appointment to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], including his membership of organisations including [[Amnesty International]], his past presidency of [[Liberty Victoria]], his past involvement with [[human rights law]] and advocacy against counter-terrorism laws.&lt;ref name="faris judicial bias" /&gt; Faris drew a comparison with the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] case which considered the [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial#Arrest in London|extradition of Augusto Pinochet]], which was overturned on appeal because of [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffman]]'s failure to disclose his links to Amnesty International.&lt;ref name="faris judicial bias" /&gt;

Because of the ongoing proceedings relating to whether Thomas should be acquitted or retried, neither the [[Government of Australia]] nor the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] commented immediately after the case, although [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Peter Costello]] later said that anti-terrorism legislation did not need to be strengthened in the wake of the case, and Opposition foreign affairs spokesperson [[Kevin Rudd]] said that "What is plain from the events of yesterday is that the Government has bungled&amp;nbsp;– and bungled badly&amp;nbsp;– the prosecution of this case."&lt;ref name="hun anger" /&gt;

[[Gerard Henderson]] said that the case "highlights an emerging division within democracies" between civil liberties advocates on the one hand and "a democracy defence lobby, which maintains that radical [[Islamism]] poses a real and present danger to Western nations" on the other.&lt;ref name="SMH henderson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Henderson | first = Gerard | title = Unanimous verdict in democracy divided | work = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher = Fairfax | date=  22 August 2006 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/unanimous-verdict-in-democracy-divided/2006/08/21/1156012472041.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scrap metal shredder''', also sometimes referred to as a metal scrap shredder, is a machine used for reducing the size of scrap metal. Scrap metal shredders come in many different variations and sizes.

==Applications==
Some examples of scrap metal materials that are commonly shredded are:

[[Automotive shredder residue|Auto shredders]] are large machines that turn a car into a large bucket of scrap steel and the rest of the car into non-ferrous materials, plastics and waste. The glass, fabric, plastic, and all other non ferrous materials are separated by eddy current magnets in place of heavy media separation. The non-ferrous materials may be referred to as "zorba."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/07/12/albany-scrap-metal-processor-to-install-massive-shredder|title=Albany scrap metal processor to install massive shredder|last=Cropley|first=John|date=July 12, 2018|website=The Daily Gazette|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the profit from the non ferrous materials covers the operating cost for the auto-shredder.

Metal scrap recycling, also called secondary metal processing, is a large industry that processes, in the U.S. alone, 56 million tons of scrap iron and steel (including 10 million tons of scrap automobiles), 1.5 million tons of scrap copper, 2.5 million tons of scrap aluminum, 1.3 million tons of scrap lead, 300,000 tons of scrap zinc and 800,000 tons of scrap stainless steel, and smaller quantities of other metals, on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/recycling/recycling_scrap_metal.html|title=Recycling - Scrap Metal Recycling|last=|first=|date=|website=US Occupational Safety and Health Administration|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Scrap metal shredders can be equipped with different types of cutting systems: horizontal shaft, vertical shaft, single-shaft, two-shaft, three-shaft and four-shaft cutting systems. These shredder designs can be high speed, medium speed and sometimes slow-speed systems, they always include hammermills of a vertical and horizontal shaft design, and can also include in contrast to hammer mills slow speed technology which are also used to process or shred metal and plastic and other waste materials encountered in the scrap metal industry.
 
The largest scrap metal shredders in the world often have 10,000 hp and are made by a wide range of companies which all originated their designs from the 1966 patent applications of the Newell Group and the Williams Group as the first patented vertical and horizontal designs for auto shredding or scrap metal shredding. Often cited is the 9,200 hp shredder from the Lynxs group at the Sims plant at the mouth of the [[River Usk]] in Newport [[Wales]] with access by [[road]], [[rail transport|rail]] and [[sea]]. This Lynxs shredder can eat 350 cars per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/5893440/the-worlds-biggest-auto-shredder-eats-450-cars-an-hour/|title=The World's Biggest Auto Shredder Eats 450 Cars an Hour|last=Tarantola|first=Andrew|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lynxs shredders are not unique in this high hp range design. Historically the Schnitzer Steel group installed a 10,000 hp unit that they made on their own in 1980, and there are many Newell Shredders that have these high hp designs. A 9,000 horsepower Mega Shredder at Sims Metal Management's Claremont Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey processes 4,000 tons of metal a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/04/behold_the_mega_shredder_jerse.html|title=Behold the Mega Shredder: Jersey City recycling plant turns cars to confetti in seconds|last=|first=|date=April 28, 2013|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-perception theory''' ('''SPT''') is an account of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] formation developed by [[psychologist]] [[Daryl Bem]].&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1967). Self-Perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena. Psychological Review, 74, 183-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-Perception Theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp.1-62). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts that people develop their attitudes (when there is no previous attitude due to a lack of experience, etc.—and the [[emotion]]al response is ambiguous) by observing their own [[behavior]] and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as the conventional wisdom is that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states.&lt;ref&gt;Robak, R. W., Ward, A., &amp; Ostolaza, K. (2005). Development of a General Measure of Individuals' Recognition of Their Self-Perception Processes. Psychology, 7, 337-344.&lt;/ref&gt; The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others' behaviors.

==Bem's original experiment==
In an attempt to decide if individuals induce their attitudes as observers without accessing their internal states, Bem used interpersonal simulations, in which an "observer-participant" is given a detailed description of one condition of a [[cognitive dissonance]] experiment. Subjects listened to a tape of a man enthusiastically describing a tedious peg-turning task.

Subjects were told that the man had been paid $20 for his testimonial and another group was told that he was paid $1. Those in the latter condition thought that the man must have enjoyed the task more than those in the $20 condition. The results obtained were similar to the original [[Cognitive dissonance#Induced-compliance paradigm|Festinger-Carlsmith experiment]]. Because the observers, who did not have access to the actors' internal cognition and mood states, were able to infer the true attitude of the actors, it is possible that the actors themselves also arrive at their attitudes by observing their own behavior. Specifically, Bem notes how "the attitude statements which comprise the major dependent variables in dissonance experiments may be regarded as interpersonal judgments in which the observer and the observed happen to be the same individual."

==Further evidence==
There are numerous studies conducted by psychologists that support the [[Psychology of self|self]]-perception theory, demonstrating that emotions do follow behaviors. For example, it is found that corresponding emotions (including liking, disliking, [[happiness]], [[anger]], etc.) were reported following from their overt behaviors, which had been manipulated by the experimenters.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, J. D. (2007). Feelings: The Perceptions of Self. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors included making different [[facial expression]]s, gazes, and postures. In the end of the experiment, subjects inferred and reported their affections and attitudes from their practiced behaviors despite the fact that they were told previously to act that way. These findings are consistent with the [[James–Lange theory]] of emotion.

In 1974, James Laird conducted two experiments on how changes in facial expression can trigger changes in emotion.&lt;ref name="Laird 1974"&gt;Laird, J. D. (1974). Self-attribution of emotion: The effects of expressive behavior on the quality of emotional experience. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29(4), 475-486. doi:10.1037/h0036125&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were asked to contract or relax various facial muscles, causing them to smile or frown without awareness of the nature of their expressions. Participants reported feeling more angry when frowning and happier when smiling. They also reported that cartoons viewed while they were smiling were more humorous than cartoons viewed while they were frowning. Furthermore, participants scored higher on aggression during frown trials than during smile trials, and scored higher on elation, surgency, and social affection factors during smile trials than during frown ones.&lt;ref name="Laird 1974" /&gt; Laird interpreted these results as "indicating that an individual's expressive behavior mediates the quality of his emotional experience."&lt;ref name="Laird 1974" /&gt; In other words, a person's facial expression can act as a cause of an emotional state, rather than an effect; instead of smiling because they feel happy, a person can make themselves feel happy by smiling.

In 2006, Tiffany Ito and her colleagues conducted two studies to investigate if changes in facial expression can trigger changes in [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] bias.&lt;ref name="Ito"&gt;Ito, T., Chiao, K., Devine, P., Lorig, T., &amp; Cacioppo, J. (2006). The Influence of Facial Feedback on Race Bias. Psychological Science, 17(3), 256-261. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01694.x&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit goal of the studies was to determine "whether facial feedback can modulate implicit racial bias as assessed by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]] (IAT)."&lt;ref name="Ito" /&gt; Participants were surreptitiously induced to smile through holding a pencil in their mouth while viewing photographs of unfamiliar black or white males or performed no somatic configuration while viewing the photographs (Study 1 only). All participants then completed the IAT with no facial manipulation. Results revealed a spreading attitude effect; people made to smile (unconsciously) at pictures of [[Black people|black]] males showed less implicit prejudice than those made to smile at pictures of [[White people|white]] males.&lt;ref name="Ito" /&gt; Their attitudes change as a result of their behavior.

Chaiken and Baldwin's 1981 study on self-perception theory dealt with environmental attitudes.&lt;ref name="Chaiken"&gt;Chaiken, S., &amp; Baldwin, M. W. (1981). Affective-cognitive consistency and the effect of salient behavioral information on the self-perception of attitudes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41(1), 1-12. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant was identified as having well or poorly defined prior attitudes toward being an [[environmentalist]] or [[Conservation movement|conservationist]]. Participants then completed one of two versions of a questionnaire designed to bring to mind either past pro-ecology behaviors or past anti-ecology behaviors.&lt;ref name="Chaiken" /&gt; For example, questions such as "Have you ever recycled?" call to mind the times an individual has recycled, emphasizing their engagement in environmentalist behavior. On the other hand, questions like "Do you always recycle?" bring to mind all the times an individual did not recycle something, emphasizing a lack of environmentalist behavior. Afterward, participants' attitudes toward being an environmentalist/conservationist were re-measured. Those with strong initial/prior attitudes toward the environment were not really affected by the salient manipulation. Those with weak prior attitudes, however, were affected. At the end, those in the pro-ecology condition ("Have you ever recycled?") reported themselves as being much more pro-environment than those in the anti-ecology condition ("Do you always recycle?").&lt;ref name="Chaiken" /&gt; Bringing to mind certain past behaviors affected what people believed their attitudes to be.

Evidence for the self-perception theory has also been seen in real life situations. After teenagers participated in repeated and sustained volunteering services, their attitudes were demonstrated to have shifted to be more caring and considerate towards others.&lt;ref&gt;Brunelle, J. P. (2001). The impact of community service on adolescent volunteers' empathy, social responsibility, and concern for others. The Sciences and Engineering, 62, 2514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research==
Research incorporating self-perception theory has continued in recent years, appearing in conjunction with studies dealing with [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational "crowding out,"]] [[terrorism]], [[mindwandering]], and the inclusion of others in the self.

Guadagno and her fellow experimenters did a study in 2010 addressing the recruitment of new members by terrorist organization via the internet.&lt;ref name="Guadagno"&gt;Guadagno, R. E., Lankford, A., Muscanell, N. L., Okdie, B. M., &amp; McCallum, D. M. (2010). Social influence in the online recruitment of terrorists and terrorist sympathizers: Implications for social psychology research. Revue Internationale De Psychologie Sociale, 23(1), 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to looking at how such an organization might influence its targets to support more [[Extremism|extreme ideologies]] (primarily through simple requests gradually increasing to larger commitments–an example of the [[foot-in-the-door technique]]), the authors looked at how "the new converts may form increasingly radical attitudes to be consistent with their increasingly radical behavior."&lt;ref name="Guadagno" /&gt; Self-perception theory, then, has strong ties to social identity and [[social influence]] in this scenario.

Also in 2010, Clayton Critcher and [[Thomas Gilovich]] performed four studies to test a connection between self-perception theory and mindwandering.&lt;ref name="Critcher"&gt;Critcher, C. R., &amp; Gilovich, T. (2010). Inferring attitudes from mindwandering. Personality And Social Psychology Bulletin, 36(9), 1255-1266.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-perception theory posits that people determine their attitudes and preferences by interpreting the meaning of their own behavior. Critcher and Gilovich looked at whether people also rely on the unobservable behavior that is their mindwandering when making inferences about their attitudes and preferences. They found that "Having the mind wander to positive events, to concurrent as opposed to past activities, and to many events rather than just one tends to be attributed to boredom and therefore leads to perceived dissatisfaction with an ongoing task." Participants relied on the content of their wandering minds as a cue to their attitudes unless an alternative cause for their mindwandering was brought to their attention.&lt;ref name="Critcher" /&gt;

Similarly, Goldstein and Cialdini published work related to self-perception theory in 2007.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, N. J., &amp; Cialdini, R. B. (2007). The spyglass self: A model of vicarious self-perception. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(3), 402-417.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extension of self-perception theory, the authors hypothesized that people sometimes infer their own attributes or attitudes by "observing the freely chosen actions of others with whom they feel a sense of merged identity – almost as if they had observed themselves performing the acts."&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; Participants were made to feel a sense of merged identity with an actor through a perspective-taking task or feedback indicating overlapping brainwave patterns. Participants incorporated attributes relevant to the actor's behavior into their own [[self-concept]]s, leading participants to then change their own behaviors.&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; The study addresses the [[self-expansion model]]: close relationships can lead to an inclusion of another person in an individual's sense of self.

==Applications==
One useful application of the self-perception theory is in changing attitude, both [[therapy|therapeutically]] and in terms of [[persuasion]].

===Psychological therapy===

For therapies, self-perception theory holds a different view of psychological problems from the traditional perspectives. Traditionally, psychological problems come from the inner part of the clients. However, self-perception theory perspective suggests that people derive their inner feelings or abilities from their external behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, (6th ed.). New York, NY: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; If those behaviors are maladjusted ones, people will attribute those maladjustments to their poor adapting abilities and thus suffer from the corresponding psychological problems. Thus, this concept can be used to treat clients with psychological problems that resulted from maladjustments by guiding them to first change their behavior and later dealing with the "problems".

One of the most famous therapies making use of this concept is therapy for "heterosocial anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;Haemmerlie, F. M., &amp; Montgomery, R. L. (1982). Self-perception theory and unobtrusively biased interactions: A treatment for heterosocial anxiety. Journal of Counseling, Psychology, 29, 362-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haemmerlie, F. M., &amp; Montgomery, R. L. (1984). Purposefully biased interactions: Reducing heterosocial anxiety through self-perception theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 47, 900-908.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the assumption is that an individual perceives that he or she has poor social skills because he/she has no dates. Experiments showed that males with heterosocial anxiety perceived less [[anxiety]] with females after several sessions of therapy in which they engaged in a 12-minute, purposefully biased dyadic social interactions with a separate females. From these apparently successful interactions, the males inferred that their heterosocial anxiety was reduced. This effect is shown to be quite long-lasting as the reduction in perceived heterosocial anxiety resulted in a significantly greater number of dates among subjects 6 months later.

===Marketing and persuasion===

Self-perception theory is also an underlying mechanism for the effectiveness of many [[marketing]] or persuasive techniques. One typical example is the foot-in-the-door technique, which is a widely used marketing technique for persuading target customers to buy products. The basic premise of this technique is that, once a person complies with a small request (e.g. filling in a short questionnaire), he/she will be more likely to comply with a more substantial request which is related to the original request (e.g. buying the related product).&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M., &amp; Cunningham, M. R. (1975). To comply or not comply: testing the self-perception explanation of the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31, 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uranowitz, S. W. (1975). Helping and self-attributions: a field experiment. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31, 852–854.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, C., Bush, M., &amp; Kirsch, K. (1976). Relationship compliance in the foot-in-the-door paradigm and size of the first request. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33, 517–520.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, J. M. (1999). The foot-in-the-door compliance procedure: a multiple-process analysis and review, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, 303–325.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that the initial commitment on the small request will change one's [[self-image]], therefore giving reasons for agreeing with the subsequent, larger request. It is because people observe their own behaviors (paying attention to and complying with the initial request) and the context in which they behave (no obvious incentive to do so), and thus infer they must have a preference for those products.

==Challenges and criticisms==

Self-perception theory was initially proposed as an alternative to explain the experimental findings of the [[cognitive dissonance theory]], and there were debates as to whether people experience [[attitude change]]s as an effort to reduce dissonance or as a result of self-perception processes. Based on the fact that the self-perception theory differs from the cognitive dissonance theory in that it does not hold that people experience a "negative drive state" called "dissonance" which they seek to relieve, the following experiment was carried out to compare the two theories under different conditions.

An early study on cognitive dissonance theory shows that people indeed experience arousal when their behavior is inconsistent with their previous attitude. Waterman&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, C. K. (1969). The facilitating and interfering effects of cognitive dissonance on simple and complex paired associates learning tasks. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 5, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt; designed an experiment in which 77 male college freshmen were asked to write an essay arguing against the position they actually agreed with. Then they were asked immediately to perform a simple task and a difficult task; their performance in both tasks was assessed. It was found that they performed better in the simple task and worse in the difficult task, compared to those who had just written an essay corresponding to their true attitude. As indicated by [[social facilitation]], enhanced performance in simple tasks and worsened performance in difficult tasks shows that arousal is produced by people when their behavior is inconsistent with their attitude. Therefore, the cognitive dissonance theory is evident in this case.

==Apparent disproof==
Debate ensued over whether dissonance or self-perception was the valid mechanism behind attitude change. The chief difficulty lay in finding an experiment where the two flexible theories would make distinctly different predictions. Some prominent [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] such as [[Anthony Greenwald]] thought it would be impossible to distinguish between the two theories.

In 1974, Zanna and Cooper conducted an experiment in which individuals were made to write a counter-attitudinal essay.&lt;ref name="Zanna"&gt;Zanna, M. P., &amp; Cooper, J. (1974). Dissonance and the pill: An attribution approach to studying the arousal properties of dissonance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29(5), 703–709. {{doi|10.1037/h0036651}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were divided into either a low choice or a high choice condition. They were also given a [[placebo]]; they were told the placebo would induce either tension, relaxation, or exert no effect. Under low choice, all participants exhibited no attitude change, which would be predicted by both cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory.&lt;ref name="Zanna" /&gt; Under high choice, participants who were told the placebo would produce tension exhibited no attitude change, and participants who were told the placebo would produce relaxation demonstrated larger attitude change.&lt;ref name="Zanna" /&gt;

These results are not explainable by self-perception theory, as arousal should have nothing to do with the mechanism underlying attitude change. Cognitive dissonance theory, however, was readily able to explain these results: if the participants could attribute their state of unpleasant arousal to the placebo, they would not have to alter their attitude.

Thus, for a period of time, it seemed the debate between the self-perception theory and cognitive dissonance had ended.

==Reviving the theory: the truce experiment==
Fazio, Zanna, and Cooper conducted another experiment in 1977, demonstrating that both cognitive dissonance and self-perception could co-exist.&lt;ref name="Fazio"&gt;Fazio, R. H., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Cooper, J. (1977). Dissonance and self-perception: An integrative view of each theory's proper domain of application. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 13(5), 464-479. doi:10.1016/0022-1031(77)90031-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experimental design similar to Zanna and Cooper's 1974 study, another variable was manipulated: whether or not the stance of the counter-attitudinal essay fell in the latitude of acceptance or the latitude of rejection (see [[social judgment theory]]). It appeared that when the stance of the essay fell into the latitude of rejection, the results favoured cognitive dissonance. However, when the essay fell in the latitude of acceptance, the results favoured self-perception theory.&lt;ref name="Fazio" /&gt;

Whether cognitive dissonance or self-perception is a more useful theory is a topic of considerable controversy and a large body of literature. There are some circumstances in which a certain theory is preferred, but it is traditional to use the terminology of cognitive dissonance theory by default. The cognitive dissonance theory accounts for attitude changes when people's behaviors are inconsistent with their original attitudes which are clear and important to them; meanwhile, the self-perception theory is used when those original attitudes are relatively ambiguous and less important. Studies have shown that, in contrast to traditional belief, a large proportion of people's attitudes are weak and vague. Thus, the self-perception theory is significant in interpreting one's own attitudes, such as the assessment of one's own [[personality trait]]s&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N., Bless, H., Strack, F., Klumpp, G., Rittenauer-Schatka, &amp; Simons, A. (1991). Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61, 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tice, D. M. (1993). Self-concept change and self-presentation: The looking glass self is also a magnifying glass. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 63, 435-451.&lt;/ref&gt; and whether someone would cheat to achieve a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstbier, R. A., &amp; Munter, P.O. (1971). Cheating as a function of the labeling of natural arousal. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 17, 208-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to G. Jademyr and Yojiyfus, the perception of different aspect in the interpreting theory can be due to many factors, such as circumstances regarding dissonance and controversy. This can also be because of [[balance theory]] as it applies to the attitude towards accountability and dimensions.

'''Shia Rights Watch''' (SRW) is an organization that works to defend justice and rights for [[Shia Muslims]] around the world. It is the first of its kind, a non-governmental, not for profit, organization that bases research and advocacy from case studies and reports, hands on experience, field education and policy changing, headquartered in [[Washington D.C.]] By working with victims, humanitarian organizations, journalists and its network of over 600 active members, SRW publishes reports and articles that help to spread awareness of the many human rights abuses committed against the Shia Muslim population throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.shafaqna.com/other-services/spotlight/item/1698-felixia-yeap-received-an-offer-to-take-photo-shoots-while-donning-islamic-hijab.html |title=Introducing a Shia organization: Shia Rights Watch |publisher=En.shafaqna.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==  
Shia Rights Watch aims to protect the rights of Shia Muslims through investigative research and targeted advocacy. Its worldwide network provides SRW with the resources to publish detailed reports and articles that shed light on the human rights violations committed every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoirepharos.com/international/international-rapport-mensuel-des-violations-des-droits-des-chiites-dans-le-monde-ar |title=INTERNATIONAL - Rapport de Shia Rights Watch sur les violations des droits des chiites dans le monde - Ar — Observatoire Pharos |language=fr |publisher=Observatoirepharos.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization goes through media, old and new, and take note of the reports that are being made on Human Rights violations to Shia Muslims around the world. If a media outlet, newspapers or blogs for example, reports on the violent acts and Anti-Shi'ist activities in a light that is honest, unbiased reporting, the organization contacts that media and thanks the author or other organization on the importance of reporting these violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1306/S00213/shia-rights-violation-by-yousef-al-qaradawi.htm |title=Shia Rights Violation By Yousef Al-Qaradawi &amp;#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization publicly condemns any reports that justifies violence or entire events itself, trying to raise awareness and bring the violations to the attention of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldshiaforum.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/shia-rights-watch-statement-save-the-lives-of-shia-muslims-and-shrines-in-syria/ |title=Shia Rights Watch Statement: Save the Lives of Shia Muslims and Shrines in Syria &amp;#124; World Shia Forum |publisher=Worldshiaforum.wordpress.com |date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reports ===

Each year, Shia Rights Watch publishes reports that document human rights violations committed against Shia Muslims as defined by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In 2012, SRW published five reports including one on [[Pakistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Malaysia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Indonesia]]. These reports include recommendations to the United States government with action steps for each specific country to move towards a more unbiased and peaceful government that does not exclude minorities, including religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abna.ir/print.asp?lang=3&amp;id=358029 |title=Saudi Shia Muslim Victims of Sectarian Isolationism: Shia Rights Watch |publisher=Abna.ir |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists, researchers, human rights activists and members of the United States government request to the organization, largely based on case studies and research, to obtain a copy.&lt;ref name="thenewstribe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/05/17/shia-rights-watch-to-release-report-highlighting-bahrains-atrocities/ |title=Shia Rights Watch to release report highlighting Bahrain’s ‘atrocities’ |publisher=The News Tribe |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political campaigning}}
A '''smear campaign''', also referred to as a '''smear tactic''' or simply a '''smear''', is an effort to damage or call into question someone's [[reputation]], by propounding negative [[propaganda]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} It can be applied to individuals or groups.

Common targets are public officials, [[politicians]], [[political candidate]]s, [[Activism|activists]] and ex-spouses. The term also applies in other contexts such as the workplace.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Jay C. Thomas, Michel Hersen (2002) Handbook of Mental Health in the Workplace&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''smear campaign'' became popular around 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Smear+campaign&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4;,Smear+campaign;,c0;,s0;;smear+campaign;,c0;;Smear+Campaign;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
A smear campaign is an intentional, premeditated effort to undermine an individual's or group's reputation, credibility, and [[Character assassination|character]]. Like [[negative campaigning]], most often smear campaigns target government officials, politicians, political candidates, and other public figures. However, private persons or groups may also become targets of smear campaigns perpetrated in  companies, institutions, the legal system, and other formal groups.

Smear tactics differ from normal discourse or debate in that they do not bear upon the issues or arguments in question. A smear is a simple attempt to malign a group or an individual with the aim of undermining their credibility.

Smears often consist of [[ad hominem]] attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and [[cognitive distortion|distortions]], [[half-truth]]s, or even outright [[lie]]s; smear campaigns are often propagated by [[gossip magazine]]s. Even when the facts behind a smear campaign are demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target's reputation is tarnished before the truth is known.

Smears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question and onto a specific individual or group. The target of the smear typically must focus on correcting the [[False accusation|false information]] rather than on the original issue.

Deflection has been described as a ''wrap-up smear'': "You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Pelosi, Nancy | date=2017-03-05 | title=State of the Union | medium=Television production | publisher=CNN | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1703/05/sotu.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smear tactics are considered by many to be a low, disingenuous form of discourse; they are nevertheless very common.

==Cluster B==
Smear campaigns have been identified as a common weapon of [[psychopaths]]&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junie Moon (2012) Surviving the Predators Among Us&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Borderline personality disorder|Borderlines]] and [[narcissists]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Nightshade (2016) ''A Pre-Book and a Victim's Guide to Surviving the Narcissist''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Burgo (2016). ''The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
In many countries, the law recognizes the value of reputation and credibility. Both [[Slander and libel|libel]] (a false and damaging publication) and slander (a false and damaging oral statement) are often punishable by law and may result in imprisonment or compensation or fees for damages done.

==Targets==
Smear tactics are commonly used to undermine effective arguments or critiques.

===John C. Frémont – 1856 US presidential election candidate===
{{Main article|John C. Frémont#Republican presidential candidate}}

During the 1856 presidential election, [[John C. Frémont]] was the target of a smear campaign alleging that he was a Catholic.  The campaign was designed to undermine support for Fremont from those who were suspicious of Catholics.

[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|"The Great Republican Reform Party Calling on their Candidate", an 1856 print which is a political cartoon about [[John C. Frémont]], the first Republican party candidate for president of the United States.

[[Ralph Nader]] was the victim of a smear campaign during the 1960s, when he was campaigning for car safety. In order to smear Nader and deflect public attention from his campaign, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] engaged private investigators to search for damaging or embarrassing incidents from his past. In early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''The New Republic'' and ''The New York Times'', reported that GM had tried to discredit Nader, hiring private detectives to [[telephone tapping|tap his phones]] and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longhine |first=Laura |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits—if it ever gets built |date = December 2005|work=Legal Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005-05-07 |work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.htm |title=President Dwight D.

Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the [[New York Court of Appeals]], whose opinion in the case expanded [[tort law]] to cover "overzealous surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;''Nader v. General Motors Corp.'', 307 N.Y.S.2d 647 (N.Y. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.

{{Main|Gary Hart#1988 presidential campaign}}

[[Gary Hart]] was the target of a smear campaign during the 1988 US presidential campaign.  Smear campaigns are a [[political strategy|campaign tactic]] associated with [[yellow journalism]] which is a type of journalism that presents little well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism.  For example, during [[Gary Hart]]'s 1988 presidential campaign, the ''New York Post'' reported on its front page big, black block letters: "GARY: I'M NO WOMANIZER."&lt;ref name=SafireVamping&gt;William Safire.

[[File:Питирим Сорокин.jpg |thumb| Pitirim Aleksandrovich Sorokin]] 
'''''Sociology of Revolution''''' is a book by [[Russian American]] sociologist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. '''Sociology of revolution''' as branch of [[sociology]] was developed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes: Leviathan – Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; to a certain extent earlier than Sorokin. Hobbes lived and created in the period of [[English Revolution]]. In the opinion by Hobbes, "the [[war]] of all against all" (''[[Bellum omnium contra omnes]]'') begins in the period of [[revolution]] and of [[Civil war|Civil War]], when all men threaten by each man, when each man has the right to all things by right of strong man, when "[[Man Is Wolf to Man]]" (''[[Homo homini lupus]]'') Sorokin had generalized the data about the new revolutions, unknowns for Hobbes – [[French Revolution]], [[Russian Revolution]] (1917), etc.

==Review==

[[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]] wrote in work  "The Working of Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;The sociology of revolution. By Pitirim A. Sorokin. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. 1925. Reviewed by Wilbur Cortez Abbott Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; that Sorokin has worked, so to speak, in a laboratory of revolution. Sorokin was, indeed, not able to set down his conclusions in Bolshevist Russia; Sorokin was banished from Russia in 1922, Sorokin wrote his book in the more hospitable atmosphere of Czecho-Slovakia". Sorokin was head of the department of sociology in the University of Petrograd, he was one of the leaders of the moderate revolutionary party, he was a member of the All-Russian Peasants' Soviet and of the [[Constituent assembly]] " in 1917-1918. Sorokin had been imprisoned three times, condemned to death and finally exiled by Bolshevist government for that. What is the result of his study of [[Russian revolution]]? Book of Sorokin is, briefly, the most damning indictment of Bolshevist regime. This book is a careful study of revolution in general. It is one of the best descriptions of revolution ever written—that of [[Thucydides]] on [[Corcyra]]—as it is with the events in France of the eighteenth century or Russia in the twentieth. Revolution is reversion of civilized people to savagery.

==History of creation==

The book ''Sociology of revolution'' was conceived by Sorokin in the years of [[Russian Civil War]] in 1917–1922. Sorokin started writing of this book in Prague in 1922. This book was published in the US in 1925.

Sorokin was entitled the privatdozent of Petrograd university in January, 1917 . Sorokin  became the editor of the newspaper of [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]   and the personal secretary of the prime minister [[Alexander Kerensky]] after [[February Revolution]]. Sorokin was arrested by [[Bolsheviks]] as the deputy of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] on January 2, 1918, Sorokin  was compelled to disappear from the authorities after release from bolshevist prison. Then Sorokin had published the open letter in newspaper  in which Sorokin states a failure of tactics of Socialist Revolutionary Party  and Sorokin declares a gap with this party. [[Vladimir Lenin]] focused the attention on this letter in the Lenin's known article "Valuable Recognitions of Pitirim Sorokin".&lt;ref&gt;Владимир Ленин "Ценные признания Питирима Сорокина"&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokin stopped being engaged in political activity and Sorokin  resumed own teaching activity. The authorities didn't like its devastating Sorokin's review about  work of [[Nikolai Bukharin]]  "The theory of a [[historical materialism]]". Later the set of the Sorokin's book "Hunger as a factor in Human Affairs" was destroyed. Sorokin  was arrested as the representative of "bourgeois professorate" and  forced out from Russia under the threat of execution in 1922. Sorokin appeared in the US for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;Сорокин П. А. Человек. Цивилизация. Общество.. — Политиздат, 1992 pages 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is revolution good or bad?==
[[File:Kustodiev The Bolshevik.jpg|thumb|300px|''Bolshevik'' (1920), by [[Boris Kustodiev]]]]
The [[theory]] of revolution was developed in [[Marxism]] too. Lenin's theory about the reasons for revolution, about the [[revolutionary situation]] resembles the Sorokin' theory partly, but theories of [[Lenin]] and Sorokin differ each other in the estimation of the value of this phenomenon as revolution sharply. Lenin considered that revolution is good; revolutions are "the festivals of the oppressed and the exploited".&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution. page 113&lt;/ref&gt; Revolution is only method for such revolutionaries as [[Marx]], [[Engels]] and Lenin to receive the authority without the elections, since the  capitalist dictatorship not allow a communist party to win in democractic elections. Marx named the revolutions as "the locomotives of [[history]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx The Class Struggles in France Chapter 3: Consequences of June 13, 1849&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokin and Hobbes considered that revolution is very bad. Sorokin considered that the revolution is the severe social illness, which can lead to death of [[social organism]] suddenly, that revolution is the worse method of an improvement of the life of masses. The revolutionaries promise to masses "gold mountains" in the words, but masses receive the [[hunger]], the [[epidemics]] and the executions of innocent people in reality. The negligible results of revolution are reached by enormous price.

Sorokin proposes other methods of improvement and reconstruction of the social organization:

* The peaceful [[reforms]], which don't jam the base instincts of man.
* Scientific research must precede to practical experiment.
* It need conduct the experiment on a low social scale at first.
* Reforms must be carried out by lawful and constitutional means

The conclusion: These canons are observed even under the erection of bridges and breeding of cattle. The inhabitant of distant planet, who observed the cataclysms of Russian revolution, could conclude that the cows and bridges are valued more expensively on the Earth than human life.

==The reasons of revolution==

For the comparison it is possible to give Lenin's opinion about the reasons for revolutionary situation:

{{quotation|What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms:

(1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the "upper classes", a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for "the lower classes not to want" to live in the old     way; it is also necessary that "the upper classes should be unable" to live in the old way;

(2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual;

(3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in "peace time", but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the "upper classes" themselves into independent historical action.|Lenin &lt;ref&gt;Vladimir  Ilyich  Lenin The Collapse of the Second International. Page 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sorokin named two reasons for the revolution:

* the suppression of base instincts at the majority of population.
* the disorganization of [[authority ]] and [[social control]].

Why does the suppression of base instincts lead to the revolution always? Because it forces  man to search the exit from the desperate condition. The hunger weakens the brakes, which retain by man from the theft, eating of low-quality food from the dustbin, robbery and murder.
The law-abiding citizen becomes thief and bandit because of the hunger, worker becomes beggar, the believer ceases to be fasted and aristocrat goes to the [[Market (place)|market]] to sell the trousers. The complete disappearance of brakes in the behavior of people can lead to the disintegration of the society, when man tears away "the framework" of civilized behavior completely and this man convert into the beast, which it is permitted all (the murder, violence, robbery).

==The kinds of the suppressed instincts as the first reason for the revolution==
[[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|Compare the ''[[sans-culotte]]'' on the left to the culotte-wearer on the right. Both wearing iconic Phrygian caps and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s]]
*  '''The hunger''', as the suppression of digestive [[instinct]]. Hunger preceded all revolutions, especially the hunger on the background of aristocratic gluttony on the feasts.
* '''The increase of [[poverty]]''', as the suppression of the impulse of [[property]]. The [[proletariat]] was poor as "church rat" in [[Russia]]. [[History]] piled the proletariat to "the bed from the nails". The revolutionary armies were comprised most frequently from the poor layers, which can not to lose something, but which can acquire all.
* '''The unsuccessful war and [[state terror]]''', as the suppression of the instinct of self-preservation. Unsuccessful wars precede revolutions. War converts soldiers into the being raged crowds of mad men. Specifically, this had occurred with the Russian soldiers in 1917 and with the German soldiers in 1918. Soldiers throw front and attack the [[government]] with the fury. Examples of these revolutions: The [[Commune of Paris]] after the Franco-Prussian War, Jaceria in [[France]] and uprising [[Wat Tyler]] in [[England]] after Centenary war, revolution 1905 in Russia after [[Russo-Japanese War]], [[February revolution]] 1917 in the end of [[World War I]].  Said  words can be attributed and to  despotic [[regime]]s, such regimes are "pregnant" by revolution  because of  [[state terrorism]] constantly.
*  '''The [[censorship]] and the prohibition to the [[human migration]]''', as the suppression of the impulse  to have of [[freedom of press]] and [[freedom of movement]].
*  '''The  limitations of [[estates of the realm]]''', as the suppression of the instinct of self-expression. The  limitations of estates of the realm prevented by people from the bottoms from engaging of high [[socioeconomic status]], which corresponds to their talents; therefore the innate ruler, who became simple workers, will become by the leader of secret organization, "[[Cicero]]" will become by propagandists.

These are the authentic reasons for revolution, and excuse can be completely different (the quarrel around the religious dogmas or convocation of General States). [[Ideology]] determines the selection of the slogans ("holy earth", "true faith", "republic" or "[[socialism]]"). Ideology determines the selection of popular heroes—[[Jesus Christ]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] or [[Karl Liebknecht]].  Ideology determines the selection of basic idea (interpretation of [[gospel]], national idea, the theory of [[surplus value]] or capitalist [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]). Ideology determines the selection of emblem ("red [[Phrygian cap]]" is the identification mark of French revolutionary—Jacobins, "black shirt" is form of the Italian fascists of Benito Mussolini, "pentagonal red star" is sign of membership in the Red Army).
What social groups do become revolutionary at first of all and why?
Those estates and social groups will be most revolutionary, which have the largest quantity of jammed instincts and, on the contrary, this estates and social groups will be enemies of revolution, which have not jammed instincts completely or which have a small quantity of jammed instincts. Therefore, Bolsheviks could keep on soldiers and workers by the revolutionary ideas easy, and aristocrats were against the revolution always. There were 95% of population on the side of the revolution in February 1917 in Russia, and then some social groups started opposing revolution escalation, these groups wanted that the government brought an order. Even peasants and sailors had risen against the [[Bolsheviks]] in [[Kronstadt]] In 1921. Soviet government had held the authority under these conditions only cause of the terrible fatigue from the cataclysms of Civil War and cause of  concessions in the form of the [[New Economic Policy]].

==The disorganization of authority  and social control as the second reason for revolution==

The disorganization of authority and social control means the incapacity of government to crush the rebellion, to remove the conditions, which cause the dissatisfaction of population, to cleave the mass on the part and to set them against each other by the principle "[[divide and rule]]", to direct the way out of energy for masses into another no-revolutionary "river's bed" according to the principle "to open the valve so that the boiler would not explode". The atmosphere of pre-revolutionary epochs amazes by observer with weakness of the authorities and with degeneration of the elite always. Chronicler Ipuwer wrote about the weakness of authority of [[pharaoh]]s on the eve of the Egyptian revolution of the epoch of average kingdom: "There is no ruler in the country. But where is ruler? Had ruler fallen asleep? Ruler had lost the force and ruler is not support to us". The same situation was in Russia in 1917. There was not one sane and imperious minister, ecrepit [[Ivan Goremykin]], incompetent [[Boris Stürmer]], mad [[Alexander Protopopov]] and mad  Vasily Virubov is the entire gallery of mediocre rulers and cynical dwarfs, this is the result of the complete degeneration of elite.  History "suffers" cruel and injurious governments until they are able to operate the state, but history will carry severe verdict  to powerless and parasitic governments. The degeneration of [[elite]] becomes inevitable, when elite converts into the [[caste]], when social "lifts" are switched off and way is closed for the innate rulers to upward with help of artificial barriers on the way of circulation into the members of elite. Talented premier-minister [[Sergei Witte]] was undergone dislike in side of [[Nicholas II of Russia]] repeatedly. When revolutionary explosion occurs, then pitiless revolutionary broom clears out entire social rubbish (aristocrats—degenerates). "Upstarts" from the bottoms rush to upward on the social ladder through the enormous slot in the social sieve of selection. This sieve exists on each floor of social ladder during the normal period of existence of society, when there is no revolution in society. Therefore, new elite builds the new "sieve" at the second stage of revolution, under protection of which the upstarts, who reached the social top, merge with the remainders of the old aristocracy, which are left for  transfer of experience of control over people. New Bolshevik "sieve" passed to upward only those, who were "from the machine tool" or "from the wooden plough", and new Bolshevik "sieve" rejected to downward all rest people.

==The second stage of revolution==

Revolution has two stages. There is a mad energy output at the first stage of revolution, but the person is not the Perpetuum mobile therefore  mass apathy and fatigue comes sooner or later. The vigorous group or the tyrant can seize power at the second stage of revolution easily, using this weakness and they can  restore an old [[regime]]. The second stage is a stage of "reaction" or "restraint".  Reasons generating this stage, are  strengthening of hunger, [[crime]], [[requisition]]s, [[epidemics]], "[[Bellum omnium contra omnes|wars of all against all]]". People face a dilemma: or to be lost, continuing revolutionary uproar, or to bring an order at any cost. Examples "creators of an order"  are  [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], [[John Zizka]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Augustus]], [[Napoleon]], who are able to bring an order "an iron fist"  after the period of revolutions or reforms.  Society which isn't capable to develop with help of peace reforms, is compelled to pay a tribute for revolution at a rate of considerable part of the population. It is possible to draw a conclusion that peace reform is much better, than a social revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16515">A '''statistical model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that embodies a set of [[statistical assumptions]] concerning the generation of some [[Sample (statistics)|sample data]] and similar data from a larger [[Statistical population|population]]. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.

The assumptions embodied by a statistical model describe a set of [[probability distribution]]s, some of which are assumed to adequately approximate the distribution from which a particular data set is sampled. The probability distributions inherent in statistical models are what distinguishes statistical models from other, non-statistical, mathematical models.

A statistical model is usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more [[random variables]] and possibly other non-random variables.  As such, a statistical model is "a formal representation of a theory" ([[Herman J. Adèr|Herman Adèr]] quoting [[Kenneth A. Bollen|Kenneth Bollen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adèr|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LCnOj4ZFyjkC&amp;pg=PA280 280]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis tests]] and all [[Estimator|statistical estimators]] are derived from statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of [[statistical inference]].

==Introduction==
Informally, a statistical model can be thought of as a [[statistical assumption]] (or set of statistical assumptions) with a certain property: that the assumption allows us to calculate the probability of any [[event (probability theory)|event]]. As an example, consider a pair of ordinary six-sided [[dice]]. We will study two different statistical assumptions about the dice.

The first statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) coming up is {{sfrac|1|6}}. From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 1:&amp;thinsp; {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|6}} × {{sfrac|1|6}}&amp;ensp;{{=}}}}&amp;ensp;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|36}}.&amp;thinsp;}} More generally, we can calculate the probability of any event: e.g. (1 and 2) or (3 and 3) or (4 and 6). 

The alternative statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of the face 1 coming up is {{sfrac|1|8}} (because the dice are [[Dice#Loaded_dice|weighted]]). From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 1:&amp;thinsp; {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|8}} × {{sfrac|1|8}}&amp;ensp;{{=}}}}&amp;ensp;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|64}}.&amp;thinsp;}} We cannot, however, calculate the probability of any other nontrivial event. 

The first statistical assumption constitutes a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we can calculate the probability of any event. The alternative statistical assumption does ''not'' constitute a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we cannot calculate the probability of every event.

In the example above, with the first assumption, calculating the probability of an event is easy. With some other examples, though, the calculation can be difficult, or even impractical (e.g. it might require millions of years of computation). For an assumption to constitute a statistical model, such difficulty is acceptable: doing the calculation does not need to be practicable, just theoretically possible.

==Formal definition==
In mathematical terms, a statistical model is usually thought of as a pair (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible observations, i.e. the [[sample space]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[probability distributions]] on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="McCullagh"&gt;{{Harvnb | McCullagh | 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intuition behind this definition is as follows.  It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution induced by the process that generates the observed data.  We choose &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; to represent a set (of distributions) which contains a distribution that adequately approximates the true distribution. Note that we do not require that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; contains the true distribution, and in practice that is rarely the case. Indeed, as Burnham &amp; Anderson state, "A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Burnham | Anderson | 2002 | loc= §1.2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;whence the saying "[[all models are wrong]]".

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is almost always parameterized: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; defines the [[Statistical parameter|parameters]] of the model. A parameterization is generally required to have distinct parameter values give rise to distinct distributions, i.e. &lt;math&gt;P_{\theta_1} = P_{\theta_2} \Rightarrow \theta_1 = \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; must hold (in other words, it must be [[Injective function|injective]]). A parameterization that meets the requirement is said to be ''[[Identifiability|identifiable]]''.&lt;ref name="McCullagh" /&gt;

==An example==
Suppose that we have a population of school children, with the ages of the children distributed [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly]], in the population. The height of a child will be [[stochastic]]ally related to the age: e.g. when we know that a child is of age 7, this influences the chance of the child being 5 feet tall. We could formalize that relationship in a [[linear regression]] model, like this: 
height&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;age&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intercept, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter that age is multiplied by in obtaining a prediction of height, ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the error term, and ''i'' identifies the child. This implies that height is predicted by age, with some error.

An admissible model must be consistent with all the data points.  Thus, a straight line (height&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;age&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) cannot be the equation for a model of the data—unless it exactly fits all the data points, i.e. all the data points lie perfectly on the line.  The error term, ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, must be included in the equation, so that the model is consistent with all the data points.

To do [[statistical inference]], we would first need to assume some probability distributions for the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  For instance, we might assume that the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; distributions are [[i.i.d.]] Gaussian, with zero mean.  In this instance, the model would have 3 parameters: ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the variance of the Gaussian distribution.

We can formally specify the model in the form (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;) as follows.  The sample space, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, of our model comprises the set of all possible pairs (age, height).  Each possible value of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) determines a distribution on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; denote that distribution by &lt;math&gt;P_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all possible values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;. (The parameterization is identifiable, and this is easy to check.)

In this example, the model is determined by (1) specifying &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and (2) making some assumptions relevant to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. There are two assumptions: that height can be approximated by a linear function of age; that errors in the approximation are distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian.  The assumptions are sufficient to specify &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash;as they are required to do.

==General remarks==
A statistical model is a special class of [[mathematical model]]. What distinguishes a statistical model from other mathematical models is that a statistical model is non-[[Deterministic system|deterministic]]. Thus, in a statistical model specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are [[Random variable|stochastic]]. In the example above, ε is a stochastic variable; without that variable, the model would be deterministic.

Statistical models are often used even when the physical process being modeled is deterministic. For instance, [[coin tossing]] is, in principle, a deterministic process; yet it is commonly modeled as stochastic (via a [[Bernoulli process]]).

There are three purposes for a statistical model, according to Konishi&amp;nbsp;&amp; Kitagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Konishi | Kitagawa | 2008 | loc= &amp;sect;1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimension of a model==
Suppose that we have a statistical model (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The model is said to be ''[[Parametric model|parametric]]'' if &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; has a finite dimension. In notation, we write that &lt;math&gt;\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|k}} is a positive integer (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[real numbers]]; other sets can be used, in principle).  Here, {{mvar|k}} is called the '''dimension''' of the model.

As an example, if we assume that data arise from a univariate [[Gaussian distribution]], then we are assuming that  
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\left\{P_{\mu,\sigma }(x) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp\left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) : \mu \in \mathbb{R}, \sigma &gt; 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this example, the dimension, {{mvar|k}}, equals 2.

As another example, suppose that the data consists of points ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}) that we assume are distributed according to a straight line with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals (with zero mean).  Then the dimension of the statistical model is 3: the intercept of the line, the slope of the line, and the variance of the distribution of the residuals.  (Note that in geometry, a straight line has [[dimension]] 1.)

Although formally &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \Theta&lt;/math&gt; is a single parameter that has dimension {{mvar|k}}, it is sometimes regarded as comprising {{mvar|k}} separate parameters. For example, with the univariate Gaussian distribution, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a single parameter with dimension 2, but it is sometimes regarded as comprising 2 separate parameters—the mean and the standard deviation.

A statistical model is [[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|''nonparametric'']] if the parameter set &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.  A statistical model is [[Semiparametric model|''semiparametric'']] if it has both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional parameters.  Formally, if {{mvar|k}} is the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|n}} is the number of samples, both semiparametric and nonparametric models have &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;k/n \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the model is semiparametric; otherwise, the model is nonparametric.

Parametric models are by far the most commonly used statistical models. Regarding semiparametric and nonparametric models, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "These typically involve fewer assumptions of structure and distributional form but usually contain strong assumptions about independencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cox | 2006 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nested models==
{{distinguish|Multilevel models|}}
Two statistical models are '''nested''' if the first model can be transformed into the second model by imposing constraints on the parameters of the first model. As an example, the set of all Gaussian distributions has, nested within it, the set of zero-mean Gaussian distributions: we constrain the mean in the set of all Gaussian distributions to get the zero-mean distributions. As a second example, the quadratic model 
:{{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ε&amp;nbsp;~ 𝒩(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} 
has, nested within it, the linear model 
:{{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+ ε,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ε&amp;nbsp;~ 𝒩(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}
—we constrain the parameter {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to equal 0.

In both those examples, the first model has a higher dimension than the second model (for the first example, the zero-mean model has dimension&amp;nbsp;1).  Such is often, but not always, the case.  As a different example, the set of positive-mean Gaussian distributions, which has dimension 2, is nested within the set of all Gaussian distributions.

==Comparing models==
{{main | Model selection}}
It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution underlying the observed data, induced by the process that generated the data. The main goal of [[model selection]] is to make statements about which elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; are most likely to adequately approximate the true distribution.

Models can be compared to each other by [[exploratory data analysis]] or [[confirmatory data analysis]]. In exploratory analysis, a variety of models are formulated and an assessment is performed of how well each one describes the data. In confirmatory analysis, a previously formulated model or models are compared to the data. Common criteria for comparing models include [[Coefficient of determination|''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Bayes factor]], and the [[likelihood-ratio test]] together with its generalization [[Likelihood function#Relative likelihood|relative likelihood]].

Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state: "The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling. They are typically formulated as comparisons of several statistical models."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Konishi | Kitagawa | 2008 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cox | 2006 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure''' is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or [[system]], or the object or system so organized.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=structure, n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=Online |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/191895?rskey=pTgPk1&amp;amp;result=1|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material structures include man-made objects such as [[building]]s and [[machine]]s and natural objects such as [[organism|biological organisms]], [[mineral]]s and [[chemical substance|chemicals]]. Abstract structures include [[data structure]]s in [[computer science]] and [[musical form]]. Types of structure include a [[hierarchy]] (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a [[Complex network|network]] featuring many-to-many [[Link (geometry)|link]]s, or a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.

== Load-bearing ==
[[File:Sámi storehouse.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional [[Sami people|Sami]] food storage structure]]
[[File:Voûte de l'église Saint-Séverin à Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|Gothic quadripartite cross-ribbed vaults of the [[Saint-Séverin]] church in Paris]]
Buildings, aircraft, skeletons, anthills, beaver dams and salt domes are all examples of [[Structural load|load]]-bearing structures. The results of [[construction]] are divided into [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure|non-building structure]]s, and make up the [[infrastructure]] of a human society. Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards, into [[Structural engineering#Specializations|categories]] including building structures, [[architectural structure]]s, civil engineering structures and mechanical structures.

The effects of loads on physical structures are determined through [[structural analysis]], which is one of the tasks of [[structural engineering]]. The [[Structural engineering#Structural elements|structural elements]] can be classified as one-dimensional ([[rope]]s, [[strut]]s, [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[arch]]es), two-dimensional ([[membrane]]s, plates, [[Concrete slab|slab]], [[Shell (structure)|shells]], [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]]), or three-dimensional (solid masses).&lt;ref name=Carpinter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carpinteri|first1=Alberto|title=Structural Mechanics: A unified approach|date=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203474952}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The latter was the main option available to early structures such as [[Chichen Itza]]. A one-dimensional element has one dimension much larger than the other two, so the other dimensions can be neglected in calculations; however, the ratio of the smaller dimensions and the composition can determine the [[Flexural rigidity|flexural]] and [[Compressive strength|compressive]] stiffness of the element. Two-dimensional elements with a thin third dimension have little of either but can resist biaxial traction.&lt;ref name=Carpinter/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

The structure elements are combined in ''structural systems''. The majority of everyday load-bearing structures are ''section-active'' structures like frames, which are primarily composed of one-dimensional (bending) structures. Other types are ''Vector-active'' structures such as [[truss]]es, ''surface-active'' structures such as shells and folded plates, ''form-active'' structures such as cable or membrane structures, and hybrid structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knippers|first1=Jan|last2=Cremers|first2=Jan|last3=Gabler|first3=Markus|last4=Lienhard|first4=Julian|title=Construction manual for polymers + membranes : materials, semi-finished products, form-finding design|date=2011|publisher=Institut für internationale Architektur-Dokumentation|location=München|isbn=9783034614702|edition=Engl. transl. of the 1. German}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134–136}}

Load-bearing biological structures such as bones, teeth, shells, and tendons derive their strength from a multilevel hierarchy of structures employing biominerals and [[protein]]s, at the bottom of which are [[collagen|collagen fibrils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Z.|last2=Zhang|first2=Y.-W.|last3=Gao|first3=H.|title=On optimal hierarchy of load-bearing biological materials|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=1 September 2010|volume=278|issue=1705|pages=519–525|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1093|pmid=20810437|pmc=3025673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Biological organisation}}

In [[biology]], structures exist at all levels of organization, ranging hierarchically from the [[atom]]ic and [[molecular]] to the [[cell (biology)|cellular]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[organism]]ic, [[population]] and [[ecosystem]] level. Usually, a higher-level structure is composed of multiple copies of a lower-level structure.

[[Structural biology]] is concerned with the [[biomolecular structure]] of [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banaszak|first1=Leonard J.|title=Foundations of Structural Biology.|date=2000|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080521848}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of these molecules is determined by their shape as well as their composition, and their structure has multiple levels. [[Protein structure]] has a four-level hierarchy. The ''[[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]'' is the sequence of [[amino acid]]s that make it up. It has a [[peptide]] backbone made up of a repeated sequence of a nitrogen and two carbon atoms. The ''[[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]]'' consists of repeated patterns determined by [[hydrogen bonding]]. The two basic types are the [[alpha helix|α-helix]] and the [[beta sheet|β-pleated sheet]]. The ''[[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]'' is a back and forth bending of the polypeptide chain, and the ''[[Protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]'' is the way that tertiary units come together and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=William K.|last2=Sadava|first2=David E.|last3=Orians|first3=Gordon H.|last4=H.

[[File:Dopamin - Dopamine.svg|thumb|right|A skeletal formula for [[dopamine]]]]
Chemical structure refers to both molecular geometry and electronic structure. The structure can be represented by a variety of diagrams called [[structural formula]]s. [[Lewis structure]]s use a dot notation to represent the [[valence electron]]s for an atom; these are the electrons that determine the role of the atom in chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeKock|first1=Roger L.|last2=Gray|first2=Harry B.|title=Chemical structure and bonding|date=1989|publisher=University Science Books|location=Mill Valley, Calif.|isbn=9780935702613|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71–72}} Bonds between atoms can be represented by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared. In a simplified version of such a diagram, called a [[skeletal formula]], only carbon-carbon bonds and functional groups are shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Graham C.|last2=Holman|first2=John S.|title=Chemistry in context|date=2000|publisher=Nelson|location=Walton-on-Thames|isbn=9780174482765|page=391|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atoms in a crystal have a [[crystal structure|structure]] that involves repetition of a basic unit called a ''unit cell''. The atoms can be modeled as points on a [[Bravais lattice|lattice]], and one can explore the effect of  [[symmetry]] operations that include rotations about a point, reflections about a symmetry planes, and ''[[translation (geometry)|translations]]'' (movements of all the points by the same amount).

== Social ==
{{Main|Social structure}}

A social structure is a pattern of relationships. They are social [[organization]]s of individuals in various life situations. Structures are applicable to people in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships. This is known as the social organization of the group. Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups. [[Structure and agency]] are two confronted theories about human behaviour.  The debate surrounding the influence of structure and agency on human thought is one of the central issues in sociology. In this context, ''agency'' refers to the individual human capacity to act independently and make free choices. ''Structure'' here refers to factors such as [[social class]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], customs, etc. that seem to limit or influence individual opportunities.

In software architecture, the structure of software is the way in which it is partitioned into interrelated components. A key structural issue is minimizing dependencies between these components. This makes it possible to change one component without requiring changes in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorton|first1=Ian|title=Essential software architecture|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783642191763|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The structure can be represented in diagrams such as the [[Control Structure Diagram]] and the [[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diehl|first1=Stephan|title=Software visualization : visualizing the structure, behaviour, and evolution of software ; with 5 tables|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540465041|pages=38–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural elements reflect the requirements of the application: for example, if the system requires a high fault tolerance, then a redundant structure is needed so that if a component fails it has backups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernardi|first1=Simona|last2=Merseguer|first2=José|last3=Petriu|first3=Dorina Corina|title=Model-Driven Dependability Assessment of Software Systems|date=2013|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642395123|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high redundancy is an essential part of the design of several systems in the [[Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computers in the Space Shuttle Avionics System|url=https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch4-4.html|website=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical ==
As a branch of philosophy, [[logic]] is concerned with distinguishing good arguments from poor ones. A chief concern is with the structure of arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Structure of Arguments|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/structure.html|website=Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic|publisher=philosophy.lander.edu|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument consists of one or more [[premise]]s from which a conclusion is [[inference|inferred]].&lt;ref name=Kemerling&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemerling|first1=Garth|title=Arguments and Inference|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e01.htm|website=The Philosophy Pages|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steps in this inference can be expressed in a formal way and their structure analyzed. Two basic types of inference are [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. In a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] deduction, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, regardless of whether they are true or not. An invalid deduction contains some error in the analysis. An inductive argument claims that if the premises are true, the conclusion is likely.&lt;ref name=Kemerling/&gt;

{{Platonism}}

The &lt;!-- "theory" lowercase as in all other theories--&gt;'''theory of Forms''' or '''theory of Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas", but the latter has a long and respect tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too.  See W. D. Ross, Plato's ''Theory of Ideas'' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This quote has to be checked including the erroneous volume no. (there are only 2), the missing page number, and the uppercase "theory"--&gt; The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. However, it is attributed to Plato without any direct textual evidence that Plato himself holds the views of the speakers of the dialogues. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Ideas:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}..., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | page=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself". See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; is a viewpoint attributed to [[Plato]], which holds that non-physical (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) forms (or ideas)&lt;!--not uppercase here because normal English words modified by the descriptive "abstract"--&gt; represent the most accurate reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.''&lt;/ref&gt; When used in this sense, the word ''form''&lt;!-- but not the article--&gt; or ''idea'' is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). Encyclopædia Britannica (1952), p. 526–542. This source states that ''Form'' or ''Idea'' get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily [[Socrates]]) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Even whether the theory represents Plato's own views is held in doubt by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5-7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=1-85326-483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theory is considered [[Platonic realism|a classical solution]] to the [[problem of universals]].

The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. 

==Forms&lt;!--linked from 'Third man argument'--&gt;==
The meaning of the term {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} (''eidos''), "visible form", and related terms μορφή (''morphē''), "shape",&lt;ref&gt;Possibly cognate with Sanskrit ''bráhman''. See Thieme (1952): ''Bráhman'', ZDMG, vol. 102, p. 128.{{cite web | title=ZDMG online | url=http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/93820}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and φαινόμενα (''phainomena''), "appearances", from φαίνω (''phainō''), "shine", [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰeh₂-|''*bʰeh₂-'']]'' or ''*bhā-''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=*bhā- | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition: Appendix I | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained stable over the centuries until the beginning of philosophy, when they became equivocal, acquiring additional specialized philosophic meanings. The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], starting with [[Thales]], noted that appearances change, and began to ask what the thing that changes "really" is. The answer was [[Substance theory|substance]], which stands under the changes and is the actually existing thing being seen. The status of appearances now came into question. What is the form really and how is that related to substance?

Thus, the theory of matter and form (today's [[hylomorphism]]) was born. Starting with at least Plato and possibly germinal in some of the presocratics the forms were considered as being "in" something else, which Plato called nature (''physis''). The latter seemed as carved "wood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.G. |last=Liddell |first2=R. |last2=Scott |first3=J.M. |last3=Whiton |year=1891 |title=A Lexicon Abridged From Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Harper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;pg=PA725 |page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; ὕλη (''hyle'') in [[Greek language|Greek]], corresponding to ''materia'' in [[Latin]], from which the English word "[[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]" is derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=matter | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/51/M0155100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; shaped by receiving (or exchanging) forms.

The Forms are expounded upon in Plato's dialogues and general speech, in that every object or quality in reality has a form: dogs, human beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and goodness. Form answers the question, "What is that?" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is. He supposed that the object was essentially or "really" the Form and that the phenomena were mere shadows mimicking the Form; that is, momentary portrayals of the Form under different circumstances. [[The problem of universals]] – how can one thing in general be many things in particular – was solved by presuming that Form was a distinct singular thing but caused plural representations of itself in particular objects. For example, [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] states, "Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed."&lt;ref name="Parmenides"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p129}} Matter is considered particular in itself. For Plato, forms, such as beauty, are more real than any objects that imitate them. Though the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in a constant change of existence. Where forms are unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D. (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor, {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Forms are the essences of various objects: they are that without which a thing would not be the kind of thing it is. For example, there are countless tables in the world but the Form of tableness is at the core; it is the essence of all of them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 389: "For neither does every smith, although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all of the same iron. The form must be the same, but the material may vary ...."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Socrates held that the world of Forms is transcendent to our own world (the world of substances) and also is the essential basis of reality. Super-ordinate to matter, Forms are the most pure of all things. Furthermore, he believed that true knowledge/intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' 185d–e: "...the mind in itself is its own instrument for contemplating the common terms that apply to everything." "Common terms" here refers to ''existence, non-existence, likeness, unlikeness, sameness, difference, unity'' and ''number''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is ''aspatial'' (transcendent to space) and ''atemporal'' (transcendent to time). Atemporal means that it does not exist within any time period, rather it provides the formal basis for time.  It therefore formally grounds beginning, persisting and ending. It is neither eternal in the sense of existing forever, nor mortal, of limited duration. It exists transcendent to time altogether.&lt;ref&gt;The creation of the universe is the creation of time: "For there were no days and nights and months and years ... but when he (God) constructed the heaven he created them also." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 37. For the creation God used "the pattern of the unchangeable," which is "that which is eternal." — paragraph 29. Therefore "eternal" – ''to aïdion'', "the everlasting" – as applied to Form means atemporal.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms are aspatial in that they have no spatial dimensions, and thus no orientation in space, nor do they even (like the point) have a location.&lt;ref&gt;Space answers to matter, the place-holder of form: "... and there is a third nature (besides Form and form), which is space (chōros), and is eternal (aei "always", certainly not atemporal), and admits not of destruction and provides a home for all created things ... we say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy space ...." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 52. Some readers will have long since remembered that in Aristotle time and space are accidental forms. Plato does not make this distinction and concerns himself mainly with essential form. In Plato, if time and space were admitted to be form, time would be atemporal and space aspatial.&lt;/ref&gt; They are non-physical, but they are not in the mind. Forms are extra-mental (i.e. real in the strictest sense of the word).&lt;ref&gt;These terms produced with the English prefix a- are not ancient. For the usage refer to {{cite web | title=a- (2) | work=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=a- }} They are however customary terms of modern metaphysics; for example, see {{cite book | first=Martha C. | last=Beck | title=Plato's Self-Corrective Development of the Concepts of Soul, Form and Immortality in Three Arguments of the Phaedo | publisher=Edwin Mellon Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-7734-7950-3 | page=148 }} and see {{cite book | first=Dr. Katherine | last=Hawley | title=How Things Persist | year=2001 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-924913-X | nopp=true | page=Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is an objective "blueprint" of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 28: "The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect ...."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forms are perfect themselves because they are unchanging.  For example, say we have a triangle drawn on a blackboard.  A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.  The triangle as it is on the blackboard is far from perfect.  However, it is only the intelligibility of the Form "triangle" that allows us to know the drawing on the chalkboard is a triangle, and the Form "triangle" is perfect and unchanging. It is exactly the same whenever anyone chooses to consider it; however, the time is that of the observer and not of the triangle.

=== Etymology ===
The words, εἶδος (''eidos'') and ἰδέα (''idea'') come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [[Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/weyd-|''*weyd-'']] or ''*weid-'' "see" (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''vétti''). ''Eidos'' (though not ''idea'') is already attested in texts of the [[Homer|Homeric]] era, the earliest Greek literature. This transliteration and the translation tradition of German and Latin lead to the expression "theory of Ideas." The word is however not the English "idea," which is a mental concept only.

===Terminology===
[[File:Allegory of the Cave blank.png|thumb|In the [[Allegory of the Cave]], the objects that are seen are not real, according to Plato, but literally mimic the real Forms.]]
The English word "form" may be used to translate two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward "form" or appearance of something, and "Form" in a new, technical nature, that never&lt;blockquote&gt;...assumes a form  like that of any of the things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses  of real existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner....&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aLnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 Plato's ''Republic'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The objects that are seen, according to [[Plato]], are not real, but literally ''mimic'' the real Forms. In the [[Allegory of the Cave]] expressed in ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows of the real things, which are not perceived directly. That which the observer understands when he views the world mimics the [[archetype]]s of the many [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (that is, of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]) of things observed.

===Intelligible realm and separation of the Forms===
Plato often invokes, particularly in his dialogues ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''Republic'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', poetic language to illustrate the mode in which the Forms are said to exist. Near the end of the ''Phaedo'', for example, Plato describes the world of Forms as a pristine region of the physical universe located above the surface of the Earth (''Phd.'' 109a-111c). In the ''Phaedrus'' the Forms are in a "place beyond heaven" (''huperouranios topos'') (''Phdr.'' 247c ff); and in the ''Republic'' the sensible world is contrasted with the intelligible realm (''noēton topon'') in the famous Allegory of the Cave.

It would be a mistake to take Plato's imagery as positing the intelligible world as a literal physical space apart from this one.&lt;ref&gt;"No sensible man would insist that these things are as I have described them..." (''Phd.'' 114d).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"there is no Platonic 'elsewhere', similar to the Christian 'elsewhere'." ([[Iris Murdoch]], "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals" (London, Chatto &amp; Windus 1992)  399).&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato emphasizes that the Forms are not beings that extend in space (or time), but subsist apart from any physical space whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/#3 Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we read in the ''Symposium'' of the Form of Beauty: "It is not anywhere in another thing, as in an animal, or in earth, or in heaven, or in anything else, but itself by itself with itself," (211b). And in the ''Timaeus'' Plato writes: "Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, ''nor itself enters into anything anywhere'', is one thing," (52a, emphasis added).

===Ideal state===
{{original research|date=February 2016}}
According to Plato, Socrates postulated a world of ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know. Nevertheless, he formulated a very specific description of that world, which did not match his metaphysical principles. Corresponding to the world of Forms is our world, that of the shadows, an imitation of the real one.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Analogy of the Cave, Rep. 514a–520a.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as shadows exist only because of the light of a fire, our world exists as, "the offspring of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, 508b trans. Grube&lt;/ref&gt; Our world is modeled after the patterns of the Forms. The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.e. acting morally.

Plato lays out much of this theory in the "Republic" where, in an  attempt to define Justice, he considers many topics including the constitution of the ideal state. While this state, and the Forms, do not exist on earth, because their imitations do, Plato says we are able to form certain well-founded opinions about them, through a theory called recollection.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Phaedo, Meno, Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt;

The republic is a greater imitation of Justice:&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our aim in founding the state was not the disproportional happiness of any one class,&lt;ref&gt;The word is ''ethnos'', "people". For the full range of meanings consult the [[American Heritage Dictionary]] online under [http://www.bartleby.com/61/88/E0228800.html ethnic].&lt;/ref&gt; but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a state ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key to not know how such a state might come into existence is the word "founding" (''oikidzomen''), which is used of colonization.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} It was customary in such instances to receive a constitution from an elected or appointed lawgiver; however in Athens, lawgivers were appointed to reform the constitution from time to time (for example, [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], [[Solon]]). In speaking of reform, Socrates uses the word "purge" (''diakathairountes'')&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 399e line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same sense that Forms exist purged of matter.

The purged society is a regulated one presided over by philosophers educated by the state, who maintain three non-hereditary classes&lt;ref&gt;"Types" (''genē'') rather than the English economic classes or the favored populations of the real Greek cities.&lt;/ref&gt; as required: the tradesmen (including merchants and professionals), the guardians (militia and police) and the philosophers (legislators, administrators and the philosopher-king). Class is assigned at the end of education, when the state institutes individuals in their occupation. Socrates expects class to be hereditary but he allows for mobility according to natural ability. The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English "intelligence") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.

The views of Socrates on the proper order of society are certainly contrary to Athenian values of the time and must have produced a shock effect, intentional or not, accounting for the animosity against him. For example, reproduction is much too important to be left in the hands of untrained individuals: "... the possession of women and the procreation of children ... will ... follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The family is therefore to be abolished and the children – whatever their parentage – to be raised by the appointed mentors of the state.

Their genetic fitness is to be monitored by the physicians: "... he ([[Asclepius]], a culture hero) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or have weak fathers begetting weaker sons – if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians minister to the healthy rather than cure the sick: "... (Physicians) will minister to better natures, giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing at all in Greek medicine so far as can be known supports the airy (in the Athenian view) propositions of Socrates. Yet it is hard to be sure of Socrates' real views considering that there are no works written by Socrates himself. There are two common ideas pertaining to the beliefs and character of Socrates: the first being the Mouthpiece Theory where writers use Socrates in dialogue as a mouthpiece to get their own views across. However, since most of what we know about Socrates comes from plays, most of the Platonic plays are accepted as the more accurate Socrates since Plato was a direct student of Socrates.

Perhaps the most important principle is that just as the Good must be supreme so must its image, the state, take precedence over individuals in everything. For example, guardians "... will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never, under the influence either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 412.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of requiring guardians of guardians perhaps suffers from the Third Man weakness (see below): guardians require guardians require guardians, ad infinitum. The ultimate trusty guardian is missing. Socrates does not hesitate to face governmental issues many later governors have found formidable: "Then if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the state should be the persons, and they ... may be allowed to lie for the public good."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's conception of Forms actually differs from dialogue to dialogue, and in certain respects it is never fully explained, so many aspects of the theory are open to interpretation. Forms are first introduced in the Phaedo, but in that dialogue the concept is simply referred to as something the participants are already familiar with, and the theory itself is not developed. Similarly, in the Republic, Plato relies on the concept of Forms as the basis of many of his arguments but feels no need to argue for the validity of the theory itself or to explain precisely what Forms are. Commentators have been left with the task of explaining what Forms are and how visible objects participate in them, and there has been no shortage of disagreement. Some scholars advance the view that Forms are paradigms, perfect examples on which the imperfect world is modeled. Others interpret Forms as universals, so that the Form of Beauty, for example, is that quality that all beautiful things share. Yet others interpret Forms as "stuffs," the conglomeration of all instances of a quality in the visible world. Under this interpretation, we could say there is a little beauty in one person, a little beauty in another—all the beauty in the world put together is the Form of Beauty. Plato himself was aware of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his Theory of Forms, as is evident from the incisive criticism he makes of his own theory in the Parmenides.

==Evidence of Forms==
Plato's main evidence for the existence of Forms is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] only and is as follows.

===Human perception===
We call both the sky and blue jeans by the same color, blue. However, clearly a pair of jeans and the sky are not the same color; moreover, the wavelengths of light reflected by the sky at every location and all the millions of blue jeans in every state of fading constantly change, and yet we somehow have a consensus of the basic form Blueness as it applies to them. Says Plato:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] in ''Metaphysics'' Α987a.29–b.14 and Μ1078b9–32 says that Plato devised the Forms to answer a weakness in the doctrine of [[Heraclitus]], who held that nothing exists, but everything is in a state of flow. If nothing exists then nothing can be known. It is possible that Plato took the Socratic search for definitions and extrapolated it into a distinct metaphysical theory. Little is known of the historical Socrates' own views, but the theory of Forms is likely a Platonic innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known: but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process of flux, as we were just now supposing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge of the forms must be the memory of our initial acquaintance with the forms in heaven. Therefore, what we seem to learn is in fact just remembering.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D, (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor. {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfection===
No one has ever seen a [[Perfection|perfect]] circle, nor a perfectly straight line, yet everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato utilizes the tool-maker's blueprint as evidence that Forms are real:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the material ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perceived circles or lines are not exactly circular or straight, and true circles and lines could never be detected since by definition they are sets of infinitely small points. But if the perfect ones were not real, how could they direct the manufacturer?

==Criticisms of Platonic Forms==
===Self-criticism===
Plato was well aware of the limitations of the theory, as he offered  his own criticisms of it in his dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']].  There Socrates is portrayed as a young philosopher acting as junior counterfoil to aged Parmenides. To a certain extent it is tongue-in-cheek as the older Socrates will have solutions to some of the problems  that are made to puzzle the younger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The dialogue does present a very real difficulty with the Theory of Forms, which Plato most likely only viewed as problems for later thought. These criticisms were later emphasized by [[Aristotle]] in rejecting an independently existing world of Forms. It is worth noting that Aristotle was a pupil and then a junior colleague of Plato; it is entirely possible that the presentation of ''Parmenides'' "sets up" for Aristotle; that is, they agreed to disagree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

One difficulty lies in the conceptualization of the "participation" of an object in a form (or Form). The young Socrates conceives of his solution to the problem of the universals in another metaphor, which though wonderfully apt, remains to be elucidated:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But exactly how is a Form like the day in being everywhere at once? The solution calls for a distinct form, in which the particular instances, which are not identical to the form, participate; i.e., the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places. The concept of "participate", represented in Greek by more than one word, is as obscure in Greek as it is in English. Plato hypothesized that distinctness meant existence as an independent being, thus opening himself to the famous [[third man argument]] of Parmenides,&lt;ref&gt;The name is from [[Aristotle]], who says in ''Metaphysics'' A.IX.990b.15: "(The argument) they call the third man." A summary of the argument and the quote from Aristotle can be found in the venerable {{Cite journal | first=George | last=Grote | author-link=George Grote | contribution=App I Aristotle's Objections to Plato's Theory  | title=Aristotle: Second Edition with Additions | year=1880 | pages=559–60 note b | place=London | publisher=John Murray }} (downloadable Google Books). Grote points out that Aristotle lifted this argument from the ''Parmenides'' of Plato; certainly, his words indicate the argument was already well-known under that name.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves that forms cannot independently exist and be participated.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of the argument has been going on for quite a number of centuries now and some analyses are complex, technical and perhaps tedious for the general reader. Those who are interested in the more technical analyses can find more of a presentation in {{cite journal | last=Hales | first=Steven D. |  title=The Recurring Problem of the Third Man | journal=Auslegung | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=67–80 | year=1991 | url=http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf }} and {{cite journal | last=Durham | first=Michael | title=Two Men and the Third Man | journal=The Dualist: Undergraduate Journal of Philosophy (Stanford University) | volume=4 | year=1997 | url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/durham.pdf | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If universal and particulars – say man or greatness – all exist and are the same then the Form is not one but is multiple. If they are only like each other then they contain a form that is the same and others that are different. Thus if we presume that the Form and a particular are alike then there must be another, or third Form, man or greatness by possession of which they are alike. An [[infinite regress]]ion would then result; that is, an endless series of third men. The ultimate participant, greatness, rendering the entire series great, is missing. Moreover, any Form is not unitary but is composed of infinite parts, none of which is the proper Form.

The young Socrates (some may say the young Plato) did not give up the Theory of Forms over the Third Man but took another tack, that the particulars do not exist as such. Whatever they are, they "mime" the Forms, appearing to be particulars. This is a clear dip into [[Representative realism|representationalism]], that we cannot observe the objects as they are in themselves but only their representations. That view has the weakness that if only the mimes can be observed then the real Forms cannot be known at all and the observer can have no idea of what the representations are supposed to represent or that they are representations.

Socrates' later answer would be that men already know the Forms because they were in the world of Forms before birth. The mimes only recall these Forms to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Plato to a large extent identifies what today is called [[insight]] with recollection: "whenever on seeing one thing you conceived another whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of recollection?" — ''[[Phaedo]]'', paragraph 229. Thus geometric reasoning on the part of persons who know no geometry is not insight but is  recollection. He does recognize insight: "... with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem ..." (with regard to "the course of scrutiny") — ''[[The Seventh Letter]]'' 344b. Unfortunately the hidden world can in no way be verified in this world and its otherworldness can only be a matter of speculation. Plato was aware of the problem: "How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I suspect, beyond you and me." — ''[[Cratylus]]'', paragraph 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  The comedian [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[The Clouds]]'', poking fun of Socrates with his head in the clouds.

===Aristotelian criticism===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).  Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his belief in the higher Forms, while Aristotle disagrees and points downwards to the here-and-now, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
The topic of Aristotle's criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms is a large one and continues to expand. Rather than quote Plato, Aristotle often summarized. Classical commentaries thus recommended Aristotle as an introduction to Plato. As a historian of prior thought, Aristotle was invaluable, however this was secondary to his own dialectic and in some cases he treats purported implications as if Plato had actually mentioned them, or even defended them. In examining Aristotle's criticism of The Forms, it is helpful to understand Aristotle's own [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic forms]], by which he intends to salvage much of Plato's theory.

In the summary passage quoted above&lt;ref name=summ&gt;Paragraph 50 a–c, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato distinguishes between real and non-real "existing things", where the latter term is used of substance. The figures that the artificer places in the gold are not substance, but gold is. Aristotle stated that, for Plato, all things studied by the sciences have Form and asserted that Plato considered only substance to have Form. Uncharitably, this leads him to something like a contradiction: Forms existing as the objects of science, but not-existing as non-substance. Scottish philosopher [[W.D. Ross]] objects to this as a mischaracterization of Plato.&lt;ref name=rossXI&gt;Ross, Chapter XI, initial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato did not claim to know where the line between Form and non-Form is to be drawn. As Cornford points out,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; those things about which the young Socrates (and Plato) asserted "I have often been puzzled about these things"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', paragraph 130c.&lt;/ref&gt; (in reference to Man, Fire and Water), appear as Forms in later works. However, others do not, such as Hair, Mud, Dirt. Of these, Socrates is made to assert, "it would be too absurd to suppose that they have a Form."

Ross&lt;ref name=rossXI/&gt; also objects to Aristotle's criticism that Form Otherness accounts for the differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By one way in which he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from "A is not B" to "A is Not-B." Otherness would only apply to its own particulars and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only ''particulars'' of Form Otherness that somehow ''suppress'' Form Greek.

Regardless of whether Socrates meant the particulars of Otherness yield Not-Greek, Not-tall, Not-beautiful, etc., the particulars would operate specifically rather than generally, each somehow yielding only one exclusion.

Plato had postulated that we know Forms through a remembrance of the soul's [[metempsychosis|past lives]] and Aristotle's arguments against this treatment of [[epistemology]] are compelling. For Plato, particulars somehow do not exist, and, on the face of it, "that which is non-existent cannot be known".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' 71b.25.&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' III 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;Book III Chapters 3–4, paragraphs 999a ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Three Laws of Robotics''' (often shortened to '''The Three Laws''' or known as '''Asimov's Laws''') are a set of rules devised by the [[science fiction]] author [[Isaac Asimov]]. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" (included in the 1950 collection ''[[I, Robot]]''), although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws, quoted as being from the "Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.", are:
# '''First Law''' - A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# '''Second Law''' - A robot must obey the orders &lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt;{{sic|given it|expected=given to it|hide=y}}&lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt; by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# '''Third Law''' - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;ref name=IROBOT &gt;{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=I, Robot |date=1950 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York City |isbn=0-385-42304-7 |page=40 |edition=The Isaac Asimov Collection |language=English |format=hardcover |chapter=Runaround |quote=This is an ''exact'' transcription of the laws. They also appear in the front of the book, and in both places there is ''no'' "to" in the 2nd law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These form an organizing principle and unifying theme for Asimov's [[robot]]ic-based fiction, appearing in his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], the stories linked to it, and his [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'' series]] of [[young adult literature|young-adult fiction]]. The Laws are incorporated into almost all of the [[positronic brain|positronic robots]] appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often [[parody|parodic]], appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.

The original laws have been altered and elaborated on by Asimov and other authors. Asimov himself made slight modifications to the first three in various books and short stories to further develop how robots would interact with humans and each other. In later fiction where robots had taken responsibility for government of whole planets and human civilizations, Asimov also added a fourth, or zeroth law, to precede the others:

# &lt;li value="0"&gt;A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

The Three Laws, and the zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media, and have impacted thought on [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] as well.

==History==
In ''The Rest of the Robots'', published in 1964, Asimov noted that when he began writing in 1940 he felt that "one of the stock plots of science fiction was&amp;nbsp;... robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?" He decided that in his stories robots would not "turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of [[Faust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Rest of the Robots| publisher=Doubleday| year=1964| isbn=0-385-09041-2| chapter=Introduction| author=Isaac Asimov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 1939, Asimov attended a meeting of the [[Queens]] ([[New York (state)|New York]]) Science Fiction Society where he met [[Eando Binder|Earl and Otto Binder]] who had recently published a short story [[I, Robot (short story)|"I, Robot"]] featuring a sympathetic robot named [[Adam Link]] who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was the first of a series of ten stories; the next year "Adam Link's Vengeance" (1940) featured Adam thinking "A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=James Gunn (author)| last=Gunn| first=James| title=On Variations on a Robot| journal=[[Asimov's Science Fiction|IASFM]] |date=July 1980| pages=56–81}} Reprinted in {{cite book| title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction| year=1982| isbn=0-19-503060-5| author=James Gunn.| publisher=Oxford Univ. Pr.| location=Oxford u.a.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing "my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot", his 14th story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Memory Yet Green| publisher=Doubleday| year=1979| first=Isaac| last=Asimov| isbn=0-380-75432-0| page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later he took "[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]" to [[John W. Campbell]] the editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''. Campbell rejected it, claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to [[Lester del Rey]]'s "[[Helen O'Loy]]", published in December 1938; the story of a robot that is so much like a person that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp.236–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederik Pohl]] published "Robbie" in ''[[Astonishing Stories]]'' magazine the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov attributes the Three Laws to John W. Campbell, from a conversation that took place on 23 December 1940. Campbell claimed that Asimov had the Three Laws already in his mind and that they simply needed to be stated explicitly. Several years later Asimov's friend [[Randall Garrett]] attributed the Laws to a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] partnership between the two men&amp;nbsp;– a suggestion that Asimov adopted enthusiastically.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp. 285–7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his autobiographical writings, Asimov included the First Law's "inaction" clause because of [[Arthur Hugh Clough]]'s poem "[[The Latest Decalogue]]", which includes the satirical lines "Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive / officiously to keep alive".&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1979). In Memory Yet Green. Doubleday. Chapters 21 through 26 {{ISBN|0-380-75432-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Asimov pins the creation of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, "[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]" and "[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]". He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]". When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology ''[[I, Robot]]'', "Reason" and "Robbie" were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to "Reason" is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Patrouch| first=Joseph F.| title=The Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov| publisher=Doubleday| year=1974| isbn=0-385-08696-2| page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the idea of a robot protecting human lives when it does not believe those humans truly exist is at odds with Elijah Baley's reasoning, as described [[#Ambiguities and loopholes|below]].

During the 1950s Asimov wrote a series of science fiction novels expressly intended for young-adult audiences. Originally his publisher expected that the novels could be adapted into a long-running television series, something like ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' had been for radio. Fearing that his stories would be adapted into the "uniformly awful" programming he saw flooding the television channels&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov decided to publish the [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'']] books under the [[pseudonym]] "Paul French". When plans for the television series fell through, Asimov decided to abandon the pretence; he brought the Three Laws into ''Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter'', noting that this "was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Joy Still Felt| publisher=Doubleday| year=1980| isbn=0-385-15544-1| last= Asimov| first=Isaac| page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short story [[Evidence (Asimov)|"Evidence"]] Asimov lets his recurring character [[Susan Calvin|Dr. Susan Calvin]] expound a [[morality|moral]] basis behind the Three Laws. Calvin points out that human beings are typically expected to refrain from harming other human beings (except in times of extreme duress like war, or to save a greater number) and this is equivalent to a robot's First Law. Likewise, according to Calvin, society expects individuals to obey instructions from recognized authorities such as doctors, teachers and so forth which equals the Second Law of Robotics. Finally humans are typically expected to avoid harming themselves which is the Third Law for a robot.

The plot of "Evidence" revolves around the question of telling a human being apart from a robot constructed to appear human&amp;nbsp;– Calvin reasons that if such an individual obeys the Three Laws he may be a robot or simply "a very good man". Another character then asks Calvin if robots are very different from human beings after all. She replies, "Worlds different. Robots are essentially decent."

Asimov later wrote that he should not be praised for creating the Laws, because they are "obvious from the start, and everyone is aware of them subliminally. The Laws just never happened to be put into brief sentences until I managed to do the job. The Laws apply, as a matter of course, to every tool that human beings use",&lt;ref name="asimov198111"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1981-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_018_1981_Nov#page/n19/mode/2up |title=The Three Laws |work=Compute! |date=November 1981 |accessdate=26 October 2013 |author=Asimov, Isaac |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "analogues of the Laws are implicit in the design of almost all tools, robotic or not":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Asimov |first=Isaac |title= Robot Visions|date= 12 April 2001|publisher= Gollancz|isbn= 978-1-85798-336-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Law 1: A tool must not be unsafe to use. [[Hammer]]s have handles and [[screwdriver]]s have hilts to help increase grip. It is of course possible for a person to injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool.
# Law 2: A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason [[ground-fault circuit interrupter]]s exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount.
# Law 3: A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, [[Dremel]] disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway).

Asimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws:{{r|asimov198111}}

{{quote|I have my answer ready whenever someone asks me if I think that my Three Laws of Robotics will actually be used to govern the behavior of robots, once they become versatile and flexible enough to be able to choose among different courses of behavior.

My answer is, "Yes, the Three Laws are the only way in which rational human beings can deal with robots—or with anything else."

—But when I say that, I always remember (sadly) that human beings are not always rational.}}

==Alterations==

===By Asimov===
Asimov's stories test his Three Laws in a wide variety of circumstances leading to proposals and rejection of modifications. Science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] writes in 1982, "The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis: the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme".&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; While the original set of Laws provided inspirations for many stories, Asimov introduced modified versions from time to time.

====First Law modified====
In "[[Little Lost Robot]]" several NS-2, or "Nestor", robots are created with only part of the First Law.&lt;ref name="IROBOT"/&gt; It reads:

{{quote|1. A robot may not harm a human being.}}

This modification is motivated by a practical difficulty as robots have to work alongside human beings who are exposed to low doses of radiation. Because their [[positronic brain]]s are highly sensitive to [[gamma ray]]s the robots are rendered inoperable by doses reasonably safe for humans. The robots are being destroyed attempting to rescue the humans who are in no actual danger but "might forget to leave" the irradiated area within the exposure time limit. Removing the First Law's "inaction" clause solves this problem but creates the possibility of an even greater one: a robot could initiate an action that would harm a human (dropping a heavy weight and failing to catch it is the example given in the text), knowing that it was capable of preventing the harm and then decide not to do so.&lt;ref name="IROBOT"/&gt;

[[Gaia (Foundation universe)|Gaia]] is a planet with [[collective intelligence]] in the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] which adopts a law similar to the First Law, and the Zeroth Law, as its philosophy:

{{quote|Gaia may not harm life or allow life to come to harm.}}

====Zeroth Law added====
Asimov once added a "[[Zero-based numbering|Zeroth]] Law"—so named to continue the pattern where lower-numbered laws supersede the higher-numbered laws—stating that a robot must not harm humanity. The robotic character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was the first to give the Zeroth Law a name in the novel ''[[Robots and Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="BBCAsimov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaac Asimov |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A42253922 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story "[[The Evitable Conflict]]".

In the final scenes of the novel ''Robots and Empire'', [[R. Giskard Reventlov]] is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is [[telepathic]], like the robot Herbie in the short story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of "harm" than most robots can grasp.&lt;ref name="SC1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/07/05/autprofile.htm |work=Campus Star |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=29 July 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2016 |quote=Only highly advanced robots (such as Daneel and Giskard) could comprehend this law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure [[metacognition]]. Though he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law. As Daneel formulates it, in the novels ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' and ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', the Zeroth Law reads:

{{quote|A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.}}

A condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov's novel ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' contains the following passage:

{{bquote|
Trevize frowned. "How do you decide what is injurious, or not injurious, to humanity as a whole?"

"Precisely, sir," said Daneel. "In theory, the Zeroth Law was the answer to our problems. In practice, we could never decide. A human being is a concrete object. Injury to a person can be estimated and judged. Humanity is an abstraction."}}

A translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov's novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit.&lt;ref name="Brécard" /&gt; Near the climax of ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', [[Elijah Baley]] makes a bitter comment to himself thinking that the First Law forbids a robot from harming a human being. He determines that it must be so unless the robot is clever enough to comprehend that its actions are for humankind's long-term good. In Jacques Brécard's 1956 [[French language|French]] translation entitled ''[[:fr:Les Cavernes d'acier|Les Cavernes d'acier]]'' Baley's thoughts emerge in a slightly different way:

{{quote|A robot may not harm a human being, unless he finds a way to prove that ultimately the harm done would benefit humanity in general!&lt;ref name="Brécard"&gt;{{cite book| last=Asimov| first=Isaac| title=The Caves of Steel| publisher=Doubleday| year=1952}}, translated by Jacques Brécard as {{cite book| title=[[:fr:Les Cavernes d'acier|Les Cavernes d'acier]]| publisher=J'ai Lu Science-fiction| year=1975| isbn=2-290-31902-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Removal of the Three Laws====
Three times during his writing career, Asimov portrayed robots that disregard the Three Laws entirely. The first case was a [[Vignette (literature)|short-short story]] entitled "[[First Law]]" and is often considered an insignificant "tall tale"&lt;ref&gt;Patrouch (1974), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[apocrypha]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1980); reprinted in Gunn (1982), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the short story "[[Cal (short story)|Cal]]" (from the collection ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]''), told by a first-person robot narrator, features a robot who disregards the Three Laws because he has found something far more important—he wants to be a writer. Humorous, partly autobiographical and unusually experimental in style, "Cal" has been regarded as one of ''Gold'''s strongest stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=John H. |work=Jenkins' Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov |url=http://preem.tejat.net/~tseng/Asimov/Stories/Story419.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-06-26 |title=Review of "Cal" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911085355/http://preem.tejat.net/~tseng/Asimov/Stories/Story419.html |archivedate=2009-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third is a short story entitled "[[Sally (Asimov)|Sally]]" in which cars fitted with positronic brains are apparently able to harm and kill humans in disregard of the First Law. However, aside from the positronic brain concept, this story does not refer to other robot stories and may not be set in the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

The title story of the ''[[Robot Dreams]]'' collection portrays LVX-1, or "Elvex", a robot who enters a state of unconsciousness and dreams thanks to the unusual [[fractal]] construction of his positronic brain. In his dream the first two Laws are absent and the Third Law reads "A robot must protect its own existence".&lt;ref name="RDA1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Robot Dreams |year=1986 |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |accessdate=11 November 2010 |url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~miranda/classes/topics/reading/asimov.pdf |quote=“But you quote it in incomplete fashion. The Third Law is ‘A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.’ ” “Yes, Dr. Calvin. That is the Third Law in reality, but in my dream, the Law ended with the word ‘existence’. There was no mention of the First or Second Law.” |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316134042/http://www.tcnj.edu/~miranda/classes/topics/reading/asimov.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov took varying positions on whether the Laws were optional: although in his first writings they were simply carefully engineered safeguards, in later stories Asimov stated that they were an inalienable part of the mathematical foundation underlying the positronic brain. Without the basic theory of the Three Laws the fictional scientists of Asimov's universe would be unable to design a workable brain unit. This is historically consistent: the occasions where roboticists modify the Laws generally occur early within the stories' chronology and at a time when there is less existing work to be re-done. In "Little Lost Robot" Susan Calvin considers modifying the Laws to be a terrible idea, although possible,&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web |title='The Complete Robot' by Isaac Asimov |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A455898 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2010 |date=3 November 2000 |quote=The answer is that it had had its First Law modified}}&lt;/ref&gt; while centuries later Dr. Gerrigel in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'' believes it to be impossible.

The character Dr. Gerrigel uses the term "Asenion" to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov's stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or in the real world could be non-Asenion. "Asenion" is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine ''Planet Stories.''&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp. 291–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into ''The Caves of Steel'' just like he referred to himself as "Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote" in ''[[Thiotimoline]] to the Stars'', in much the same way that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] appeared in ''[[Lolita]]'' [[anagram]]matically disguised as "Vivian Darkbloom".

Characters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of ''The Caves of Steel'' featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots.

===By other authors===

====Roger MacBride Allen's trilogy====
In the 1990s, [[Roger MacBride Allen]] wrote a trilogy which was set within Asimov's fictional universe. Each title has the prefix "Isaac Asimov's" as Asimov had approved Allen's outline before his death.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} These three books, ''[[Isaac Asimov's Caliban|Caliban]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Inferno|Inferno]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Utopia|Utopia]]'', introduce a new set of the Three Laws. The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov's originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the "inaction" clause, the same modification made in "Little Lost Robot"; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a "New Law" robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do "whatever it likes" so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws. The philosophy behind these changes is that "New Law" robots should be partners rather than slaves to humanity, according to [[Fredda Leving]], who designed these [[New Law Robots]]. According to the first book's introduction, Allen devised the New Laws in discussion with Asimov himself. However, the ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' says that "With permission from Asimov, Allen rethought the Three Laws and developed a new set,".&lt;ref name="EoSF1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of science fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-5924-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icA3oLIZEeMC&amp;pg=PA7 |author=[[Don D'Ammassa]] |page=7 |chapter=Allen, Roger MacBride}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jack Williamson's "With Folded Hands"====
[[Jack Williamson]]'s novelette "[[With Folded Hands]]" (1947), later rewritten as the novel ''The Humanoids'', deals with robot servants whose prime directive is "To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm". While Asimov's robotic laws are meant to protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson's story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do is to sit with folded hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~engb415/literature/cyberzach/Williamson/human.html |title=The Humanoids |publisher=Umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Foundation'' sequel trilogy====
In the officially licensed ''Foundation'' sequels ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'', ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' and ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (by [[Gregory Benford]], [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]] respectively) the future [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

The Laws of Robotics are portrayed as something akin to a human [[religion]], and referred to in the language of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with the set of laws containing the Zeroth Law known as the "Giskardian Reformation" to the original "Calvinian Orthodoxy" of the Three Laws. Zeroth-Law robots under the control of R. Daneel Olivaw are seen continually struggling with "First Law" robots who deny the existence of the Zeroth Law, promoting agendas different from Daneel's.&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Muse as Therapist: A New Poetic Paradigm for Psychotherapy |year=2009|publisher=Karnac Books |isbn=978-1-85575-595-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjhWPnUGexQC&amp;pg=PA22 |author=Heward Wilkinson|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these agendas are based on the first clause of the First Law ("A robot may not injure a human being...") advocating strict non-interference in human politics to avoid unwittingly causing harm. Others are based on the second clause ("...or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm") claiming that robots should openly become a [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] government to protect humans from all potential conflict or disaster.

Daneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue [[artificial intelligence|AI]] — specifically, a simulation of the long-dead [[Voltaire]] — which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws. Trema comes to believe that humanity should be free to choose its own future. Furthermore, a small group of robots claims that the Zeroth Law of Robotics itself implies a higher Minus One Law of Robotics:

{{quote|A robot may not harm [[sentience]] or, through inaction, allow sentience to come to harm.}}

They therefore claim that it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] sentient life for the benefit of humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though ''Foundation's Triumph'' hints that these robotic factions remain active as fringe groups up to the time of the novel [[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|''Foundation'']].&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1" /&gt;

These novels take place in a future dictated by Asimov to be free of obvious robot presence and surmise that R. Daneel's secret influence on history through the millennia has prevented both the rediscovery of [[positronic brain]] technology and the opportunity to work on sophisticated intelligent machines. This lack of rediscovery and lack of opportunity makes certain that the superior physical and intellectual power wielded by intelligent machines remains squarely in the possession of robots obedient to some form of the Three Laws.&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1" /&gt; That R. Daneel is not entirely successful at this becomes clear in a brief period when scientists on [[Trantor]] develop "[[Trantor#Food production|''tiktoks'']]" — simplistic programmable machines akin to real–life modern robots and therefore lacking the Three Laws. The robot conspirators see the Trantorian tiktoks as a massive threat to social stability, and their plan to eliminate the tiktok threat forms much of the plot of ''Foundation's Fear''.

In ''Foundation's Triumph'' different robot factions interpret the Laws in a wide variety of ways, seemingly ringing every possible permutation upon the Three Laws' ambiguities.

====Robot Mystery series====
Set between ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' and ''[[Robots and Empire]]'', [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot Mystery'' trilogy updates the ''Robot''–''Foundation'' saga with robotic minds housed in computer mainframes rather than humanoid bodies.{{clarify|not sure of the significance of this to the article - needs explaining via a reliable source|date=June 2011}} The 2002 Aurora novel has robotic characters debating the moral implications of harming cyborg lifeforms who are part artificial and part biological.&lt;ref name="IAATiedemann1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Aurora (ebook) |publisher=Byron Press Visual Publications |author=MARK W. TIEDEMANN |page=558 |quote="In short", Bogard said, "not all people are human"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One should not neglect Asimov's own creations in these areas such as the Solarian "viewing" technology and the machines of ''[[The Evitable Conflict]]'' originals that Tiedemann acknowledges. ''Aurora'', for example, terms the Machines "the first RIs, really". In addition the ''Robot Mystery'' series addresses the problem of [[nanotechnology]]:&lt;ref name="tiedemann"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/94p0.html| title=Interview with Mark Tiedemann| publisher=Science Fiction and Fantasy World| date=16 August 2002| accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; building a positronic brain capable of reproducing human cognitive processes requires a high degree of miniaturization, yet Asimov's stories largely overlook the effects this miniaturization would have in other fields of technology. For example, the police department card-readers in ''The Caves of Steel'' have a capacity of only a few kilobytes per square centimeter of storage medium. ''Aurora'', in particular, presents a sequence of historical developments which explains the lack of nanotechnology — a partial [[retcon]], in a sense, of Asimov's timeline.

====Additional laws====
There are three Fourth Laws written by authors other than Asimov. The 1974 [[Lyuben Dilov]] novel, ''Icarus's Way'' (a.k.a., ''The Trip of Icarus'') introduced a Fourth Law of robotics:

{{quote|A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.}}

Dilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: "The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fifth law was introduced by [[Nikola Kesarovski]] in his short story "The Fifth Law of Robotics". This fifth law says:

{{quote|A robot must know it is a robot.}}

The plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot. The robot violated both the First Law and Dilov's Fourth Law (assumed in Kesarovksi's universe to be the valid one) because it did not establish for itself that it was a robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For the 1986 tribute anthology, ''[[Foundation's Friends]],'' [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] wrote a story entitled, "The Fourth Law of Robotics". This Fourth Law states:

{{quote|A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.}}

In the book a robot rights activist, in an attempt to liberate robots, builds several equipped with this Fourth Law. The robots accomplish the task laid out in this version of the Fourth Law by building new robots who view their creator robots as parental figures.&lt;ref name="HHThefourthlaw1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Harry |title=The Fourth Law of Robotics |year=1989 |authorlink=Harry Harrison (writer) |pages=7–8 |quote=A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the 2004 Will Smith [[I, Robot (film)|film adaptation of ''I, Robot'']], humorist and graphic designer Mark Sottilaro farcically declared the Fourth Law of Robotics to be "When turning evil, display a red indicator light." The red light indicated the wireless uplink to the manufacturer is active, first seen during a software update and later on "Evil" robots taken over by the manufacturer's positronic superbrain.

In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian, proposed an additional law that for the first time{{cn|date=March 2017}} considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ashrafian |first= Hutan| year= 2014|title= AIonAI: A Humanitarian Law of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-013-9513-9#page-1 |journal= Science and Engineering Ethics |volume= 21 |issue= 1 |pages= 29–40 |publisher= Springer| doi= 10.1007/s11948-013-9513-9 |pmid= 24414678 |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sixth law states:

{{quote|All robots endowed with comparable human reason and conscience should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.}}

In [[Karl Schroeder]]'s ''Lockstep'' (2014) a character reflects that robots "probably had multiple layers of programming to keep [them] from harming anybody. Not three laws, but twenty or thirty."

== Ambiguities and loopholes ==

===Unknowing breach of the laws===
In ''The Naked Sun'', [[Elijah Baley]] points out that the Laws had been deliberately misrepresented because robots could ''unknowingly'' break any of them. He restated the first law as "A robot may do nothing that, ''to its knowledge,'' will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, ''knowingly'' allow a human being to come to harm." This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he points out that a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being.&lt;ref name="TNSPoison"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook)|year=1956–1957|page=233|quote=... one robot poison an arrow without knowing it was using poison, and having a second robot hand the poisoned arrow to the boy ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Naked Sun'' complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.

Baley furthermore proposes that the Solarians may one day use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant.&lt;ref name="TNSSpaceship"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook)|year=1956–1957|page=240|quote=But a spaceship that was equipped with its own positronic brain would cheerfully attack any ship it was directed to attack, it seems to me. It would naturally assume all other ships were unmanned}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibility is referenced in ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human. (The novel takes place thousands of years after The Naked Sun, and the Solarians have long since modified themselves from normal humans to hermaphroditic telepaths with extended brains and specialized organs)

===Ambiguities resulting from lack of definition===
The Laws of Robotics presume that the terms "human being" and "robot" are understood and well defined. In some stories this presumption is overturned.

====Definition of "human being"====
The [[Solaria]]ns create robots with the Three Laws but with a warped meaning of "human". Solarian robots are told that only people speaking with a Solarian accent are human. This enables their robots to have no ethical dilemma in harming non-Solarian human beings (and are specifically programmed to do so). By the time period of ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' it is revealed that the Solarians have genetically modified themselves into a distinct species from humanity — becoming hermaphroditic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundation and Earth (1986) |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/isaac-asimov/foundation-and-earth.html |publisher=gotterdammerung.org |accessdate=11 November 2010 |author=Branislav L. Slantchev}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] and containing biological organs capable of individually powering and controlling whole complexes of robots. The robots of Solaria thus respected the Three Laws only with regard to the "humans" of Solaria. It is unclear whether all the robots had such definitions, since only the overseer and guardian robots were shown explicitly to have them. In "Robots and Empire", the lower class robots were instructed by their overseer about whether certain creatures are human or not.

Asimov addresses the problem of humanoid robots ("[[android (robot)|androids]]" in later parlance) several times. The novel ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the short stories "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]" and "The Tercentenary Incident" describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human.&lt;ref name="ROBANDEMP1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Robots and Empire |publisher=Doubleday books |isbn=0-385-19092-1|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=151|quote=although the woman looked as human as Daneel did, she was just as nonhuman}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "[[The Bicentennial Man]]" and "[[—That Thou Art Mindful of Him]]" explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. [[Gwendoline Butler]] writes in ''A Coffin for the Canary'' "Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Butler| first=Gwendoline| title=A Coffin for the Canary| publisher=Black Dagger Crime| year=2001| isbn=0-7540-8580-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', [[Elijah Baley]] points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there.

"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him", which Asimov intended to be the "ultimate" probe into the Laws' subtleties,&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1980); reprinted in Gunn (1982), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; finally uses the Three Laws to conjure up the very "Frankenstein" scenario they were invented to prevent. It takes as its concept the growing development of robots that mimic non-human living things and given programs that mimic simple animal behaviours which do not require the Three Laws. The presence of a whole range of robotic life that serves the same purpose as organic life ends with two humanoid robots concluding that organic life is an unnecessary requirement for a truly logical and self-consistent definition of "humanity", and that since they are the most advanced thinking beings on the planet — they are therefore the only two true humans alive and the Three Laws only apply to themselves. The story ends on a sinister note as the two robots enter hibernation and await a time when they will conquer the Earth and subjugate biological humans to themselves; an outcome they consider an inevitable result of the "Three Laws of Humanics".&lt;ref name="TCRMindful1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=The Complete Robot |year=1982 |publisher=Nightfall, Inc. |authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=611|chapter=... That Thou Art Mindful Of Him}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story does not fit within the overall sweep of the ''Robot'' and [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]]; if the George robots ''did'' take over Earth some time after the story closes the later stories would be either redundant or impossible. Contradictions of this sort among Asimov's fiction works have led scholars to regard the ''Robot'' stories as more like "the Scandinavian sagas or the Greek legends" than a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1982), pp. 77–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Asimov describes "–That Thou Art Mindful of Him" and "Bicentennial Man" as two opposite, parallel futures for robots that obviate the Three Laws as robots come to consider themselves to be humans: one portraying this in a positive light with a robot joining human society, one portraying this in a negative light with robots supplanting humans.&lt;ref name="TCRBicentennial"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac|title=The Complete Robot|year=1982|publisher=Nightfall, Inc. |authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=658|chapter=The Bicentennial Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are to be considered alternatives to the possibility of a robot society that continues to be driven by the Three Laws as portrayed in the ''Foundation'' series.{{According to whom|date=December 2010}} Indeed, in ''Positronic Man'', the novelization of "Bicentennial Man", Asimov and his co–writer [[Robert Silverberg]] imply that in the future where Andrew Martin exists his influence causes humanity to abandon the idea of independent, sentient humanlike robots entirely, creating an utterly different future from that of ''Foundation''.{{According to whom|date=December 2010}}

In ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'', a novel unrelated to the ''Robot'' series but featuring robots programmed with the Three Laws, John Bigman Jones is almost killed by a Sirian robot on orders of its master. The society of Sirius is eugenically bred to be uniformly tall and similar in appearance, and as such, said master is able to convince the robot that the much shorter Bigman, is, in fact, not a human being.

====Definition of "robot"====
As noted in "The Fifth Law of Robotics" by [[Nikola Kesarovski]], "A robot must know it is a robot": it is presumed that a robot has a definition of the term or a means to apply it to its own actions. Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not understand that it was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions.

===Resolving conflicts among the laws===
Advanced robots in fiction are typically programmed to handle the Three Laws in a sophisticated manner. In many stories, such as "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" by Asimov, the potential and severity of all actions are weighed and a robot will break the laws as little as possible rather than do nothing at all. For example, the First Law may forbid a robot from functioning as a surgeon, as that act may cause damage to a human, however Asimov's stories eventually included robot surgeons ("The Bicentennial Man" being a notable example). When robots are sophisticated enough to weigh alternatives, a robot may be programmed to accept the necessity of inflicting damage during surgery in order to prevent the greater harm that would result if the surgery were not carried out, or was carried out by a more fallible human surgeon. In "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]" Susan Calvin points out that a robot may even act as a [[Attorney at law (United States)|prosecuting attorney]] because in the American justice system it is the [[jury]] which decides guilt or innocence, the judge who decides the sentence, and the [[executioner]] who carries through [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |title=I, Robot |url=http://nullfile.com/ebooks/%28ebook%29%20Asimov,%20Isaac%20-%20I,%20Robot.pdf |author=Isaac Asimov |accessdate=11 November 2010 |page=122 |format=Asimov, Isaac - I, Robot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov's Three Law robots (or Asenion) can experience irreversible mental collapse if they are forced into situations where they cannot obey the First Law, or if they discover they have unknowingly violated it. The first example of this [[failure mode]] occurs in the story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", which introduced the First Law itself, and introduces failure by dilemma – in this case the robot will hurt them if he tells them something and hurt them if he does not.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=I, Robot |url=http://nullfile.com/ebooks/%28ebook%29%20Asimov,%20Isaac%20-%20I,%20Robot.pdf|author=Isaac Asimov|accessdate=11 November 2010 |page=75 |format=Asimov, Isaac - I, Robot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This failure mode, which often ruins the positronic brain beyond repair, plays a significant role in Asimov's SF-mystery novel ''[[The Naked Sun]]''. Here Daneel describes activities contrary to one of the laws, but in support of another, as overloading some circuits in a robot's brain&amp;nbsp;– the equivalent sensation to pain in humans. The example he uses is forcefully ordering a robot to do a task outside its normal parameters, one that it has been ordered to forgo in favor of a robot specialized to that task.&lt;ref name="TNSPain"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook) |year=1956–1957 |page=56 |quote=Are you trying to tell me, Daneel, that it hurts the robot to have me do its work? ... experience which the robot undergoes is as upsetting to it as pain is to a human}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', it is stated that more advanced robots are built capable of determining which action is more harmful, and even choosing at random if the alternatives are equally bad. As such, a robot is capable of taking an action which can be interpreted as following the First Law, and avoid a mental collapse. The whole plot of the story revolves around a robot which apparently was destroyed by such a mental collapse, and since his designer and creator refused to share the basic theory with others, he is, by definition, the only person capable of circumventing the safeguards and forcing the robot into a brain-destroying paradox.

In ''[[Robots and Empire]]'', Daneel states it's very unpleasant for him when making the proper decision takes too long (in robot terms), and he cannot imagine being without the Laws at all except to the extent of it being similar to that unpleasant sensation, only permanent.

Robots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so. Robots already exist (for example, a [[Roomba]]) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~prestes/Courses/Robotics/beyond%20asimov.pdf | title=Beyond Asimov: The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics | journal=IEEE Intelligent systems| date=July 2009| accessdate = July 2009| issue=4| volume=24|pages=14–20| doi=10.1109/mis.2009.69| last1=Murphy | first1=Robin | last2=Woods | first2=David D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.&lt;ref name="moravec"&gt;[[Hans Moravec|Moravec, Hans]].

In a 2007 guest editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on the topic of "Robot Ethics", SF author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] argues that since the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs.&lt;ref name="SAWSCI"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sawyer| first=Robert J.| url=http://sfwriter.com/science.htm| doi=10.1126/science.1151606|journal=Science|date=16 November 2007|title=Guest Editorial: Robot Ethics| accessdate = 2010-10-10| volume=318| issue=5853| page=1037| pmid=18006710}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.)&lt;ref name="SAWON3LAWS"&gt;{{cite web| last=Sawyer| first=Robert J.| url=http://www.sfwriter.com/rmasilaw.htm| title=On Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics| year=1991| accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Langford]] has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws:

# A robot will not harm authorized Government personnel but will [[Terminate with extreme prejudice|terminate intruders with extreme prejudice]].
# A robot will obey the orders of authorized personnel except where such orders conflict with the Third Law.
# A robot will guard its own existence with lethal antipersonnel weaponry, because a robot is bloody expensive.

Roger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued "Asimov's Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov's stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Roger. ''Asimov's laws of robotics: Implications for information technology''.

Under "Enhancements to codes of ethics".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Asimov's later novels ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour.

In March 2007 the [[South Korea]]n government announced that later in the year it would issue a "Robot Ethics Charter" setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The futurist [[Hans Moravec]] (a prominent figure in the [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to "corporate intelligences" — the [[corporation]]s driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future.&lt;ref name="moravec"/&gt; In contrast, the [[David Brin]] novel ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and [[natural selection]] would sweep the Laws away — Asimov's careful foundation undone by [[evolutionary computation]]. Although the robots would not be evolving through ''design'' instead of ''mutation'' because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the July/August 2009 issue of ''IEEE Intelligent Systems'', Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed "The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics" as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows:

Woods said, "Our laws are little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring” and that "The philosophy has been, ‘sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better – a perfect version of ourselves.’ We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways."&lt;ref name="IEEEMWTTLRR"/&gt;

{{Main|The Three Laws of Robotics in popular culture}}
Asimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the "Frankenstein complex".{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} Stories written by other authors have depicted robots as if they obeyed the Three Laws but tradition dictates that only Asimov could quote the Laws explicitly.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} Asimov believed the Three Laws helped foster the rise of stories in which robots are "lovable"&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Star Wars]]'' being his favorite example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Asimov| first=Isaac| year=1995| title=Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Life in Letters|author2=Stanley Asimov | publisher=Doubleday| isbn=0-385-47622-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the laws are quoted verbatim, such as in the ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'' episode "Shgoratchx!", it is not uncommon for Asimov to be mentioned in the same dialogue as can also be seen in the [[Aaron Stone]] pilot where an android states that it functions under Asimov's Three Laws. However, the 1960s German TV series ''[[Raumpatrouille|Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion]]'' (''Space Patrol – the Fantastic Adventures of Space Ship Orion'') bases episode three titled "''Hüter des Gesetzes''" ("Guardians of the Law") on Asimov's Three Laws without mentioning the source.

References to the Three Laws have appeared in popular music ("Robot" from [[Hawkwind]]'s 1979 album ''[[PXR5]]''), cinema (''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]''), cartoon series (''[[The Simpsons]]''), tabletop roleplaying games ([[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]) and [[webcomics]] (''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]'' and ''[[Freefall]]'').

===The Three Laws in film===
[[Robby the Robot]] in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) has a hierarchical command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up very much in the manner of Asimov's robots. Robby is one of the first cinematic depictions of a robot with internal safeguards put in place in this fashion. Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to be programmed to follow his Three Laws.

[[Image:Bicentennial-man-three-laws.jpg|thumb|NDR-114 explaining the Three Laws]]
Isaac Asimov's works have been adapted for cinema several times with varying degrees of critical and commercial success. Some of the more notable attempts have involved his "Robot" stories, including the Three Laws. The film ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999) features [[Robin Williams]] as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 (the serial number is partially a reference to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[CRM 114 (device)|signature numeral]]). Williams recites the Three Laws to his employers, the Martin family, aided by a holographic projection. However, the Laws were not the central focus of the film which only loosely follows the original story and has the second half introducing a love interest not present in Asimov's original short story.

[[Harlan Ellison]]'s proposed screenplay for ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form a large part of the screenplay's plot development. This is only natural since Ellison's screenplay is one inspired by ''[[Citizen Kane]]'': a frame story surrounding four of Asimov's short-story plots and three taken from the book ''[[I, Robot]]'' itself. Ellison's adaptations of these four stories are relatively faithful although he magnifies Susan Calvin's role in two of them. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison's introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ellison| first=Harlan| title=I, Robot: The illustrated screenplay| publisher=Aspect| year=1994| isbn=0-446-67062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1986 movie [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']], in a scene after the android [[List of Alien characters|Bishop]] accidentally cuts himself during the [[knife game]], he attempts to reassure [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] by stating that: "It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/quotes|title= Aliens (1986) - Memorable quotes |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the 1979 movie from the same series, ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the human crew of a starship infiltrated by a hostile alien are informed by the android [[Alien (film)#Ash|Ash]] that his instructions are: "Return alien life form, all other priorities rescinded",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/oh/quotations/movies/a/alien.html |title=ALIEN |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating how the laws governing behaviour around human safety can be rescinded by Executive Order.

In the 1987 film ''[[RoboCop]]'' and its sequels, the partially human main character has been programmed with three "prime directives" that he must obey without question. Even if different in letter and spirit they have some similarities with Asimov's Three Laws. They are:&lt;ref name="AARobocop"&gt;{{cite book |title=Alternate Americas: science fiction film and American culture |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-98395-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVvb6gfT4o4C&amp;pg=PA205 |author=M. Keith Booker |page=205 |quote=In a variation on Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Serve the Public Trust
# Protect the Innocent
# Uphold the Law
# Classified

These particular laws allow Robocop to harm a human being in order to protect another human, fulfilling his role as would a human law enforcement officer. The classified fourth directive is one that forbids him from harming any OCP employee, as OCP had created him, and this command overrides the others, meaning that he could not cause harm to an employee even in order to protect others.

The plot of the film released in 2004 under the name, ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' is "suggested by" Asimov's robot fiction stories&lt;ref&gt;"Suggested by" Isaac Asimov's robot stories—two stops removed from "based on" and "inspired by", the credit implies something scribbled on a bar napkin—[[Alex Proyas]]' science-fiction thriller ''I, Robot'' sprinkles Asimov's ideas like seasoning on a giant bucket of popcorn. [...] Asimov's simple and seemingly foolproof Laws of Robotics, designed to protect human beings and robots alike from harm, are subject to loopholes that the author loved to exploit. After all, much of humanity agrees in principle to abide by the [[Ten Commandments]], but [[free will]], circumstance, and contradictory impulses can find wiggle room in even the most unambiguous decree. Whenever ''I, Robot'' pauses between action beats, Proyas captures some of the excitement of movies like ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I.]]'', all of which proved that philosophy and social commentary could be smuggled into spectacle. Had the film been based on Asimov's stories, rather than merely "suggested by" them, Proyas might have achieved the intellectual heft missing from his stylish 1998 [[cult film|cult]] favorite ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]].''

and advertising for the film included a trailer featuring the Three Laws followed by the [[aphorism]], "Rules were made to be broken". The film opens with a recitation of the Three Laws and explores the implications of the [[#Zeroth Law added|Zeroth Law]] as a logical extrapolation.

Philosopher [[James H. Moor]] says that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results.

[[Marc Rotenberg]], President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Professor of [[information privacy law]] at Georgetown Law, argues that the Laws of Robotics should be expanded to include two new laws:
* a Fourth Law, under which a Robot must be able to identify itself to the public ("symmetrical identification")
* a Fifth Law, dictating that a Robot must be able to explain to the public its decision making process ("algorithmic transparency").

In [[time management]], '''timeboxing''' allocates a fixed time period, called a '''timebox''', within which planned activity takes place. It is employed by several [[project management]] approaches and for personal time management.  {{Rquote|right|Timebox—don't scopebox| Mary Poppendieck | ''Leading Lean Software Development''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Poppendieck | first = Mary | title = Leading Lean Software Development: Results Are Not the Point | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | page = 139 | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-321-62070-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In project management ==

Timeboxing is used as a [[project planning]] technique. The schedule is divided into a number of separate time periods (timeboxes), with each part having its own deliverables, deadline and budget.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Sometimes referred to as ''schedule as independent variable'' (SAIV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MWhXwkHsS0gC&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Schedule%20as%22&amp;f=false|title=Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the Perplexed|last=Boehm|first=Barry W.|last2=Boehm|first2=Barry|last3=Turner|first3=Richard|date=2004|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=9780321186126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As an alternative to fixing scope ===

In [[project management]], there are generally considered to be [[Project management triangle|three constraints]] of time (sometimes [[Schedule (project management)|schedule]]), cost (sometimes [[budget]]), and [[Scope (project management)|scope]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmanagement.net.au/triple_constraints ''What are the Triple Constraints in Project Management''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060820021929/http://www.projectmanagement.net.au/triple_constraints |date=2006-08-20 }}, article by Rod Hutchings on [http://projectmanagement.net.au/ Project Management Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216052557/http://projectmanagement.net.au/ |date=2009-02-16 }} (22 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chat"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Carl | last=Chatfield | title=A short course in project management | url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project/HA102354821033.aspx| publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobson | first = Michael | title = The triple constraints in project management | publisher = Management Concepts | location = Vienna, Va | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56726-152-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kanabar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leffingwell/&gt; with [[Quality (business)|quality]] often added as a fourth constraint (represented as the middle of a triangle),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Snedaker |first= Susan |author2=Nels Hoenig  |title= How to Cheat at IT Project Management |publisher= Syngress |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-59749-037-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Kent | title = Extreme programming eXplained : embrace change | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Reading, MA | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-61641-6 | pages=15–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dangelo&gt;{{cite book | last = Dangelo | first = Mark | title = Innovative relevance : realigning the organization for profit : it is not a battle for the "shore lines" - it's a struggle for purpose | publisher = iUniverse | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-595-67081-9 | page=53 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQx3lab0KnIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that a change in one constraint will affect the others.&lt;ref name=Kanabar&gt;{{cite book | last = Kanabar | first = Vijay | title = MBA Fundamentals : Project Management | publisher = Kaplan Pub | location = New York | year = 2008 | page = 51 | isbn = 978-1-4277-9744-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without timeboxing, projects usually work to a fixed scope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Godin |first= Seth |title= Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application |publisher= 37signals }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case when it becomes clear that some deliverables cannot be completed within the planned timescales, either the deadline has to be extended (to allow more time to complete the fixed scope) or more people are involved (to complete the fixed scope in the same time). Often both happen, resulting in delayed delivery, increased costs, and often reduced quality (as per [[The Mythical Man-Month]] principle).

With timeboxing, the deadline is fixed, meaning that the scope would have to be reduced. As this means organizations have to focus on completing the most important deliverables first, timeboxing often goes hand-in-hand with a scheme for prioritizing of deliverables (such as with the [[MoSCoW method]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36755892|title=DSDM, dynamic systems development method : the method in practice|last=Jennifer.|first=Stapleton,|date=1997|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0201178893|location=Harlow, England|oclc=36755892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== To manage risk ===

Timeboxes are used as a form of [[risk management]], to explicitly identify uncertain task/time relationships, i.e., work that may easily extend past its deadline. Time constraints are often a primary driver in planning and should not be changed without considering project or sub-project critical paths. That is, it's usually important to meet deadlines. Risk factors for missed deadlines can include complications upstream of the project, planning errors within the project, team-related issues, or faulty execution of the plan. Upstream issues might include changes in project mission or backing/support from management. A common planning error is inadequate task breakdown, which can lead to underestimation of the time required to perform the work. Team-related issues can include trouble with inter-team communication; lack of experience or required cross-functionality; lack of commitment/drive/motivation (i.e. poor team building and management).

To stay on deadline, the following actions against the triple constraints are commonly evaluated:

* Reduce scope: drop requirements of lower impact (the ones that will not be directly missed by the user)
* Time is the fixed constraint here
* Increase cost: e.g., add overtime or resources

=== Adoption in software development ===

Many successful [[software development]] projects use timeboxing, especially smaller ones.&lt;ref name=Capers&gt;For all project types time boxing ranked 23 and rated "Very Good Practice"; for small (1000 [[function point]]) projects ranked 7 and rated a "Best Practice" by the survey in {{cite book | last = Jones | first = Capers | title = Software engineering best practices lessons from successful projects in the top companies | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-07-162162-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting timeboxing more than tripled developer productivity at [[DuPont]] in the '80s.&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; In some cases, applications were completely delivered within the time estimated to complete just a [[Functional specification|specification]].&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; However, [[Steve McConnell]] argues that not every product is suitable&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; and that timeboxing should only be used after the customer agrees to cut features, not quality.&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; There is little evidence for strong adoption amongst the largest class of projects.&lt;ref name=Capers/&gt;

Timeboxing has been adopted by some notable [[software development methodologies]]:

* [[Dynamic Systems Development Method|Dynamic systems development method]] (DSDM)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In [[lean software development]], [[Kanban|pull scheduling]] with [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] provides short term time management. When developing a large and complex system, when long term [[planning]] is required timeboxing is [[Abstraction layer|layered]] above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Poppendieck | first = Mary | title = Leading Lean Software Development : Results are not the Point | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | pages = 137–140 | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-321-62070-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rapid application development]] (RAD) [[software development process]] features [[iterative and incremental development|iterative development]] and [[software prototyping]]. According to [[Steve McConnell]], timeboxing is a "Best Practice" for RAD and a typical timebox length should be 60–120 days.&lt;ref name=McConnell&gt;{{cite book | last = McConnell | first = Steve | title = Rapid Development : taming wild software schedules | publisher = Microsoft Press | location = Redmond, Wash | year = 1996 | isbn = 1-55615-900-5 | pages=575–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] was influenced by ideas of timeboxing and [[iterative development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coplien | first = James | title = Lean Architecture for Agile Software Development | publisher = Wiley | location = Chichester Hoboken, N.J | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lpvY36MPMUwC | page = 25 | isbn = 978-0-470-68420-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular timeboxed units known as [[Sprint (scrum)|sprints]] form the basic unit of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohn | first = Mike | title = Succeeding with Agile : Software Development using Scrum | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2010 | pages = 257–284 | isbn = 978-0-321-57936-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical length for a sprint is 30 days.&lt;ref name=Schwaber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leffingwell | first = Dean | title = Agile Software Requirements : Lean requirements practices for teams, programs, and the enterprise | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-321-63584-6 | pages = 15 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pTExbNmZwZUC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint planning, sprint retrospective and sprint review meetings are timeboxed.&lt;ref name=Schwaber&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwaber | first = Ken | title = Agile Project Management with Scrum | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc | location = New York | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RpYX01XVMksC | isbn = 978-0-7356-3790-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Extreme programming]] methodologies, development planning is timeboxed into iterations typically 1, 2 or 3 weeks in length. The business [[Requirement prioritization|revalues]] pending [[user story|user stories]] before each iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Kent | title = Extreme programming eXplained : embrace change | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Reading, MA | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-61641-6 | pages=85–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agile software development]] advocates moving from ''plan driven'' to ''value driven'' development. Quality and time are fixed but flexibility allowed in scope. Delivering the most important features first leads to an earlier [[return on investment]] than the [[waterfall model]].&lt;ref name=Leffingwell&gt;{{cite book | last = Leffingwell | first = Dean | title = Agile Software Requirements : Lean requirements practices for teams, programs, and the enterprise | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-321-63584-6 | pages = 17–19 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pTExbNmZwZUC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of detailed specifications typically is the result of a lack of time, or the lack of knowledge of the desired end result (solution). In many types of projects, and especially in software engineering, analyzing and defining ''all'' requirements and specifications before the start of the realization phase is impossible. Timeboxing can be a favorable type of contracting for projects in which the deadline is ''the'' most critical aspect and when not all requirements are completely specified up front. This also allows for new feedback or insights discovered during the project to be reflected in the end result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In personal time management ==

''Timeboxing'' can be used for personal tasks, as well, in which case it uses a reduced scale of time (e.g., thirty minutes) and of deliverables (e.g., a household chore instead of project deliverable). 

Personal timeboxing is also said to act as a [[Life hacking|life hack]] to help curb perfectionist tendencies (by setting a firm time and not overcommitting to a task)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whyamilazy.com/40-super-effective-ways-to-stop-procrastinating/ |title=40 Ways To Stop Procrastinating |last1=Frankton |first1=James |date=4 April 2014 |website=Why Am I Lazy? |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can also enhance creativity and focus (by creating a sense of urgency or increased pressure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pash | first = Adam | title = Lifehacker the guide to working smarter, faster, and better | publisher = Wiley | location = Indianapolis, Ind | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-118-13345-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d-FYJceblAMC | at=Hack 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with other methods ==

Timeboxing acts as a building block in other personal time management methods:

* The [[Pomodoro Technique]] is based on 25 minute timeboxes of focused concentration separated by breaks allowing the mind to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nöteberg | first=Staffan | title=Pomodoro Technique Illustrated | publisher = Pragmatic Bookshelf | location = Raleigh, N.C | isbn=978-1-934356-50-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12910">The '''World Courts of Women''' are public hearings that give a forum to those who are traditionally excluded from formal political and legal proceedings. Organized around particular topics relevant to the hosting country, these unofficial public enquiries highlight the injustices that women face. They include testimonies of personal experience, analyses by scholars and activists, and skill-sharing and strategizing. Through these, the World Courts aim to educate and raise awareness, record injustice and human rights violations, give voice to marginalized women, and develop alternative visions and strategies for the future.

==Overview==

World Courts of Women are symbolic processes that hold [[Unofficial hearing|unofficial public enquiries]] into crimes against women, including the violation of their basic [[human rights]]. The main function of these hearings is to allow an opportunity for participants to relate experiences that are not widely publicized by traditional media sources and [[public discourse]]. It aims to challenge dominant public discourse by pointing to contradictions between principles of human rights and the experiences of women. The secondary function is for the [[testimony]] to provide a resource for [[social movements]] and [[political movements]] working for [[social justice]] and [[women's liberation]], which seek to hold powerful governments and other entities accountable to human rights standards and [[international law]] and "transform the dominant paradigm of politics." &lt;ref name="Courts of Women"/&gt;

The World Courts of Women have been inspired and promoted by Corinne Kumar, an [[activist]] leader in the Tunis-based [[non-governmental organization]] and human rights advocacy group, El Taller International.&lt;ref name="Courts of Women1"/&gt; In the countries where these occur, the intent is to hold their governments accountable to both international law and human [[ethics]]. While such courts lack [[Legitimacy (political)|official legitimacy]], by pointing out the failures of formal laws to protect women, they can help undermine the popular acceptance of government authority that is based in [[patriarchy]]. In this sense, they aim to increase [[popular sovereignty]] and to delegitimize institutions, [[bureaucracy]], and other social groups which are thought to be inadequate in punishing persons who violate the ethics and [[Norm (social)|norms]], if not also the [[Law|formal laws]], governing society. They challenge the traditional notion of power and powerholders; according to Kumar, "moving out of the patriarchal mindset would mean refusing the mono-dimensional definition of power, seeking to redefine and relocate power, to discover an alternate concept of power, to find new patterns of power."&lt;ref name="Women, Violence, and Nonviolent Change"/&gt;

There are many gender biases’ in the courts especially against women. Women can be denied equal justice, equal treatment, and equal opportunity (Harbour). Women have had laws passed to protect them against violence. It took many years to actually allow them to recognize women as victims of stalking or sexual harassment. Eventually laws were passed to protect these victims. Many women have experienced and lived through the domestic violence that was done to them and no one believed them. Now society is finally recognizing the violence against women more than ever before. Even though women are still put down compared to men in certain situations or jobs the world has evolved to better the understanding that women are just as capable as men.

== People's tribunals ==

[[Tribunal|People’s tribunals]] assert that targeted judicial systems are failing to provide access for low-income, minority, and other non-elite groups and individuals to [[prosecute]] or even bring forth a [[criminal charge]]. Investigation is also made into laws recognized by states that fail to consider [[personal and cultural values]] of [[human rights]] and [[dignity]]. These tribunals are also intended to help strengthen international conventions or norms to which governments and other [[elites]] are held.&lt;ref name="People's Tribunals as Constructive Resistance"/&gt;

The [[social space]]s where the World Courts of Women occur are [[communities]] in which "social categories are suspended, [[social roles|roles]] become fluid and [[social interaction|interaction]] is privileged."&lt;ref name="The Courts of Women"/&gt;  The [[symbolic system|symbolic]] use of the World Courts of Women intends to provide [[social influence|influence]], [[people power|power]], and [[Standing (law)|standing]] for victims unable to find resolution in official judicial systems and institutions.&lt;ref name="Courts of Women2"/&gt;

The first [[International War Crimes Tribunal]] was an investigative body immediately followed the 1966 publication of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s book, ''War Crimes in Vietnam''.  The tribunal investigated and evaluated the United States of [[criticism of American foreign policy|America's foreign policy]] and military [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and provided a model for further tribunals related to [[war crimes]], [[human rights violations]], and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Bertrand Russell: Critical Assessments, Volume 1,"/&gt;

The [[International Tribunal on Crimes against Women]] was a people's tribunal which took place on March 4–8, 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. The event was created with the intention to "make public the full range of crimes, both violently brutal and subtly discriminatory, committed against women of all cultures."&lt;ref name="Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book"/&gt;

== History ==

What follows is a partial list of past World Courts.

In 1992 the first World Court of Women, called the "Asia Court on Violence Against Women" was held in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. The Courts of Women organized by Asian Women's Human Rights Council (AWHRC) in the [[Asia Pacific region]] inspired courts in other regions, particularly in the [[Arab world]], [[Africa]], and [[Central America]].  In 1995 Arab women organized the Arab Women's Court with the assistance of human rights organizations including the international NGO, El Taller.  That year the court held a public hearing in [[Beirut, Lebanon]] on violence directed against women. In 1996 the ''Mahkamate El Nissa El Arabiya'' (Permanent Arab Women’s Court) was established.  Different member organizations were to host this court on a rotating basis.&lt;ref name="Arab World"/&gt;

The [[Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery]] was held in December 2000. It was a people's tribunal convened to gather testimony from victims, and then, based on [[international criminal law|international laws]] that were in place during [[World War II]], to try groups and individuals for [[rape]] or [[sexual slavery]], i.e., forcing women to sexually service Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref name="Did NHK Balk at Covering War Tribunal?"/&gt;
  
The World Court of Women Against War, for Peace was held March 8, 2001 in [[Khayelitsha]], Cape Town, South Africa to bear witness to the enormous violence and [[genocide]] caused by wars around the world. 4,000 people from around the Republic of South Africa and the world participated.&lt;ref name="The World Court of Women Against War, for Peace"/&gt;

World Court of Women on U.S. War Crimes took place in [[Mumbai]], India, on January 18, 2004, as part of the 2004 [[World Social Forum]].&lt;ref name="World Court of Women on US War Crimes"/&gt;

The 36th Court of Women, "Daughters of Fire : The Indian Court of Women on Dowry and Related Forms of Violence Against Women" was held in [[Bangalore]], India on July 26–29, 2009.&lt;ref name="Background: India Court of Women on Dowry and Related Forms of Violence Against Women"/&gt;

The 37th Court of Women, "Southeast Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking" was held on August 6, 2009 during the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) in [[Nusa Dua]], Bali. Twenty-two women, from six Southeast Asian countries ([[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], the [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Singapore]]) spoke about living with [[HIV/AIDS]] and their experiences with [[human trafficking]], [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]], and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="Survivors seek justice from podium"/&gt;

"World Court of Women on Poverty in the United States: Disappeared in America" was the first US example, held in [[Oakland, California]], USA, from May 10–13, 2012. Representing the western region of the country, the focus was on poverty in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Let's Make Poverty History"/&gt;

In 2013, another World Court of Women was held in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia 2013"/&gt;

The 2015 session took place in Bangalore, India, to witness the violence and injustice, and highlight the political lessons and resistance, and oppose "the unending wars against women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Courts of Women: against war, for peace|url = https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/rebecca-johnson/courts-of-women-resisting-violence-and-war|website = openDemocracy|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segal''' (born 1956 in [[Lutsk]], Ukraine)&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/Distinguished_Professors/Zindel_Segal.htm|title= Zindel Segal|publisher= Provost.utoronto.ca|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cognitive psychologist]], a specialist on [[clinical depression|depression]] and one of the founders of [[Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy]] (MBCT).

A professor of psychology at University of Toronto, Segal combines mindfulness with conventional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which teaches patients to develop a different relationship to sadness or unhappiness by observing and without judgment. Presently he is Distinguished Professor of Psychology in Mood Disorders in the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]]. He is also the Director of Clinical Training in the Graduate Department of Clinical Psychological Science.

==Career==
When he first started working on the [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) project, he was studying how depression alters a person's [[self-image]]. His research included measuring a depressed patient's self-image by calculating the time it took her to react to positive or negative information about her. David Kupfer, who was head of the [[Psychobiology]] of Depression Research Network of the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], asked Segal to create a "maintenance" version of [[cognitive therapy]] which could be used to fight depression relapse after one had recovered from an acute episode.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Teasdale, Williams, 2013, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; This need for a new therapy became Zindel Segal's new passion. He is the author of ''Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression''.

His research has helped to characterize psychological markers of relapse vulnerability to affective disorder. Among the books he has authored are Interpersonal Process in Cognitive Therapy, Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: A new approach for preventing relapse. A Founding Fellow of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, he was awarded the Douglas Utting Prize for significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of depression and the Hope Award by the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario.  He continues to advocate for the relevance of mindfulness-based clinical care in psychiatry and mental health.
