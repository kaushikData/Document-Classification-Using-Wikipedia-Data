'''ABKO Properties''' was a [[joint venture]] between [[Wichita, Kansas]] [[real estate]] entrepreneur George Ablah and Wichita-based [[Koch Industries]] formed specifically to purchase Chrysler Realty Corporation in the late 1970s from a hard-pressed [[Lee Iacocca]]. Koch Industries is ranked 2 among the Forbes list of largest private companies.  Chrysler Realty Corporation purchases, leases or options dealership facilities and then leases or subleases these facilities to Chrysler dealers. The name ABKO was derived from the first two letters of Ablah’s name and the first two letters of Charles Koch’s name, who is head of Koch Industries.  At the time ABKO was formed, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy.

==History==

ABKO purchased around 840 Chrysler [[Car dealerships in the USA|automotive dealership]] sites around the country controlled by Iacocca in 1979 for slightly over $100 million in cash.  Not all the sites were owned by Chrysler Realty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler's Realty Sale May Be Overly Touted|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1979/09/16/chryslers-realty-sale-may-be-overly-touted/9ca2d3dc-7163-42ae-844c-7a0f35ee3037/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Ablah and his team, Chrysler Realty president Ed Homer (for a brief time), executive vice president Corliss (Corky) Nelson of Koch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D10FF3B5C0C728CDDAB0894DA484D81|title=EXECUTIVES|date=1982-02-01|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquisition/disposition specialists Wayne Delfino and Frank Mills, and attorney John Schippel, among others, ABKO set forth a strategy to diversify Chrysler Realty Corporation by way of liquidating non-performing Chrysler dealership properties by tax-free exchange and sale.

In 1983, Iacocca, assisted by a government bailout he organized, repurchased 446 of the dealerships in a measure aimed at strengthening the Chrysler dealer network.  ABKO dissolved shortly thereafter.

'''Alain Dolium''' (born 11 December 1967) is a French businessman, politician and a member of the [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/2009-12-06/alain-dolium-une-tres-symbolique-tete-de-liste-modem-pour-l-ile/917/0/402204|title=Alain Dolium, une très symbolique tête de liste MoDem pour l'Ile-de-France, actualité Politique|last=ROCHICCIOLI|first=Pierre|date=12 June 2009|work=Le Point|language=French|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to [[Antillean]] parents, he declares himself 'multicultural'. He was a successful businessman, notably serving in think-tanks committed to the integration of French suburban youth through [[affirmative action]]. Politically, he declared that he voted for Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] in 2002 but for centrist candidate [[François Bayrou]] in the first round of 2007 election before voting for Socialist [[Ségolène Royal]] in the runoff. He joined Bayrou's [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] in 2008.

In 2009, he was selected to be the [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]]'s candidate in [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] for the [[French regional elections, 2010|2010 regional elections]].

"Saturday is Pay Day at the fruit-picking camp. Boy Scouts queue up in a pay parade to collect their pocket money from the Scout master.

An '''allowance''' is an amount of [[money]] given or allotted usually at regular intervals for a specific purpose.  In the context of children, parents may provide an allowance ([[British English]]: '''pocket money''') to their child for their miscellaneous personal spending.  In the construction industry it may be an amount allocated to a specific item of work as part of an overall contract.

The person providing the allowance is usually trying to control how or when money is spent by the recipient so that it meets the aims of the person providing the money.  For example, an allowance by a parent might be motivated to teach the child [[money management]] and may be unconditional or be tied to completion of chores or achievement of specific [[Grading (education)|grades]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= May 20, 2011|url = http://money.msn.com/family-money/allowances-welfare-for-kids-weston.aspx|title = Allowances: 'Welfare' for kids?|format = |publisher = [[CNN]]| accessdate = October 4, 2012 | last=Weston| first= Liz|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person supplying the allowance usually specifies the purpose and may put controls in place to make sure that the money is spent for that purpose only.  For example, a company employee may be given an allowance or [[per diem]] to provide for meals and travel when working away from home and may then be required to provide [[receipts]] as proof. Or they are provided with specific non-money tokens or vouchers that can be used only for a specific purpose such as a [[meal voucher]].

==Types of allowance==

===Allowances in business===

====Construction contracting====
In [[construction]], an allowance is an amount specified and included in the construction [[contract]] (or specifications) for a certain item of work (e.g., appliances, lighting, etc.) whose details are not yet determined at the time of contracting. Typically:
# the allowance amount covers the cost of the contractor's material/equipment delivered to the project plus all taxes less any trade discounts to which the contractor may be entitled with respect to the item of work;
# the contractor's costs for labor (installation), overhead, profit and other expenses with respect to the allowance item are included in the base contract amount but not in the allowance amount;
# if the section 1 costs for the item of work are higher (or lower) than the allowance amount, the base contract amount should be increased (decreased) by the difference in the two amounts and by the change (if any) to the contractor's costs under section 2.

The allowance provisions may be handled otherwise in the contract: e.g., the flooring allowance may state that installation costs are part of the allowance. The contractor may be required to produce records of the original takeoff or estimate of the section 2 costs for each allowance item.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11600">'''Bayesian search theory''' is the application of [[Bayesian statistics]] to the search for lost objects. It has been used several times to find lost sea vessels, for example the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']]. It also played a key role in the recovery of the flight recorders in the [[Air France Flight 447]] disaster of 2009.  Currently, it is being used to locate the remains of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/find-mh370-next-job-for-theory-used-to-show-existence-of-god|title = How an Eighteenth-Century Statistician Is Helping to Find MH370|last = AngusWhitley1|first = Angus Whitley|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/mh370/12030483/MH370-search-narrowed-to-hot-spot-as-analysis-finds-plane-did-not-conduct-controlled-landing.html|title = MH370 search narrowed to 'hot-spot' as analysis finds plane did not conduct controlled landing|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-02/mh370-hunters-say-new-analysis-reaffirms-most-likely-wreck-site|title = MH370 Hunters Narrow Down Most Likely Site of Wreckage|last = AngusWhitley1|first = Angus Whitley|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The usual procedure is as follows:
# Formulate as many reasonable hypotheses as possible about what may have happened to the object.
# For each hypothesis, construct a [[probability density function]] for the location of the object.
# Construct a function giving the probability of actually finding an object in location&amp;nbsp;X when searching there if it really is in location&amp;nbsp;X. In an ocean search, this is usually a function of water depth — in shallow water chances of finding an object are good if the search is in the right place. In deep water chances are reduced.
# Combine the above information coherently to produce an overall probability density map. (Usually this simply means multiplying the two functions together.) This gives the probability of finding the object by looking in location&amp;nbsp;X, for all possible locations&amp;nbsp;X. (This can be visualized as a [[contour map]] of probability.)
# Construct a search path which starts at the point of highest probability and 'scans' over high probability areas, then intermediate probabilities, and finally low probability areas.
# Revise all the probabilities continuously during the search. For example, if the hypotheses for location&amp;nbsp;X imply the likely disintegration of the object and the search at location&amp;nbsp;X has yielded no fragments, then the probability that the object is somewhere around there is greatly reduced (though not usually to zero) while the probabilities of its being at other locations is correspondingly increased. The revision process is done by applying [[Bayes' theorem]].

In other words, first search where it most probably will be found, then search where finding it is less probable, then search where the probability is even less (but still possible due to limitations on fuel, range, water currents, etc.), until insufficient hope of locating the object at acceptable cost remains.

The advantages of the Bayesian method are that all information available is used coherently (i.e., in a "leak-proof" manner) and the method automatically produces estimates of the cost for a given success probability. That is, even before the start of searching, one can say, hypothetically, "there is a 65% chance of finding it in a 5-day search. That probability will rise to 90% after a 10-day search and 97% after 15&amp;nbsp;days" or a similar statement. Thus the economic viability of the search can be estimated before committing resources to a search.

Apart from the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']], other vessels located by Bayesian search theory include the [[MV Derbyshire|MV&amp;nbsp;''Derbyshire'']], the largest British vessel ever lost at sea, and the [[SS Central America|SS&amp;nbsp;''Central America'']]. It also proved successful in the search for a lost [[hydrogen bomb]] following the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] in Spain, and the recovery in the Atlantic Ocean of the crashed [[Air France Flight 447]].

Bayesian search theory is incorporated into the CASP (Computer Assisted Search Program) mission planning software used by the [[United States Coast Guard]] for [[search and rescue]]. This program was later adapted for inland search by adding terrain and ground cover factors for use by the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Civil Air Patrol]].

==Mathematics==

Suppose a grid square has a probability ''p'' of containing the wreck and that the probability of successfully detecting the wreck if it is there is ''q''. If the square is searched and no wreck is found, then, by Bayes' theorem, the revised probability of the wreck being in the square is given by

: &lt;math&gt;  p' = \frac{p(1-q)}{(1-p)+p(1-q)} = p \frac{1-q}{1-pq} &lt; p.&lt;/math&gt;
For every other grid square, if its prior probability is ''r'', its posterior probability is given by

: &lt;math&gt; r' = r \frac{1}{1- pq} &gt; r. &lt;/math&gt;

===USS ''Scorpion''===

In May 1968, the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[nuclear submarine]] [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'' (SSN-589)]] failed to arrive as expected at her home port of [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. The command officers of the U.S. Navy were nearly convinced that the vessel had been lost off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]],  but an extensive search there failed to discover the remains of ''Scorpion''.

Then, a Navy deep-water expert, [[John Craven USN|John P. Craven]], suggested that ''Scorpion'' had sunk elsewhere. Craven organised a search southwest of the [[Azores]] based on a controversial approximate triangulation by [[hydrophone]]s. He was allocated only a single ship, [[USNS Mizar (AGOR-11)|''Mizar'']], and he took advice from a firm of consultant mathematicians in order to maximise his resources. A Bayesian search methodology was adopted. Experienced submarine commanders were interviewed to construct hypotheses about what could have caused the loss of ''Scorpion''.

The sea area was divided up into grid squares and a probability assigned to each square, under each of the hypotheses, to give a number of probability grids, one for each hypothesis. These were then added together to produce an overall probability grid. The probability attached to each square was then the probability that the wreck was in that square. A second grid was constructed with probabilities that represented the probability of successfully finding the wreck if that square were to be searched and the wreck were to be actually there. This was a known function of water depth. The result of combining this grid with the previous grid is a grid which gives the probability of finding the wreck in each grid square of the sea if it were to be searched.

At the end of October 1968, the Navy's oceanographic research ship, {{USNS|Mizar|AGOR-11|2}}, located sections of the hull of ''Scorpion'' on the seabed, about {{convert|740|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the [[Azores]],&lt;ref name=pshow&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 "Strange Devices That Found the Sunken Sub Scorpion."] ''Popular Science'', April 1969, pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; under more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water. This was after the Navy had released sound tapes from its underwater "[[SOSUS]]" listening system, which contained the sounds of the destruction of ''Scorpion''. The court of inquiry was subsequently reconvened and other vessels, including the [[bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste II|''Trieste II'']], were dispatched to the scene, collecting many pictures and other data.

Although Craven received much credit for locating the wreckage of ''Scorpion'', Gordon Hamilton, an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of [[hydroacoustics]] to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, was instrumental in defining a compact "search box" wherein the wreck was ultimately found. Hamilton had established a listening station in the Canary Islands that obtained a clear signal of what some scientists believe was the noise of the vessel's pressure hull imploding as she passed [[crush depth]]. A [[Naval Research Laboratory]] scientist named Chester "Buck" Buchanan, using a towed camera sled of his own design aboard ''Mizar'', finally located ''Scorpion''.&lt;ref name=pshow/&gt; The towed camera sled, which was fabricated by J. L. "Jac" Hamm of Naval Research Laboratory's Engineering Services Division, is housed in the [[National Museum of the United States Navy]]. Buchanan had located the wrecked hull of [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|''Thresher'']] in 1964 using this technique.

==Optimal distribution of search effort==

The classical book on this subject ''The Theory of Optimal Search'' ([[Operations Research Society of America]], 1975) by [[Lawrence D. Stone]] won the 1975 [[Lanchester Prize]] by the American Operations Research Society.

==Searching in boxes==

Assume that a stationary object is hidden in one of n boxes. For each box &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; there are three known parameters: the cost of a single
search at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;; the probability of finding the object by a single search at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if it is at this location, &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;; and the probability that the object is at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;. A searcher looks for the object. They know the a priori probabilities at the beginning and update them by Bayes’ law after each (unsuccessful) attempt.
The problem of finding the object in minimal expected cost is a classical problem
solved by [[David Blackwell]]. Surprisingly, the optimal policy is easy to describe: at each stage look into the location which maximizes
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_i a_i}{c_i}&lt;/math&gt;. This is actually a special case of [[Gittins index]].

'''Branco Weiss''' (23 April 1929 in [[Zagreb]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] &amp;ndash; 31 October 2010 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]) was a Swiss entrepreneur and [[patron]].

==Life==
Weiss was born into a Jewish family from the Austrian province [[Burgenland]] which had settled in [[Croatia in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Croatia]]. After his father's death at the hand of the [[Ustaše|fascists]] in 1943, Weiss fled with his mother to [[Italy]] and later to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/tue_gutes_und_rechne_scharf_1.5431395.html | title = Tue Gutes und rechne scharf | accessdate = 2011-01-15 | last = Weiss | first = Branco | date = 2010-04-13 | work = Neue Zürcher Zeitung | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While growing up in a town on the shore of [[Lake Constance]], he studied literature, art and history and developed an interest in natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phzh.ch/webautor-data/402/081031_Laudatio_Oelkers.pdf | title = Laudatio auf Branco Weiss zur Verleihung des Zürcher Bildungspreises 2008 | accessdate = 2010-12-23 | last = Oelkers | first = Jürgen | year = 2008 | language = German | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001758/http://www.phzh.ch/webautor-data/402/081031_Laudatio_Oelkers.pdf# | archive-date = 7 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his high-school diploma in Glarisegg in 1947. Subsequently, he enrolled at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH) in Zurich and graduated there with a degree in chemical engineering in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/archive_articles/101101_nachruf_branco_weiss_tl/index_EN | title = The great industrialist and patron Branco Weiss dies aged 81

Weiss wrote a thesis on the [[cost-benefit analysis]] in the field of [[Filter (chemistry)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phzh.ch/webautor-data/402/081031_Laudatio_Oelkers.pdf | title = Laudatio auf Branco Weiss zur Verleihung des Zürcher Bildungspreises 2008 | accessdate = 2010-12-23 | last = Oelkers | first = Jürgen | year = 2008 | language = German | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001758/http://www.phzh.ch/webautor-data/402/081031_Laudatio_Oelkers.pdf# | archive-date = 7 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Weiss has established several national and international high-tech companies. [[Kontron]], a company he founded in 1959, was acquired by Hoffmann-La Roche in 1974. He was also the founder of Esec, a provider of semiconductor components that BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. acquired from [[OC Oerlikon]] in 2009. These companies were amongst the pioneers of the computer industry. Weiss was the founder and past president of the Swiss Venture Capital Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ionewmanagement.ch/de/artikelanzeige/artikelanzeige.asp?pkBerichtNr=145636 | title = Was die KMU brauchen, ist Mut | accessdate = 2011-01-15 | last = Weiss | first = Branco | date = 2007-02-27 | work = Handelszeitung | language = German | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234417/http://www.ionewmanagement.ch/de/artikelanzeige/artikelanzeige.asp?pkBerichtNr=145636# | archive-date = 6 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Weiss was a frequent lecturer on innovation and high-tech entrepreneurships. He held lectures at the [[ETH Zurich]] from 1985 to 1994 on "Technological Strategies" and on "Management of New Companies". He was a board member and honorary member of the Swiss Academy of Engineering Science, an honorary member of the Swiss Engineers and Architects Society as well as the Alumni Association of ETH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/archive_articles/101101_nachruf_branco_weiss_tl/index_EN | title = The great industrialist and patron Branco Weiss dies aged 81
| accessdate = 2011-01-15 | last = Weiss | first = Branco | date = 2010-11-01 | work = ETH Life | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Weiss patronized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/kultur/aktuell/die_muehseligkeit_der_menschlichen_existenz_erleichtern_1.7321950.html | title = Die Mühseligkeit der menschlichen Existenz erleichtern | accessdate = 2010-12-23 | last = Weiss | first = Branco | date = 2010-08-25 | work = Neue Zürcher Zeitung | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; several universities and numerous cultural projects.

In 1987 Weiss together with [[Swatch]] founder [[Nicolas Hayek]] initiated the Swiss Technology Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ch-innovation.ch/index.cfm?sef=1,390,33,62,0,1,1 | title = The history of the Swiss Innovation Forum | accessdate = 2010-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jointly with Israel's Ministry of Education, he founded the Branco Weiss Institute in Israel in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brancoweiss.org.il/e/ | title = Branco Weiss Institute, Israel | accessdate = 2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute consists of 12 schools that promote learning competencies and thinking abilities to students and teachers.

In 2002, Weiss founded [https://brancoweissfellowship.org Society in Science – The Branco Weiss Fellowship], a [[fellow]]ship for researchers shortly after their PhD from around the globe. The grant enables postdocs to work on a research topic of their choice for up to five years. In Spring 2010 he handed this organization worth 20 million Swiss francs over to the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bilanz.ch/leserservice/300reichste.asp?Session=FE4CE9D0-57E7-46DE-967C-BC34AE627ACB&amp;CID=110&amp;CPID=0 | title = 300 reichste Schweizer, Bilanz 2010 | accessdate = 2011-02-02 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowship’s research projects receive broad media coverage. Its fellows work on research projects that affect society, such as the analysis of how diseases spread through communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.discovery.com/human/disease-spread-high-school-model101213.html | title = Busy high school model shows how diseases spread | accessdate = 2011-02-01 | last = Bland | first = Eric | date = 2010-12-13 | work = Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how stress affects ageing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2010/1118/1224283615717.html | title = Measuring the effects of stress on the ageing process | accessdate = 2011-02-01 | last = Cormac | first = Sheridan | date = 2010-11-18 | work = The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 fellow Riley Crane together with his research team at [[MIT]] won the [[DARPA Network Challenge]]. The Pentagon Prize was organized by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] for developing new ways to understand how information is spread through social networks. According to his research team this technique could be used for finding criminals and missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/technology/internet/07contest.html?_r=1 | title = With Lure of Cash, M.I.T.

Weiss also donated 23 million Swiss francs in 2004 to the ETH’s “[[ETH Zurich#Science City|Science City]]” - an infrastructure project that helps transform the additional ETH campus built in the outskirts of Zurich into an attractive district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/tue_gutes_und_rechne_scharf_1.5431395.html | title = Tue Gutes und rechne scharf | accessdate = 2011-01-15 | last = Weiss | first = Branco | date = 2010-04-13 | work = Neue Zürcher Zeitung | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 the Branco Weiss Information Science Laboratory, a state-of-the-art building in Science City, was inaugurated.

Dr. Weiss made one of the largest donations to [[Central European University]] (CEU) and also was a member of the team that developed the strategic plan of the University, which was applied in 2003. In 2004 he helped with the initial accreditation of the CEU by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ceu.hu/news/2010-11-02/dr-branco-weiss-23-april-1929-%E2%80%93-31-october-2010 | title = Central European University News Room | accessdate = 2011-02-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721104419/http://www.ceu.hu/news/2010-11-02/dr-branco-weiss-23-april-1929-%E2%80%93-31-october-2010# | archive-date = 21 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEU is ranked 22nd on the European Top Business Schools 2010 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.topmba.com/mba-rankings/top-business-schools-report-2010/regions/top-business-schools-in-europe | title = European TOP Business Schools 2010 | accessdate = 2011-02-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120913023124/http://www.topmba.com/mba-rankings/top-business-schools-report-2010/regions/top-business-schools-in-europe | archivedate = 13 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buffett Rule''' is part of a tax plan proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Carrie Budoff Brown. [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63756.html "Obama's 'Buffett Rule' to call for higher tax rate for millionaires".] ''[[Politico]]'', September 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The tax plan would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than one million dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buffett Rule: a Basic Principle of Tax Fairness |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/Buffett_Rule_Report_Final.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Economic Council]] |date=April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s2059is/pdf/BILLS-112s2059is.pdf|title=S.2059 - Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a White House official, the new tax rate would directly affect 0.3 percent of taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Distribution of Average Tax Rates (Individual Income Tax and Employee Payroll Tax) Buffett Rule.JPG|thumb|Distribution of average tax rates including individual income tax and employee payroll tax.]]

The Buffett Rule is named after American investor [[Warren Buffett]], who publicly stated in early 2011 that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html|title=Stop Coddling the Super-Rich|last=Buffett|first=Warren|date=August 14, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket, to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14962769 | title=US economy: New Obama plan to tax wealthiest | work=BBC News | date=September 18, 2011 | accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Senate leader [[Harry Reid]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–[[Nevada|Nev.]]) proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on everyone making over a million dollars a year to pay for new stimulus provisions, but the change did not go through.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Tapper. [https://news.yahoo.com/buffett-rule-tax-set-30-percent-obama-speech-023903437.html "Buffett rule tax set at 30 percent: Obama speech’".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128110435/http://news.yahoo.com/buffett-rule-tax-set-30-percent-obama-speech-023903437.html |date=January 28, 2012 }} ''[[Yahoo News]]'', January 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A White House statement released in January 2012 defined the rule as part of "measures to ensure everyone making over a million dollars a year pays a minimum [[Tax rate#Effective|effective tax rate]] of at least 30 percent ... implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions."&lt;ref name=ctj/&gt; The White House also stated that "no household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/economy/buffett-rule |title=The Buffett Rule &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffett Rule was not in the President's 2012 budget proposal and the White House initially stressed it as a guideline rather than a legislative initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Lowrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/us/politics/white-house-sees-buffett-tax-rule-more-as-a-guide.html "The Buffett Tax Rule Is Really More of a Guideline".] ''[[New York Times]]'', February 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule, however, was later submitted for deliberation as [[US Senate]] Bill S. 2059, ''Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012''.&lt;ref name="gpo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2230:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status  -  112th Congress (2011 - 2012)  - S.2230 - THOMAS (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2012, the bill received 51 affirmative votes, but was stopped by a Republican [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] that required 60 votes to proceed to debate and a vote on final passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerist.com/2012/04/senate-blocks-buffett-rule-with-51-45-vote.html|title=Senate Blocks Buffett Rule With 51-45 Vote|work=Consumerist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-04-16/senate-fails-to-pass-buffett-rule/54324786/1 |title= Bill defeat | work=USA Today | date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible effects==

If enacted, the rule change would result in $36.7 billion per year in additional tax revenue ($367 billion over the next decade), according to a January 2012 analysis by the [[Tax Foundation]], a [[think tank]].&lt;ref name=boak&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=3B1556AF-A13F-476F-AD68-42FA17D5C0CA|title=Buffett Rule's impact?

For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation assumes that many high-income taxpayers would reduce the amount of capital gains realized in one year to fall beneath the Buffett Rule threshold.

The estimated $47 billion would offset by 0.7% the $6.4 trillion increase in spending over the next decade estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, based on President Obama's 2013 budget plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buffett Rule Tax Bill Would Raise $47 Billion Over 10 Years |author=Richard Rubin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-20/buffett-rule-tax-bill-would-raise-31-billion-over-10-years |work=Businessweek |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the higher estimate from the Tax Foundation, the estimated $367 billion would offset by 5.7% the $6.4 trillion spending over the next decade.

The 2013 budget proposed by the Obama administration stated that the Buffett Rule should replace the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=
Cutting Waste, Reducing the Deficit, and Asking All to Pay Their Fair Share |author= |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/cutting.pdf |work=Office of Management and Budget |date=n.d. |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that the Buffett Rule plus the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax would increase the deficit by $793.3 billion in the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

Part of the reason for the inequality in taxation is that revenue from long-term [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains]] is taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Government Subsidizes Wealth Inequality |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/report/2014/06/25/92656/how-the-government-subsidizes-wealth-inequality/|work=Center for American Progress |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=Aug 1, 2014 |first=Harry |last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's not entirely clear how many individuals would be affected by the change. An October 2011 study by the [[Congressional Research Service]] found that a 30% minimum tax rate rule would mean up to 200,000 taxpayers, equivalent to 0.06% of all U.S. citizens, paying more.&lt;ref name=boak/&gt;

==Reactions and public opinion==

===Support===
[[Paul Krugman]], a ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, wrote in January 2012 that "such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/politics-policy-and-public-interest/2012/apr/30/case-buffett-rule/
|title=The Case for the Buffett Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "the economic record certainly doesn’t support the notion that superlow taxes on the superrich are the key to prosperity" asserting that since the U.S. economy added 11.5 million jobs during President Bill Clinton's first term, when the capital gains tax rate was over 29 percent, he thinks there's no real reason to keep from raising the tax rate.&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Paul Krugman]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/opinion/krugman-taxes-at-the-top.html|title=Taxes at the Top|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[CBS News]]/''[[New York Times]]'' poll released in January 2012 found that 52 percent of Americans agreed that investments should be taxed at the same rate as income.&lt;ref name=caldwell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57365416-503544/obama-details-buffett-rule-says-millionaires-should-pay-at-least-30-percent-tax-rate/|title=Obama details "Buffett Rule," says millionaires should pay at least 30 percent tax rate|publisher=[[CBS News]]|first=Leigh Ann|last=Caldwell|date=January 25, 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll released in April 2012 also found that 60 percent of Americans support the rule.

===Opposition=== 
Representative [[Paul Ryan]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]–[[Wisconsin|Wis.]]), who is the chairman of the [[House Budget Committee]], criticized the new tax provisions.

Established in 1993 and based in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], their twice daily business alerts reach 45,000 email addresses and the paper has a total weekly circulation of 10,100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Alliance of Area Business Publications Membership Overview | url = http://www.bizpubs.org/rpt_members.asp | accessdate = 2007-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and readership of 28,280.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen 2008, as quoted on Business News website&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper was founded by Harry Kleyn and his business partners Vanguard Press as a [[fortnight]]ly free [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] newspaper in Perth.  In 2000, after finding new investors, the paper developed a digital edition and changed to weekly circulation. The new investors were represented on the operational side by Elton Swarts, the current Executive Chairman. The Editorial Department was also expanded.  ''Business News'' moved to a subscription model in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | title = WA Business News Corporate History | url = http://www.wabusinessnews.com.au/corphistory.php | accessdate = 2007-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Business News'' also hosts the ''Success &amp; Leadership'' breakfast series throughout the year, featuring highly regarded Western Australian business leaders, speaking about their own professional and personal journey of success.

In 2013, the company re-branded to the new ''Business News'' name and expanded its pay wall around the digital assets. Subscribers have complete access to the web site, article archive and online Book of Lists. Registered Users can view up to 8 articles a month in a metered model before the pay wall kicks in. It still publishes a fortnightly fully colour business [http://www.businessnews.com.au/current-issue newspaper].&lt;ref&gt;Business News website, 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the founder of the accessories and jewelry company [[Alex and Ani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunn|first1=Laura|title=Women in Business Q&amp;A: Carolyn Rafaelian, Founder, CEO and CCO, Alex and Ani|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-dunn/women-in-business-qa-caro_b_9753484.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the owner of the [[Belcourt of Newport]] and Carolyn's Sakonnet Vineyards.

==Background==
Rafaelian's father opened a jewelry factory in 1966, in which Rafaelian and her sister worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracey Samuelson |url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/rhode-island-hard-hit-recession-slow-recover |title=Rhode Island, hard hit by recession, slow to recover |website=Marketplace.org |date=2015-04-23 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time she helped her father design pieces and produced original designs herself for her father's jewelry manufacturing company&lt;ref name=PD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegloss.com/2009/06/30/fashion/interviewcarolyn-rafaelian-of-alex-and-ani/ |date=June 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |publisher=''The Gloss'' |title=Interview: Carolyn Rafaelian of Alex and Ani |author=Michelle Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinerama. She attended Prout Memorial High School for Girls (later known as [[The Prout School]]). She attended the [[University of Rhode Island]] between 1987 and 1989, and then she transferred to and graduated from the [[American College in Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=uri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/quadangles/features/alex-ani-a-vital-force-in-rhode-island/ |title=Alex &amp; Ani: A Vital Force in Rhode Island |date=Spring 2012 |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |publisher=''Quad Angles''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 she joined her father's business, and eventually began to work on her own line. In 2002 Rafaelian became co-owner of Cinerama with her sister.

==Early life==
Wiese studied at [[Paarl Boys' High School]] in the [[Western Cape]] region of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabsa.co.za/presses/7.pdf Article about the richest men in South Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205083922/http://www.sabsa.co.za/presses/7.pdf |date=5 February 2013 }} at Sabsa.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; Wiese attended [[Stellenbosch University]], from where he received BA and LLB degrees.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Career==
After university, Wiese practised law at the Cape Bar for some years before working as a Director at [[Pepkor]], the discount clothing chain that his parents helped to found.&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Meet South African Billionaire Christo Wiese, Mr. Shoprite|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2012/07/24/meet-south-african-billionaire-christo-wiese-mr-shoprite/|accessdate=8 January 2015|work=Forbes|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his leadership, [[Shoprite (South Africa)|Shoprite]] started out as a chain of eight supermarkets in [[Cape Town]] that was purchased for 1 million [[South African rand|rand]] (equivalent to $122,000 USD) which grew into a multibillion-dollar business due to various acquisitions and expansion strategies made in the first 30 years of operations. After playing a role in helping Shoprite acquire distributor Senta, Wiese started expanding his business into [[franchising]] new locations for Shoprite department stores.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web

In April 2015, it was reported that [[Virgin Group]] and their private equity backers had sold 80% of [[Virgin Active]] to the South African investment firm [[Brait]], owned by Wiese. The sale price will be £682 million for an 80% stake, valuing the business at £1.3 billion, including debt, and the transaction should be completed in summer 2015, and the company will continue to operate under the Virgin Active brand.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kollewe|first1=Julia|title=Virgin Active stake sold to South Africa's Brait for £682m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/virgin-active-stake-sold-to-south-africas-brait|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lanzerac Manor &amp; Winery===
Wiese bought a South African farm dating back from the 19th century in 1991, and converted it into a [[Star (classification)|five-star]] hotel, ''[[Lanzerac Manor &amp; Winery]]'', with 48 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanzerac.co.za/ Lanzerac Manor &amp; Winery information] at Lanzerac.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; He later sold the property to a foreign investment firm for an undisclosed sum on 7 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin24.com/Companies/TravelAndLeisure/Wiese-sells-Lanzerac-to-foreigners-20120307 Wiese sells Lanzerac to foreigners] at Fin24&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2012, it was reported that Wiese owed [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]] an estimated R2 billion in back taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining.com/south-africas-third-wealthiest-man-owes-the-taxman-250-million-53346/ ''South Africa’s third wealthiest man owes the taxman $250 million''] at Mining.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/Mr-Peps-R2bn-tax-bill-20120812|title=Christo Wiese's R2bn tax bill|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiese faced a legal battle to recover $1 million that he was carrying while boarding a flight from England to Luxembourg in 2009. This amount was confiscated by customs officers as the sum was in hard cash bundled up in rubber bands in his luggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/06/27/billionaire-christo-wiese-south-africa-richest-cash-luggage/#1af3573c50c4|title=This Is What Happens When A Billionaire Tries To Get On A Plane With $1 Million Cash In His Luggage|last=O'Connor|first=Clare|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''company mortgage''' (Företagshypotek) is a particular Swedish collateral right, which replaced the company [[Personal property|chattel]] pledge (Företagsinteckning) : on January 1, 2009.

A company or a (natural or legal) person that intends to run a business can pledge a company mortgage by registering a specific amount in the corporate mortgage register. The pledge is not tied to a particular property at a particular point in time. Instead the property can change over time. The idea behind this is the entrepreneur's personal property can be used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for credit without him or her having to give up having the assets at his or her disposal.

The register is kept by the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Bolagsverket), which issues proof of the registered pledge, called a mortgage letter (Inteckningsbrev). This proof can be either written or electronic. A written mortgage letter is pledged when the businessman hands it over as collateral to a creditor. An electronic mortgage letter is deemed to be pledged when the creditor has been registered as the bearer (holder) of the mortgage letter.

The company mortgage gives special priority rights on a businessman’s personal property that belongs to the business other than cash or bank funds, stock or other publicly traded [[financial instrument]]s, property that cannot be seized or be included in a bankruptcy, or property that can be pledged in other ways, such as aircraft and ships during both the seizure of assets and bankruptcy under §5 of the Priority Rights Act (Förmånsrättslagen). A company mortgage pledged before another company mortgage has priority. Company mortgages pledged on the same day have equal rights. At the request of the bearer of a company mortgage letter, the holding can be registered in the corporate mortgage register.

A decision by the registration authority may be appealed to District Court ([[Tingsrätt]]). In the appeal the Act on Court Cases (Lagen om Domstolsärenden) is applied. Anyone wishing to appeal a decision of the registration authority should do so in writing. The letter must be submitted to the registration authority.

The provisions relating to the company mortgage imply a return to the rules on company mortgages that applied before 2004.

'''Corona treatment''' (sometimes referred to as '''air plasma''') is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature [[corona discharge]] plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes is often used to create a curtain of corona plasma.  Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material.  All materials have an inherent [[surface energy]].  Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries.

==History==
The corona treatment was invented by the Danish engineer Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked by one of his customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to print on plastic. 
Verner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new corona treatment system.

==Materials==
Many [[plastics]], such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]], have chemically inert and nonporous surfaces with low [[surface tension]]s causing them to be non-receptive to bonding with printing [[ink]]s, [[coating]]s, and [[adhesive]]s. Although results are invisible to the naked eye, surface treating modifies surfaces to improve adhesion.

Polyethylene, polypropylene, [[nylon]], [[Vinyl polymer|vinyl]], [[PVC]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], metalized surfaces, foils, paper, and [[paperboard]] stocks are commonly treated by this method. It is safe, economical, and delivers high line speed throughput. Corona treatment is also suitable for the treatment of [[Injection molding|injection]] and [[Blow molding|blow]] molded parts, and is capable of treating multiple surfaces and difficult parts with a single pass. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Equipment==
Corona discharge equipment consists of a [[high-frequency]] power generator, a [[high-voltage]] [[transformer]], a stationary [[electrode]], and a treater ground roll.  Standard utility electrical power is converted into higher frequency power which is then supplied to the treater station. The treater station applies this power through [[ceramic]] or [[metal]] electrodes over an air gap onto the material’s surface.

Two basic corona treater stations are used in [[extrusion coating]] applications—''Bare Roll'' and ''Covered Roll''. On a bare roll treater station, the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a covered roll station, it encapsulates the treater base roll. The treater consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a covered roll treater is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll treater is used to treat conductive webs. However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Corona Treating for Coating Applications | url = http://www.faustel.com/technical-library/corona-treating-for-coating-applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-treatment==
Many substrates provide a better bonding surface when they are treated at the time they are produced. This is called “pre-treatment.” The effects of corona treatment diminish over time.  Therefore many surfaces will require a second “bump” treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.

==Other technologies==
Other technologies used for surface treatment include in-line atmospheric (air) plasma, flame plasma, and chemical plasma systems.

===Atmospheric plasma treatment===
[[Atmospheric-pressure plasma]] treatment is very similar to corona treatment but there are a few differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric plasma treatment technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment.

===Flame plasma===
Flame plasma treaters generate more heat than other treating processes, but materials treated through this method tend to have a longer shelf-life. These plasma systems are different from air plasma systems because flame plasma occurs when flammable gas and surrounding air are combusted into an intense blue flame. Objects’ surfaces are [[Polarizability|polarized]] from the flame plasma affecting the distribution of the surface’s [[electron]]s in an [[oxidation]] form.  This treatment requires higher temperatures so many of the materials that are treated with a flame plasma can be damaged.

===Chemical plasma===
Chemical plasma is based on the combination of air plasma and flame plasma. Much like air plasma, chemical plasma fields are generated from electrically charged air. But, instead of air, chemical plasma relies on a mixture of other gases depositing various [[chemical group]]s onto the treated surface.

{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

''' ''De facto'' corporation''' and '''corporation by estoppel''' are both terms that are used by [[court]]s in most [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s to describe circumstances in which a business organization that has failed to become a '''[[De jure corporation|''de jure'' corporation]]''' (a corporation by law) will nonetheless be treated as a corporation, thereby shielding [[shareholder]]s from liability.

==''De facto'' corporation==
In order for a ''de facto'' corporation to be created, the following elements must exist:

#There must be an incorporation [[statute]] that lays out the various requirements under which legal incorporation can be accomplished;
#There must have been a good faith attempt to comply with the statute by the intended incorporators;
#:For example, if the [[articles of incorporation]] were mailed to the appropriate office, but addressed to the wrong person, lost in the mail, or not filed by the corporation by the time the corporation began acting in an official capacity.
#There must have been an act made on the corporation's behalf by its purported officers or [[agency (law)|agents]].

If all of these requirements are met, then the business will be treated as a corporation for all purposes, except with respect to acts by the state itself. However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a  person who was ''aware'' that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation.

==Corporation by estoppel==
Corporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business ''as if it were'' a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be [[estoppel|estopped]] from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant.

==Differences between ''de facto'' corporation and corporation by estoppel==
Both doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort.  The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.

'''Eight disciplines''' ('''8Ds''') '''problem solving''' is a method developed at [[Ford Motor Company]] used to approach and to resolve problems, typically employed by engineers or other professionals. Focused on product and process improvement, its purpose is to identify, correct, and eliminate recurring problems. It establishes a permanent corrective action based on statistical analysis of the problem and on the origin of the problem by determining the [[root cause]]s. Although it originally comprised eight stages, or 'disciplines', it was later augmented by an initial planning stage. 8D follows the logic of the [[PDCA cycle]]. The disciplines are:
  
:D0: '''Preparation and Emergency Response Actions''': Plan for solving the problem and determine the prerequisites.  Provide Emergency response Actions
:D1: '''Use a Team''': Establish a team of people with product/process knowledge.
:D2: '''Describe the Problem''': Specify the problem by identifying in quantifiable terms the who, what, where, when, why, how, and how many (5W2H) for the problem.
:D3: '''Develop Interim Containment Plan''': Define and implement containment actions to isolate the problem from any customer.
:D4: '''Determine and Verify Root Causes and Escape Points''': Identify all applicable causes that could explain why the problem has occurred. Also identify why the problem was not noticed at the time it occurred. All causes shall be verified or proved. One can use [[five whys]] or [[Ishikawa diagram]]s to map causes against the effect or problem identified.
:D5: '''Verify Permanent Corrections (PCs) for Problem will resolve problem for the customer''': Using pre-production programs, quantitatively confirm that the selected correction will resolve the problem. (Verify that the correction will actually solve the problem.)
:D6: '''Define and Implement Corrective Actions''': Define and Implement the best corrective actions.
:D7: '''Prevent Recurrence / System Problems''': Modify the management systems, operation systems, practices, and procedures to prevent recurrence of this and similar problems.
:D8: '''Congratulate the Main Contributors to your Team''': Recognize the collective efforts of the team. The team needs to be formally thanked by the organization.
8Ds has become a standard in the automotive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/eight-disciplines-8d/index.html Eight Disciplines (8D)]&lt;/ref&gt; assembly, and other industries that require a thorough structured problem-solving process using a team approach.

==Ford Motor Company's team-oriented problem solving==

The executives of the Powertrain Organization ([[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]s, [[chassis]], [[engine]]s) wanted a methodology where teams (design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and production) could work on recurring chronic problems. In 1986, the assignment was given to develop a manual and a subsequent course that would achieve a new approach to solving identified engineering design and manufacturing problems. The manual for this methodology was documented and defined in ''Team Oriented Problem Solving'' (TOPS), first published in 1987. The manual and subsequent course material were piloted at [[Ford World Headquarters]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].  Ford refers to their current variant as G8D (Global 8D). The Ford 8Ds manual is extensive and covers chapter by chapter how to go about addressing, quantifying, and resolving engineering issues. It begins with a cross-functional team and concludes with a successful demonstrated resolution of the problem. Containment actions may or may not be needed based on where the problem occurred in the life cycle of the product.

==Usage==

Many disciplines are typically involved in the "8Ds" methodology.  The tools used can be found in textbooks and reference materials used by [[quality assurance]] professionals. For example, an "Is/Is Not" worksheet is a common tool employed at D2, and Ishikawa, or "fishbone," diagrams and "5-why analysis" are common tools employed at step D4.
In the late 1990s, Ford developed a revised version of the 8D process that they call "Global 8D" (G8D), which is the current global standard for Ford and many other companies in the automotive supply chain. The major revisions to the process are as follows:

* Addition of a D0 (D-Zero) step as a gateway to the process. At D0, the team documents the symptoms that initiated the effort along with any emergency response actions (ERAs) that were taken before formal initiation of the G8D. D0 also incorporates standard assessing questions meant to determine whether a full G8D is required. The assessing questions are meant to ensure that in a world of limited problem-solving resources, the efforts required for a full team-based problem-solving effort are limited to those problems that warrant these resources.
* Addition of the notion of escape points to D4 through D6. An 'escape point' is the earliest control point in the control system following the root cause of a problem that should have detected that problem but failed to do so. The idea here is to consider not only the root cause, but also what went wrong with the control system in allowing this problem to escape. Global 8D requires the team to identify and verify an escape point at D4. Then, through D5 and D6, the process requires the team to choose, verify, implement, and validate permanent corrective actions to address the escape point.

Recently, the 8D process has been employed significantly outside the auto industry. As part of lean initiatives and continuous-improvement processes it is employed extensively in the food manufacturing, health care, and high-tech manufacturing industries.

==Benefits==

The benefits of the 8D methodology include effective approaches to finding a [[root cause]], developing proper actions to eliminate root causes, and implementing the permanent corrective action. The system also helps to explore the [[control system]]s that allowed the problem to escape. The Escape Point is studied for the purpose of improving the ability of the Control System to detect the failure or cause when and if it should occur again.
Finally the Prevention Loop explores the systems that permitted the condition that allowed the Failure and Cause Mechanism to exist in the first place.

==Prerequisites==

Requires training in the 8D [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] process as well as appropriate data collection and analysis tools such as [[Pareto chart]]s, fishbone diagrams, and process maps.

==Problem solving tools==

The following tools can be used within 8D:
* [[Ishikawa diagram]]s also known as cause-and-effect or fishbone diagrams
* [[Pareto chart]]s or Pareto diagrams
* [[5 Whys]]
* 5W and 2H (who, what, where, when, why, how, how often)
* [[Statistical process control]]
* [[Scatter plot]]s
* [[Design of experiments]]
* [[Check sheet]]
* [[Histograms]]
* [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]]
* [[Flowchart]]s or [[process map]]s

==Background of common corrective actions to dispose of nonconforming items==

The 8D methodology was first described in a Ford manual in 1987. The manual describes the eight-step methodology to address chronic product and process problems.  The 8Ds included several concepts of effective problem solving, including taking corrective actions and containing nonconforming items. These two steps have been very common in most manufacturing facilities, including government and military installations. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) released “MIL-STD 1520 Corrective Action and Disposition System for Nonconforming Material”. This 13 page standard defines establishing some corrective actions and then taking containment actions on nonconforming material or items. It is focused on inspection for defects and disposing of them. The basic idea of corrective actions and containment of defectives was officially abolished in 1995, but these concepts were also common to Ford Motor Company, a major supplier to the government in World War II. Corrective actions and containment of poor quality parts were part of the manual and course for the automotive industry and are well known to many companies. Ford's 60 page manual covers details associated with each step in their 8D problem solving manual and the actions to take to deal with identified problems.

===Military usage===

The exact history of the 8D method remains disputed as many publications and websites state that it originates from the US military. Indeed, MIL-STD-1520C &lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1500-1599/MIL-STD-1520C_NOTICE-2_23481/&lt;/ref&gt; outlines a set of requirements for their contractors on how they should organize themselves with respect to non-conforming materials. Developed in 1974 and cancelled  in February 1995 as part of the Perry memo,&lt;ref&gt;https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397&lt;/ref&gt; you can compare it best to the ISO 9001 standard that currently exists as it expresses the same philosophy. The aforementioned military standard does outline some aspects that are in the 8D method, however, it does not provide the same structure that the 8D methodology offers. Taking into account the fact that the Ford Motor Company played an instrumental role in producing army vehicles during the Second World War and in the decades after, it could very well be the case that the MIL-STD-1520C stood as a model for today’s 8D method.&lt;ref&gt;8D Problem solving explained – Turning operational failures into knowledge to drive your strategic and competitive advantages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between 8D and FMEA==

[[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] (failure mode and effect analysis) is a tool generally used in the planning of product or process design. The relationships between 8D and FMEA are outlined below:
# The problem statements and descriptions are sometimes linked between both documents. An 8D can utilize pre-brainstormed information from a FMEA to assist in looking for potential problems.
# Possible causes in a FMEA can immediately be used to jump start 8D Fishbone or [[Ishikawa diagrams]]. Brainstorming information that is already known is not a good use of time or resources.
# Data and brainstorming collected during an 8D can be placed into a FMEA for future planning of new product or process quality. This allows a FMEA to consider actual failures, occurring as failure modes and causes, becoming more effective and complete.
# The design or process controls in a FMEA can be used in verifying the root cause and Permanent Corrective Action in an 8D.
The FMEA and 8D should reconcile each failure and cause by cross documenting failure modes, problem statements and possible causes. Each FMEA can be used as a database of possible causes of failure as an 8D is developed.

The term '''empowerment''' refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

The term empowerment originates from American [[community psychology]] and is associated{{by whom|date=June 2016}} with the social scientist [[Julian Rappaport]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Julian. In praise of paradox. A social policy of empowerment over prevention, in: American Journal of Community Psychology, Vol. 9 (1), 1981, 1–25 (13)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compsy.org.uk/rethemp.htm|title=Rethinking empowerment: shared action against powerlessness|last=Burton &amp; Kagan|first=|date=1996|website=compsy.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social work]], empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and [[democratic education]], empowerment is seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting [[civic engagement]]. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a [[wikt:deficit|deficit]]-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of [[continuing education]] and [[self-help]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Empowerment Group. (1989, October). Empowerment and family support. Networking Bulletin, 1(1)2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with [[feminism]].

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for [[marginalized]] people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, [[self-sufficiency]], with a focus on eliminating the future need for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own [[nonprofit organization]], using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, "Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out."&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt;  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female "...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2273|title=Encouraging and Empowering Girls - Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association|date=13 July 2012|website=Ccpa-accp.ca|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [[mentally ill]] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lenz: ''Empowerment und Ressourcenaktivierung – Perspektiven für die psychosoziale Praxis.''&lt;/ref&gt; It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

== In social work and community psychology ==
[[File:Altenheim 12.jpg|thumb|Empowerment in the work for senior citizens in a residential home in Germany]]
In [[social work]], empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. "[[Marginalized]]" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.
The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents’ experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of [[Milton Friedman]] embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microempowering.org |title=Welcome to MicroEmpowering! |publisher=Microempowering.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has argued that large [[institutional investor]]s such as [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the [[legal mobilisation]] i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the [[law]] to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=Odi.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO)  "Legal empowerment is about [[Capacity building|strengthening the capacity]] of all people to exercise their [[rights]], either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that [[law]] is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/legal-empowerment|title=What Is Legal Empowerment?|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' ''Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control'' ' outlines the fact that [[Law|legal tools]] for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The [[legal system|state legal system]] is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, ''lack of [[legal awareness]] as well as [[legal aid|legal assistance]] '' tend to be recurrent problems.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the [[law]], and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools',  is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like [[legal literacy]] and awareness training, broadcasting [[legal information]], conducting participatory [[legal discourse]]s, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] with [[advocacy]] along with media engagement, and socio [[legal mobilisation]].&lt;ref name=Cotula /&gt;

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and [[women's empowerment]] through lobbying.

==Gender==
{{main|Gender empowerment|Women empowerment}}
[[Gender empowerment]] conventionally refers to the [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by [[feminism]] and employed legal empowerment by building on international [[human rights]]. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights]] and [[International development|development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]] targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|website=Un.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield,&lt;ref&gt;Potterfield, Thomas. "The Business of Employee Empowerment: Democracy and Ideology in the Workplace." Quorum Books, 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular [[Management fad|management concepts]] of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of [[Counterfeit|bogus]] empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ciulla| first = Joanne B.| chapter = Leadership and the Problem of Bogus Empowerment| editor-last = Ciulla| editor-first = Joanne B.| title = Ethics, the heart of leadership| edition = 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| publication-date = 2004| isbn = 978-0-275-98248-5| quote = [...] in many organizations, promises of empowerment are bogus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In management===
In the sphere of [[management]] and organizational theory, "empowerment" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or [[worker]]s generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the [http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views] of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as "empowerment circle" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of [[quality circles]] to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, [[knowledge management]] contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/empowering-your-employees-to-e|title=Empowering Your Employees to Empower Themselves |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1998/05/empowerment-the-emperors-new-clothes|title=Empowerment: The Emperor’s New Clothes |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulhost.com/employee-empowerment|title=Employee Empowerment: The Key to Employee Satisfaction|publisher=AtulHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book ''Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute'', the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# [[information sharing|Share information]] with everyone
# Create [[autonomy]] through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with [[self-directed work team]]s

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the "right kind of [[authority]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;6).  To summarize, "empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Aileen Mitchell. ''Empowering People'' (Institute of Management). Pitman. London: Financial Times Management, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace.  It is important to [[workplace training|train]] employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blanchard, Kenneth H.|author2=John P. Carlos|author3=Alan Randolph|title=Empowerment Takes More than a Minute|publisher=San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/05/6-myths-about-empowering-employees|title=6 Myths About Empowering Employees |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Age of Popular Empowerment?==

[[Marshall McLuhan]] insisted that the development of [[electronic media]] would eventually weaken the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “[[Descartes|linear-Cartsesian”]] forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="youtube1977"&gt;{{cite news|last1= McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=‘ABC TV Monday Conference: The Medium is the Message (Part 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= ABC TV Monday Conference|publisher=ABC TV Monday Conference|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by [[information technology]] would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in [[real-time computing|near-real-time]] vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education &lt;ref name="youtube1977"/&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-driven]] public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"/&gt;

'''Johannes Gerardus Hendrikus "Hans" Janmaat''' (November 3, 1934 &amp;ndash; June 9, 2002) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] (CP) and later his own formed [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] (CD). He was [[Parliamentary group leader|Parliamentary leader]] of the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] from September 16, 1982 until October 15, 1984 when he was expelled from the party. He later served as [[Parliamentary group leader|Parliamentary leader]] of the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] from September 8, 1989 until May 19, 1998 when his party lost all its seats.

Although he was widely known, he was never a major force in the Dutch political landscape,&lt;ref name="ing"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn6/janmaat | author= Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis | title = Janmaat, Hans | accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly because of a [[cordon sanitaire]] imposed by the [[Third Lubbers cabinet]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Johannes Gerardus Hendrikus Janmaat was born on November 3, 1934 in [[Nes aan de Amstel]] in [[North Holland]], as the oldest of nine children in a traditional [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; His father was a salesman and insurance broker. When Janmaat was 4 years old, the family moved to [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], where it would endure the [[World War II|war years]] in relative peace.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;
After graduating in 1954, Janmaat started a study in [[aeronautical engineering]], but had to drop out two years later after his father could no longer afford the tuition fees.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Having to give up his studies to work was the first of many setbacks he would often refer to later in life.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

In 1966 he married [[Belgian]] Evi Hock, having met her while working in Germany.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; In 1979, they divorced. In 1996, Janmaat married [[Wil Schuurman]]. No children were born in either marriage.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

In the early 1960s, Janmaat ran a furniture factory with two of his brothers, but it burned down in 1966. He used the insurance payout to study [[politicology]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Fellow-students found him ambitious, provocative and witty.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; In 1969, he participated in the occupation of the ''Maagdenhuis'', the university's administrative center, as part of a student protest.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; He completed his studies in 1972.

===Politics===
After graduating, Janmaat held part-time positions as a teacher of [[civics]]. He also ran a one-man consultancy for small businesses.

In 1972, he joined the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP).&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; He also worked in several commissions for the [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS'70) party. Despite his efforts, he was not considered suitable for a front line position because of his capriciousness and tendency to go against the grain.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

In the 1970s, he became more interested in the emerging issue of [[Immigration policy|immigration]] as large numbers of [[foreign worker]]s came to the Netherlands. His increasingly radical stance lead to a break with the KVP as well as DS'70.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

[[Image:Tweede Kamer Hans Janmaat aan het woord, Bestanddeelnr 932-9715.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hans Janmaat as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] in 1984.]]

In 1980, he read an article in [[Vrij Nederland]] which drew his attention to the recently founded extreme-right [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] (CP). After several interviews, he joined the party as its seventh member.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Starting as a publicity worker, he would rapidly rise to be the party's top and was its ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate) for the [[Dutch general election, 1982|1982 elections]]. The party won a single seat in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], which went to Janmaat.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Other political parties largely ignored and [[Ostracism|ostracized]] him.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

===Centre Democrats===
After disagreements and a power struggle with other members of the Centrum Party, he was expelled from the CP in October 1984. However, he retained his seat in parliament, in accordance with Dutch law. Janmaat officially launched his own party, the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] (CD) in November 1984.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Politically, the party did not differ greatly from the CP, except that it was strongly centered around Janmaat, to prevent another power struggle.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

Several attempts were made to reconcile the differences between CP and CD. One such meeting in a hotel in [[Kedichem]] was disrupted by left-wing activists, who set fire to the building. Janmaat narrowly escaped with his life, CD secretary (and later wife of Janmaat) Wil Schuurman lost a leg because of injuries sustained jumping out of a window to escape the fire.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;

In the [[Dutch general election, 1986|1986 election]], Janmaat lost his seat in parliament, however he regained his single seat in [[Dutch general election, 1989|1989]].

His biggest political success would be in the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 elections]], when he gained three seats.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Major political parties changed their response to Janmaat and his views: rather than actively ignoring him they also started openly addressing the issue of immigration.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weggevaagd"/&gt; In the [[Dutch general election, 1998|1998 election]] the CD lost all three of its seats. Janmaat had become increasingly paranoid and said that computers used for voting had been tampered with.&lt;ref name="weggevaagd"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article753636.ece/Weggevaagd | author = De Volkskrant | title= Weggevaagd | accessdate=  2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trouw"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.trouw.nl/archief/article1314246.ece/Politiek___Met_excuses_aan_Janmaat.html | author= Trouw | title= Met excuses aan Janmaat | accessdate=  2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Janmaat was in the process of starting another party, the ''Conservative Democrats'',&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; however it did not get off the ground and did not participate in the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 election]].

His failing health forced him to withdraw from politics, however the changing political climate did prompt him to challenge his conviction for discrimination at the [[European Court of Justice]]. Janmaat's death in 2002 halted the case.

===Political views===
Janmaat wanted to represent the indigenous Dutch workers and middle class. His views were based mostly on economic and materialistic arguments rather than an underlying [[ideology]].&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Disappointing economic growth, unemployment and government cutbacks could not be addressed while large numbers of immigrants were flowing into the country.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; Janmaat was against a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural society]]: he argued that immigrants should either assimilate into Dutch culture, or return to their country of birth.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt;
His best known slogans were "Holland is not a country of immigration," "full=full" and "we will abolish the multicultural society, as soon as we get the chance and power"; he was convicted for the last two statements. According to Jan van de Beek, Hans Janmaat often used economic arguments in his tirades against immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Jan van de Beek as cited by Michel Hoebink  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-too-pc-about-cost-immigration "Dutch too PC about the cost of immigration,"] ''Radio Netherlands Worldwide (NRW)'' (2 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was often accused of committing acts of [[hate speech]], and received fines and a conditional prison sentence for incitement to hatred and discrimination against foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article715909.ece/Rechter_veroordeelt_Janmaat_en_Freling_tot_vier_weken_cel| author= De Volkskrant | title= Rechter veroordeelt Janmaat en Freling tot vier weken cel | accessdate=  2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc.nl/international/opinion/article2268138.ece/call_wilders_by_his_name_a_racist "Call Wilders what he is: a racist,"] nrc.nl (8 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkert Jensma, [http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article1886350.ece/Freedom_of_expression_or_freedom_to_insult "Freedom of expression or freedom to insult?,"] nrc.nl (27 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vpro"/&gt;

He often made controversial remarks about immigrants and other politicians. He argued that [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]] should not be allowed to hold a high office because of his Jewish heritage &lt;ref name="vpro"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/nieuws/2006/februari/extreemrechts-in-nederland.html | author= VPRO | title= Extreemrechts in Nederland | accessdate = 2010-06-09 | authorlink= VPRO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said he was not saddened by the sudden death of political opponent [[Ien Dales]].&lt;ref name="vpro"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Other parties erected a [[cordon sanitaire]] around Janmaat, ignoring him while he spoke in parliament.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; A [[taboo]] on discussing negative aspects of immigration existed in the Dutch political climate in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.vkblog.nl/bericht/257704/Moet_Janmaat_worden_gerehabiliteerd%3F | author= De Volkskrant | title= Moet Janmaat worden gerehabiliteerd? | accessdate=  2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meindert Fennema]], Emeritus Professor of Political Theory of Ethnic Relations at the University of Amsterdam, argued in 2006 that Janmaat was convicted for statements that are now commonplace &lt;ref name="Trouw"/&gt; due to changes in the political climate (caused in part by the [[September 11 attacks]], and the assassinations of [[Pim Fortuyn]] and [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]).&lt;ref name="vpro"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4451">'''The International Adult and Continuing Education (IACE) Hall of Fame''' was founded in 1996 "to honor leaders in the fields of continuing education and adult learning and to serve as a record and inspiration for the next generation of continuing education leaders".&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/about.html |title=Homepage Hall of Fame |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, adult and continuing education leaders from around the world are selected for induction into the IACE Hall of Fame.

==History==
The story of the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame officially began in the early 1990s with the desire to provide a mechanism to honor and document contributions of the past to better build the future. Dr. Thurman J. White, a pioneer in the field of continuing education for adult and nontraditional students, contributor to the theoretical base of [[adult education]] and initiator of the Oklahoma College of Continuing Education at University of Oklahoma, initiated this idea in cooperation with current leaders and officers of several associations and organizations in the USA (University Continuing Education Association, [[ASTD|American Society for Training and Development]], AAACE/American Association of Adult and Continuing Education,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaace.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|ECOP/National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges]]).

The Hall was incorporated in the state of Oklahoma on September 20, 1995, as a nonprofit corporation. The Hall of Fame, in the beginning focused mostly to the USA, more and more inducted members from other countries. In  2006 the first induction ceremony took place out of the USA (Bamberg, Germany).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/andragogik/08/andragogik/andragogy/HOF/06-HOF-Bamberg.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Logo of the society:&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;
[[File:IACEHallofFame-header.jpg|center|alt=Logo Header]]

==Structure==
The Hall of Fame operates with a small central staff in the Office of the Vice President for Outreach at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Inducted members elect a Board of Directors, which manages the induction process and organizes symposia and other Hall activities.

==Hall of Fame Members==
Scholars, practitioners, and policy makers reflect the diversity of adult and continuing education practice and scholarship and the increasingly global leadership community that constitutes the IACE Hall of Fame. Anyone may nominate a candidate for induction into the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame. A Selection Committee reviews nominations and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, which selects the final group to be inducted every year. The Nomination Instructions claim: "To be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame, a person must be eminently distinguished in the profession, shall have brought honor or distinction, and shall have contributed to the heritage of adult and continuing education."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/IACEHOF%20Nomination_form%202011.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first induction in 1996, the Hall of Fame has inducted more than 250 members&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/inductees.html&lt;/ref&gt; from 27 nations.

==Location==
The official home for the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame is the University of Oklahoma's Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education (OCCE), Norman, Oklahoma.

==Meetings==
The IACE Hall of Fame typically holds its annual induction ceremony and symposium in conjunction with the annual conference of a major national/international professional association in the field: for example in 2008 in Budapest in conjunction with the Unesco/Confintea-conference, in 2010 in Guadalajara with CREAD/Inter-American Distance Education Consortium, and 2011 in Toronto with [http://www.upcea.edu/ UPCEA/University Professional &amp; Continuing Education Association.]

In 2010, Ricketts led a campaign against [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] and what he perceived to be wasteful federal spending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dyn.politico.com/members/forums/thread.cfm?catid=7&amp;subcatid=41&amp;threadid=4573155 Politico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327030053/http://dyn.politico.com/members/forums/thread.cfm?catid=7&amp;subcatid=41&amp;threadid=4573155 |date=2012-03-27 }}, Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45225.html Politico], Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ricketts founded an independent organization called Taxpayers Against Earmarks that classified every Member of Congress as either a spending "hero" or "hooligan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/ricketts-joins-the-big-leagues-with-earmarks-crusade/ NYTimes The Caucus], Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Taxpayers for Common Sense and WashingtonWatch.com, Taxpayers Against Earmarks developed a database of earmarks requested by members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Manu Raju, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46060.html Study: 39,294 earmarks sought], ''Politico'' (December 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The group successfully pressed for a moratorium on earmarks in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Reingold, [http://fortune.com/2012/09/21/joe-ricketts-the-new-billionaire-political-activist/ Joe Ricketts: The new billionaire political activist], ''Fortune'' (September 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers Against Earmarks changed its name to Ending Spending in 2011, as part of a broadening of the group's focus.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Finkel, [http://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/ending-spending-action-fund/ Ending Spending Action Fund], [[FactCheck.org]] (April 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the advertising expenditure was to highlight incumbents' earmark-related policies.&lt;ref name="Omaha.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Jake, [http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/10/28/new-tv-ad-ending-spending-fund-targets-reid-over-earmarks "New TV ad by 'The Ending Spending Fund' Targets Reid over Earmarks"], ''Foxnews.com'', October 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ending Spending Fund spent the largest amount of its money on the [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010]] in an unsuccessful effort to defeat Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]]. Although not required by law, Ricketts willingly disclosed his identity due to his belief in [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 17, 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a story by Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg reporting that The Ending Spending Action fund had been presented with a 54-page proposal entitled, "The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: the Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good." According to  the ''Times'', the proposal, written by a vendor seeking to be hired by Ending Spending, suggested a $10-million ad campaign to "attack President Obama in ways that Republicans have so far shied away" and called for "running commercials linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, the [[Jeremiah Wright|Reverend Jeremiah A.

{{Japanese name|Matsukata}}
{{nihongo|'''Matsukata Kōjirō'''|松方 幸次郎||extra=January 17, 1865 &amp;ndash; June 24, 1950}} was a Japanese businessman who devoted his life and fortune to amassing a collection of Western art which, he hoped, would become the nucleus of a Japanese national museum focused particularly on masterworks of the Western art tradition.  Although his plans were not realized in his lifetime, his vision is commemorated in Japan's [[National Museum of Western Art]] ([[National Museum of Western Art|NMWA]]) in Ueno, central Tokyo.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"&gt;[http://www.nmwa.go.jp/en/collection/index.html  NMWA collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsukata was the third son of the early [[Meiji period]] [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]] and ''[[genrō]]'', [[Matsukata Masayoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1923/09/04/archives/article-4-no-title.html?sq=matsukata+kojiro&amp;scp=17&amp;st=p "Article 4 -- No Title,"] ''The New York Times''. September 4, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;  While at [[Rutgers College]], he was a member of the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity and a member of the freshman football team.  After being educated in the United States at [[Rutgers Preparatory School]] and [[Rutgers University]], he became  president of [[Kawasaki Shōzō|Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company]] (''Kawasaki Shōzō'') in 1896 and then went on to become&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Liah. (2001).

The financial success he enjoyed in the early part of the century was affected adversely by economic downturns in the 1920s and 1930s; but much of his art collection remained intact despite the collapse of his business interests.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;

== Art collecting ==
{{see also|ja:松方コレクション}}
Masukata invested his significant personal fortune in the acquisition of several thousand examples of Western painting, sculpture and decorative arts. He collected these art works throughout Europe, but primarily in Paris.  Mutsukata bought the Rodin masterpiece, "Gates of Hell", which is currently to be seen at the Rodin Museum in Paris; and the sculptures on display in the NMWA entrance plaza were made from the same original molds.&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Clara. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A11FC3C5F17738DDDAB0A94D0405B868EF1D3&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=matsukata+kojiro&amp;st=p  "Rodin's Tomb a New Meca for Artists of the World; Sculptures Reassembled at Meudon Will Be Opened to Public -- Their Setting Is Beautiful and Impressive",] ''The New York Times''. August 22, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, he hoped to see his collections in an art museum in Tokyo where visitors could come into direct contact with Western art;&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt; and he wanted the people of Tokyo to enjoy the same degree of easy access to great art which was available to Parisians.

Matsukata is also famous for his collection of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock prints which had been scattered throughout the world.  The 1925 exhibition of the woodblock prints Mtsukata collected abroad is thought to have been the first of its kind in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Checkland, Olive. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VPpTfAK9oKwC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Matsukata+Kojiro&amp;sig=wTPz7JtVPhTFV_RqLnnYBzkBXP4#PPA107,M1 ''Japan and Britain After 1859: Creating Cultural Bridges'', p. 107.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today about 8,000 ukiyo-e prints from the Matsukata collection are housed in the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;

Among these works collected by Matsukata, those known today as the NMWA Matsukata Collection remained in France after World War II; and as part of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, they were briefly confiscated by France. Although most were sent to Japan, 14 valuable paintings by Monet, Van Gogh, Courbet, Cézanne, and others were retained to fill in gaps in the French national collection.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"&gt;Falk, Ray.  [https://www.nytimes.com/1959/06/21/archives/french-art-in-tokyo.html?sq=matsukata+kojiro&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p  "French Art in Tokyo",] ''The New York Times''. June 21, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining objects in the Matsukata collection totaled 370 works, including 196 paintings, 80 drawings, 26 prints and 63 sculptures—including massive public statuary by Rodin which now grace the landscaped area in front of the entrance to NMWA.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;  Each of the Rodin sculptures in the NMWA collection were cast from the original molds.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"/&gt;  In fact, as it happens, Matsukata was the one who paid for the best Rodin castings in France today, but he didn't quite manage to bring them back to Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Michener, James A. (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=EWH3P_CuEPsC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Matsukata+Kojiro&amp;sig=S8Ve5bK47fxCDcxEypcsIRp0HcE#PPA246,M1  ''The Floating World'', p. 244.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is how they fell into French hands at the end of World War II. The Matsukata Collection is in Tokyo today because France eventually gave these artworks to the Japanese people.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;

Matsukata was well known as a good friend of Claude Monet. It has been reported that once, when Monet offered him the opportunity to buy whatever he wanted in the studio at Giverny, he purchased 18 paintings.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"/&gt;  His other artist friends included [[Frank Brangwyn]], who assisted Matsukata in the acquisition of his collection.  Brangwyn designed a gallery, the so-called Palace of Sheer Pleasure, which Matsukata intended to build in Tokyo.

He had originally intended to bring all these artworks to Japan, but he balked at the 100% tax imposed on imports.  Much of what was stored in Britain was destroyed by fires during World War II; and much of what remained in Japan was also destroyed by Allied bombing during the Pacific War.  The combination of factors which kept so much of his collecting activities intact was only seen by the Japanese public for the first time in 1959 when they visited the museum he had envisaged.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"/&gt;

In addition to being a singer and musician, Abboud is also a poet and [[composer]], though says that she refrains from publishing her poetry or compositions in order to focus on her musical career as advised by her manager Dory Shehade.&lt;ref name="OTV interview, 26 June 2017" /&gt;

==Biography==
He was the son of the wealthy Hong Kong merchant and [[compradore]] of the [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]], [[Lo Cheung-shiu]]. His brother, [[Lo Man-kam]] was also a prominent lawyer and member of the Executive and Legislative Councils of Hong Kong before Lo Man-wai. He had three sons and one daughters. His second son, [[Kenneth Lo Tak-cheung]], was also member of the [[Urban Council]].&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{cite news|title=羅文惠殯禮榮衷|date=12 April 1985|page=10|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo was born in 1895 and educated in Hong Kong before he studied law in England. After he returned to Hong Kong in 1916, he practiced law at his family's law firm.&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite news|title=羅文惠殯禮十一日舉行|date=8 April 1985|page=8|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1926 and became member of the Urban Council in 1940. After the war, he succeeded his brother, Lo Man-kam to become member of the Legislative Council in 1950 and of the Executive Council in 1959. For his service in the Legislative Council, he was awarded the Officer and the Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1950 and 1955 respectively.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

He was also director of many major public companies, including the [[Hongkong Tramways]], [[Star Ferry]], [[China Light and Power Company]], [[Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company]], and [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=羅文惠前日逝世|date=7 April 1985|page=5|newspaper=Tai Kung Pao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo was also a good tennis player and was regarded as the "Grand Old Man of Hong Kong Tennis." He won win the Men's Doubles with his brother Lo Man-kam at the 1920 Hong Kong National Grass Court Championships, as well as the singles title in 1929. In addition, he finished as runner-up to Ng Sze-kwong three years in a row in the Men's Singles at the Hong Kong National Grass Court Championships from 1920 to 1922. With his sister Enid Lo, he also won the Mixed Doubles of the Hong Kong Hardcourt Championships in 1928, 1930 and 1932, thus elevating him to the status as the only Hong Kong player to have won a local major doubles title with both his brother and his sister.

Lo died on 5 April 1985. His funeral took place at the Hong Kong Funeral Home and his body was cremated at the Cape Collinson Crematorium on 11 April.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funeral"/&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Lord Ashcroft Bust, LAIBS, Anglia Ruskin, 10 Oct, 2012.jpg|thumb|Ashcroft's [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] In the [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] of the Lord Ashcroft Building at the [[Lord Ashcroft International Business School|business school]] of [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Cambridge]], from where he earned [[Higher National Diploma]] in [[business studies]].]]
Born in [[Chichester]], [[West Sussex]],&lt;ref name=MToday940641/&gt; as his father Eric was a British colonial [[civil servant]], Ashcroft spent some of his early years in [[British Honduras]] (now [[Belize]]) and [[Malawi]].

He was educated at [[Norwich School (educational institution)|Norwich School]], [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]], and [[Anglia Ruskin University|Mid-Essex Technical College (now Anglia Ruskin University)]], where he obtained a [[Higher National Diploma]] in [[Business studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Fran Abrams.

Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business career===
After a period in Belize after completing his education, Ashcroft returned to [[Hitchhiking|hitch hike]] around Europe, and then for a short period of time became the manager of a rock and roll band. In 1967, Ashcroft joined [[Carreras Tobacco Company|Carreras Tobacco]] as a management trainee.&lt;ref name=DPDT&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Politics Dirty Times|author=Michael Ashcroft|publisher=Biteback|date=8 July 2009|ISBN=1-84954-009-8|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/pdf/dirtypoliticsdirtytimes_04112011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left in 1969, joining Pritchard Group Services, after several months unemployed.&lt;ref name=DPDT/&gt; Pritchard Group was a cleaning and business services company and Ashcroft worked his way up quickly to become an assistant in the company's head office accounting department, part of a large acquisitions team.

In 1972, at the age of 26, he started his own business, Michael A. Ashcroft Associates. His first acquisition was Uni-Kleen – a loss-making [[Housekeeping|cleaning]] company with one thousand employees, which he purchased for just £1 in 1974, with a £15,000 bank loan (or £176,780 in 2014-inflation adjusted terms). He worked to turn the company around, selling it just three years later for £1.3 million.&lt;ref name=MToday940641&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/940641 |title=How he made his pile: Lord Ashcroft, businessman/politician |publisher=Management Today |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_march2000&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/696781.stm Ashcroft: The Tories' troublesome tycoon]". BBC News. 31 March 2000. Retrieved 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawley/ADT===
{{Main|ADT Security Services}}
On exiting Uni-Kleen in 1977, his next purchase was Hawley Goodall, another poorly performing company, this time in camping equipment manufacture. Ashcroft used Hawley to make a series of acquisitions, transforming Hawley into a business services group, ranging from janitorial services for hospitals and offices, to [[car auction]] services, and later with a focus on the security services industry. Through the sale of the car auctions division to the fast-expanding [[British Car Auctions]], he formed a lifelong friendship with [[David Wickins]], whom he would later help take a majority stake in [[Lotus Cars]], as well as finance other joint-ventures.&lt;ref name=GuardWickins&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/16/thatcher.uk1|title=Ashcroft's Lotus position|author=Andy McSmith and Ben Laurance|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=16 January 2000|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981, Hawley had made its first acquisitions in the [[United States]], and its total revenues had grown to $27 million.

By early 1983, Hawley had built up a 20% stake in pharmaceutical packaging manufacturer Cope Allman. Ashcroft offered to increase his stake to 29.9%, just below the 30% level at which a formal bid for the entire company must be launched. Ashcroft and Cope Allman fought bitterly over the purchase share price and current holdings, with Cope Allman reporting Ashcroft and Wickins to the [[Takeover panel]], after discovering that BCA had built up a 13.5% in the company. But the takeover panel found that the Ashcroft and Wickins were operating independently, so Hawley was able to increase its holding to 29.9%. At this point the combined holdings of Hawley/BCA in Cope Allman amounted to 43.5% per cent of Cope Allman, giving them the power to introduce sweeping changes without launching a full bid.&lt;ref name=GuardWickins/&gt; Cope Allman was eventually sold to an MBO backed by Hawley and financed by [[Bain Capital]], and then sold to [[Rexam|Bowater]] in 1992 in a complex swap of assets with ADT/Hawley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/nhl-shareholders-not-told-of-executives-role-1558339.html|title=NHL shareholders not told of executive's role|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=19 October 1992|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Ashcroft and Wickins bought car sales dealership [[Henlys Group]] via a Canadian-registered company, Mipec. Controlled by Ashcroft's Hawley Goodall, Henlys was merged with the already owned funeral [[hearse]] maker [[Coleman Milne]] to form a Motoring Division. In 1989, Hawley Goodall sold its Motoring Division consisting of Henlys and [[Coleman Milne]] to the [[Plaxton]] Group, the bus and coach manufacturer based in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Yorkshire]].

In 1986, Hawley bought out Ashcroft's former employer, Pritchard Services, leaping to the second place in the U.S. services industry. At this time, Hawley had revenues of more than $1.3 billion.

1987 was a key year for Hawley. In the early part of the year, it bought Crime Control Inc. based in Indianapolis, for $50 million, placing the company in fourth place in the U.S. security market. Later in the year it bought [[ADT Security Services]], the largest electronic security company in the United States. This purchase transformed Hawley into the leading security services business in the United States, and resulted in the majority of its revenues coming from the North American market. As a result of the acquisition, [[Bermuda]]-registered Hawley changed its name to ADT Inc. and decided to refocus its business around security services. At the end of 1987, the company sold its North American-based facility services business to [[Denmark]]'s [[ISS A/S]].

In 1987, Ashcroft bought out the existing shareholders of Wickins BCA via Hawley Goodall. Based at [[Blackbushe Airport]] to allow Wickins access to his treasured aviation division, which flew both [[Jet Ranger]] helicopters and [[Beechcraft King Air]] turbo prop aircraft, Ashcroft, who has a disliking for such flippant expenditure,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} immediately sold off the aircraft. Wickins joined the board of Hawley Goodall, remaining there until the Tyco takeover, but retired from BCA in 1990. In 1995, to allow for the Tyco transaction, the group decided to divest itself of BCA. The residual North American arm was sold to trade buyers, while the European arm was sold to a consortium of some 40 private investors, including Ashcroft via his Belize-based investment company. In September 2006, BCA was bought by the UK-based [[investment banking]] arm of private bank [[Samuel Montagu &amp; Co.]], a division of [[HSBC]], personally netting Ashcroft over £200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/456572/ashcroft-in-for-bca-cash-windfall |title=Ashcroft In For BCA Cash Windfall |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=20 September 2006 |accessdate=14 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116073951/http://news.sky.com/story/456572/ashcroft-in-for-bca-cash-windfall |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, ADT was sold by a [[reverse takeover]] to US conglomerate [[Tyco International]] for $6.7 billion, allowing Tyco to become tax-efficient.&lt;ref name=telegraph_july1999&gt;{{cite news

Ashcroft disposed of large amounts of the Tyco stock which he had acquired as a result of the sale of ADT, explaining that he needed the capital to diversify into other things and that he never retained a substantial stake in any enterprise which he did not control. Ashcroft nevertheless continued as a non-executive director of Tyco, a role he still held in 2002 when Tyco CEO [[Dennis Kozlowski]] was arrested in New York in connection with personal tax offences. Unease had already been expressed at Tyco at some of Kozlowski's corporate decisions and Ashcroft was amongst the directors who appointed lawyer [[David Boies]] to investigate irregularities in the company.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In time, the exposure of management deficiencies led to Ashcroft's demanding that the whole of the board of directors of Tyco should resign, to be replaced by new management.

===Belize and cross holdings===
Ashcroft has close business and other connections with the Commonwealth country of Belize, and served as the country's ambassador to the [[United Nations]] between 1998 and 2000. In his 2005 biography, he admitted that it is a country where his interests have been "exempt from certain taxes for 30 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/09/27/exclusive-the-peer-who-bankrolls-the-tories-is-the-boss-of-a-poor-tax-haven-115875-20755178/|title=Exclusive: The peer who bankrolls the Tories is 'the boss' of a poor tax haven|work=Daily Mirror|location=London|date=27 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Prime Minister of Belize]] [[Dean Barrow]] told its parliament:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/01/lord-ashcroft-belize-scrutiny|title='Lord Ashcroft of Belize' facing eviction as country turns on him|work=The Guardian|date=1 November 2009|accessdate=28 December 2009 | location=London | first=Jamie | last=Doward}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Ashcroft is an extremely powerful man. His net worth may well be equal to Belize's entire GDP. He is nobody to cross.}}
Barrow also warned [[David Cameron]] that relations with the [[United Kingdom]] would be damaged if Ashcroft were given a senior position in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/belize-pm-warns-cameron-about-role-for-ashcroft-1830754.html|title=Belize PM warns Cameron about role for Ashcroft|work=The Independent|date=29 November 2009|accessdate=17 September 2010 | location=London | first=Jane | last=Merrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1981, Belize had gained independence from the UK. Seeing the opportunity to build an off-shore operations base and control the country's financial service, in 1984 Ashcroft formed Belize Holdings (BHI), which became the vehicle for a parallel acquisition spree during the 1980s, beyond the scope of Hawley.

By the late 1980s, BHI had become one of the largest holding companies in Belize, with direct interests in or holdings via main operating company Stargate Ltd, ranging from telecommunications, property, the Belize shipping register, and citrus fruits.

In 1987, BHI led the formation of Belize Bank Holdings (BBH), which took control of [[Belize Bank]] from the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]. Belize Bank has become the country's largest financial institution, controlling some 50 percent of the market. BBH developed local and international interests in facilities services, finance and telecommunications. Belize Bank itself formerly held a majority stake in [[Belize Telemedia]] Limited (BTL), until it was nationalised by the Government of Belize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governmentofbelize.gov.bz/download/pm_intro_bill.pdf |title=Prime Minister's Introduction of Bill to have Government assume control of Belize Telemedia Limited |publisher=Government of Belize |work= |accessdate=13 October 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, under pressure from the Belize Government to bring transparency to its Belize based financial interests, BBH restructured, demerging its interests in England and Ireland into a separate company, Carlisle Group Ltd. BBH then renamed itself BCB Holdings.

===Other business activity===
Ashcroft also has significant interests in the following companies quoted on the [[Alternative Investment Market]]: [[Restore plc]], WeAre20:20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Marketing Group plc has changed its name to WEARE 2020 plc |url=http://weare2020.com/investors.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121419/http://weare2020.com/investors.aspx |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Placing and admission to AIM |url=http://www.digitalmarketinggroup.co.uk/constitutionals/Digital_Marketing_Group_Admission_Final.pdf |publisher=Digital Marketing Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327231208/http://www.digitalmarketinggroup.co.uk/constitutionals/Digital_Marketing_Group_Admission_Final.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Ashcroft – Business – WeAre20:20 plc|url=http://lordashcroft.com/business/weare2020plc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Impellam Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holding(s) in Company|url=http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=42258432&amp;symbol=L%5EIPEL|publisher=advfn.com|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having attempted a takeover Corporate Services Group in 1999, in June 2006 he increased his stake to 28.5%, prompting speculation that he might make an offer for the remaining shares in the company. In May 2008 the merger of Carlisle Group and Corporate Services Group to form [[Impellam Group]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle Group included the brands Recruit PLC and Tate.

In September 2007, Ashcroft agreed the sale of AIM listed cleaning services supplier [[OneSource (cleaning services supplier)|OneSource]]. Based mainly in the United States, it was the old North American cleaning business of ISS that Ashcroft had sold to them when refocusing Hawley in 1987. Bought in 1997 for $1, he agreed the sale of the company at a value of £179m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=14748|title=UK: From $1 firm, Lord Ashcroft nets £132m|author=Simon Bowers|work=CorpWatch/Guardian|date=9 October 2007|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2006 he became the major shareholder in [[England|English]] professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], owning up to 42% of the club's shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, he accepted a bid for [[British Car Auctions]] (BCA) worth £450m, netting him a personal gain of £200m.

In 2011, he became the main backer, along with Stephan Shakespeare (CEO and co-Founder of YouGov) of Flooved, an online education startup.

===Personal life===

==Politics==

===Conservative Party===
In the UK, he was a major donor to and Treasurer of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from 1998 to 2001, under [[William Hague]]. His tenure was marked by a number of controversies: he was seen to pay little UK [[income tax]] because of his domicile in Belize; and he was at the centre of a debate about openness and accountability of political funding. Unsubstantiated speculation about his business affairs was concluded when he pursued a libel action against ''[[The Times]]''. This was settled on 9 December 1999, when ''The Times'' issued a front-page statement saying "The Times is pleased to confirm that it has no evidence that Mr Ashcroft or any of his companies have ever been suspected of money-laundering or drug-related crimes... Litigation between the parties has been settled to mutual satisfaction, with each side bearing its own costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Colin Brown |title=Ashcroft offers to 'reorganise affairs' in libel case settlement |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ashcroft-offers-to-reorganise-affairs-in-libel-case-settlement-738547.html |work=The Independent |date=9 December 1999 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Kevin Maguire, Nick Hopkins and Paul Murphy |title=Dramatic end to Ashcroft and Times libel battle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/09/thatcher.uk2 |work=The Guardian |date=9 December 1999 |accessdate=23 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he clashed with Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] when he offered a £2m donation on the condition that it should go to his specified candidates rather than into general [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Conservative Central Office]] funds. Ashcroft stated in 2005: "I much prefer to be involved, to make sure that my investment is wisely placed."&lt;ref name=Telegraph_27_01_10&gt;{{Citation | last = Brogan | first = Benedict | title = How the charity of a peer's wife will propel Cameron to power | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | date = 27 January 2010 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/benedict-brogan/7086643/How-the-charity-of-a-peers-wife-will-propel-Cameron-to-power.html | accessdate =31 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Cash for Peerages]]" controversy, on 31 March 2006 Ashcroft was named by the Conservative Party as having loaned it £3.6m.

On 12 October 2007 he was accused by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs of being allowed to heavily fund local Conservative organisations in marginal seats of his choosing. Ashcroft has insisted such funding is legitimate.

Significant donations made to the Conservative Party by Bearwood Corporate Services, a company controlled by Ashcroft, have also come under scrutiny. The trading status of the company, and thus the validity of donations totalling £5.1m between 2003 and 2008, is unclear and became the subject of an investigation by the Electoral Commission begun in October 2008. Both Labour MPs and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] had called for the process to be concluded in time for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|next general election]], due by mid-2010. [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Matthew Oakeshott, Baron Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay|Lord Oakeshott]] stated: "Democracy is in danger if Lord Ashcroft has been pouring millions into Conservative campaigns through an offshore pipeline from a Caribbean [[tax haven]]."&lt;ref name=Telegraph_27_01_10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian_15_11_09&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Syal | first1 = Rajeev | last2 = Helm | first2 = Toby | title = Electoral watchdog under fire as Lord Ashcroft inquiry threatens to run into election | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 15 November 2009 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/15/lord-ashcroft-donations-inquiry | accessdate =31 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian_07_02_10&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Helm | first1 = Toby | last2 = Syal | first2 = Rajeev | title = Gordon Brown attacks 'scandal' of Lord Ashcroft donations | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 7 February 2010 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/07/gordon-brown-ashcroft-donations-scandal | accessdate =7 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 2010 sources from the Electoral Commission described the donations as being "legal and permissible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Donation probe 'clears Ashcroft'|publisher=BBC News | date = 4 March 2010 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8549243.stm| accessdate =4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2010, Ashcroft admitted that he was not domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. On 4 March 2010 the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Public Administration [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select committee]] decided to hold a "special one-off inquiry" into Ashcroft's peerage and his tax affairs. The committee's three Conservative MPs are said to have refused to take part in the inquiry.&lt;ref name=Times_05_03_10&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Elliott | first1 = Francis | last2 = Kennedy | first2 = Dominic | title = Conservative officials 'refused to co-operate with Ashcroft inquiry' | newspaper = The Times | date = 5 March 2010 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7050508.ece | accessdate =5 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Ashcroft announced he would be stepping down as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party. His resignation came as he published [http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2010/09/minority-verdict/ Minority Verdict], his critical analysis of why the Conservative Party failed to gain an overall majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]]; leading to the Conservatives forming the [[Coalition Government 2010–2015|Coalition government]] with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|the Liberal Democrats]]. He was replaced by the Conservative MP, former government minister and the current [[Treasury Select Committee|Treasury Select Committee member]], [[Michael Fallon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/8018673/Michael-Fallon-named-Conservative-Party-deputy-chairman.html|title=Michael Fallon named Conservative Party deputy chairman|date=22 September 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the ''Daily Telegraph'' credited Ashcroft, owner of both the [[ConservativeHome]] and PoliticsHome website with
"stopping the Coalition working" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right.&lt;ref name=stopping&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9359539/Lord-Ashcrofts-Tory-Right-is-stopping-the-Coalition-working.html|title=Lord Ashcroft’s Tory Right is stopping the Coalition working|author=Oborne, Peter|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2010 election, Cameron gave Ashcroft a large office and a significant role in the election campaign but he received no reward in the form of ministerial job.&lt;ref name=stopping/&gt;
Although claiming not to exercise editorial control, Ashcroft, a "brutal critic of the Coalition from the start"
has established "megaphone presence" in the online media and the Lib Dems are described as blocking economic and welfare system reforms.&lt;ref name=stopping/&gt; The parties have separate and contradictory agendas and--as exemplified by [[Michael Gove]]'s education reforms intended for Tory ears only'-do not even consult each other.&lt;ref name=stopping/&gt;
Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by "coordinated attacks on the Coalition."&lt;ref name=stopping/&gt;  Although voters may have liked Coalition government, "the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together" and Cameron seems unwilling to celebrate midterm successes.&lt;ref name=stopping/&gt; "Ashcroft, who has been against it all along, looks like getting his way."&lt;ref name=stopping/&gt;

===Belize===
Ashcroft allegedly gave the [[People's United Party]] in Belize $1m when it was in opposition.&lt;ref name=MToday940641/&gt; During its period in power, it introduced laws that are claimed by opponents and media commentators to be financially advantageous to Ashcroft.&lt;ref name=MToday940641/&gt;

===Australia===
Ashcroft has become a significant figure in Australian politics having been identified as the single largest individual donor to any Australian political party during the Financial Year 2004/2005. The [[Australian Electoral Commission]] reported in February 2006 that Ashcroft (who gave his address as "House of Lords, Westminster, London") had donated $1 million to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in September 2004 just before the 2004 Federal election. It was the biggest single disclosed private donation in Australian political history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fadar.aec.gov.au/Returns/7/D6976.pdf Lord Ashcroft KCMG Annual Return] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703193801/http://fadar.aec.gov.au/Returns/7/D6976.pdf |date=3 July 2007 }} (PDF) at Annual Returns Locator Service&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated $250,000 to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] on 28 July 2010.

==Charity and philanthropy==
In 2013, Ashcroft stated that he has given tens of millions of pounds to good causes over the years.&lt;ref name=TelegraphMay2013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/10037208/Lord-Ashcroft-I-have-never-been-a-great-believer-in-inherited-wealth.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: 'I have never been a great believer in inherited wealth'|author=Ashcroft, Michael|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, he pledged to donate more than half of his money to good causes, and became a signatory of [[The Giving Pledge]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphMay2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://givingpledge.org/pdf/letters/Ashcroft_Letter.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702151341/http://givingpledge.org/pdf/letters/Ashcroft_Letter.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |title=Statement from Lord Ashcroft KCMG PC: May, 2013 |author= |publisher=''The Giving Pledge'' |date=May 2013 |accessdate=19 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-crime supporter===
Lord Ashcroft is the founder and chairman of [[Crimestoppers UK|Crimestoppers]].

On 12 October 2009, Lord Ashcroft pledged NZ$50,000 for the safe return of two-year-old toddler [[Aisling Symes]]. Aisling had gone missing a week earlier in [[West Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10602789|title=$50,000 reward offered in Aisling Symes case|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Anglia Polytechnic University - geograph.org.uk - 48187.jpg|thumb|[[Anglia Ruskin University]]'s Michael A. Ashcroft Building, opened in 2002 in Chelmsford. It houses the Lord Ashcroft International Business School.]]
Ashcroft has been Chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University since November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/microsites/honorary/ashcroft.html|title=Lord Ashcroft|publisher=Anglia Ruskin University|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He donated £5 million in 1999 for the university's business school at [[Chelmsford]], now called [[Lord Ashcroft International Business School]], and another £5million gift in 2009 to create a new business school in Cambridge.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

He is the sponsor of [[Ashcroft Technology Academy]] in Wandsworth, a state secondary school within the English [[Academy (English school)|academy]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|281159|PROSPECT EDUCATION (TECHNOLOGY) TRUST LIMITED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the main backer, along with [[Stephan Shakespeare]] (CEO and co-Founder of [[YouGov]]) of Flooved, an [[Ed tech]] Startup.

He has provided a copy of ''Britain's Treasure Islands'' to every secondary school in the UK and its overseas territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's Treasure Islands|url=http://www.britainstreasureislands.com/project/lord-michael-ashcroft|work=britainstreasureislands.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashcroft is also an Ambassador for the education and veterans charity [[SkillForce]] which, under Chief Executive, [[Ben Slade]] devised and developed the [[Prince William Award]] - the only award of its kind in William's name.

===Environmentalist===
Ashcroft is a [[whale]] spotter, through which interest he has financially supported various environmental groups and campaigns. He financially supported the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]], who persuaded him to back a television campaign in six Caribbean countries, aimed at coaxing them to withdraw their support for whaling. The countries had received $16 million (£8 million) a year in [[Whaling in Japan#Normalization|fisheries aid from Japan]]. The campaign coincided with the 2006 [[International Whaling Commission]] conference in [[St Kitts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article1690260.ece|title=The unexpected face of fight to save the whales |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=18 December 2009 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Hasell | date=23 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907202847/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article1690260.ece| archivedate= 7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
Ashcroft has also supported military causes; in September 2011 he hosted a reception at the House of Lords for the launch of the Felix Fund, the charity for [[bomb disposal]] experts and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.felixfund.org.uk/2011/09/28/felix-fund-launch-raises-55000/|title=Felix Fund Launch raises £55,000|work=Felix Fund - The Bomb Disposal Charity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/8753256/Launch-of-1m-appeal-for-our-bomb-disposal-heroes.html|title=Launch of £1m appeal for our bomb disposal heroes|date=10 September 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashcroft pledged to donate all of the author's royalties from his book ''Special Forces Heroes'' to the [[Help for Heroes]] charity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/latest-news-archive/latest_news_5.html Help for Heroes – Latest News 5] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802154208/http://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/latest-news-archive/latest_news_5.html |date=2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from his book, ''George Cross Heroes'' to the [[Victoria Cross and George Cross Association]].

He donated £1 million of the £7 million cost of the [[Bomber Command Memorial]] in London's [[Green Park]], and his contribution is recognised on each side of the memorial.

==Victoria Crosses==
Ashcroft collects [[Victoria Cross]]es which are awarded for valour and devotion to duty to members of various armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=All Awards and Accreditation notices, Victoria Cross (VC) |newspaper=The Gazette, Official Public Record |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/awards-and-accreditation/content/10007 |access-date=20 May 2016 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His collection is by far the largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2270310/World%27s-largest-VC-collection-to-go-on-show.html |title=World's largest VC collection to go on show |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=8 July 2008 |first=Andrew |last=Pierce |accessdate=9 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning 128 years from acts of valour at the start of the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 to an act of courage during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. He wrote ''Victoria Cross Heroes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date  = 6 November 2006 | title = Victoria Cross Heroes: Men of Valour | last = Ashcroft | first = Michael | publisher = [[Headline Publishing]] (hardcover) | isbn = 978-0-7553-1632-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mark the 150th anniversary of the Victoria Cross.

Following the theft of a number of Victoria Crosses awarded to New Zealand servicemen from the [[National Army Museum (New Zealand)|Army Museum at Waiouru]] in late 2007, Ashcroft pledged NZ$200,000 for their return. Those stolen included the VC &amp; Bar of [[Charles Upham]]. The medals were recovered three months later and at a presentation in Wellington on 15 April 2008 he pledged a further NZ$200,000 for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the thefts.

In July 2008, Ashcroft announced a donation of £5 million for a permanent gallery at the [[Imperial War Museum]], where the fifty Victoria Crosses held by the museum are now on display alongside his own collection of 162 VCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3560402/Never-forget-the-winners-of-the-Victoria-Cross.html|title=Never forget the winners of the Victoria Cross|author=Ashcroft, Michael|date=11 July 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Tax status===
Ashcroft has been described as a "[[tax exile]]",&lt;ref name="Guardian_2002-08-27"/&gt; and for a number of years lived in the UK enjoying the controversial [[List of people with non-domiciled status in the UK|non-domiciled tax status]]. At the time of his ennoblement the Cabinet Office said that Ashcroft would be taking up permanent residence in the UK for tax purposes,&lt;ref name="Guardian_2002-08-27"/&gt; an undertaking described in the newspapers as a "pledge"&lt;ref name="BBC_2218803"/&gt; and a "gentleman's agreement",&lt;ref name="Guardian_2002-08-27"/&gt; but he did not in fact claim to do so until a decade later,&lt;ref name=BBC_8542744/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_10535852"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tory donor Lord Ashcroft gives up non-dom tax status | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 7 July 2010 | accessdate = 9 April 2015 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10535852 | quote = Lord Ashcroft has given up his non-dom tax status to stay in the Lords, it has been confirmed. }}&lt;/ref&gt; when a change in the law would have required him to quit the Lords, had he not done so.&lt;ref name="BBC_10535852"/&gt; Then in 2017 it was revealed following the [[Paradise Papers]] leak of offshore investment documents that Lord Ashcroft remained a domicile of Belize despite having claimed to have given up his non-dom tax status in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41879422|title=Paradise Papers: Lord Ashcroft stayed non-dom despite pledges|author= Paradise Papers reporting team|date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. DEA leak fiasco===
In 1999, Ashcroft was first nominated by Conservative Party leader and friend [[William Hague]] for the Lords. During their investigation, the [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]] was fed certain information via the media, which originated from Jonathan Randel, an intelligence research specialist for the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Randel leaked Ashcroft's name as being in the DEA's files, although it later emerged that Ashcroft was one of five million people they routinely had files on. Randel claimed that the DEA was ignoring Ashcroft in its investigation of [[money laundering]], allegations which ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper later printed on its front page. However, later investigation by various British media sources from information released under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|US Freedom of Information Act]] showed that at no point did the DEA personally investigate Ashcroft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/ashcroft/ |title=Lord Ashcroft |work=The Guardian |accessdate=18 December 2009 | location=London | date=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his second successful nomination to the Lords and his ascent to the house, Ashcroft sued ''The Times'' in the High Court. The two parties eventually reached an out of court agreement which resulted in [[Rupert Murdoch]] agreeing to ''The Times'' printing a full front page retraction of its allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=michael_ashcroft_1|title=Michael Ashcroft – December&amp;nbsp;8, 1999 "Murdoch Settles Libel Lawsuit"|publisher=History Commons|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashcroft later recounted his own side of the story in his book, ''Dirty Politics, Dirty Times.''&lt;ref name=DPDT/&gt;

===Business style===
In 2003, Ashcroft was criticised by the [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]], Mr Justice [[Peter Smith (judge)|Peter Smith]] in ''[[Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO (Holdings) Plc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2003] EWHC 936 (Ch), upheld in the Court of Appeal [2004] EWCA Civ 118, however Jonathan Parker LJ said, "That being so, it was in my judgment unnecessary and inappropriate for the judge to have expressed himself in such extreme language. However, the fact that he chose to express himself as he did has no impact on the conclusion which he reached on the issue of undervalue: a conclusion which, for the reasons I have given, was in my judgment plainly correct."&lt;/ref&gt; Smith condemned Ashcroft's tactics in relation to the takeover of cleaning company RCO by the Danish firm ISS. Smith said,

{{blockquote|Euphemistically this practice — which I understand is a not unheard-of practice in the City — is described as "[[greenmail]]". The proper word to my mind is blackmail. It is the kind of thing which brings the City into disrepute ... Where matters are dealt with in speculation and profits are made, which are then gathered offshore, when there is no merit and no exposure to the kind of risks associated with companies, that to my mind is not legitimate.|sign=Justice Peter Smith&lt;ref name=Obs1/&gt;}}

Smith went on to say that Ashcroft "was not content with a small £250,000 profit earned in a matter of weeks. He now seeks to extract millions."&lt;ref name=Obs1&gt;{{cite news |first=Conal |last=Walsh |author2=Antony Barnett |title=Ghost of Gekko in Ashcroft's greenmail |work=[[The Observer]] |date=11 May 2003 |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/11/theobserver.observerbusiness | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashcroft responded by telling journalists that  "being accused of blackmail by a man who states that speculation has no part to play in the City is rather like finding that you are sharing a railway carriage with a drunk. It's best not to take too much notice."&lt;ref name=Obs1/&gt;

In 2008, ''The Economist'' ran an article on the web of loans and court cases surrounding Belize Bank (owned by Ashcroft), a private hospital company called Universal Health Services and the government of Belize. It was alleged that Belize Bank had wrongly appropriated monies sent from the government of Venezuela for housing purposes in order to settle debts relating to loans to UHS and illegally guaranteed in secret by the Belizean premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11377008|title=A $10m mystery-What connects the deputy-chairman of the Conservative Party with Hugo Chávez|work=The Economist|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2010, Ashcroft was accused of avoiding VAT on opinion polls he commissioned for the Conservatives in 2005. The polls were carried out by [[YouGov]] and [[Populus]], and are believed to have cost in the region of £250,000.

''The Guardian'' said that sources claimed the bills were paid by a company owned by Ashcroft in Belize, meaning that he did not pay VAT. The newspaper estimated that the total VAT bill could have totalled more than £40,000, however, paying the bill in this way removed the legal obligation to pay VAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/03/ashcroft-party-vat-polling|title=Lord Ashcroft has been accused of avoiding VAT on opinion polls|date=5 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, BBC's ''Panorama'' programme alleged that Lord Ashcroft continued to control the Caribbean construction company, Johnston International, after its sale in 1999 until it went bankrupt in 2010, and that he concealed his continuing control. Ashcroft denied he owned Johnston after 1999 but ignored questions about whether he continued to 'control' it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16732528|title=Tory Lord Ashcroft 'concealed link to Caribbean firm'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Call Me Dave''===
Ashcroft's book ''[[Call Me Dave|Call Me Dave: The unauthorised biography of David Cameron]]'', published on 5 October 2015, has been criticised for containing content which lacks evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Conservative sources deny David Cameron pig’s head allegations|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/conservative-sources-deny-david-cameron-pigs-head-allegations|work=The Guardian|accessdate = 26 September 2015|first = Rowena|last = Mason|first2 = Patrick|last2 = Wintour}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, some commentators believe Ashcroft published the book to tarnish David Cameron's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = David Cameron biography: No 10 refuses to comment on debauchery claims|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-biography-downing-st-debauchery-claims|work=The Guardian|accessdate = 26 September 2015|first = Patrick|last = Wintour|first2 = Rowena|last2 = Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book triggered the "[[Piggate]]" scandal with an allegation that a photograph exists which shows Cameron putting "a private part of his anatomy" into the mouth of a dead pig's severed head, which was positioned in the lap of another man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3242550/Cameron-pig-bemused-look-face-future-PM-took-outrageous-initiation-ceremony-joining-Oxford-dining-society.html British Prime Minister and an obscene act with a dead pig's head: How David Cameron took part in sordid initiation ceremony after joining Oxford University dining society as a student.] ''Daily Mail''.

==Honours and styles of address==

===Honours===
On 31 March 2000, Ashcroft was appointed as a [[life peer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55806 |supp=y |page=11959|date=25 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title '''Baron Ashcroft''', of Chichester in the County of West Sussex was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 20 October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=56008 |page=11959|date=25 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment to the House of Lords was controversial at the time, particularly because of his business and political interests in Belize; the body responsible for scrutiny of political honours had refused his becoming a member of the Lords one year earlier.

He was nominated by Conservative party leader [[William Hague]] on the condition that he became a UK resident although at the beginning of 2010 he announced his "non-domiciled" tax status.&lt;ref name=BBC_8542744 /&gt; Ashcroft had announced that he intended to take the title "Baron Ashcroft of Belize", a suggestion that infuriated his political opponents.

'''''On the Ball''''' is a [[football]] management game series from the German developers [[Ascaron]], former name Ascon. The premiere title in the series is '''''On the Ball,''''' originally titled '''''Anstoss''''' in German. The player is managing a football club in the English League (in the original version the [[Bundesliga]] to become the [[Bundestrainer]]). The original game was very popular in Germany, so the developer Ascaron created several sequels: "On the Ball 2", "On the Ball 3", and "On the Ball Action". Doppelpass was a bundle that included On the Ball and the self-running add-on Anstoss World Cup Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/doppelpass|title=Doppelpass for Amiga (1994) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English version has a minor fan base.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehouseofgames.org/index.php?t=10&amp;id=229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The player chooses a team in the main menu which has the look of an office. As a manager, the player not only elects the football players for the team, but also run a stadium with the price management and the transfer of players. The football games can be presented in different forms. Then there is a text mode were the games is presented and commentated in text form and the last one has the text and some pictures of a game. The tactic of the own team could be changed and players could be switched. The career is limited to ten seasons.

'''Our Generation Speaks''' ('''OGS''') is a fellowship program and startup incubator whose mіѕѕіоn іѕ to bring together young [[Israelis|Israeli]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] leaders through entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogspeaks.com/about-ogs|title=Our Generation Speaks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OGS works in partnership with the [[Heller School for Social Policy and Management]] ([[Brandeis University]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heller.brandeis.edu/about/ourgenerationspeaks/|title=Our Generation Speaks – The Heller School at Brandeis University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MassChallenge]] &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|title=Can entrepreneurship bridge the Israeli-Palestinian gap?|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/10/can-enterpeneurship-bridge-the-israeli-palestinian-gap/|publisher=The Boston Globe - BetaBoston|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give OGS Fellows the tools to develop businesses that generate significant social and economic value in the [[Middle East]].

== Structure ==
OGS teaches business development, financial management, marketing strategy, and conflict-resolution to young adults aged 21–30. The fellowship runs over the course of three months in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] and includes daily classes taught by Brandeis University professors, one-on-one mentoring, and workshops. During the summer, the fellows work in teams to build sustainable businesses that will benefit their home communities. The fellowship operates entirely in English and provides each group of fellows with the skills and network to enact change in their communities. Each business developed through OGS receives seed funding at the end of the fellowship to aid in their launch and operations upon return to Israel and Palestine.

OGS Fellows remain connected through the OGS Alumni Organization, which plans a number of annual activities, including group trips in Israel and Palestine, meetings with local leaders, and trainings focused on career and leadership development. The organization will host an annual conference for current fellowship participants and the growing group of alumni over time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.ogspeaks.com|website=Our Generation Speaks|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OGS Fellows are exceptional young adults from both Israel and Palestine. OGS uses entrepreneurship to bring together people from these communities, which in turn works toward building trust and enacting social and economic change. Each year, OGS aims to maintain a 1:1 ratio of Israeli and Palestinians, as well as female and male fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/his-generation-speaks-qa-with-social-entrepreneur_us_585883a0e4b0d5f48e165242|title=Their Generation Speaks: Q&amp;A With Social Entrepreneur, Ohad Elhelo|first=Yuval|last=Rabin|date=19 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fellowship is fully funded for the fellows.

Some of the startups have also raised funds independently of OGS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/12/israel-bedouin-genetic-disease-family-doctor.html|title=Bedouin woman battles genetic diseases in Israel's Negev|date=2016-12-30|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2017/03/21/backed-by-big-wheels-a-boston-incubator-hooks-up-young-israelis-and-palestinians-to-launch-startups/#5655e0d46424|title=Backed By Big Wheels, A Boston Incubator Hooks Up Young Israelis And Palestinians To Launch Startups|last=Behar|first=Richard|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [1970s] – early [1980s], three major events… boosted the development of pancreas transplantation… [At] the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid-[1980s] and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas.

== Career ==
In 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm.  This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals, of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to [[Fresenius SE]] for $4.6 billion in July 2008.&lt;ref name="app"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-07-07/fresenius-agrees-to-buy-app-for-up-to-4-6-billion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004201/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-07-07/fresenius-agrees-to-buy-app-for-up-to-4-6-billion |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-08-27 | title = Fresenius Agrees to Buy APP for Up to $4.6 Billion | author1 = Angela Cullen | author2 = Eva von Schaper | publisher = [[Bloomberg News]] | date = 2008-07-07 | accessdate = 2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon-Shiong later founded [[Abraxis BioScience]] (maker of the drug [[Abraxane]] he co-discovered),&lt;ref name=CoDiscoverers&gt;The discovers on the key patents were [[N.P. Desai]], Soon-Shiong, [[P.A. Sandford]], [[M.W. Grinstaff]], and [[Kenneth S. Suslick|K.S. Suslick]], adding [[K. S. Wong]] to the two 1997 patents (see Further reading).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company he sold to [[Celgene]] in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.&lt;ref name="celgene"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2010/oct/18/celgene-closes-abraxis-acquisition/|title = Celgene Closes Abraxis Acquisition|last = Crowe|first = Deborah|publisher = [[Los Angeles Business Journal]]|date = 18 October 2010|accessdate = 20 October 2010}}{{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon-Shiong founded [[NantHealth]] in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=222554189|title=Company Overview of NantHealth, LLC|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon-Shiong went on to found [[NantWorks]] in September 2011, whose mission was "to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Shawn Baldwin]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3006413/innovation-agents/shawn-baldwin-analyzes-patrick-soon-shiongs-value-creation-through-medicin |title=Dr. Patrick Soon Shiong Generates Billions of Value Creation in Medicine |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Soon-Shiong's big rollup gets a name: NantWorks' |url=http://mobihealthnews.com/13083/soon-shiongs-big-rollup-gets-a-name-nantworks |first=Brian |last=Dolan|date=Sep 8, 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth's supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds.  The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotechit.com/story/biotech-billionaires-supercomputer-cuts-cancer-analysis-47-seconds/2012-10-04|title=Biotech billionaire's supercomputer cuts cancer analysis to 47 seconds|author=McBride, Ryan|publisher=fiercebiotechit.com|date=4 October 2012|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, [[NantOmics]], to develop cancer drugs based on [[protein kinase inhibitors]]. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks' vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-28/cancer-researcher-turned-billionaire-starts-new-company.html | title=Cancer Researcher-Turned-Billionaire Starts New Company | author=Tirrell, Meg| journal = [[Bloomberg.com]]|date=2013-01-28 | access-date=2013-02-26|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, with [[Arizona State University]] and the [[University of Arizona]], Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a "do-tank".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Message from the CEO and President' |url=http://www.healthcaretransformationinstitute.org/page/message-ceo-and-president |first=Patrick |last=Soon-Shiong|date=Sep 8, 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}{{self-published inline|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=November 2016}}  HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Patrick Soon-Shiong Talks With ASU's Michal Crow about the Imminent, Hoped-For Healthcare Revolution' |url=http://zocalopublicsquare.org/full_video.php?event_id=552 |authors=Crow, Patrick &amp; Soon-Shiong, Pattrick | date=2012-09-05}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service [[AccuRadio]], investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster.

As part of the donation, the university was required to use Soon-Shiong's company for the services required for the research, at a total cost of $10 million. NantHealth set the price for DNA sequencing at $10,000 per sample, while auditors found that other companies charged between $2,900 and $5,000 for the same service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/10/19/soon-shiong-utah-audit/|title=Utah audit finds legal violations in university's deal with Patrick Soon-Shiong|author=|date=19 October 2017|website=statnews.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal experts referred to it as money laundering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/06/soon-shiong-questions-philanthropy/|title=Three times Soon-Shiong's philanthropy raised questions|author=|date=6 March 2017|website=statnews.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2017/10/17/audit-university-of-utah-violated-state-law-by-directing-donation-money-back-to-donors-company/|title=Hughes questions whether University of Utah had a 'Cinderella-slippered' deal when it directed donation money back to donor's company|author=|date=|website=sltrib.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps a technique to receive tax deductions for an investment in Soon-Shiong's own company.

In early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/01/11/cancer-coalition-combination-drugs/|title=Rival drug firms team up to test new cancer treatment approach|date=2016-01-11|website=STAT|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/us/politics/if-cancer-becomes-bidens-cause-a-bold-but-polarizing-doctor-is-on-call.html|title=If Cancer Becomes Biden's Cause, a Bold but Polarizing Doctor Is On Call|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=2015-11-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2017, as announced by [[Sean Spicer]], then President-elect [[Donald Trump]] met with Soon-Shiong at his [[Bedminster, NJ]] estate to discuss national medical priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/10/the-full-transcript-from-the-trump-transition-teams-tuesday-call-to-reporters-6/ |title=The full transcript from the Trump transition team's Tuesday call to reporters |publisher=Washington Post |date=January 10, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Soon-Shiong's investment firm Nant Capital reached a deal to purchase the paper and ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' from [[Tronc Inc.]] for "nearly $500 million in cash" as well as the assumption of $90 million in pension obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-los-angeles-times-sold-20180207-story.html|title=Billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong reaches deal to buy L.A.

The term '''productivity alpha''' describes above [[benchmarking|benchmark]] [[productivity]] resulting from operations that have been optimized through the use of [[technology]].

Productivity alpha is essential to helping today’s [[asset management]] organizations remain competitive. It leads to cost savings, increased [[efficiency]] and a more satisfied work force.

==Background==

[[Alpha (investment)|Alpha]] is a word used in the [[investment]] process. A positive alpha means that a fund has performed better than the benchmark or better than average.

There is a direct correlation between a firm’s operations and productivity. When operations are automated and operational processes are streamlined, productivity increases. This can help a firm to see a significant improvement in their overall business. Well-run operations will, in fact:

* Enable the [[front office]] to address new sources of alpha
* Protect the generated alpha
* Minimize the cost of operations
* Provide accurate and transparent information to investors

By allowing the [[asset manager]] to execute his or her [[investment strategy]] faster or smarter, the operations can have a direct impact on the fund’s alpha.

Highly automated and efficient operations enable a firm to more quickly accommodate new instruments, strategies and markets, thus directly contributing to the development of new sources of alpha.

By avoiding errors and delays in operations the [[Chief operating officer|COO]] helps to protect the alpha that the [[Fund management|fund manager]] has created. 
Errors in the [[Middle office|middle]] or [[back office]] can result in additional costs for reversing trades or even penalties. Furthermore, inadequate technology can increase an organization’s risk exposure. Operations which are tightly and efficiently managed can contribute to the protection of investment alpha.

By being more efficient in operations, an organization can reduce the cost of operations, directly benefitting the fund or the asset manager’s P&amp;L.
Every dollar spent on administrative expenses is a dollar less in additional [[revenue]] performance. In order to create and protect alpha, you must be able to reduce expenses and streamline processes.

By leveraging efficient operations for enhanced client service and reporting, an organization can spend more productive time with its clients. 
[[Investor]]s today demand accurate and well-presented information in a timely manner. This requires that operational processes and systems be aligned and skillfully managed to successfully feed downstream reporting applications and produce credible investor reports.  Clearer reporting and increased [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] enables a higher quality and more satisfying client interactions, and directly contributes to the productivity of client-facing staff in both the front and back office.

==The role of technology==

Technology is essential in helping to optimize operations and increase productivity.  The strategic deployment of technology allows investment firms to manage complexity, increase efficiency, and reduce costs and operational risk. Technology also enables investment firms to respond to changing business and regulatory requirements such as [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act]], [[UCITS]] and [[MiFID]]. In TowerGroup’s report on the Top 10 Technology Initiatives for 2011, it is predicted that the areas that will see the most technology investment in 2011 will be [[risk management]], [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]], [[data management]], [[analytics]], and reporting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17581">[[Image:PullmanSquare.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Pullman Square, the centerpiece of Huntington's urban renewal efforts.]]

'''Pullman Square''' is a [[Lifestyle center (retail)|lifestyle center]] in downtown [[Huntington, West Virginia]], United States between 8th and 10th Street and 3rd Avenue and Veteran's Memorial Boulevard. It is located on what was known as the '''[[Cityscape of Huntington, West Virginia#Urban renewal|Superblock]]''',&lt;ref name="HD_022299"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ross | first=Jim |title=Chi-Chi's not interested in moving | publisher=''Herald-Dispatch'' | date=1999-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a large [[urban renewal]] project that saw the demolishing of four city-square-blocks in 1970.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"&gt;{{ cite news | last=Wellman | first=Dave |title=Officials hope decades of flops are over | publisher=''Herald-Dispatch'' | date=2000-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Superblock ===
The Superblock was to be a large revitalizaion project in downtown Huntington.&lt;ref name="HD_022299"/&gt; In 1970,&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; a four-block {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} vacant site was created for the next "large development"; however, problems besieged the area for decades. In 1974, a master plan was developed for the vacant site.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt;

In 1977, the [[Big Sandy Superstore Arena|Huntington Civic Arena]] was constructed on one parcel. One year later, a group of entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350-room hotel and retail stores; however, the plan died by 1980.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; In 1983, the ''National Shamrock Development and Investment Company'' wanted to develop the property and took a two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million ''Urban Development Action Grant'' request.

In the spring of 1986, the ''Huntington Development Corporation'' suggested that an off-track betting facility be constructed; however, the idea died after Governor [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.|Arch Moore]] vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; In 1987, the ''Webb Companies'' presented a plan for a $110 million mixed-use complex called '''''RiverCenter''''' that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a [[skywalk|skyway]] to the [[Harris Riverfront Park]].&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.

Another instance included an [[outlet mall]] proposal that was announced on May 6, 1987; however, two months later, the [[Herald-Dispatch]] reported that the project was "dead" and that the "13-year history of failure haunts (the) Superblock." &lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; Another proposal, on April 28, 1989 reported on a development that was "on tap," followed by an article several years later that stated, "super development dream fails to become reality." In 1992, a two-story shopping center was proposed but the idea failed to receive tenant support.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt;

A [[Chi-Chi's]] Mexican restaurant was constructed on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street in 1991.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; These developments were mostly suburban in nature and was not conductive to improvements in downtown Huntington. A [[Holiday Inn]] was constructed adjacent to the Big Sandy Superstore Arena between 8th and 9th Street in 1998.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt;

=== Intermodal facility ===
In 1998, $27 million for an intermodal facility was appropriated from [[United States Congress|Congress]]; an additional $6.7 million came from state and local funding.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "New facility could alter downtown." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Feb. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Governor [[Cecil Underwood]] had promised $700,000 in 1999, with local lawmakers funding the additional $1.3 million;&lt;ref name="HD_052299"&gt;"Huntington given more cash." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 22 May 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; an additional $4 million was to be allocated from the state over the next two years.

The proposed facility was for a [[Tri-State Transit Authority]] (TTA) bus transfer station, retail development and associated parking structures and would occupy a two-block surface parking lot between 8th Street and 10th Street along 3rd Avenue. A later study by ''Woolpert'' suggested at least {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of retail and a parking structure that has 800 to 1,400 spaces.  Yet another study suggested that retail, entertainment, dining, housing, cultural, and educational aspects be included in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Joseph. "Superblock a key component." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 28 March 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A ground breaking ceremony was planned in early 2000 with initial completion of the project in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edward. "Cash crunch hinders Superblock." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Feb. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to complete the ''Superblock'', Chi-Chi's would need to be evicted; however, it was granted and opportunity to have a restaurant within the proposed development.&lt;ref name="HD_022299"/&gt; Chi-Chi's refused to leave the ''Superblock'', however, citing that they wanted to "upgrade and remodel" the restaurant.

In 1999, [[Robert C. Byrd]] allocated $8 million to federal appropriation bills for the ''Superblock'' project.&lt;ref name="HD_052299"/&gt; Another $400,000 was allocated from the [[Federal Transit Administration]] to the ''Huntington Transit Authority'' for the feasibility study and master plan for the intermodal facility.

[[Image:Pullman Square.jpg|right|thumb|Pullman Square.]]

=== Pullman Square ===
On September 30, 1999, it was announced that the ''Huntington Urban Renewal Authority'' was in negotiations with the ''Transit Authority'' and an unnamed [[Columbus, Ohio]] developer for the Superblock.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edward. "Superblock progressing, chief says." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 1 Oct. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the ''Transportation Appropriations'' bill, which provided an additional $12 million in funds for the intermodal facility.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edward. "Superblock." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 16 Oct. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2000, ''Steiner + Associates'' (dropped in favor of ''Metropolitan Partners'' with the same developers), a Columbus, Ohio developer that specializes in recreating downtown urban environments, announced a $60 million {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|-4|abbr=on}}. retail and entertainment complex between 10th streets and 3rd Avenue and Veterans Memorial Boulevard that would resemble an "old-time small town" and would fit within the "historic context of the existing downtown." &lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Developer unveils plans for $60 million complex." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington], Oct. 19, 2000. March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Superblock plans revealed today." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The developers had previously constructed similar developments in [[Newport, Kentucky]] with the completion of [[Newport on the Levee]] and [[Easton Town Center]] in Columbus. The project would include stores, restaurants and a 12 to 16-screen movie theater and would open in fall of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Tarbett, Jean. "Shoppers." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Two parking structures would be constructed as well. The parking structure between 8th and 9th Street would be four-levels and include 940 parking spaces, but could be expanded upward to include an office tower; the parking structure between 9th and 10th Streets would be three-levels and include the movie complex on top.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Developer unveils plans for $60 million complex." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Broken down, the project plan included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Development Program/Merchandising Mix" | publisher=''Pullman Square'' | url=http://www.pullman-square.com/program.html | date=2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628034619/http://www.pullman-square.com/program.html |archivedate=2003-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} of retail,
* {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of restaurants,
* 25,300 sq, ft. of office space,
* {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} of entertainment, and 
* a 2,300-seat, {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} theater.

The plan included narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound towards the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] to one lane in each direction with angled parking; however, this was later revised to one-lane in each direction with parallel parking and a center variable lane.&lt;ref&gt;Gorczyca, Beth. "Before it gets spiffy, 3rd will be messy." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a [[traffic calming]] measure.

In January 2002, the ''Huntington Urban Renewal Authority'' began [[eminent domain]] proceedings against ''Chi-Chi's''.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Schedule tightens on Pullman." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 24 Jan. 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The parent company of ''Chi-Chi's'', ''Prandium Inc.'', had refused to sell the property and rejected the city's final offer on October 19, 2000 and refused all negotiations and communications with the ''Authority'' and with ''Metropolitan Partners''. In March, ''Prandium Inc.'' refused an offer of $975,000 for the property plus $200,000 in relocation costs, which was over the appraised value of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Chi-Chi's." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 9 March 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The company requested a sale price of $2 million instead.  The company, however, went into [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy reorganization in March. In May, ''Chi-Chi's'' wanted to sell the property for $1.15 million, including undisclosed costs for relocation and loss of business,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Chi-Chi's." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 2 May 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but later reversed out of the deal and wanted $1.75 million.&lt;ref name="HD_032703"&gt;Ross, Jim. "Superblock land sold to Pullman Square developers." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 27 March 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2002, ''Metropolitan Partners'' filed a grant request to the ''West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee''.&lt;ref name="HD_032703"/&gt; It received $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements.&lt;ref name="HD_100503"&gt;Ross, Jim. "Development in limbo." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 5 Oct., 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was later filed by the [[Jackson County, West Virginia]] lawyer Larry Harless, questioning the legality of the committee and its work. Eventually, the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] nullified the grant process and the grants that were given.

On March 26, 2003, the ''Superblock'' was sold to the developers of ''Pullman Square'', ''Metropolitan Partners''.&lt;ref name="HD_032703"/&gt; Chi-Chi's had until April 15 to vacate; it was demolished on the 29th.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Demolition makes way for Pullman." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 30 April 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening date had been pushed back from spring to summer 2004 due to a court case that was being considered by the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia|West Virginia Supreme Court]]. In July 2003, the [[West Virginia Legislature]] passed legislation that withstood the ''Court of Appeals''; however, the ''Pullman Square'' project had to be re-approved by the reconstituted grant committee.&lt;ref name="HD_071303"&gt;{{cite news | last=Cantley-Falk | first=Rebeccah | title=Work to begin Monday at Pullman site | publisher=''Herald-Dispatch'' | date=2003-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant money was once again awarded in August;&lt;ref name="HD_100503"/&gt; however, two citizens' lawsuits by Larry Harless once again disputed the process. In their case, they stated that the state may provide loans to the projects but not to the grants, and questioned the legality of the [[West Virginia Lottery|state's]] video lottery. The ''West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee'' was to finance the grants by selling bonds which would be repaid from profits on video lottery.

On October 17, 2003, the state Supreme Court ruled that the state could proceed with the sale of bonds financing ''Pullman Square'' and 48 other projects throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;"Ruling clears way for local projects." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Oct., 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and opening===
Construction began on Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with the excavation of the parking lot for the parking structures.&lt;ref name="HD_071303"/&gt; It opened on November 19, 2004 with [[Marquee Cinemas]].&lt;ref name="HD_112004"&gt;{{cite news| title="TODAY'S SPOTLIGHT: PULLMAN SQUARE" | author=Chambers, Bryan | date=2004-11-20 | publisher=[[The Herald-Dispatch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Empire Books &amp; News, [[EB Games]] and [[Starbucks]], opened in early December.&lt;ref name="HD_061605"&gt;"Pullman progress." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 16 June 2005. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, the Funny Bone Comedy Club opened, followed by [[Cold Stone Creamery]] in July and pizzeria [[Uno Chicago Grill]] and [[Max &amp; Erma's]] in August.

A few months after opening, the [[Uno Chicago Grill]] was sued for not paying the builders, suppliers, and utilities.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"/&gt; It soon changed its name to La Sha's [[West Virginia Lottery|West Virginia]] Bistro and was headed by [[Powerball]] winner [[Jack Whittaker (lottery winner)|Jack Whittaker]]; however, it closed on February 22, 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC complained that the ''Bistro'' owed thousands for rent.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HD_022207"&gt;{{cite news |first= Tarbett |last= Hardiman |title= Bistro closes doors at Pullman Square |work= Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] |date= 2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edible Arrangements]] was announced on August 5, 2006. The retail store, specializing in fruit bouquets and designer arrangements of fruit, opened in the fall.&lt;ref name="HD_080506"&gt;{{cite news |first= Justin |last= McElroy |title= New store set to open at Pullman |work= [[The Herald-Dispatch]] |date= 2006-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, on January 11, 2007, [[Moe's Southwest Grill]] closed for remodeling.&lt;ref name="HD_011207"&gt;{{cite news |title= Two downtown restaurants unexpectedly close |work= ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] |date= 2007-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quick-casual restaurant later reluctantly announced that it was, in fact, moving to a nearby location on 9th Street.  On March 17 Runway Couture opened next to Inspired, featuring west coast-inspired fashions; both are owned by Deneene Chafin.  Moe's Southwest Grill maintained goodfaith talks with Pullman Square and after protracted negotiations Metropolitan Partners agreed to Moe's corporate lease arrangements and subsequently surrendered the keys to the former location on November 5, 2007.

On May 8, 2008, it was announced that Community Trust Bank would locate a bank branch at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street. It would include spaces for more retail that is currently "under negotiations".&lt;ref name="HD_050807"&gt;{{cite news |first= Tarbett |last= Hardiman |title= Feds approve bank branch at Pullman |work= ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] |date= 2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in August. The Garage Chophouse, however, pulled out of Pullman Square.&lt;ref name="HD_050807"/&gt; In June, it was announced that Uno Chicago Grill would reopen under the franchise of Rick Rose, who owns some [[Bennigan's]] restaurants in Ohio, and under [[Mike Bartrum]], a retired [[NFL]] player.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"&gt;{{cite news | title=Pullman additions planned | last=Hardiman | first=Jean Tarbett | publisher=''[[Herald-Dispatch]]'' | date=2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant sells [[Chicago]]-style pizza and could open by July 30.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"/&gt; Benny's Cheesesteaks opened on June 19,&lt;ref name="HD_062007"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070620/NEWS03/70620016/-1/NEWS13 | title=Benny’s open at Pullman Square | date=2007-06-20 | publisher=''[[Herald Dispatch]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second location for the [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based restaurant that sells [[Philadelphia]]-style hoagies, wings, wraps, and beer. Heels, a high-end shoe store owned by the owner of Inspired and Runway Couture made its debut in July.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"/&gt;

=== Success ===
Since Pullman Square's opening in 2004, the lifestyle center has boasted many successes. ''Max &amp; Erma's'' is the number one chain in the number of sales, while ''EB Games'' is number one in sales for their region.&lt;ref name="HD_080506"/&gt; ''Cold Stone Creamery'' is listed as being in the top 10 of all stores in the United States.&lt;ref name="HD_080506"/&gt;

The company was founded in 1988.&lt;ref name=herper2013&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/08/14/how-two-guys-from-queens-are-changing-drug-discovery/ | deadurl=no | title=How Two Guys From Queens Are Changing Drug Discovery | date=August 14, 2013 | author=Herper, Matthew | work=[[Forbes]] | location=United States | accessdate=March 22, 2014 | archivedate=March 16, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316003731/http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/08/14/how-two-guys-from-queens-are-changing-drug-discovery/ }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally focused on [[neurotrophic factors]] and their regenerative capabilities (thus the name), it branched out into the study of both [[cytokine]] and [[tyrosine kinase]] receptors.

==Company history==
Regeneron has developed [[aflibercept]], a [[VEGF]] inhibitor, and [[rilonacept]], an [[interleukin-1]] blocker. VEGF is a protein that normally stimulates the growth of blood vessels, and interleukin-1 is a protein that is normally involved in inflammation.

On March 26, 2012, Bloomberg announced that [[Sanofi]] and Regeneron are in development with a new cholesterol drug which will help reduce cholesterol up to 72% more than the leading brands. The new drug targets the [[PCSK9]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2015/01/26/sanofi-and-regeneron-leapfrog-amgen-in-new-cholesterol-drug-race/#11360b5e6ef3|title=Sanofi And Regeneron Leapfrog Amgen In New Cholesterol Drug Race|last=Husten|first=Larry|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In July 2015, the company announced a new global collaboration with [[Sanofi]] to discover, develop, and commercialise new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/regeneron-sanofi-launch-2b-immuno-oncology-collaboration/81251558/|title=Regeneron, Sanofi Launch $2B+ Immuno-Oncology Collaboration - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data and $650 million from the development of [[REGN2810]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/struggling-sanofi-paying-18b-partner-regeneron-immuno-oncology/2015-07-28|title=UPDATED: Struggling Sanofi paying $1.8B to partner with Regeneron on immuno-oncology - FierceBiotech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; REGN2810 was later named cemiplimab.

'''350 North Orleans''' (formerly known as '''River North Point''') is the official name of the 24-floor multipurpose building located in the River North community area of Chicago, at the intersection of the North Branch and the Main Branch of the [[Chicago River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/1127.php|title=The Chicago Apparel Center|accessdate=July 14, 2010|publisher=Glass Steel and Stone|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115085859/http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/1127.php|archivedate=January 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] in 1977,&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merchandisemart.com/marchitecture/history.html|accessdate=July 10, 2007|title=History of the Mart|publisher=merchandisemart.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602052539/http://www.merchandisemart.com/marchitecture/history.html|archivedate=June 2, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1988, [[Helmut Jahn]] designed an enclosed [[pedestrian bridge|pedestrian walking bridge]] over Orleans Street connecting the building to [[Merchandise Mart]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACEmp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=117078&amp;lng=3|title=Apparel Center|publisher=[[Emporis.com]]|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally built to serve as the world's largest wholesale buying center for the [[clothing industry]], the building has more commonly known by several other names including '''River North Point, The''' '''Apparel Mart''', and the '''Chicago Apparel Center'''.  The building opened on November 6, 1976.&lt;ref name="WPCOS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Wolf Point Center Opens Saturday|date=November 5, 1976|work=Chicago Tribune |page=C9|author=Mateja, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The property was formerly owned by [[Marshall Field]] who sold it to [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and the building's grand opening was attended by the entire [[Kennedy family]].  The family owned the land upon which the building was constructed for over 50 years. After the building was constructed in 1976, it remained in the family for over 20 years, but was sold to [[Vornado Realty Trust]] in 1998 as part of a larger $625 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|625|1998|r=1}}}} million today) transaction including Merchandise Mart and several other properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Kennedy Family Selling Merchandise Mart To Vornado Realty|date=January 26, 1998|work=Chicago Tribune |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the family has retained its ownership interest in adjacent properties and continues to manage the Merchandise Mart business.

The building is associated with the neighboring Merchandise Mart to its east, which it is connected to by way of an enclosed pedestrian walkway and the two buildings are sometimes jointly referred to as the Merchandise Mart and Apparel Center or Merchandise Mart and Apparel Center Annex.  The building is one of four distinct properties that are known as Chicago's Mart Center complex, also known as World Trade Center Chicago: The Merchandise Mart, the Chicago Apparel Center, the Merchandise Mart ExpoCenter and [[Wolf Point, Chicago|Wolf Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=To The Mart ...

When the building was constructed, it was the world's largest wholesale buying center, featuring over 1,000 display [[showroom]]s representing over 3,000 clothing lines.  It was Chicago's attempt to replace New York City, where businessmen have to travel to 20 different buildings to see a comparable variety of clothing as the world's fashion center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New Apparel Center Expected To Boost City|date=January 12, 1976|work=Chicago Tribune |page=C7|author=Mateja, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its completion bolstered the Merchandise Mart's claim of being the "World's Largest Wholesale Buying Center".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Merchandise Mart Is Still City's Giant: A Town Of 20,000 And It's Not Very Crowded|date=February 4, 1977|work=Chicago Tribune |page=1|author=Unger, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was completed just as the downtown office space market recovered from the [[1973–75 recession]] and was part of a boom of Near North Side hotel constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Occupancy Rate Inches Up In Loop Offices|date=July 11, 1976|work=Chicago Tribune |page=W B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Chicago Building Slump Tops Out|date=January 2, 1977|work=Chicago Tribune |page=E12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WPMPHNC&gt;{{Cite news|title=Wolf Point's Mart Plaza Hotel Nearing Completion|date=September 19, 1976|work=Chicago Tribune |page=W B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adjacent parking lot has approximately 450 parking spaces.&lt;ref name=WPCOS/&gt; The grand opening ceremony on January 22, 1977 was attended by the Kennedy family, as well as [[Chicago Mayor]] [[Michael Bilandic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7yMjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ds4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3787,4533222&amp;dq=apparel+center+chicago&amp;hl=en|title=All In The Family|work=[[Palm Beach Post]]|date=January 23, 1977|accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Apparel Center Looks Good|date=January 22, 1977|work=Chicago Tribune |page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grand opening celebration included a fashion show attended by 1,200 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BXYUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6727,3667746&amp;dq=apparel+center+chicago&amp;hl=en|title=Fashion Fanfare Marks Opening Of Apparel Center In Chicago|date=January 27, 1977|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|author=Lawson, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 [[The Blackstone Group]] purchased 350 North Orleans for $390 million from San Francisco-based owner Shorenstein Properties. Shorenstein had purchased the property in January 2012 for $228 million and invested an estimated $70 million in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20150527/CRED03/150529861/willis-tower-buyer-pounces-on-former-apparel-center|title=Willis Tower buyer pounces on former Apparel Center|accessdate=November 20, 2015|date=May 27, 2015|work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]|author=Ori, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tenants ==
In 2012 the last of the apparel showroom Tenants vacated and the building was converted to 100% commercial office.  The existing Tenant base is primarily marketing firms and commodity trading firms. . The largest Tenants include [[Brookfield Properties Retail Group]] (formerly GGP), [[WPP plc]] ([[Ogilvy (agency)]] and Ronin Capital.

== Window Installation ==

The building was constructed with no windows above the 3rd floor and below the 13th floor (the Hotel was constructed with windows for obvious reasons).  In the mid-1990s as commercial office Tenants began to occupy the building, the building owners began replacing the original concrete pre-cast panels with windows.  The current owner has had windows installed on 3 full floors and replaced partial height windows with full height windows on many of the floors that had already had windows installed.  As of February 2018, there are only two elevations on the 8th floor of the north tower that are in need of window installation.

== Tenant Amenity Spaces ==
In 2018, the entire facade (from the 3rd floor upwards) was refinished and the original brown aggregate was painted, significantly improving its image.  In addition, the building owner redeveloped the existing conference facility and created a Tenant Lounge known as River Room which contains a Tenant exclusive conference facility and approximately 9,000 square feet of high end lounge space for Tenants to meet outside of the office in a more casual setting.  River Room has expansive views of the Chicago River and an adjacent bar / eatery is currently under construction.

In May of 2018 a high end fitness facility known as Studio350 was constructed in 10,000 square feet of vacant space on the 1st floor.  The facility is exclusive to 350 North Orleans Tenants and offers a full range of classes (yoga, spinning, strength training) and is operated by LifeStart on behalf of the building owner.

A Tenant exclusive roof deck has been constructed and appears to be opening in late 2018.

''' Mohammad Saiful Bukhari Azlan''' (born 6 July 1985) is a Malaysian politician. He was the personal assistant of former Malaysia Opposition Leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]] and also the accuser in [[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials#2008 allegation|Anwar's second sodomy trial]]. On 28 June 2008, he lodged a police report claiming that he had been forcibly sodomised by Anwar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/world/asia/30malaysia.html|title=Malaysia Opposition Leader Accused of Sodomizing Aide|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was put to him that a 61-year-old man is unlikely to be able to physically overpower a 24-year-old man, he changed his complaint to "homosexual conduct by persuasion".&lt;ref name=ipu2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/hr-e/186/Mal15.htm|title=Anwar Ibrahim - resolution adopted by consensus by the IPU Governing Council at its 186th session|publisher=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]|date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodomy, even if consensual, is punishable by up to 20 years' [[imprisonment]] and [[whip]]ping under Section 377B of the Malaysian Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081009021823/http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/S-E%2BAsia/STIStory_253862.html M'sian police classify sexual assault report against Anwar as sodomy] straitstimes.com. 2 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profile ==
From 2006 to 2007, Saiful attended college at the [[Universiti Tenaga Nasional]] (Uniten) in [[Bangi, Malaysia]] where he was a pro-student activist and a candidate for the University's student body president.

Saiful was an electrical engineering student but did not earn a degree due to his dismissal from the college in 2007. In the 2008 Malaysian General Elections, he supported the opposing political party, accusing the incumbent Prime Minister, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], of [[cronyism]] and corruption.

== Personal life ==
On 20 October 2012, Saiful became engaged to [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] personality Nik Suriani Megat Deraman and subsequently married her on 25 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2013/05/25/saiful-bukhari-is-now-a-married-man/ |title=Saiful Bukhari is now a married man  |website=thestar.com.my |access-date=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was found doing a [[batik]] and [[songket]] business at a booth during UMNO General Assembly 2016 at [[Putra World Trade Centre]] (PWTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mstar.com.my/berita/berita-semasa/2016/12/01/bekas-pembantu-anwar/|title=Bekas Pembantu Peribadi Anwar Kini Usahawan Muda|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|mStar]]|date= 1 December 2016 |language=[[Malay language|Malay]]|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political work==
After being dismissed from Uniten, Saiful became a volunteer worker at the [[Petaling Jaya]] branch office of the [[People's Justice Party]] (PKR). He was later appointed as a personal assistant to party leader,  Anwar Ibrahim. One of his duties as personal assistant was to organize meetings with parliamentary members wanting to switch over to the People's Justice Party. The meetings were held in a privately owned condominium in Desa Damansara (Damansara Heights), [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.

Saiful accompanied Anwar Ibrahim on several of his overseas trips during this period including travel to [[Hong Kong]] (early May 2008), [[Bangkok]] (late May 2008) and [[Singapore]] (16 June and 18 June 2008), according to his passport. Saiful was also used to assist Anwar's chief of staff in creating and arranging Anwar's schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Archives. [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/3/nation/21994433&amp;sec=nation "Saiful tells of duties and trips on his blog"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', 3 August 2008. 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saiful is an avid blogger and his blog has popular followings among pro-opposition as well as pro-government groups. In his blog, he once accused Anwar of trying to persuade members of parliament to jump parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/bm/news_lite.php?id=350227 Saiful Dakwa Atur Pertemuan Anwar Dengan Anggota Parlimen Yang Ingin Lompat Parti]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court case==
On 7 August 2008, Anwar was charged in the Kuala Lumpur Session Court for sodomy without consent, the victim being Saiful.&lt;ref&gt;LISA GOH and YUEN MEIKENG. [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/5/17/courts/8693876&amp;sec=courts "Anwar to enter defence"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', 17 May 2011. Retrieved on 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Saiful has alleged that he was sodomised by Anwar on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mageswari and Nurbaiti Hamdan. [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=/2010/5/14/nation/6261593 "It happened many times, says Saiful"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', 14 May 2010. Retrieved on 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The last offence was committed on 26 June 2008, at 11-5-1 Desa Damansara Condominium, No 99, Jalan Setiakasih, [[Bukit Damansara]], Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Anwar was charged under Section 377B Kanun Keseksaan of the [[Malaysia]]n penal code, that can amount to 20 years incarceration and whipping if found guilty. He pleaded not guilty to the allegations.

:* Section 377A penal code defines the term "sodomise" as: "Any person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit carnal intercourse against the order of nature."
:* Section 377B penal code states: "Whoever voluntarily commits carnal intercourse against the order of nature shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to whipping."
:* Section 377C penal code states: "Whoever voluntarily commits carnal intercourse against the order of nature on another person without the consent, or against the will, of the other person, or by putting the other person in fear of death or injury to the person or any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years and not more than twenty years, and shall also be liable to whipping."

==Religious oath-taking==
On 15 August 2008, in the main hall of the [[Federal Territory Mosque]], Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur, Saiful took an oath pursuant to the [[Sharia|Shariah]] Islamic principles that he spoke the truth. The ceremony lasted 15 minutes and was witnessed by more than 30 people, including photographers and camera operators. No mainstream or government media were permitted to record the event. Before taking the oath, Saiful read a couple of verses from the [[Quran]] including the [[Surah Al-Fatihah]].&lt;ref&gt;Archives. [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/22/permatang_pauh/22144293&amp;sec=Permatang%20Pauh "Anwar asked to explain"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', 22 August 2008. Retrieved on 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saiful's oath :
&lt;blockquote&gt; I, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, swear by the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious the Most Merciful, that I was sodomized by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June 2008. On that day Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim put his genital inside my anus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 If I lied in this confession, then I'm lying to God and I will accept the consequences, I will be damned until the day of judgement, wallahualam. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among those who witnessed the oath taking ceremony were Saiful's father [[Azlan Mohd Lazim]] and the mosque designated Imam Ramlang Porigi. A press conference was then held at the Dinasti Hotel, Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bernama.com/bernama/v3/bm/news.php?id=353076 Saiful Mengangkat Sumpah Di Masjid Wilayah Persekutuan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AUDREY EDWARDS.

Retrieved 0n 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions of other political and religious leaders==
Perlis's [[mufti]], [[Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin]] said that the oath taken by Saiful was in accordance with Islam. This is because he has declared with intent and proclaiming the divine words of Wallahi, Wabillahi, Watallahi.&lt;ref&gt;SIRA HABIBU. [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/5/2/nation/8590854&amp;sec=nation "Take the oath too, Anwar urged"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', 2 May 2011. Retrieved on 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) Deputy Youth Chief [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] then said that Saiful's oath cannot be undermined as those who have taken the divine oath invoke Allah's wrath if they are lying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/anwar_asked_to_explain.html Anwar asked to explain ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election participation==
Saiful contested as an independent candidate in the [[Port Dickson by-election, 2018|Port Dickson by-election]] held on 13 October 2018 after the seat was vacated by it's incumbent member of parliament Danyal Balagopal Abdullah to enable Anwar to contest and be elected back to the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/09/28/mohd-saiful-bukhari-to-contest-pd-by-election/|title=Saiful Bukhari back to haunt Anwar in PD by-election - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/09/29/eight-candidates-for-pd-polls/|title=PD polls: Multi-cornered fight as 7 candidates vie for seat (Updated) - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saiful only managed to get 82 votes and lost his electoral deposit in the seven-corners by-election which was won by Anwar with a majority of 23,560 votes on 13 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/13/anwar-ibrahim-wins-pd-byelection-with-23560-vote-majority/|title=EC: Anwar wins PD polls with 23,560-vote majority  -  Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After Aaron Swartz's death, the first instance of the platform was launched under the name ''Strongbox'' by staff at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on 15 May 2013.&lt;ref name=davidson2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html |title=Introducing Strongbox |last1=Davidson |first1=Amy |authorlink1=Amy Davidson (author) |date=15 May 2013 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]] took over development of DeadDrop under the name ''SecureDrop'', and has since assisted with its installation at several news organizations, including [[ProPublica]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Intercept]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="strongbox"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New Yorker|url=https://projects.newyorker.com/strongbox/ |title=Strongbox|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luxembourg"&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1308.6768|last1=Biryukov|first1=Alex|title=Content and popularity analysis of Tor hidden services|last2=Pustogarov|first2=Ivan|last3=Thill|first3=Fabrice|last4=Weinmann|first4=Ralf-Philipp|class=cs.CR|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite news|author=Davidson, Amy|date=15 May 2013|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html |title=Introducing Strongbox|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==

SecureDrop uses the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] to facilitate communication between [[whistleblowers]], journalists, and news organizations. SecureDrop sites are therefore only accessible as hidden services in the Tor network. After a user visits a SecureDrop website, they are given a randomly generated code name.&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; This code name is used to send information to a particular author or editor via uploading. [[Investigative journalist]]s can contact the whistleblower via SecureDrop messaging. Therefore, the whistleblower must take note of their random code name.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;

The system utilizes private, segregated [[server (computing)|servers]] that are in the possession of the news organization. Journalists use two [[USB flash drive]]s and two personal computers to access SecureDrop data.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; The first personal computer accesses SecureDrop via the Tor network, the journalist uses the first flash drive to download [[encrypted]] data from the Internet. The second personal computer does not connect to the Internet, and is wiped during each reboot.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; The second flash drive contains a [[decryption]] code. The first and second flash drives are inserted into the second personal computer, and the material becomes available to the journalist. The personal computer is shut down after each use.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;

Freedom of the Press Foundation has stated it will have the SecureDrop code and security environment audited by an independent third party before every major version release and then publish the results.&lt;ref name=second-audit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timm|first1=Trevor|title=SecureDrop Undergoes Second Security Audit|url=https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/securedrop-undergoes-second-security-audit|accessdate=13 July 2014|agency=Freedom of the Press Foundation|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first audit was conducted by University of Washington security researchers and [[Bruce Schneier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Czeskis|first1=Alexei|last2=Mah|first2=David|last3=Sandoval|first3=Omar|last4=Smith|first4=Ian|last5=Koscher|first5=Karl|last6=Appelbaum|first6=Jacob|last7=Kohno|first7=Tadayoshi|last8=Schneier|first8=Bruce|title=DeadDrop/StrongBox Security Assessment|url=http://www.czeskis.com/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF|publisher=University of Washington Department of Computer Science and Engineering|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second audit was conducted by [[Cure53]], a German security firm.&lt;ref name=second-audit/&gt;

==Prominent organizations using SecureDrop==
The Freedom of the Press Foundation now maintains an [https://securedrop.org/directory official directory] of SecureDrop instances.

{{Politics sidebar|Admin}}
'''Street-level bureaucracy''' is the subset of a  [[Public administration|public agency or government institution]] where the [[civil servant]]s work who have direct contact with members of the general public. Street-level civil servants carry out and/or enforce the actions required by a government's laws and [[public policy|public policies]], in areas ranging from safety and security to education and [[social service]]s. A few examples include [[police officer]]s, [[border guard]]s, [[social worker]]s and public school [[teacher]]s. These civil servants have direct contact with members of the general public, in contrast with civil servants who do [[policy analysis]] or [[economic]] analysis, who do not meet the public. Street-level bureaucrats act as liaisons between government policy-makers and citizens and these civil servants implement policy decisions made by senior officials in the public service and/or by elected officials.

Street-level bureaucrats interact and communicate with the general public, either in person (as with a police officer doing a [[random checkpoint]] to check for [[drunk driving]] or a civil servant in a department of transportation who helps people to register a newly purchased car and provide them with [[licence plate]]s); over the phone (as with a government [[call center]], where civil servants answer phone calls from people who are applying for or receiving [[unemployment insurance]]); or, in jurisdictions which have implemented [[electronic government]] technologies, via the [[Internet]] (e.g., a person finding out about the government's [[taxation law]]s by going onto the taxation department's official [[website]] and asking questions to a civil servant via [[email]]).

Street-level bureaucrats often have some degree of [[discretion]] on how they enforce the rules, laws and policies which they are assigned to uphold. For example, a police officer who catches a speeding motorist typically can decide whether to give the driver a warning or apply a penalty such as a fine or criminal charge; a [[border guard]] who finds undeclared rum in a border-crossing motorist's car trunk can either give the person a warning, confiscate and destroy the [[contraband]] item, or levy a fine or other penalty; a government social worker who meets with an unemployed person can decide whether or not to provide [[social assistance]] or unemployment insurance benefits; and a high school [[Principal (education)|principal]] who finds that a student is [[truancy|skipping school]] can decide whether or not to suspend the person, taking into account the student's unique circumstances and situation. Even though front-line bureaucrats have this degree of discretion, they typically must operate within the [[rule of law]], the system of government [[regulation]]s, [[law]]s and [[administrative law|administrative procedural rules]]. These regulations, laws and rules help to ensure that the street-level bureaucracy operates fairly and ethically, and that each citizen is treated fairly.

== History ==
The concept of street-level bureaucracy was first coined by [[Michael Lipsky]] in 1969(&lt;ref name="Lipsky, Michael 1969"&gt;Lipsky, Michael (1969). Toward a Theory of Street-Level Bureaucracy (IRP Discussion Papers No. 48-69) (p. 45). Madison, WI: Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP), University of Wisconsin. Retrieved from http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp4869.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), who argued that "policy implementation in the end comes down to the people [(the street-level bureaucrats)] who actually implement it". However, the process of street-level bureaucracy has been around for a much longer period. A "government will be better accepted if its administrators [e.g., bureaucrats] reflect the origins [and needs] of its people", &lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Scott A.; Klay, William Earle. "George Washington's Precedents: The Institutional Legacy of the American Republic's Founding Public Administrator". ''Administration &amp; Society'' 2015: 75-91. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; an ideal which embodies the goals of an effective street-level bureaucracy in America. Some of the first street-level bureaucrats in the US were [[post office]] officials and administrators. The presidency of [[Woodrow Wilson]] helped to spur a large growth in public administration and government policy-making, which in turn led to larger-sized and better-funded street-level bureaucracies. However it was not until the 1950s with the [[baby boom]] that street level bureaucracy became as strong as a presence in society as it is in the 2000s.

Lipsky describes street level bureaucrats as the "human face" of policy, since these individuals interact directly with citizens.&lt;ref name="Lipsky, Michael 1980"&gt;Lipsky, Michael. Street-level Bureaucracy: Dilemmas of the Individual in Public Services. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of street-level bureaucracy follows the history of policy development and  the scope of government in America, with areas with larger populations and more government policies employing more public servants (e.g., Chicago which employs 26,680 teachers).(&lt;ref name="Lipsky, Michael 1980"/&gt;) Due to street-level bureaucrats' close interactions with citizens, day-to-day application of discretion in their assessment of people's cases and issues, and their role as policy interpreters, Lipsky claims that "in a sense the street-level bureaucrats implicitly mediate aspects of the [[Constitution|constitutional]] relationship of citizens to the state. In short, they hold the keys to a dimension of [[citizenship]]."(&lt;ref&gt;Lipksy, Michael. Street-level Bureaucracy. N.p.: n.p., 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) The interpretation of the duties, scope, and responsibilities of street-level bureaucrats are still debated in the 2000s, with ongoing discussion on the roles of discretion, accountability, lack of resources, and technology and concerns raised about the risks of corruption.

== Demand and need ==
Where there is population growth, there is usually growth in demand for these occupations, because there are more citizens who need public services. The demand for these occupations will vary by region but generally, the job outlook in these careers is on the rise in many countries and/or regions where there is an increase in population.

=== Education ===
In the United States' education sector there is a strong demand for teachers in numerous regions across the country. There are currently fifty-one "hot spots" with a demand for educators in these regions. Amongst these fifty-one hot spots, five of the regions are with an incredible need for educators in both the primary and secondary education sector. The areas of desperate need include: Las Vegas, Nevada; the Northern region of Oklahoma; Kansas City, Missouri; the Central region of Arkansas; and the Western region of Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Maria|title=Where We Work|url=https://www.teachforamerica.org/where-we-work|website=Teach For America|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Police  ===
The demand for police officers is another occupation that will experience growth over the next ten years. Because urbanized and metropolitan regions are amongst the fastest growing in the United States, that is generally where the demand for these individuals will be.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Labor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook: Police and Detectives|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/police-and-detectives.htm#tab-6|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firefighters ===
Firefighters are another case in protective services where an increase in demand is expected over the next decade. A seven percent increase in career outlook is to be expected by the year 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook: Firefighters|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/firefighters.htm#tab-6|website=Bureau of Labor and Statistics|accessdate=8 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social workers ===
The demand for [[social worker]]s has an average growth rate in the United States. With a general population increase social workers are needed in all areas of the career field. The demand for social workers is extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child and Family Social Worker|url=http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/child-and-family-social-worker|accessdate=2015|agency=U.S. News &amp; World Report L.P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national average for growth in all careers stands at eleven percent, while a projected nineteen percent increase in social work is needed to fulfill the sectors responsibility to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook: Social Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm#tab-6|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=8 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==

=== Corruption and accountability ===
Corruption in street-level bureaucracy is a violation of the ethical codes of conduct, laws and regulations that have been established by the government and its agencies. An example of corruption would be cases where a [[police officer]] or [[border guard]] accepted a [[bribe]] from a member of the public in return for not enforcing a law or regulation. There are many agencies which define and interpret what is acceptable ethical behavior and what is not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oge.gov/uploadedfiles/education/education_resources_for_ethics_officials/resources/code_of_ethics_poster.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.oge.gov/uploadedfiles/education/education_resources_for_ethics_officials/resources/code_of_ethics_poster.pdf|url = http://www.oge.gov/uploadedfiles/education/education_resources_for_ethics_officials/resources/code_of_ethics_poster.pdf|website = www.oge.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of these rules or ethical codes of conduct by street-level bureaucrats has repercussions that effect not only the person or agency involved, but also the general public that these street-level bureaucracies serve. Neutrality and impartiality in following policies and procedures is what is expected and most remain separate from person feelings or views.  Here is a link to a social work case that let personal feelings override there ethical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/EoENovDec08.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deception in Social Work|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/EoENovDec08.shtml|website = www.socialworktoday.com|accessdate = 2015-05-06|first = Great|last = Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example for corruption in street-level bureaucracy are black market payments for doctors and nurses, as part of the shadow economy. The term "black market medicine" refers to a variety of illegal actions that individuals take in order to obtain healthcare services for themselves. Such actions include direct payments to doctors in government hospitals to improve one's position on the waiting list (especially for surgeries) or payments to doctors so they will treat the patient personally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nissim|date=2016|title=How Culture Affects Street-Level Bureaucrats’ Bending the Rules in the Context of Informal Payments for Health Care: The Israeli Case|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074016665919|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|volume=48|pages=175-187|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accountability]] is the means by which these codes are upheld and to ensure moral and ethical practices within these bureaucratic agencies. There is much debate over the methodology of how exactly these agencies should be held accountable. Accountability is divided into five categories: transparency, liability, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pathologies of Accountability: ICANN and the Challenge of "Multiple Accountabilities Disorder" - Koppell - 2005 - Public Administration Review - Wiley Online Library|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00434.x|journal = Public Administration Review|access-date = 2015-05-06|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00434.x|volume=65|pages=94–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major accountability processes are compliance based and performance based. "Traditionally, accountability has involved defining rules and procedures and then employing various means to ensure compliance with these expectations"&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = THE ACCOUNTABILITY PARADOX IN AN AGE OF REINVENTION: The perennial problem of preserving character and judgment|last = Jos|first = P.H.|date = 2004|journal = Administration &amp; Society|doi = 10.1177/0095399704263479|pmid = |last2 = Tompkins|first2 = M.E.|issue = 3|volume = 36|pages = 255–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance-based practices rely on standardized processes that measure performance in terms of output and results.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Yet compliance based, and performance based accountability has limitations for measuring the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and economy of the bureaucracy. Furthermore, accountability stems from a multidimensional perspective, which includes the general public the bureaucracy serves, peers and co-workers, office managers, public administrators, and elected officials.

=== Discretion ===

[[Discretion]] can be defined as a component in the decision making process that determines an individual's action or non-action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Is There A Need for Control?|last = Carrington|first = Keith|date = 2005|journal = Public Administration Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 29|pages = 140–161|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrington divides discretion into two major components as the freedom the decision maker has to choose between different actions; and the decision to act or not act through the rules and judgment of the decision maker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Michael Lipsky states street level bureaucrats have discretion because human judgment is in the nature of service work that machines could not replace.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Street-Level Bureaucracy|last = Lipsky|first = Michael|publisher = Russell Sage Foundation|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Street level bureaucrats are responsible for making appropriate decisions that are appropriate for clients and their situations. Lipsky states all street level bureaucrats will confront situations in which they need to depart from service ideals in order to cope with both expectations from their jobs and the public ideals. 

According to Lipsky, the exercise of discretion among street level bureaucrats is critical in how public servants interact with citizens on a daily basis. He claims to understand these acts of discretion once must analyze the outcome of agency performance the public experiences as a combined result of agency rules and street level bureaucrats responses to unsanctioned work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lipsky said the use of discretion by street level bureaucrats can’t be removed from everyday practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of human service work. Carrington identifies the fear of power abuse as a major reason for the opposition of discretion in the arena of street level bureaucrats and its citizens. In order to control problems in discretionary action there has been a demand for control by understanding the social situations in which discretion varies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marissa Kelly also examines the use of discretion among street level bureaucrats to assert that discretion can either enhance or inhibit street level bureaucrats’ implementation of justice. She asserts that whether discretion is appropriate or not justice theories need to be further examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Theories of Justice and Street-Level Discretion|last = Kelly|first = Marisa|date = 1994|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory: J-PART|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 4|issue = 2|pages = 119–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of resources ===

Lipsky concludes that the lack of resources causes street level bureaucrat to develop simplified routines for processing cases that influence their everyday tasks. These routines for decisionmaking affect public policy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He states that street level bureaucrats are taught implementation skills instead of learning about how to find more resources, knowledge and information that would help them to implement policies more effectively.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Understanding Implementation: Street-Level Bureaucrats' Resources for Reform|last = Hill|first = Heather|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Public Administration|doi = 10.1093/jpart/mug024|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 265–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill identifies several implementation resources street level bureaucrats often lack such as; research resources, appropriate resources on how to shape specific policies for their specific situation, and access to expertise and skills training to better their decision-making and awareness in specific challenging situations that arise at the street level.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another key resource that front-line bureaucrats often lack is time to fully assess individual cases. In social services, social workers often have such a large caseload that they can only see social assistance recipients or applicants for a very short time each week. As a result, social workers have to make very rapid decisions as to whether to approve or deny welfare benefits.

== Role of technology==
[[File:RIAN archive 440889 Mamonovo-Avtodorozhnoye border-control checkpoint on the Russian-Polish border in the Kaliningrad Region.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A border guard checks a computer display when a citizen comes to the service window.]]
Technological advances such as the widespread availability of the Internet and online databases have had a major impact on street-level bureaucracy and the front-line civil servants who provide services to citizens. There are two major theories on how technology has impacted this sector: curtailment theory and enablement theory. Curtailment theory holds that increasing technological advances hinder street-level bureaucrats and their ability to perform effectively; especially concerning their ability to exercise discretion on complex cases. Enablement theory holds that increasing technological advances, at best, empower the existing abilities of the street-level bureaucrat and better inform the citizen. At worst, the effects of technology are ambiguous.

=== Curtailment theory ===

It was first argued by Snellen that increasing  technological advances (ITA) "deeply challeng[e] [the street-level bureaucrat's] ability to manipulate information."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Snellen|first1 = I|title = Electronic Governance: Implications for Citizens, Politicians and Public Servants|journal = International Review of Administrative Sciences|date = 2002|volume = 68|issue = 2|pages = 183–198|doi=10.1177/0020852302682002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snellen believed it was the ability to manipulate information that gave the SLB's their power. He further argued that as more decisions are made by computers or software, SLB's will lose their discretionary powers and they will shift to other actors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Buffat|first1 = Aurelien|title = Street-Level Bureaucracy and E-Government|journal = Public Management Review|date = 2013|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 149–161|doi=10.1080/14719037.2013.771699}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 2010, some government organizations use online application forms for programs in which the computer program, rather than a human front-line bureaucrat, will reject applications which are incomplete. In a pre-technological advances era, a front-line bureaucrat might have used his or her discretion over decisions to allow an application in which some of the information requests are not completed (e.g., due to urgent need on the part of the citizen or the existence of an emergency situation). For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, if a social worker received a hand-written, pen-and-paper application from a [[homeless]] person for [[social assistance]], the bureaucrat might approve the application even if the applicant did not have a street address or the required identification documents, to ensure that the applicant remained housed and safe.
 
However, there are four problems with this thesis. First, it is implied, but never proven, that with the arrival of more technology, discretion at the frontline will diminish or become non-existent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Second, Snellen's definition of the SLB's source of power is too narrow and does not take into account other sources of discretion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Third, this thesis only pertains to particular public organizations and does not apply to more common types of street-level bureaucracies such as police departments, schools, or social welfare departments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lastly, this theory does not take into account how SLB's and other caseworkers actually utilize this new technology and how that might affect their performance.

=== Enablement theory ===

In contrast to the curtailment theory, a 2007 study by Jorna and Wagenaar showed that ITA was able to increase the amount of work done while cutting down on inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Iron Cage Strengthened? Discretion and Digital Discipline|last = Jorna|first = F|date = 2007|journal = Public Administration|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00640.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Wagenaar|first2 = P|volume = 85|issue = 1|pp = 189–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the meaning and content of this work was not able to be captured and understood by ITA. A 2004 study by Vitalis and Duhaut 
highlighted the ambiguous nature of ITA.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nouvelles Technologies De L'information Et De La Communication Et Relation Administrative: De La Relation De Guichet A La Relation De Reseau|last = Vitalis|first = A|date = 2004|journal = Revue Francaise D'Administration Publique|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Duhaut|first2 = N|volume = 110|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown that the [[Internet]] or other forms of technology were utilized for simpler tasks, and more elaborate and complex matters were dealt with face-to-face with citizens. Vitalis and Duhaut come to the conclusion that a SLB has their discretionary power enhanced by ITA, and citizens benefit from ITA by being better informed of their rights when dealing with SLBs and 
their institutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This theory maintains that discretion by the SLB is not hindered in anyway by ITA and will continue to do their jobs effectively. This theory also focuses more on how ITA is utilized by both citizens and state agents which puts more emphasis on the ability of ITA to further help and empower SLBs and citizens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This book is notable as an inside look at a biotechnology company, and the stresses and marketing pressures on funding research into drug design. This book is a mixture of finance and technology.

He is the son of an automobile spare parts trader and left school in the seventh grade upon which he sold ice pops to support his family. According to [[The Washington Post]], he then "rose from a car washer and office boy to become one of the nation's richest men". In 2006, he was listed as #35 on a [[Forbes]] list of "the 40 richest men in Indonesia".&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/80/06indonesia_Tomy-Winata_RSXG.html |title=Indonesia's 40 Richest: #35 Tomy Winata |author= |date=7 September 2006 |work= |publisher=''Forbes'' |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Winata's business empire has been developed under the Artha Graha Group and Artha Graha Network. In 1988, he worked with the Indonesian Army Foundation to rescue a troubled local bank, Bank Propelat, and subsequently changed its name to Bank Artha Graha.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In mid-1997, in cooperation with [[Bank Indonesia]] he bailed out Bank Arta Prima,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} which was then merged with Bank Artha Graha. In 2003, Artha Graha Group took over Bank Inter-pacific, Tbk (a publicly listed company).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 2005, Bank Inter-pacific, Tbk acquired Bank Artha Graha becoming Bank Artha Graha Internasional, Tbk (INPC.JK).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Winata is involved in the property sector through PT Jakarta International Hotels and Development, Tbk (JIHD.JK, a publicly listed company), which owns Borobudur Hotel in Central Jakarta, and PT Danayasa Arthatama, Tbk (SCBD.JK, a publicly listed company), which owns the Sudirman Central Business District (SCBD) in the heart of Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://scbd.com/menu/page/profile | title = Profil

Winata plans to build the Signature Tower Building-Jakarta, a 111-storey skyscraper, which will be the fifth tallest building in the world, in the center of the SCBD. He has said the mega-project is part of his mission to show the world that "Indonesia can".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarasumbar.com/berita/nasional/d/0/285152/tomy-winata-indonesia-jadi-pemain-penting-dunia.html Tomy Winata: Indonesia Jadi Pemain Penting Dunia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017020735/http://www.antarasumbar.com/berita/nasional/d/0/285152/tomy-winata-indonesia-jadi-pemain-penting-dunia.html |date=2013-10-17 }}, ''antarasumbar.com'', 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His vision is to make SCBD the "Manhattan of Indonesia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/jakarta-can-be-a-new-manhattan-tomy-winata/587266 Jakarta Can Be a 'New Manhattan': Tomy Winata'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424000904/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/jakarta-can-be-a-new-manhattan-tomy-winata/587266 |date=2013-04-24 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurnas.com/news/90197/Jakarta_Bisa_Jadi_Kota_Yang_Diperhitungkan_Dunia/1/Nasional/Ibu_Kota Jakarta Bisa Jadi Kota Yang Diperhitungkan Dunia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017081107/http://www.jurnas.com/news/90197/Jakarta_Bisa_Jadi_Kota_Yang_Diperhitungkan_Dunia/1/Nasional/Ibu_Kota |date=2013-10-17 }}, ''jurnas.com'', 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Press==
In a high-profile case against the news magazine ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'' following an article's "Ada Tomy in Tenebang?" (Is there Tomy in [[Tanah Abang]] ?) published in the March 3, 2003 issue of ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'',&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42646-2004Aug28.html |title=Magazine Case Tests Indonesian Press Freedom |author=Ellen Nakashima |date=29 April 2004 |work= |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tempo'' editor-in-chief [[Bambang Harymurti]] was found guilty.&lt;ref name="smh030509"/&gt;

The Central Jakarta District Court ordered ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'' magazine to publicly apologize and to pay a fine of 500 million rupiah (US$59,000).  Tomy filed libel charges against PT Tempo Inti Media; chief editor Bambang Harymurti; chief deputy editor Toriq Hadad; reporters Ahmad Taufik, Bernarda Rurit, and Cahyo Junaidi; publisher Fikri Jufri and corporate director Zulkifli Lubis, according to a Tempo report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magazine found guilty of libel|url=https://cpj.org/x/ec6|website=cpj.org|accessdate=March 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge stated that, "Tempo failed to find the truth by covering both sides before publishing the article," said a report in [[The Jakarta Post]]. However, this conviction was later overturned on appeal.&lt;ref name="smh030509"/&gt;

In another high-profile case, in the provision of travellers cheques used in 2004 to bribe Indonesian politicians to elect Miranda Swaray Goeltom as Senior Deputy Governor in the Indonesian central bank, [[Bank Indonesia]], has been widely reported in the Indonesian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3189&amp;Itemid=367 |title=Indonesia's Judicial Flying Circus |author= |date=12 May 2011 |work= |publisher=''Asia Sentinel'' |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Miranda said he did not know the owner of Bank Artha Graha. "Who owns it?" she told Tempo last Friday. "I do not know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dekat dengan Bos Artha Graha?

In 2010, the United States implemented the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]]; the law required financial firms around the world to report accounts held by US citizens to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. 
The US on the other hand refused the [[Common Reporting Standard]] set up by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], alongside [[Vanuatu]] and [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="SwansonApr5" /&gt;

This means the US receives tax and asset information for American [[asset]]s and [[income]] abroad, but does not share information about what happens in the United States with other countries. In other words, it has become attractive as a [[tax haven]].&lt;ref name=BloombergDrucker /&gt;

Though the U.S. has been a pioneer in defending itself from foreign secrecy jurisdictions, aggressively taking on the Swiss banking establishment and setting up its technically quite strong Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) – it provides little information in return to other countries, making it a formidable, harmful and irresponsible secrecy jurisdiction at both the Federal and state levels."|source=[[Tax Justice Network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Financial Secrecy Index 2015 reveals improving global financial transparency, but USA threatens progress|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FSI-2015-Presser.pdf|accessdate=May 2, 2016|work=Tax Justice Network|date=November 2, 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Robert W.|title=The World's Next Top Tax Haven Is...America|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/01/27/the-worlds-next-top-tax-haven-is-america|accessdate=May 2, 2016|work=Forbes|date=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Offshore tax avoidance===
{{main|Tax avoidance in the United States}}
Despite this, the US [[Public Interest Research Group]] (PIRG) said in 2014 that the [[United States]] loses roughly $184 billion per year due to corporations such as Pfizer, Microsoft and Citigroup using offshore tax havens to avoid paying US taxes. According to PIRG:
*[[Pfizer]] paid no US income taxes 2010–2012, despite earning $43 billion. The corporation received more than $2 billion in federal tax refunds. In 2013, Pfizer operated 128 subsidiaries in tax havens and had $69 billion offshore which could not be collected by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS);
*[[Microsoft]] maintains five tax haven subsidiaries and held $76.4 billion overseas in 2013, thus saving the corporation $24.4 billion in taxes;
*[[Citigroup]] maintained 21 subsidiaries in tax haven countries in 2013, and kept $43.8 billion in offshore jurisdictions, thus saving the corporation an additional $11.7 billion in taxes.&lt;ref name="U.S. PIRG"&gt;{{cite news|title=Picking Up the Tab 2014|url=http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/picking-tab-2014|work=U.S. PIRG|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vincenzo Florio Jr.''' (18 March 1883 – 6 January 1959) was an Italian entrepreneur, heir of the rich [[Florio]] economic dynasty, one of the wealthiest Italian families during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=florio&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/florio/ Flòrio], Treccani Enciclopedie on line (retrieved 10 April 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; An automobile enthusiast, he is best known as the founder of the [[Targa Florio]].


==Early life==
He was the son of the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy|Senator of the Kingdom of Italy]], [[Ignazio Florio Sr.]] and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. He was born in [[Palermo]] and was named after his grandfather [[Vincenzo Florio Sr.]] (1799–1886) who founded the [[Florio]] wine and spice company. He was the younger brother of [[Ignazio Florio Jr.]]. Not inclined to business, he loved traveling and was a frequent visitor of [[Paris]], [[Nice]], [[Montecarlo]] and [[Cannes]]. Luxury boats were one of his passions: in the family they owned five yachts.&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-florio_res-3f57584f-87ed-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Florio, Vincenzo], by Simone Candela - Treccani Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 48 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 he married principessa Annina Alliata di Montereale. After her death to [[cholera]] in 1911, he married [[Lucie Henry]] of [[Épernay]], France, a year later.

==Career==
[[File:Buste of Vincenzo Florio.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Buste of Vincenzo Florio, located between the spectators balconies at the Targa Florio pitcomplex]]
An automobile enthusiast, he initiated the financial basis and the engineering plans for the "Brescia Motor Week" in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]]. He had finished third in the 1904 edition, and generously funding the 1905 race, which was renamed [[Coppa Florio]]. He donated 50,000 lire and a Cup for the winner.  His greatest fame came from creating the [[Targa Florio]] race in [[1906 Targa Florio|1906]], based on discussions with [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]] and [[Henri Desgrange]]. The Targa also claimed to be a worldly event not to be missed. Renowned artists, such as [[Alexandre Charpentier]] and [[Leonardo Bistolfi]], were commissioned to design medals. A magazine was initiated, ''Rapiditas'', which aimed to enhance, with graphic and photographic reproductions of the race, the myth of the car and the typical character of modern life, speed.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

Florio also raced himself. His best result was the win in the [[Targa Rignano]] ([[Padova]] - [[Bovolenta]]) 1903, named after Count Rignano, thus inspiring Florio to pick the surname-based Targa Florio.  His own racing team, however, got [[Felice Nazzaro]] to leave [[Fiat]] and join as driver,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; who had won the 1907 race. In 1913 Vincenzo Florio founded the Automobile Club of Sicily, of which he remained president for a long time.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

==Death==
He died at Épernay. He is buried in the family chapel, in the cemetery of [[Santa Maria di Gesù]].

==Commemoration==
Florio was also a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043815/http://www.comune.palermo.it/Eventi/Palazzo%20Ziino/Secondo_Piano/Florio/florio_e.htm Vincenzo Florio, il gusto della modernità]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Vincenzo Florio – A taste for modernity'' was on display in [[Palermo]] in 2003.

'''William Kistler Coors''' (August 11, 1916 – October 13, 2018) was an American brewery executive with the [[Coors Brewing Company]].  He was affiliated with the company for over 64 years, and was a board member from 1973 to 2003. He was a grandson of [[Adolph Coors]] (1847–1929) the company's founder.

==Biography==
Born in [[Golden, Colorado]] on August 11, 1916, he was the son of [[Adolph Coors II]] and Alice Kistler May (1885–1970), and the brother of [[Adolph Coors III]] (1916–60) and Joseph Coors Sr. (1917–2003).  Coors earned a bachelor's degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1938, and a master's degree in [[chemical engineering]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="King of Coors"/&gt;

Coors had three daughters with his first wife Geraldine, who suffered from alcoholism and died of illness.{{what|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref name="Coors Clan"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bella Stumbo|title=Brewing Controversy—Coors Clan: Doing It Their Way Series: First of two parts|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=September 18, 1988 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-18/news/mn-3400_1_adolph-coors/4 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; William remarried in the 1960s and he and his wife, Phyllis, had one son, Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay director plays havoc with 'all-US' beer dynasty: Traditional firm encounters problems with its image|publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |location=London |date=July 21, 2001 |page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coors' oldest daughter Geraldine committed suicide August 5, 1983 at the age of 40 after suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].

==Career==
{{refimprove-section|date=October 2018}}
William Coors entered the family business as a chemical engineer for [[Coors Brewing Company]] in 1939.

Coors was respected in the industry for his ability in packaging, bottling, and engineering. He is credited with pioneering the recyclable two-piece [[aluminum can]], which is now standard throughout the industry.&lt;ref name="King of Coors"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bartell Nyberg|title=King of Coors: Brewer Climbs to No. 3 With Bill Coors at Helm|publisher=''Denver Post''| date=1990-05-20|page= G1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Coors requested $250,000 from his father, CEO [[Adolph Coors, Jr.]], to build an experimental line of aluminum cans. By the early 1960s, can recycling was viable, and the company offered customers a one-cent [[Deposit-refund system|deposit on returned cans]].

Coors was elected to the board of directors in 1973. When the non-brewing assets (e.g., [[CoorsTek|Coors Ceramics Co.]]) of Adolph Coors Co. were spun off in 1992 as ACX Technologies Inc., he served as chairman of both companies.

In 2003, at the age of 87, Coors retired from the boards of the Adolph Coors Company and the Coors Brewing Company, although he remained with the company as chief technical adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=William Coors Sets Retirement| publisher=''Denver Post''|date=2003-05-17|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
William Coors' political views were considered to be more moderate and less outspoken than his brother [[Joseph Coors|Joe]]'s.&lt;ref name="Coors Clan"/&gt; For example, Joe's public opposition to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1988 earned the company the ire of feminist groups, even though William was on record supporting the amendment.&lt;ref name="Coors Clan"/&gt;

===Accusations of racism===
Coors was criticized for remarks he made on February 23, 1984, in a seminar held by the Minority Business Development Center in [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="speech to blacks"&gt;{{cite news|author=Don Williamson |title=Calls for Coors boycott echo again after speech to blacks brews a storm |publisher=''The San Diego Union''|date=1984-03-12| page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In off-the-cuff remarks, he stated that "...ancestors were dragged here in chains against their will… I would urge those of you who feel that way to go back to where your ancestors came from, and you will find out that probably the greatest favor that anybody ever did you was to drag your ancestors over here in chains, and I mean it." He also remarked Africa's economic problems stemmed from "a lack of intellectual capacity."&lt;ref name="speech to blacks"/&gt;

Coors apologized in a press conference the next day for his "unfortunate choice of words and lack of sensitivity," and said he hoped his commitment to minority groups spoke louder than his words. He stated that his words were taken out of context by the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', which he later sued for [[Defamation|libel]].&lt;ref name="Fight Over Coors's Role"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kathleen Teltsch| title=Fight Over Coors's Role Upsets Foundation Parley|publisher=''New York Times''|date=1984-04-26|page=A18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of people who attended the speech reported that the remarks were not considered offensive.&lt;ref name="speech to blacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fight Over Coors's Role"/&gt; An informal boycott of Coors was announced by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] during a March 2 meeting in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="speech to blacks"/&gt; At the time, the [[AFL-CIO]] had been boycotting the company for seven years over a labor dispute.&lt;ref name="Coors Beer to Assist Hispanics"&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |title=Coors Beer to Assist Hispanics |publisher=''Boston Globe'' |date=1984-10-30 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 500 liquor stores in Southern California joined the NAACP boycott, which was suspended five days later when they reached an agreement with the company.&lt;ref name="Fight Over Coors's Role"/&gt; In September, the Adolph Coors Company signed an agreement with [[Operation PUSH]] and the NAACP to invest $325 million into black communities over five years, to deposit millions of operating capital in black-owned banks, and to spend $8.8 million on advertising in black-owned media.&lt;ref name="Coors Beer to Assist Hispanics"/&gt; In October, the company negotiated a similar agreement with [[American GI Forum]] and [[National Council of La Raza|La Raza]] for $300 million.&lt;ref name="Coors Beer to Assist Hispanics"/&gt; This was the first ever such arrangement between La Raza and any corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Iver Peterson| title=Making Big Business A Threat It Can't Refuse|publisher=''New York Times''|date=1984-12-02|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Coors dropped his libel suit after the ''Rocky Mountain News'' printed an article commending Coors' good record with the minority community, and expressing regret for the headline over the February 24, 1984 article.&lt;ref name="Coors' New Brew"&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Richter |title=Coors' New Brew: Taking Out the Political Aftertaste| publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=1987-09-27|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Corporation finance,'' 1909 ===
[[File:Corporation finance, 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page, 1909]]
In a 1910 review Hammond stated, that Professor Lough's book is the most comprehensive, the most scholarly and the best written treatise on the subject of corporation finance which has appeared in this country. Like the other volumes in the series of which it is a part, the book was written primarily in the interest of business men, although the author expresses the hope that it will also prove useful to stock and bond brokers, to lawyers, to bankers and to accountants. It is sure to do this but it is also bound to be of great use to teachers and students in the courses in business administration in our colleges and universities. It is more than probable that it was the author's experience with just such students which accounts in large measure for the clearness and logical method of his presentation.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/222315 Reviewed Works: Corporation Finance by William H. Lough, Jr.; The Modern Corporation by Thomas Conyngton]." Review by: M. B. Hammond. ''The Economic Bulletin'' Vol. 3, No. 3 (Sep., 1910), pp. 268-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is not a philosophical treatise on corporations. It contains no history of the corporation movement and there is little discussion of the place occupied by the corporation in our modern business life or of the difficult problem of securing its public control in the interest of the people at large. Such supervision as is needed the author seems to believe can be secured by means of publicity and careful accounting. The book is written by a man in thorough sympathy with the idea that the corporation affords the best method of carrying on modern business transactions, and the movement towards corporate consolidation he believes to be in the interest of the public as well as of the investors in corporate securities.

==== Legal character and requirements of the corporation ====
This book is primarily descriptive of the methods of promoting, organizing and financing corporations, and all the illustrations are taken from the experience of American companies. In the first six chapters the author deals with the legal character and requirements of the corporation.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt;

In the chapter about the interior organization Lough goes into the [[Power (social and political)|powers]] and [[Legal liability|liabilities]] of [[Director (business)|directors]]. Lough started explaining that "in theory, however, even if not in practice, a board of directors is supposed to represent all the stockholders equally. Partly for that reason the board... is given complete control over the corporation's assets and officers."&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1909, p. 45-6)&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the organization, there is a "centralization of control,' which can be compared to a double pyramid (see image). Lough explained:
[[File:Corporation finance pyramid, 1909.jpg|thumb|320px|Corporation Finance Pyramid, 1909]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The base of one pyramid represents the body of [[stockholder]]s or owners of the corporation who delegate their rights as owners to the directors, who in turn transfer all active authority to the president or other [[chief executive officer]], who is at the apex of that pyramid. The other pyramid represents the subordinate officials and employees of the corporation. The chief executive officer is also the apex of this pyramid and transmits his orders through the various grades of subordinates to the clerks and laborers at the base of the pyramid. Thus responsibility and authority conferred by the stockholders and exercised over the employees are both centered in this chief executive officer. It is an organization almost ideally adapted, so far as efficiency and economy go, to the conditions of present-day industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1909, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overall the first six chapters of the book contains little that is new. It is derived, as the author suggests, largely from Thomas Conyngton's ''The Modern Corporation'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Conyngton. ''[https://archive.org/details/moderncorporati00conygoog The Modern Corporation]'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; Worthy of notice in this part, however, is the distinction which Professor Lough draws between "the parent company" and "the holding company."&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt; Lough stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A [[parent company]] is one that for some reason does not desire to carry on operations in its own name over the whole country, and which therefore organizes and holds all or nearly all the stock of one or more subordinate companies... A [[holding company]] proper on the other hand, using the term in a financial, not a legal sense, comes into existence for the purpose of buying control of pre-existing companies. Its ostensible object is the buying of securities of other corporations to be held for whatever revenues they will produce. The real object of its existence, however, is not accomplished unless it holds control of all its subsidiary companies and directs their operations. Sometimes this control consists in holding a bare majority of the voting stock of the subsidiary; but it is generally advisable to secure as much stock as possible, for the greater the extent of the control, the more readily may the holding company carry out its plans to achieve economies and fix prices.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1909, p. 81-82)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lough also noted that "holding companies may be formed, not only to acquire stock of operating companies, but also to obtain control of other holding companies." Such organization can become rather complex, and any examples may require considerable explanation. Lough continued:
[[File:Chart of Interborough-Metropolitan System, New York, 1909.jpg|thumb|320px|Chart of Interborough-Metropolitan System, New York, 1909]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader will get a sufficiently clear idea as to how complex organizations of this kind are built up if he will study the accompanying chart of the Interborough-Metropolitan Company, which was prepared for the Public Service Commission of the First District of the State of 'New York. The Interborough-Metropolitan Company controls all the street car, elevated and subway railway lines in the principal boroughs of New York City. It was formed, as shown in the chart, by an exchange of its securities for the securities of two formerly competing companies, the Metropolitan Securities Company and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The relations of these two companies to each other, to their direct subsidiaries, and to the subsidiaries of their subsidiaries, are as clearly as possible presented in the chart."&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1909, p. 86-87)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To illustrate further the extent, as well as the complexity, Lough gave a second example of [[Standard Oil Company]] with a complete listing of over 100 subsidiaries controlled by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.

==== Raising funds, credit instruments and establishing new enterprise ====
Chapters 7-11 of the work deal with the various methods of raising funds and with the credit instruments to which they give rise. The author says: "Only one method of raising funds is cheaper than borrowing and that method is stealing." In view of some recent episodes in corporation finance it is doubtful whether even this exception need have been made. By a study of the balance sheets of several large corporations, the author endeavors to show that failure to borrow largely is a sign of weak and injudicious financial management. Particularly good in this section of the book is the discussion of short time loans.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt;

Chapter 12-15 deal with the work of the promoter in establishing new enterprise, and in consolidating old ones and this section concludes with an excellent chapter on the United States Steel Corporation. In Chapters 16-19 the author describes the four methods of selling securities: by inside distribution; through Wall Street; through bond and brokerage houses; and by means of advertising. The relative advantages of these various methods are thoroughly discussed and there is much in these chapters which should prove valuable to the buyer as well as to the seller of securities.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt;

In chapter 19 Lough explains the working of [[syndicate]]s, and gives and example of how a new plant was constructed wholly with borrowed funds. 
[[File:Corporation finance circular flows, 1909.jpg|thumb|320px|Corporation finance circular flows, 1909]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;:In the spring of 1902 the promoter of a smelting and refining company in Mexico succeeded in convincing a number of Philadelphia financiers that his proposition was worth looking into. They made a thorough investigation, satisfied themselves that the proposed plant would certainly prove profitable, and undertook to finance its construction. Engineers' estimates called for an expenditure of something over $2,000,000 and a period of three years before the plant would begin to earn expenses. As a matter of fact, the expenditure was approximately $3,000,000 and the construction work was not completed until early in 1907.&lt;ref name="L09 280-83"&gt;Lough (1909, p. 280-83)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A syndicate of Philadelphia and Baltimore capitalists and banking houses was formed to underwrite the enterprise. Next an entirely different syndicate of banking houses was organized, which agreed to take the notes(when issued up to a certain amount) of syndicate No. I, the notes to be secured by the stock of a corporation organized to construct the plant. The corporation was capitalized at $2,000,000, half preferred and half common stock. All its stock was sold to syndicate No. I, for $1,000,000. Syndicate No. I then posted the stock and gave notes to syndicate No. II, who loaned the $1,000,000. Thus syndicate No. I was not called upon for cash, except for expenses, and the construction company was supplied with $1,000,000 with which to begin operations.&lt;ref name="L09 280-83"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Next, after expending the $1,000,000, the construction company issued $500,000 of its own notes, which being its only obligations were accepted by Philadelphia banks... Up to this point one-half the necessary funds had been secured and at the end of two years the work of construction had been more than half completed. Now a new corporation was formed which was to operate the plant. The reader will observe that the first corporation existed simply to carry on construction. The operating corporation at once took over the stock of the construction company, title to which up to this time had remained with syndicate No. I. Then the operating corporation put out a first-mortgage bond issue, based on all its property then owned and thereafter to be constructed, and sold during the next two years $1,500,000 of bonds. In this way the whole $3,000,000 necessary to build the plant was raised by borrowing and the members of syndicate No. I furnished nothing to the enterprise but their credit. The diagram on page 282 will perhaps assist the reader in arriving at a clear understanding of the whole series of transactions.&lt;ref name="L09 280-83"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lough told about the actual situation, that "the plant at the date of writing has been running a little over two years. Earnings have been more than sufficient to meet all interest charges and other expenses, and it is expected that large profits will be earned in the future..."&lt;ref name="L09 280-83"/&gt; He ended with explaining, that "it may seem strange that a new plant could thus be constructed wholly with borrowed funds; yet there is nothing especially unusual about the operation. The secret of the success of the syndicate in this instance lay in the fact that they were themselves strong financially and could borrow the first $1,000,000 readily..."&lt;ref name="L09 280-83"/&gt;

==== Honest financial management and high finance ====
Chapters 20-24 deal with an honest financial management of corporations and discuss some of the difficult problems with which financial managers have to deal; such as the proportion of working capital, betterment expenses, and the handling of the surplus. With reference to betterment expenses Professor Lough is inclined to favor the policy of the Pennsylvania Railroad in providing for those expenses which are bound to result in a permanent saving or profit, by means of bond issues, and for those expenses (like the New York tunnels), which may or may not yield profits in the near future, by appropriations from the surplus.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt;

In chapters 25-37 are revealed the tricks and methods of "high finance." This part of the work the author advises those who are "morally weak" to omit, but they may well be perused by "innocent investors." The various methods of manipulation are classified according as they are carried on by the officers, the directors, or by and for the stock holders. Finally, come three excellent chapters on insolvency and reorganization with illustrations drawn from the financial history of the Santa Fe, the Rock Island and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. About 25 pages of "quiz questions" are given at the end of the book.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt;

Corporation finance is not treated by Professor Lough as a part of economics although closely related to it. His treatment of the subject is much like the German method of treating public finance — a subject somewhat dependent on economics but having its own independent set of principles.&lt;ref name="MBH 1910"/&gt;

=== ''Business Finance, A Practical Study of Financial Management in Private Business Concerns,'' 1917 ===
[[File:Business Finance, A Practical Study of Financial Management in Private Business Concerns, 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page, 1917]]
A 1918 review of this work by Arthur S. Dewing (1880-1971)&lt;ref&gt;[http://numismatics.org/Archives/Dewingbio Arthur S. Dewing (1880-1971) biography] at numismatics.org. American Numismatic Society, 1999-2009. Accessed 14.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, that this book represents an important study of modern financial practice, especially with reference to medium-sized industrial corporations. More than the majority of books on corporation finance heretofore published, it seeks to discover what might be called a financial "ought," which differentiates between good and bad financial policies. Everyone knows the fundamental difficulty which brought about the receiverships of the Atchison or the Westinghouse companies. These are stock illustrations. But Lough's insistence that the private corporation should prepare a budget is, in the reviewer's opinion, a new and important contribution.&lt;ref name="ASD 1918"&gt;Arthur S. Dewing. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1805704 Reviewed Work: Business Finance: A Practical Study of Financial Management in Private Business Concerns by William H. Lough]," in: ''The American Economic Review,'' Vol. 8, No. 1 (Mar., 1918), pp. 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into five parts. The first covers general and well known characteristics of corporations in contradistinction to other forms of enterprise ; the second describes the media through which the corporation may secure capital; and the third the practical problems of securing it. Of these three parts the concluding chapter of the second (ch. 8) entitled Basis of Capitalization is the most constructive and worthwhile. Especially important in the haze of present-day attempts to establish a sound basis for public regulation of corporate income is Lough's insistence that earning power, not original investment, is the most rational basis of capitalization. In accordance with this theory one would wish that he had devoted more than a paragraph to the important recent changes in New York and other state laws permitting the issue of stock without par value.&lt;ref name="ASD 1918"/&gt;

The fourth section entitled Internal Financial Management is the most illuminating in the book. While by no means all accountants would agree with those paragraphs expounding one or another of the various moot problems, still the discussions are all thoroughly sound, albeit savoring more of business expediency than the strict logic of accountancy. The two closing chapters, entitled Budgets and Financial Standards, are particularly suggestive. The subjects treated in the latter have wide economic significance, but the generalizations are somewhat superficial and backed by insufficient empirical evidence. The fifth part, entitled Financial Abuses and Involvements, is distinctly patchwork. It shows the marks of hasty preparation and is the least satisfactory section in the book.&lt;ref name="ASD 1918"/&gt;

Numerous inaccuracies annoy the careful reader. For illustration, Lough speaks of the "reorganization of the Erie Railroad in 1895" (p.&amp;nbsp;142) and one is surprised to hear that there was issued at the time "Erie Railroad first consolidated mortgage 7's 1920." The proof reading was not always careful; for illustration, 1889 should read 1899 (p.&amp;nbsp;171). These are small matters, but scientific accuracy of detail is very important in financial writings of lasting value. As a whole, the book shows a wide familiarity with current financial discussion and, above all, great sanity and good judgment. Teachers of corporation finance will find in it a very satisfactory text. From the pedagogical point of view it strikes the happy medium between unjustified generalities and a hopeless maze of detail.&lt;ref name="ASD 1918"/&gt;

=== ''High-Level Consumption,'' 1935 ===
In the 1930s Lough became an authority in the field of [[Consumer spending]]. A 1932 report of Retail Trade Board of the Boston [[Chamber of Commerce]] for example had noted that Lough had estimated a "total retail sales of consumer goods amounted to about 19 billion dollars in 1914,". while the National Bureau of Economic Research had "estimated total retail sales as 22 billion dollars for that year."&lt;ref&gt;Retail Trade Board, Boston Chamber of Commerce., ''Report.'' Vol. 4, 1932, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Lough with the assistance of [[Martin Gainsbrugh]] published "High-Level Consumption," which is considered the first detailed estimates of aggregate [[consumer expenditures]] for goods and services in the United States over a period of time.&lt;ref name="USCB 1970"&gt;[[United States Census Bureau]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UWB02EGwFjoC&amp;pg=PA306 Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970],'' Vol. 1. p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; This work was also noted as "the only serious attempts to measure saving of individuals over several years by the balance sheet method."&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Economic Research, Conference on Research in Income and Wealth. ''Studies in income and wealth,'' Vol. 3. (1939) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Their pioneer estimates covered the years 1909, 1914, 1919, 1921, 1923, 1925, 1927, 1929, and 1931. The data for the later years were revised and extended by Harold Barger, ''Outlay and Income in the United States, 1921-1938,'' National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Barger, National Bureau of Economic Research (1942). ''Outlay and income in the United States, 1921-1938.'' (1942), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, J. Frederic Dewhurst and Associates (''America’s Needs and Resources,'' 1947) revised these various estimates and expanded those on recreational expense to take account of estimates by Julius Weinberger, “The Economic Aspects of Recreation,” ''Harvard Business Review,'' summer issue, 1937.&lt;ref name="USCB 1970"/&gt;

In 1935, estimates of aggregate consumer expenditures in detail for 1909 and 1929 and selected years between were prepared by [[Martin Gainsbrugh]] and published in William H. Lough, ''HighLevel Consumption''... This book included a comparison with The Brookings Institution’s aggregates for 1929, showing that the two estimates were very close for food expense, and reasonably close for attire and home maintenance; but the estimates by Lough and Gainsbrugh of expenditures for all other items were much higher than the Brookings’ figures.&lt;ref name="USCB 1970"/&gt;
