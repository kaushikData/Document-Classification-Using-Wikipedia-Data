'''Achi''' (''Achí'' in Spanish) is a [[Mayan language]] very closely related to [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] (''Quiché'' in the older orthography). It is spoken by the [[Achi people]], primarily in the department of [[Baja Verapaz]] in [[Guatemala]].

There are two Achi dialects. Rabinal Achi is spoken in the [[Rabinal]] area, and Cubulco Achi is spoken in the [[Cubulco]] area west of Rabinal.

One of the masterpieces of precolumbian literature is the [[Rabinal Achí]], a theatrical play written in the Achi language.

'''Ambelau''' ({{lang-id|Bahasa Ambelau}}) is an [[Austronesian language]]; in 1989, it was spoken by about 5,700 [[Ambelau people]], of whom more than 5,000 lived on the [[Indonesia]]n island [[Ambelau]] ({{lang-id|Pulau Ambelau}}) and most others in the village Wae Tawa of the nearby island [[Buru]] ({{lang-id|Pulau Buru}}).&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;

The language belongs to the [[Central Maluku languages|Central Maluku]] branch of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]; there is no consensus in literature on its attribution to a distinct sub-branch, e.g. [[Sula–Buru languages]]. Although Ambelau island is only 20&amp;nbsp;km away from the much larger Buru island (population 135,000), the Ambelau language is rather different from all languages and dialects of Buru. The preservation of the language was also unaffected by the fact that Ambelau people compose only half of the Ambelau island population, and the communication with the [[Bugis]] and Javanese people composing the other half usually occurs in the official language of the country, Indonesian. Ambelau language has no dialects; so the Ambelau community on Buru island speaks identical language to that used on Ambelau. The language has no writing system.&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasi" /&gt;

The most detailed study of Ambelau language was conducted in the 1980s by Charles E. Grimes and Barbara Dix Grimes – Australian missionaries and ethnographers, active members of [[SIL International]] (they should not be confused with Joseph E. Grimes and Barbara F. Grimes, Charles' parents, also known Australian ethnographers).&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible" /&gt;

[[File:Cocktail by candle light 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Many of the flavors associated with premium Champagne are influenced by the autolysis of the lees during winemaking.]]
'''Autolysis in [[winemaking]]''' relates to the complex chemical reactions that take place when a wine spends time in contact with the [[lees (wine)|lees]], or dead [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] cells, after [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]. While for some [[wine]]s autolysis is undesirable, it is a vital component in shaping the flavors and mouth feel associated with premium [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] production.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 54"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 54 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Champagne Science ''"[https://www.champagnegallery.com.au/champagne-science/vinification/autolysis/ Autolysis - and its effects on Champagne] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216173031/https://www.champagnegallery.com.au/champagne-science/vinification/autolysis/ |date=February 16, 2011 }}"'' Accessed: December 30th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of leaving a wine to age on its lees (or ''[[sur lie]]'' aging) has a long history in winemaking dating back to [[Roman winemaking]]. The chemical process and details of autolysis were not originally understood scientifically, but the positive effects such as a creamy mouthfeel, breadlike and floral aromas, and reduced [[astringency]] were noticed early in the [[history of wine]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 399"&gt;[[Jancis Robinson]] (ed), ''[[The Oxford Companion to Wine]]'' Third Edition  pg 399 [[Oxford University Press]] 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ancient Roman]] writers, such as [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]], observed that wine that was left on its lees (or sediment as they knew it) exhibited different characteristics than wine that was quickly separated from its sediment. While the Romans did not understand the full chemical process or details behind the autolysis that took place, they were able to perceive the results of this autolysis in the creamy mouthfeel, reduced astringency and unique flavors and aromas that developed.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 399"/&gt; With modern day understanding of autolysis, winemaking in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]] have strict regulation regarding the time Champagne must spend in contact with its lees in order to receive some benefit from autolysis. Under ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) regulations, wines from Champagne cannot legally be sold until it has gone through autolysis in the bottle for at least 15 months with non-[[vintage]] Champagne. Vintage Champagne must have a minimum of 3 years aging; some [[Champagne house]]s extend the time for autolysis to  7 years or more.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 653"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 653 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Undegorgierter Champagner.jpg|275px|right|thumb|As the Champagne ages on its lees ''(pictured inside bottle)'' the process of autolysis causes the release of mannoproteins and polysaccharides that influence the flavor of the wine.]]
During fermentation, yeast cells convert the [[sugar (wine)|sugar]] in the grape [[must]] into [[ethanol]]. When the sugar food source for the yeast and necessary nutrients [[Yeast assimilable nitrogen|such as nitrogen]] run out, or the alcohol level of the wine reaches such a point to where it is [[toxic]] for the yeast, the cells die and sink to the bottom of the fermentation vessel. These dead cells, or "lees", are normally removed by [[racking]] the wine into a clean vessel. If the wine is left in contact with the lees, [[enzymes]] start to break the cells down producing [[mannoproteins]] ([[mannose]]-containing [[glycoproteins]]) and [[polysaccharides]] that are released into the wine. In [[sparkling wine production]], a wine is made "sparkling" or "bubbly" because a [[secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]] is introduced when the wine is contained within a sealed [[wine bottle]]. During this time the wine is deliberately kept in contact with its lees inside the bottle for a period ranging from a couple months to several years. Studies have shown that the chemical reaction of autolysis, and its impact on the wine, starts to become noticeable after 18 months and will continue to impart traits for at least 5 years. The sparkling wine is eventually separated from its lees through a technique known as [[riddling]] and [[Sparkling wine production#Disgorging|disgorgement]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 54"/&gt;

==Influences on the wine==
The effects of autolysis on wine contributes to a creamy mouthfeel that may make a wine seem to have a [[body (wine)|fuller body]]. The release of enzymes inhibits [[oxidation]] which improves some of the [[aging potential (wine)|aging potential]] of the wine. The mannoproteins improve the overall stability of the proteins in the wine by reducing the amount of [[tartrate]]s that are precipitated out. They may also bind with the [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s in the wine to reduce the perception of bitterness or astringency in the wine. The increased production of [[amino acid]]s leads to the develop of several flavors associated with premium Champagne including aromas of [[biscuit]]s&lt;ref&gt;Caterer and Hotel Keeper Magazine ''"[http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2001/07/26/31586/the-changing-face-of-moet.html The changing face of Moet]"' July 26th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bread]] [[dough]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]tiness&lt;ref&gt;Beverage Industry Factsheet ''"[http://www.just-drinks.com/factsheet.aspx?ID=56 Autolysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327035821/http://www.just-drinks.com/factsheet.aspx?ID=56 |date=March 27, 2008 }}"'' Accessed Dec. 20th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[acacia]]. As the wine ages further, more complex notes may develop from the effects of autolysis.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 54"/&gt;

===Potential faults===
If not properly managed, [[wine fault]]s can potentially develop from autolysis. If the layer of lees begins to exceed 4 inches (10 centimeters), the enzymes released from the process of the yeast digesting themselves creates [[redox|reducing]] conditions and promotes the development of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[mercaptan]] odors. The process of stirring the lees or ''bâttonage'' can help prevent a thick layer of lees forming and promote a smoother autolysis. Poor hygiene of the winemaking equipment or wine made from grapes that had residue from [[fungicide]] can create off odors smelling of [[sulfide]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 399"/&gt;

'''Babatana''', also spelled '''Mbambatana''', is the principal [[indigenous language]] of [[Choiseul Province]], [[Solomon Islands]]. Although native to the South Choiseul coastline area between Sepa and the Manggo Bay area, the use of this language has spread across much of [[Choiseul Island]] and it is generally understood, much like Solomon Islands [[Pijin]], across the province as a second or third language.

In medicine the term '''cheesewiring''' or '''cheesewire effect''' describes any process in which [[cells]] or [[intercellular matrix]] are [[dissect]]ed or [[extrusion|extruded]] either by the material being pressed through a taut element, or by the tension of a taut element pulling through tissue.

==As a complication==
Cheesewiring can be a complication or part of a negative outcome of a procedure.  Examples include tumor growth penetrating the openings in a [[Self-expandable metallic stent|bowel stent]] that was placed to open an [[obstructed bowel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vrazas|first1=JI|last2=Ferris|first2=S|last3=Bau|first3=S|last4=Faragher|first4=I|title=Stenting for obstructing colorectal malignancy: an interim or definitive procedure|journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery|date=June 2002|volume=72|issue=6|pages=392–6|doi=10.1046/j.1445-2197.2002.02426.x|pmid=12121155}}&lt;/ref&gt; sutures used to hold a transplanted [[cornea]] in place cutting through the cornea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartels|first1=MC|last2=van Rooij|first2=J|last3=Geerards|first3=AJ|last4=Mulder|first4=PG|last5=Remeijer|first5=L|title=Comparison of complication rates and postoperative astigmatism between nylon and mersilene sutures for corneal transplants in patients with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy|journal=Cornea|date=June 2006|volume=25|issue=5|pages=533–9|doi=10.1097/01.ico.0000214218.60249.e5|pmid=16783141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and treatment of [[tendon rupture]], when sutures pull through the tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peltz|first1=TS|last2=Haddad|first2=R|last3=Scougall|first3=PJ|last4=Nicklin|first4=S|last5=Gianoutsos|first5=MP|last6=Oliver|first6=R|last7=Walsh|first7=WR|title=Structural Failure Mechanisms of Common Flexor Tendon Repairs|journal=Hand Surgery|date=October 2015|volume=20|issue=3|pages=369–79|doi=10.1142/S0218810415400092|pmid=26387996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an intentional procedure==
The term can also be used for to name the process of using a guidewire or suture intentionally to cut through tissue during a surgical procedure or allowing a suture to slowly cut through tissue over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ullery|first1=BW|last2=Chandra|first2=V|last3=Dake|first3=M|last4=Lee|first4=JT|title=Cheese wire fenestration of a chronic juxtarenal dissection flap to facilitate proximal neck fixation during EVAR|journal=Annals of Vascular Surgery|date=January 2015|volume=29|issue=1|pages=124.e1–5|doi=10.1016/j.avsg.2014.07.025|pmid=25192823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tashiro|first1=J|last2=Baqai|first2=A|last3=Goldstein|first3=LJ|last4=Salsamendi|first4=JT|last5=Taubman|first5=M|last6=Rey|first6=J|title="Cheese wire" fenestration of a chronic aortic dissection flap for endovascular repair of a contained aneurysm rupture|journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery|date=August 2014|volume=60|issue=2|pages=497–9|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2013.06.066|pmid=23911248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prem-Venkatesh|last2=Ramamurthi|first2=S|last3=Montgomery|first3=DM|title=The use of a "cheese-wire" suture in trabeculectomy|journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=April 2007|volume=91|issue=4|pages=500–4|pmid=17372339|pmc=1994764|doi=10.1136/bjo.2006.100057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of [[fistula]]s often involves placing a suture and allowing it to cut off the fistula over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moses|first1=RA|last2=Ann Gormley|first2=E|title=State of the Art for Treatment of Vesicovaginal Fistula|journal=Current Urology Reports|date=August 2017|volume=18|issue=8|pages=60|pmid=28656520|doi=10.1007/s11934-017-0708-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chittagonian''' or '''Chittagong Bangla''', also '''Satgaya''' (চাঁটগাঁইয়া) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] spoken by the people of [[Chittagong]] in [[Bangladesh]], and in much of the southeast of the country. It is closely related to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and is often considered to be a nonstandard [[dialect]] of Bengali, but the two are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ctg|title=Chittagonian A language of Bangladesh |publisher=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |year=2009 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated (2009) that Chittagonian has 13–16 million speakers, principally in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Summary by language size |publisher=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |year=2009 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Chittagonian is a member of the [[Bengali-Assamese languages|Bengali-Assamese]] sub-branch of the [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern group]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages]], a branch of the wider Indo-European language family. Its sister languages include [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Like other Bengali-Assamese languages, it is derived through an Eastern [[Middle Indo-Aryan]] from [[Old Indo-Aryan]], and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ethnologue |title=Chittagonian, a language of Bangladesh |year=2005 |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
The [[Eastern Nagari script]] is the most common script used.

==History==
The [[1st National Assembly of the Philippines]] passed Commonwealth Act No. 184, s. 1936, establishing an Institute of National Language (''Surian ng Wikang Pambansa''). On January 12, 1937, Former President [[Manuel L. Quezon|Manuel Luis Quezón y Molina]] appointed the members to compose the INL. By virtue of Executive Order No. 134 issued and signed by President Quezón on December 30, 1937, approved the adoption of Tagalog as the basis of the national language, and declared and proclaimed the national language based on Tagalog, as the national language of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="eo134"&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Order No. 134 : Proclaiming the national language of the Philippines based on the "Tagalog" language |url=http://www.quezon.ph/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/mlq-speech-national-language-1.pdf |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the INL was dissolved and replaced with the National Language Institute. Its purpose was to prepare for the nationwide teaching of the [[Filipino language|Tagalog-based national language]] (''Wikang Pambansa na batay sa Tagalog'') by creating a dictionary and a grammar book with a standardized orthography. In the School Year of 1940-41, the teaching of the [[Filipino language|national language]] (''Wikang Pambansa''), with its new standardized orthography, was set by law in the fourth year of all high schools in both public and private schools throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pangilinan |first=Michael Raymon |title=Kapampángan or Capampáñgan: Settling the Dispute on the Kapampángan Romanized Orthography |url=http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf#search=%22siuala%22/ |accessdate=2010-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326210447/http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tagalog-based national language was taught in school only as one of the subject areas in 1940 but was not adapted as the medium of instruction.

During the [[Second World War]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese occupiers]] encouraged the use of the national language rather than English in the schools. The Tagalog-based national language was, therefore, propagated not only in education but also in mass media and in official communication. The census for 1948 reported that 7,126,913 people or 37.11% of the population spoke the language, representing an increase of 11.7% from the 1939 figure of 4,068,565. Of these seven million people, 47.7% learnt it as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Belvez |first=Paz |title=Development of Filipino, the national language of the Philippines |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=3&amp;i=207 |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040649/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=3&amp;i=207 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current commission was established by [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 7104 of 1991, replacing the '''Institute of Philippine Languages (IPL)''' that was previously set up in January 1987 (EO No. 117); itself, a replacement of the  older '''Institute of National Language (INL)''', established in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Catacataca |first=Pamfilo |title=The Commission on the Filipino Language |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=3&amp;i=205 |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040720/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=3&amp;i=205 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One major criticism of the commission is that it supposedly fails in its goal of further developing the Filipino language. This is grounded in the fact that Filipino is essentially [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], a fact acknowledged by former Commissioner, Ricardo María Durán Nolasco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=53&amp;a=20983 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090324/http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=53&amp;a=20983|archivedate=2007-09-29 |title=New center to document Philippine dialects |accessdate = 2007-06-30 |author=Inquirer |year=2007 |publisher=Asian Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with an impoverished technical and scientific vocabulary, at that, which relies heavily on foreign borrowings and, often, constructions. It is often left to the [[List of universities and colleges in the Philippines|universities]] to develop their own respective terminologies for each field, leading to a lack of uniformity and general public disuse.

It is argued&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/congrec/14th/1st/1RS-11.pdf Congressional Record : Plenary Proceedings of the 14th Congress, First Regular Session : House of Representatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629110922/http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/congrec/14th/1st/1RS-11.pdf |date=2011-06-29 }}, Vol. 1, No. 11, August 14, 2007, pp. 455-460 (Rep. López opens the discussion)&lt;/ref&gt; that current state of the Filipino language is contrary to the intention of Republic Act (RA) No. 7104 that requires that the national language be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country's other languages. However, Resolution 92-1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wika.pbworks.com/Resolusyon%20Blg%2092-1 Resolution No. 92-1 : Description of basic Filipino language], pbworks.com&lt;/ref&gt; which defines the national language as "the language spoken in Metro Manila and other business centers of the country", does not necessarily run counter to RA No. 7104.

'''Dionysius I Telmaharoyo''' ([[Latin]]: ''Dionysius Telmaharensis'', [[Syriac language|Syriac]]: ܕܝܘܢܢܘܣܝܘܣ ܬܠܡܚܪܝܐ, [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مار ديونيسيوس التلمحري), also known as '''Dionysius of Tel Mahre''', was the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 818 until his death in 845.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"&gt;Barsoum (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dionysius was born in Tal Mahre, near the city of [[Raqqa]], into a wealthy family from [[Edessa]], and became a monk at the Monastery of [[Qinnasrin]], where he studied philology, jurisprudence, philosophy, and theology.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt; He also studied at the Monastery of Mar Jacob at Kayshum.&lt;ref name="Hoyland 416"&gt;Hoyland (1997), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; In 818, Dionysius was elected Patriarch of Antioch unanimously by a synod of forty-eight bishops. After his consecration, he issued a proclamation and held three councils in Raqqa in the same year, at which he issued twelve canons.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt; Dionysius restored the Monastery of Qinnasrin in 822 after it was damaged by fire caused by dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;Barsoum (2003), p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

In 826, Dionysius visited Egypt in the company of the [[Abbasid]] general [[Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani]].&lt;ref name="Swanson" &gt;Swanson (2010), p.
 37&lt;/ref&gt; He later held a council at the Monastery of Euspholis in 828,&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt; and returned to Egypt in 832 in the company of [[Caliph]] [[Al-Ma'mun]].&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt; Whilst in Egypt, Dionysius met with Pope Jacob of Alexandria, head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], a fellow [[miaphysite]] church, and several Coptic Orthodox bishops outside of the city of Tannis. He held another council at the city of [[Tikrit|Tagrit]] in 834, and met with Al-Ma'mun in [[Baghdad]], and also his successor, Caliph [[Al-Mu'tasim]]. A total of one hundred bishops were ordained by Dionysius during his tenure and he served as patriarch until his death on 22 August 845.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

==Works==
At the request of John, Bishop of [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]], Dionysius composed the ''Annals'', a two volume history of the church and secular events from the coronation of the Roman Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] in 583 to the death of the Roman Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilus]] in 843. One volume was dedicated to church history whilst the other covered secular history, and each volume was divided into eight books.&lt;ref name="Hoyland 416"/&gt; The work was composed with use of citations of the works of [[Theophilus of Edessa]], an 8th-century scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland (1997), p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annals'' were cited extensively by [[Michael the Syrian|Michael I]], Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch (r. 1166–1199), and the anonymous author of the ''[[Chronicle of 1234]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland (1997), p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius' accounts were also later used in the ''Ecclesiastical History'' of [[Bar Hebraeus]], [[Maphrian]] of the East (r. 1266–1286).&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

The ''[[Zuqnin Chronicle|Chronicle of Zuqnin]]'' was erroneously ascribed to Dionysius by [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]], but this has since been disregarded.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37315">The '''Eastern Lombard Grammar''' reflects the main features of [[Romance languages]]: the [[word order]] of [[Eastern Lombard]] is usually [[Agent–verb–object|SVO]], [[noun]]s are inflected in [[Grammatical number|number]], [[adjective]]s agree in number and [[Grammatical gender|gender]] with the nouns, [[verb]]s are conjugated in [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]] and [[Grammatical mood|moods]] and agree with the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in number and [[Grammatical person|person]]. The [[Declension|case system]] is present only for the weak form of the [[pronoun]].

Eastern Lombard has always been a [[spoken language]] and, in spite of sporadic attempts to fix the main features in a written grammar, a unique canonical variety has never prevailed over the others. The present day situation sees a large number of varieties, roughly identifiable by the area where a particular variety is spoken (so, you may encounter a [[Bergamo|Bergamasque]], [[Brescia]]n, a [[Camonica|Camunic]] variety, etc.). Varieties differ mainly in [[phonology]], [[syntax]] and word choice.&lt;br&gt;
This grammar is based on the Brescian variety and, although local differences (even remarkable) can be found, the basic principles are generally valid for the other varieties.

==Nouns==
[[Noun]]s in Eastern Lombard have two [[grammatical gender]]s: masculine and feminine.

===Singular===
====Masculine====
'''Masculine singular''' nouns generally end with a consonant:&lt;br&gt;
• ''gat'', cat&lt;br&gt;
• ''òm'', man&lt;br&gt;
but can often end with a stressed vowel: this usually happens where a historical ''-n'' has been dropped.&lt;br&gt;
• ''cà'', dog&lt;ref&gt;(cfr. [[Western Lombard dialect|west. Lombard]] ''can'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• ''pà'', bread&lt;ref&gt;(cfr. [[Western Lombard dialect|west. Lombard]] ''pan'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• ''carbù'', coal&lt;ref&gt;(cfr. [[Western Lombard dialect|west. Lombard]] ''carbón'')&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminine====
'''Feminine singular''' nouns generally end with ''-a'':&lt;br&gt;
• ''gàta'', female cat&lt;br&gt;
• ''fónna'', woman&lt;br&gt;
but can occasionally end with a consonant:&lt;br&gt;
• ''néf'', snow&lt;br&gt;
Note that, in some varieties, the final ''-a'' represents an [[Help:IPA|/ɔ/]] sound, that can make feminine words sound like they end in *''-o''.

===Plural===
====Masculine====
'''Masculine plural''' nouns follow particular rules depending on the ending of the singular form of the noun.&lt;br&gt;
If the singular ends with a stressed vowel, the word does not change in the plural:&lt;br&gt;
• ''el cà'' → ''i cà''&lt;br&gt;
If the singular ends with ''-c'', ''-j'', ''-m'', ''-p'', ''-r'' or ''-s'', the plural remains identical to the singular:&lt;br&gt;
• ''el sac'' → ''i sac''&lt;br&gt;
• ''el ventàj'' → ''i ventàj''&lt;br&gt;
• ''el póm'' → ''i póm''&lt;br&gt;
• ''el cóp'' → ''i cóp''&lt;br&gt;
• ''el pér'' → ''i pér''&lt;br&gt;
• ''el ciós'' → ''i ciós''&lt;br&gt;
If the singular ends with ''-t'', the plural will end with ''-cc'' (pronounced [tʃ]):&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Geoffrey Stephen ''"The linguistic unity of northern Italy and Rhaetia"'' - University of Sydney - 1982 - page 434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• ''el gat'' → ''i gacc''&lt;br&gt;
If the singular ends with ''-n'', the plural will end with ''-gn'' (pronounced [ɲ]):&lt;br&gt;
• ''el àzen'' → ''i àzegn''&lt;br&gt;
If the singular ends with ''-l'', the plural will end with ''-j'':&lt;br&gt;
• ''el caàl'' → ''i caàj''

====Feminine====
'''Feminine plural''' nouns generally end with ''-e'':&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Geoffrey Stephen ''"The linguistic unity of northern Italy and Rhaetia"'' - University of Sydney - 1982 - page 440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• ''la gàta'' → ''le gàte''&lt;br&gt;
• ''la fónna'' → ''le fónne''&lt;br&gt;
When the singular ends with a consonant, the plural follows the rules applied to masculine nouns.

==Article==

All the [[Article (grammar)|article]]s in Eastern Lombard agree in number and gender with the corresponding noun.
Articles can be '''definite''' (like ''the'' in English) and '''indefinite''' (like ''a/an''). Indefinite articles are used only with singular nouns, however to indicate an indefinite number of objects, Lombard exploits something similar to the partitive in [[French articles and determiners|French]]), but because the partitive system is much less developed in Lombard, this class of articles is included in the indefinite system.

===Definite Article===
{| class="wikitable"
! ''Definite'' !! Masculine !! Feminine
|-
|Singular || '''''el''''', ''ol'', ''al'' || '''''la'''''
|-
|Plural || '''''i''''' || '''''le''''', ''i''
|}

'''''Note:'''''
* ''El'' is the form used for the singular definite article in the Brescian variety but in other dialects the forms ''ol'' (Bergamasque) or ''al'' (Cremasque) are preferred.
* The most widespread form for the feminine plural article in Eastern Lombard is ''le'' but in the area of Bergamo ''le'' is replaced by the form ''i'' that is the plural masculine form.
Brescian: '' 'le fónne' '' &lt;br&gt;
Bergamasque '' 'i fómne' '' (eng. ''the women'')&lt;br&gt;
Note that speakers that use one form may not find correct the other.

* When ''el'' is followed by a vowel, it becomes ''l''', like in:
''El ga majàt l'armì del póm'' ("He ate the seed of the apple").

* When ''el'' is preceded by a vowel, it becomes '''l'', like in:
''A la fì vé 'l bel'' ("The good part comes at the end").

===Indefinite Article===
Bresciano:
{| class="wikitable"
! !! colspan=1 | '''Masculine''' !! colspan=1 | '''Feminine'''
|-
|'''Singular''' || ''en'' ¹ ² || ''ena'' ¹ ³
|-
|'''Plural''' || ''dèi'' ⁴ || ''dèle'' ⁴
|}
Bergamasque:
{| class="wikitable"
! !! colspan=1 | '''Masculine''' !! colspan=1 | '''Feminine'''
|-
|'''Singular''' || ''ü'' || ''öna''
|-
|'''Plural''' || ''di'' || ''di''
|}

====References====
¹ - In some varieties of Eastern Lombard, ''en'' can be realized as {{IPA|/øn/}} and written as ''ön'' or even {{IPA|/ø/}} written as ''ö''.&lt;br&gt;
² - The masculine article ''en'' becomes '''n'' when it follows a vowel, as in:&lt;br&gt;
• ''L'éra 'n gran rebelòt'', "It was a big mess."&lt;br&gt;
³ - The feminine article ''ena'' becomes'' 'na'' when it follows a vowel, and ''en' ''when it precedes one.&lt;br&gt;
⁴ - From a historical point of view, ''dèi'' and ''dèle'' should not be considered the plural forms of ''en'' and '''na''. However, practically, they behave as they are plural form of the indefinitive articles:&lt;br&gt;
• ''Gó ést en cà'', "I saw a dog."&lt;br&gt;
• ''Gó ést dèi cà'', "I saw some dogs."

== Modifiers ==

=== Adjectives ===

In Eastern Lombard, adjectives with qualificative function usually go after the noun they modify, and agree with it in number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine).&lt;br&gt;
Plural of adjectives is formed observing the same rules of nouns. So we have:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'' 'n òm pesèn'' / ''du òm pesègn''   (a short man / two short men)&lt;br&gt;
'' 'na fómna pesèna'' / ''dò fómne pesène''   (a short woman / two short women)

Although, in general, if compared with the Italian tongue, Eastern Lombard is less permissive under this aspect, some common adjectives like ''bèl'' (beautiful), ''bröt'' (ugly), ''gran'' (big), ''bù'' (good, good-natured), ''brào'' (good, clever) can also be placed before the noun. In this case the meaning can take on a different nuance, e.g.:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''en bröt òm''   (a bad-natured man)&lt;br&gt;
''en òm bröt''   (an ugly man)

===Superlative===
&lt;br&gt;
Eastern Lombard expresses an extreme degree or absolute state of something by means of the '''absolute superlative''', that corresponds to the English form ''very + adjective''.&lt;br&gt;
Differently from Italian, Spanish and other Romance languages, Eastern Lombard lacks a counterpart of the form ''adjective+issimo'' and also lacks a cognate for the Italian ''molto''. In the Brescian variety, the most widespread form is ''adjective + fés'',&lt;ref&gt;Melchiori, G.B. ''"Vocabolario bresciano-italiano"'' Brescia, Tip. Franzoni - 1817 - pag. 254&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''l'è bèl fés''   (it is very beautiful)&lt;br&gt;
'' 'na maöla dólsa fés''  (a very sweet strawberry)

Although, the adverb ''fés'' cannot be used if the adjective is placed before the noun. In that case the superlative form is obtained by the adverb ''gran'' placed before the adjective, e.g.:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''du gran bèj caàj''   (two very beautiful horses)&lt;br&gt;
''l'è 'n gran brào barbér''   (he is a very good barber)

Another way to express a high degree of something is to reinforce it by means of a second ''adjective+ét/ènt''&lt;ref&gt;Jaberg, Karl ''"Innovations élatives dans l'Italie du Nord: nuovo novente - nuovo noviccio"'' in Vox Romanica, 11 - 1950 - page 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly a present participle), for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''só ché mis gosét''   (I am very wet; literally: dripping wet)&lt;br&gt;
''la padèla l'è calda sbrojéta''   (the pan is very hot; literally: burning hot)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the second element is very frequently a repetition of the first adjective, i.e.:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''na máchina nöa nöènta''   (a very new car) &lt;br&gt;
''ghè za ciar ciarènt''    (it is already very clear)&lt;br&gt;
''del dutùr ghéra zó pjé pjenènt''   (it was very full of people down there to the doctor room)

=== Demonstrative adjectives ===

Eastern Lombard makes a two-way distinction of demonstrative: the proximal form for the singular masculine is ''chèsto'', while the distal form is ''chèl''. This is the declension for the two forms:

{| class="wikitable"
! !! colspan=2 | '''Proximal''' !! colspan=2 | '''Distal'''

| Masculine || ''chèsto'' || ''chèsti'' &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || ''chèl'' || ''chèi''
|-
| Feminine || ''chèsta'' || ''chèste'' || ''chèla'' || ''chèle''
|}

# An alternative form is ''chès·cc'', pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkɛstʃə]}}, but the [[schwa]] is very reduced and hardly pronounced.

Both the proximal and the distal form are frequently emphasized with ''chè'' and ''là'' after the noun. So for example:

''chèsto pà'' or ''chèsto pà chè'' or ''chèl pà chè''(this bread);

''chèl pà'' or ''chèl pà là'' (that bread).

== Pronouns ==

[[Pronouns]] are classified in [[personal pronouns]] (referring to entities), [[demonstrative pronoun]]s (deitic function), [[interrogative pronouns]] (to formulate questions) and [[relative pronoun]]s (linking sentence together).

=== Personal Pronouns ===

Personal pronouns decline in number (singular and plural) and person (first, second and third). For the third person, gender (masculine and feminine) represents a further distinction.

'''''Notes:'''''

: 1. Unlike the other possessive pronouns, ''nòst'' and ''vòst'' decline as adjective in number and gender:

: 2. Not used in urban Brescian but quite common in other varieties:
:: '' '''en''' va a Bèrghem'' (we go to Bergamo)
:: ''dài che '''ma'''l ciàpa'' (hurry up, we can catch it)
: 3. The tonic form of the 3rd persons (either singular or plural) have two additional forms to add a proximal or distal value to the pronoun, when this refers to an animate subject:
:: '' '''lüche''' 'l màja compàgn de 'n luf'' (This man eats like a wolf)
:: ''i è stàde '''lùrela''' '' (It was those (girls/women) )
: The following table shows the eight possible forms:

|-
| Singular Feminine || ''léche'' || ''léla'' 
|-
| Plural Feminine || ''lùreche'' || ''lùrela'' 
|}
|}
&lt;br&gt;
: 4. The situation for the '''object proclitic''' pronoun for the third persons (both singular and plural) is further complicated by the fact that there is a different behavior whether the following verb is a simple or a compound form. For example:
:: ''mé '''le''' càte sö''  (I pick them up)
:: ''mé '''i'''ó catàde sö'' (I have picked them up)
:: ''lur i '''la''' càta sö''  (they pick it up)
:: ''lur i '''l''''à catàt sö'' (they have picked it up)

&lt;br&gt;
'''''Examples of use of the pronouns:'''''

* '''Tonic''' form can be used as subject at the beginning of the sentence or as indirect object after a preposition.
: '' '''mé''' nó a Milà'' (I go to Milan)
: ''ègne con '''té''' '' (I come with you)

* A peculiar feature of Eastern Lombard is the '''proclitic''' form for the '''subject'''. This form precedes the main verb and is obligatory for the second singular person and the third person (singular and plural).

: ''Té '''ta''' sét dré a majà 'l ris'' (you are eating rice)

* The '''proclitic''' form for the '''direct object''' precedes the verb, as in:

: ''mé '''ta''' ède'' (I see you)
: ''mé''.tonic.subject '''''ta'''''.clitic.object  ''ède''.1st.sing

* The '''dative proclitic''' form precedes the verb, as in:

: ''chèsta tùrta, la '''ma''' pjas pròpe'' (this cake, I really like it). Literally:
: ''chèsta''.fem.sing ''tùrta'', ''la''.subject.clitic '''''ma'''''.dative.clitic ''pjas''.present.3rd.sing ''pròpe''

* The '''object enclitic''' is used mainly for pronominal forms of infinitive and imperative:

: ''i völ copà'''m''' '' (they want to kill me.)
: ''scrìe'''l''' zó!'' (write it down!)

* When both an '''enclitic dative''' and an '''enclitic object''' are present, the enclitic dative comes before and an ''-e-'' is introduced between the two enclitic pronouns:

: ''el pöl dà'''fel''' adès''   (he can give it to you now)
: ''scrìe'''mej''' zó!''   (write them down [to me, for me]!)

=== Demonstrative Pronouns ===

Demonstrative pronouns are identical in form with the demonstrative adjectives (see corresponding table). Of course, they occur without a noun and they agree in number and gender with the referent. &lt;br&gt;
Demonstrative pronouns are almost always used with the deictic particle ''ché'' or ''là''. However, while with demonstrative adjectives ''chèl'' can be used in combination with ''ché'', demonstrative pronouns do not accept the expression *''chèl ché''. So:

''chèsto s·cèt ché'' (this boy) -&gt; ''chèsto ché'' (this one)&lt;br&gt;
''chèl s·cèt là'' (that boy) -&gt; ''chèl là'' (that one) &lt;br&gt;
''chèl s·cèt ché'' (this boy) -&gt; no corresponding expression (*''chèl ché'' is not an acceptable form).

In [[Anaphora (linguistics)|pronoun resolution]] (finding the referent of a pronoun), strong preference is given to animate entities rather to inanimate entities.

==Verbs==
One of the first description of the verb declension of Eastern Lombard verbs is included in the small dictionary edited in 1951 by Stefano Pinelli&lt;ref&gt;Pinelli, Stefano, ''Piccolo dizionario del dialetto bresciano''. 1976  - Brescia Grafo (Reprint of the 1851 ed. published by N. Romiglia, Brescia, with introductive notes by Vittorio Mora)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non finite Mood===

====Infinitive====
According to the infinitive form, verbs are classified in '''two classes''':&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The '''first class''' includes the verbs ending in -à:&lt;br&gt;
''Parlà'' (to speak)&lt;br&gt;
''Cantà'' (to sing)&lt;br&gt;
''Nà'' (to go)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The '''second class''' includes the verbs with the infinitive ending in ''-ì'' or ''-er''. Note that almost all the verbs of this second class can present two infinitive forms, one ending in ''-ì'' and the other ending in ''-er''. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Lizì = Lèzer'' (to read)&lt;br&gt;
''Scriì = Scrìer'' (to write)&lt;br&gt;
''Patì = Patéser'' (to suffer)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The form in -ì is mandatory when an enclitic pronoun is added:&lt;br&gt;
''Gó de lizìl'' (I have to read it)&lt;br&gt;
while the form in -er is generally preferred when the infinitive has no enclitic pronouns attached:&lt;br&gt;
''Gó de lèzer'' (I have to read)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Bergamasque instead alternates the form in -í with a form identical to the 3rd singular of present indicative mood.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Gó de lès'' (I have to read) - compare with: ''Lü 'l &lt;u&gt;lès&lt;/u&gt; el giornàl'' (he reads the newspaper) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
therefore the two forms of the infinitive are:&lt;br&gt;
''Lezì = Lès'' (to read)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ducatodipiazzapontida.it/cultura-tradizioni-folclore/vocabolario-italiano-bergamasco/lettera-l.html?page=7 www.ducatodipiazzapontida.it - Vocabolario Italiano - Bergamasco]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Scriì = Scrif'' (to write)&lt;br&gt;
''Corì = Cór'' (to run)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ducatodipiazzapontida.it/cultura-tradizioni-folclore/vocabolario-italiano-bergamasco/lettera-c.html?page=66 www.ducatodipiazzapontida.it - Vocabolario Italiano - Bergamasco]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Past Participle====
'''Past participle''' is used in the compound tenses present perfect and past perfect.
The regular past participle is made adding an ''-t'' (or ''-da'' for feminine in adjective construction and tenses that require gender agreement) after the infinitive form. Verbs of the '''second class''' use the form ending in ''-ì''. For example:

''Parlà'' + ''t'' =&gt; ''Parlàt''&lt;br&gt;
''Cantà'' + ''t'' =&gt; ''Cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
''Scriì'' + ''t'' =&gt; ''Scriìt''&lt;br&gt;
''Patì'' + ''t'' =&gt; ''Patìt''

===Indicative Mood===

====Present Tenses====
There are two present tenses in Eastern Lombard:&lt;br&gt;
A simple present and a present progressive:

=====Simple Present=====
The '''Simple Present''', is conjugated as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First class (infinitive in -à: ''cantà'' (to sing) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''cànte''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''càntet''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''cànta''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''cantóm''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''cantìf''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''cànta''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Second class (infinitive in -ì/-er: ''córer'' (to run) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''córe''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''córet''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''cór''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''coróm''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''curìf''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''cór''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The paradigms above are presented without the corresponding pronouns. II person singular and III personal singular and plural cannot be separated by their clitic pronoun. &lt;br&gt;
The following paradigm is presented with either the personal pronoun and the clitic pronoun:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''mé cànte''&lt;br&gt;
''té ta càntet''&lt;br&gt;
''lü el cànta'' (III person singular masculine)&lt;br&gt;
''lé la cànta'' (III person singular feminine)&lt;br&gt;
''nóter cantóm''&lt;br&gt;
''vóter cantìf''&lt;br&gt;
''lur i cànta'' (III person plural masculine)&lt;br&gt;
''lùre le cànta'' (III person plural feminine)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first person plural can also be conjugated with the clitic pronoun ''en'' + III sing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''nóter cantóm = nóter en cànta''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This form can be prevalent or even exclusive in certain varieties (for example in Bergamasque).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another local way to conjugate the I person plural is &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''nóter càntem''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
where the clitic pronoun seems to have shifted and merged with the declension.

=====Interrogative form of the verb=====
A feature which Lombard tongue shares (among Romance languages) with French is the '''interrogative conjugation of the verb'''. This form is much better preserved in Eastern Lombard than in [[Western Lombard]], where superstratum effects by [[Italian language|Italian]] are stronger. The analogy with French tongue holds at a syntactical level, i.e. ''interrogative form'' means a verb–subject order. A difference consists in the fact that subject particles are enclitic (no accent) and [[agglutination|agglutinate]] with the verb. Internal [[Sandhi]] phenomena may take place as well ''canta-la?'' turns into ''càntela?''. 
So, eastern Lombard verbs have a distinct conjugation paradigm for the interrogative function, where clitic pronouns shift after the verb and solder with it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First class&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''càntej?'' that corresponds to ''(do I) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''càntet?'' that corresponds to ''(do you) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.masc.: ''càntel?'' that corresponds to ''(does he) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.fem.: ''càntela?'' that corresponds to ''(does she) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''cantómej'' that corresponds to ''(do we) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''cantìf'' that corresponds to ''(do you) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.masc.: ''càntej?'' that corresponds to ''(do they) sing?''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.fem.: ''càntele?'' that corresponds to ''(do they) sing?''

It is worthwhile noting that some Camunic dialects show a periphrastic interrogative form,&lt;ref&gt;Benincà, P. e Poletto, C. 1996, ''"A case of do-support in Romance"'', ms., presented at "21° Incontro di Grammatica Generativa" (Bergamo, february 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; with syntax similar to [[English language|English]] tongue:
*''Che fal dí?''= What does he/she say?
*''Che fal fá?''= What does he/she do?
*''Che fal pensá che?''= What does he/she think?
Note that usual interrogative form is applied to the auxiliary verb ''fá'' in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Lino Ertani, ''"Dizionario del dialetto Camuno e toponomastica"'' M.Quetti-Artogne 1985 (Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Negative form of the verb=====
The '''negative form''' is obtained by adding the negation particle ''mìa'' after the verb:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''cànte mìa'' that corresponds to ''(I) don't sing''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''càntet mìa''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''cànta mìa''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''cantóm mìa''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''cantìf mìa''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''cànta mìa''

=====Present Progressive=====
The '''Present progressive''', that is formed with the simple present of the verb ''véser'' + ''dré a'' + infinitive (literally "to be behind to", meaning "to keep up with"):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First class (infinitive in -à: ''cantà'' (to sing) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''só dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sét dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')è dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sóm dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sìf dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i)è dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Second class (infinitive in -ì/-er: ''córer'' (to run) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''só dré a córer''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sét dré a córer''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')è dré a córer''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sóm dré a córer''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sìf dré a córer''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i)è dré a córer''

====Past Tenses====
There are four past tenses. A simple past (imperfect) and three compound pasts (past progressive, present perfect and past perfect):

=====Imperfect=====
The '''Imperfect''' tense, which refers to any repeated, continuous, or habitual past action, is conjugated as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First class (infinitive in -à: ''cantà'' (to sing) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''cantàe''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''cantàet''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''cantàa''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''cantàem''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''cantàef''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''cantàa''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Second class (infinitive in -ì/-er: ''córer'' (to run) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''curìe''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''curìet''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''curìa''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''curìem''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''curìef''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''curìa''

=====Past Progressive=====
The '''Past Progressive''' stresses the fact that the action was continuous in the past. This tense is formed with the imperfect of the verb ''véser'' (to be) + ''dré a'' + the infinitive:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''sére dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''séret dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')éra dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sérem dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''séref dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i)éra dré a cantà''

=====Present Perfect=====
The '''Present Perfect''' is used for every past action without strong connotation on the aspect of the verb, otherwise speakers prefer Imperfect or Past Progressive tenses. Notably, Lombard does not have a Preterite. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The '''Present Perfect''' is formed with the present of the verb ''ìga'' (to have) + the past participle or with the present of the verb ''véser'' + the past participle:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Example from ''cantà''(to sing), with auxiliary verb ''ìga'':
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''gó cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''ghét cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''ga cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''góm cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''ghif cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''ga cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Example from ''sta'' (to stay), with auxiliary verb ''véser'':

I sing.: ''só stat''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sét stat''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')è stat''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sóm stacc''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sìf stacc''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i)è stacc''

=====Past Perfect=====
The '''Past Perfect''' expresses that the action was completed in the past before some other event. &lt;br&gt; This tense is formed with the Imperfect of the verb ''ìga'' (to have) + the past participle or with the Imperfect of the verb ''véser'' + the past participle (similarly to the Present Perfect):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''ghìe cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''ghìet cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''ghìa cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''ghìem cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''ghìef cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''ghìa cantàt''

I sing.: ''sére stat''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''séret stat''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')éra stat''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sérem stacc''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''séref stacc''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i)éra stacc''

====Future Tenses====
There are three future tenses. A simple future and two compound futures (future progressive and future perfect):

=====Simple Future=====
The '''Simple Future''', is conjugated as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First class (infinitive in -à: ''cantà'' (to sing) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''cantaró''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''cantarét''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''cantarà''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''cantaróm''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''cantarìf''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''cantarà''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Second class (infinitive in -ì/-er: ''córer'' (to run) )&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''coraró''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''corarét''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''corarà''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''coraróm''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''corarìf''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''corarà''

=====Future Progressive=====
The '''Future Progressive''' is formed with the simple future of the verb ''véser'' (to be) + ''dré a'' + the infinitive:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''saró dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sarét dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''sarà dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''saróm dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sarìf dré a cantà''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''sarà dré a cantà''

=====Future Perfect=====
The '''Future Perfect''' is formed with the simple future of the auxiliary verb ''ìga'' (to have) + the past participle or with the simple future of ''vèser'' + the past participle (similarly to the Present Perfect):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''garó cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''garét cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''garà cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''garóm cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''garif cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''garà cantàt''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''saró stat''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sarét stat''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''sarà stat''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''saróm stacc''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sarìf stacc''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''sarà stacc''

=== Subjunctive and Conditional moods ===
[[Subjunctive mood|Subjunctive]] and [[Conditional mood|conditional]] moods are used to form the hypothetical sentences and to express desire.&lt;br&gt;
The paradigms for a regular verb (cantà = to sing) are the following:&lt;br&gt;
{{Col-begin|width=80%}}
{{Col-break}}
person
{{Col-break}}
subjunctive present
{{Col-break}}
subjunctive past
{{Col-break}}
conditional
{{col-end}}
{{Col-begin|width=80%}}
{{Col-break}}
I sing.&lt;br&gt;II sing.&lt;br&gt;III sing.&lt;br&gt;I plur.&lt;br&gt;II plur.&lt;br&gt;III plur.
{{Col-break}}
''càntes''&lt;br&gt;''càntes''&lt;br&gt;''cànte''&lt;br&gt;''cantómes''&lt;br&gt;''cantìghes''&lt;br&gt;''cànte''
{{Col-break}}
''cantèse''&lt;br&gt;''cantèset''&lt;br&gt;''cantès''&lt;br&gt;''cantèsem''&lt;br&gt;''cantèsef''&lt;br&gt;''cantès''
{{Col-break}}
''cantarèse''&lt;br&gt;''cantarèset''&lt;br&gt;''cantarès''&lt;br&gt;''cantarèsem''&lt;br&gt;''cantarèsef''&lt;br&gt;''cantarès''
{{col-end}}

=== Imperative mood ===
Imperative mood has only one tense (present) and three persons (II singular, I and II plural).&lt;br&gt;
The paradigm is the following:&lt;br&gt;
{{Col-begin|width=80%}}
{{Col-break}}
person
{{Col-break}}
I class verbs&lt;br&gt;
(ending in -à)
{{Col-break}}
II class verbs&lt;br&gt;
(ending in -ì / -er)
{{col-end}}
{{Col-begin|width=80%}}
{{Col-break}}
II sing.&lt;br&gt;I plur.&lt;br&gt;II plur.
{{Col-break}}
''cànta''&lt;br&gt;''cantóm''&lt;br&gt;''cantì''
{{Col-break}}
''scrìf''&lt;br&gt;''scrióm''&lt;br&gt;''scriì''
{{col-end}}
&lt;br&gt;
Imperative can also bring an enclitic pronoun to specify the object of the action or toward who it is directed. In this case the conjugation for the II singular person can be slightly different. So we have:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''cànta!'' (you sing!)

but

''càntela!'' (sing it!)&lt;br&gt;
where ''-la'' is the enclitic pronoun indicating the object (in this example: III person singular feminine).

''càntega!'' (sing to them)&lt;br&gt;
where ''-ga'' indicates toward who is directed the action (in this example: III person plural).

and for the II class verbs:

''scrìf!'' (you write!)

but

''scrìel!'' (write it!)&lt;br&gt;
''scrìem!'' (write to me!)

==Phrasal verbs==
Eastern Lombard makes a large use of phrasal verbs, i.e. a combination of a verb and an adverb of place. The meaning of the resulting form often significantly differs from the basic verb meaning. Here are some examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''catà'' (to pick up) &lt;br&gt;
''catà fò'' (to choose) &lt;br&gt;
''catà sö'' (to pick up, to drive over someone/something in a vehicle) &lt;br&gt;
''catà sa'' (to retrieve, to refer to unconcerning matters) &lt;br&gt;
''catà zó'' (to pick from a tree) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''tö'' (to buy, to take) &lt;br&gt;
''tö dré'' (to bring with oneself) &lt;br&gt;
''tö sö'' (to take up) &lt;br&gt;
''tö dét'' (to engage, to give an employment) &lt;br&gt;
''tö fò'' (to ask for rest days) &lt;br&gt;
''tö zó'' (to assume drugs or medical treatments) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''leà'' (to lift) &lt;br&gt;
''leà fò'' (to breed) &lt;br&gt;
''leà sö'' (to stand up) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that the adverbial particle always comes immediately after the group ''verb + enclitic pronouns'', e.g.:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''te ghét de laàl zó'' (you have to wash it down)&lt;br&gt;
''càtemej sö, per pjazér'' (pick them up [for me], please)

== Auxiliary verbs ==
Eastern Lombard has two auxiliary verbs: ''véser'' (to be) and ''ìga'' (to have) and are used in the same way as in Italian.

=== The verb Véser (to be) ===
Besides being used as [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] or to express existence (like ''to be''), '''Véser''' is also an auxiliary verb, contrary to the use of the English [[Present perfect|Present Perfect]]. &lt;br&gt;
The forms in the present tense are irregular:

I sing.: ''só''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sét''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')è''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sóm''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sìf''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i)è''

=== The verb Ìga (to have) ===
The peculiarity of the verb ''ìga'' in Eastern Lombard is that it is always bound to a pronominal particle. The infinitive form, for example, is ''ìga'', where the particle ''-ga'' is a 1st person plural pronoun (comparable with the pronoun ''ci'' of the Italian).&lt;br&gt;
When a different pronoun is needed, the particle ''-ga'' is replaced with the proper pronoun, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''L'è bèl a ì'''ga''' i sólcc'' (It is good to have money)&lt;br&gt;
but&lt;br&gt;
''La dis de ì'''l''' vést'' (She says to have seen it)&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
The same occurs in the conjugated forms, with the exception that the pronominal particle comes before the verb instead of after. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''''G'''ó du gacc'' (I have two cats)&lt;br&gt;
but&lt;br&gt;
'''''L''''ó ést'' (I have seen it)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The complete conjugation for the indicative present is:

I sing.: ''gó''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''ghét''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''ga''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''góm''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''ghìf''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''ga''

Certain varieties (mostly Bergamasque) drop the pronominal particle when conjugated as auxiliary verb, thus, in that case, the correct expressions are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''''Gó''' öna moér e du s·cècc'' (I have a wife and two sons)&lt;br&gt;
but&lt;br&gt;
'''''Ó''' biìt tròp''  (I have drunk too much)

=== Convergence of the imperfect ===
Curiously enough, the imperfect conjugation of the auxiliary verbs seems to confuse and interchange the inflections.&lt;br&gt;
Etymologically the two auxiliary verbs should be conjugated as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''véser:'''&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''sére''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''séret''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')éra''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sérem''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''séref''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i) éra''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''ìga:'''&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''ghìe''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''ghìet''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''ghìa''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''ghìem''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''ghìef''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''ghìa''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But, beside these forms, the followings can often be found:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''véser:'''&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''sìe''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''sìet''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''(l')ìa''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''sìem''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''sìef''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i) ìa''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''ìga:'''&lt;br&gt;
I sing.: ''ghére''&lt;br&gt;
II sing.: ''ghéret''&lt;br&gt;
III sing.: ''ghéra''&lt;br&gt;
I plur.: ''ghérem''&lt;br&gt;
II plur.: ''ghéref''&lt;br&gt;
III plur.: ''(i) ghéra''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, the following sentences can be found with no apparent preference:&lt;br&gt;
''El '''ghìa''' fat sö 'na ca.''&lt;br&gt;
''El '''ghéra''' fat sö 'na ca.''&lt;br&gt;
Both meaning ''He had built a house.''

==Negation==

In Eastern Lombard, negation is generally expressed with the form '''''mìa''''' (or locally '''''mìga''''') after the verb.

''el tò s·cèt el stüdia '''mìa''' l'Inglés'' (Your son is not studying English).

In the case of a compound tense, the negation occurs after the auxiliary.

''só '''mìa''' nàt a scöla'' (I did not go to school).

Differently from [[Italian language|Italian]] where the negative sentence pattern contemplates and requires the use of redundant negative particles, Eastern Lombard doesn't. Thus, when an indefinite pronoun with negative value is already present in the sentence, the particle ''mìa'' is usually dropped (even though in certain conditions it is tolerated).

''ghéra '''niènt''' de fa'' (there was nothing to do).&lt;br&gt;
Compare with the Italian:&lt;br&gt;
'' '''non''' c'era '''niente''' da fare.''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''mé gó ést '''nüsü''' '' (I didn't see anybody).&lt;br&gt;
In Italian would be rendered with:&lt;br&gt;
'' io '''non''' ho visto '''nessuno''' ''. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''el ga '''mài''' lauràt'' (he has never worked).&lt;br&gt;
Italian:&lt;br&gt;
'' '''non''' ha '''mai''' lavorato''.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
The forms:&lt;br&gt;
''ghéra '''mìa niènt''' de fa'' and ''mé gó '''mìa''' ést '''nüsü''' '' 
are tolerated while the form ''el ga '''mìa mài''' lauràt'' is not.

A less common way to express negation is the use of the particle '''''nó''''' before the verb or before the proclitic subject pronoun. This form has almost everywhere been replaced by the use of ''mìa''. It seems to have crystallized uniquely in few expressions like:

''mé '''nó''' crède!''  (I don't think so!)

''gne '''nó''' 'l va, gne '''nó''' 'l vé.'' (neither it goes, nor comes it).

A '''fandub''' is a [[fan-made]] [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] or redub of a live-action or animated production. Dubbing is the act of re-recording of a live-action or animated production, typically in a language other than the original. Most productions are translated from different languages, but fandubs do exist for productions that were produced in the fandubber's native language. The dialogue can range from being a close translation to a completely altered version of the original script's story and plots, as well as the personalities of protagonists. The reasons behind fandubbing can range from the production not receiving an official dub to the official dub being poorly received. Fandubs are most commonly done with [[Japanese animation]], but can include live action and animated series and movies in any language. Versions where the story line, character personalities, and content are dramatically altered, typically in a humorous manner, are called "Abridged Series" and "fundubs".

Because fandubs typically use [[copyright]]ed material, fandubs face the same copyright implications as [[Fansub#Legal and ethical issues|fansubs]] but on a different scale. To avoid copyright issues, fandubs are sometimes made using web-based dubbing tools like [http://dubroo.com/ Dubroo], which does not alter the original videos but just plays the dubbed audio along with the original muted video.

== History ==

Amateur voice acting began simultaneously and independently from each other in a small number of developed countries. One of the first recorded projects, dating from 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laputa II: The Sequel - Tiny Liner Notes |url=http://www.seishun.org/2005/03/laputa-ii-sequel.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230052129/http://www.seishun.org/2005/03/laputa-ii-sequel.html |archivedate=2014-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the anime fan-dub parody "Laputa II: The Sequel", an English redub of the first four episodes of ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''.

A further  [[Star Wars]] fandub of [[Dominik Kuhn]] (Dodokay), using a scene in the film for a [[viral marketing]] parody gained fame with German mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/14/us-media-youtube-starwars-idUSTRE69D3V920101014 Star Wars dub sends jobbing ad man into orbit], By Dave Graham Reuters STUTTGART, Germany Thu Oct 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

While fansubbing is a highly-popular means by which various Internet-downloaded visual media can be understood by other language markets, fandubbing as a practice has not gained similar momentum as a means of translation by lay Internet users. The majority of fandub projects are arranged for short-form video clips and are often posted to [[video hosting service]]s such as [[YouTube]].

Most series are produced online with voice actors often auditioning via forums, but live dubbing sessions at anime cons often take place, for example the "[http://www.voiceacting.space/thread-94-post-238.html#pid238 Anime Dub Live" panels held in the UK].

Flash is particularly visible as a solid patch of plastic at bottom centre-right, between the model aeroplane side and the sprue.]]'''Flash''', also known as '''flashing''', is excess material attached to a [[molding (process)|molded]], [[forging|forged]], or [[casting|cast]] product, which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the [[parting line]]&lt;ref name="Kazmer2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kazmer|title=Injection mold design engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWTftzWhBp4C&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Hanser Verlag|isbn=978-1-56990-417-6|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.&lt;ref name="VGX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_sg/Images/3014_tcm963-4308.pdf|title=NX I-deasVGX Core/Cavity|year=2007|publisher=Siemens PLM Software|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molding flash can be caused from old or worn mold cavities that no longer fit tightly together. Other times, the complexity of the part requires so many mating pieces with such precise geometries that it is almost impossible to create a perfect fit on every impression. Most often, the type of material being molded, and its attendant viscosity in its liquid form, is the primary factor that leads to the creation of the unwanted mold flash.&lt;ref name="bozzelli"&gt;Bozzelli, John [http://www.ptonline.com/articles/an-expert-tells-how-to-stop-flash "An Expert Tells How to Stop Flash"], ''Plastics Technology'', July 2004, accessed May 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of removing flash, known as '''deflashing''', is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], or [[Tumble finishing|tumbling]]. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders to have their operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic deflashing&lt;ref name="Nitrofreeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deflashing/cryogenic-deflashing-using-blast-media/|title=Cryogenic Deflashing for Molded Plastic, Rubber &amp; Silicone|publisher=Nitrofreeze Cryogenic Solutions|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or media blasting to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.

== Witness mark ==
In plastic injection, a faint mark called a '''witness mark''' (or '''witness line''') will occur along the parting line.&lt;ref name="Kazmer2007"/&gt; This is unavoidable and is usually accepted despite the minor aesthetics issue. However, some part surfaces (e.g. when used for sealing&lt;ref name="Bernard2005"&gt;{{cite patent|country=US | number = 6939500 | status = patent | title = Method and apparatus for eliminating a parting line witness mark from a molded part | gdate = 2005-09-06 | invent1 = Bernard, Edward Helmut}}&lt;/ref&gt;) cannot tolerate witness marks, and thus either the marks must be removed post-molding or the [[Molding (process)|mold]] redesigned.

{{Wiktionary|homograph}}

A '''homograph''' (from the {{lang-el|ὁμός}}, ''homós'', "same" and γράφω, ''gráphō'', "write") is a [[word]] that shares the same written form as another word but has a different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;
{{
	cite web|
	title=One of two or more words that have the same spelling but differ in origin, meaning, and sometimes pronunciation, such as fair (pleasing in appearance) and fair (market) or wind (wĭnd) and wind (wīnd)|
	url=http://tfd.com/homograph
	}}
	&lt;/ref&gt; However, some dictionaries insist that the words must also sound different,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vCUTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=homograph+dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMI2J_XwvfhxgIVji3bCh3O0wBB#v=onepage&amp;q=homograph%20dictionary&amp;f=false ''Homophones and Homographs: An American Dictionary, 4th ed.''], McFarland, 2006, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] says that the words should also be of "different origin".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: ''homograph''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, ''The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography'' lists various types of homographs, including those in which the words are discriminated by being in a different ''word class'', such as ''hit'', the verb ''to strike'', and ''hit'' the noun ''a blow''.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, BTS.; Rundell, M., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H0rc_cnr3NYC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=homograph+dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBWoVChMI2J_XwvfhxgIVji3bCh3O0wBB#v=onepage&amp;q=homograph%20dictionary&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography''], OUP Oxford, 2008, 
pp. 192 - 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

If, when spoken, the meanings may be distinguished by different pronunciations, the words are also [[heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]]s. Words with the same writing ''and'' pronunciation (i.e. are both homographs and [[homophone]]s) are considered [[homonym]]s. However, in a looser sense the term "homonym" may be applied to words with the same writing ''or'' pronunciation. Homograph disambiguation is critically important in [[speech synthesis]], [[natural language processing]] and other fields. Identically written different senses of what is judged to be fundamentally the ''same'' word are called [[polyseme]]s; for example, ''wood'' (substance) and ''wood'' (area covered with trees).

==In English==
Examples:
*''sow'' (verb) – to plant seed
:''sow'' (noun) – female pig
where the two words are spelt identically but pronounced differently. Here confusion is not possible in spoken language but could occur in written language.

*''bear'' (verb) – to support or carry
:''bear'' (noun) –  the animal
where the words are identical in spelling and pronunciation, but differ in meaning and grammatical function. These are called [[Homonym|homonyms]].

==In Chinese==

Many homographs in Old Chinese also exist in [[Middle Chinese]]. Examples of homographs in Middle Chinese are:

===Modern Chinese===
Many homographs in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese also exist in modern Chinese varieties. Homographs which did not exist in Old Chinese or Middle Chinese often come into existence due to differences between [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]. Other homographs may have been created due to merging two different characters into the same glyph during script reform (See [[Simplified Chinese characters]] and [[Shinjitai]]).

Some examples of homographs in [[Cantonese]] from Middle Chinese are:

The '''Hungarian System''', or '''Brodlowsky System''', is a type sporting tournaments setting.

During the winter of 1979, Ivan Brodlowsky, the creator of 2x Hunter Ball, defined what he called the Hungarian System of Classification, or simply the 'Brodlowsky System'. This kind of tournament organization made was a revolution in the Eastern Europe of the 80's, showing that socialists could create their own system of sport management.

In 1981, the [[Hungarian Federation of Basketball]] adopted his idea and organized the national championship following on his plan. The following year, the Ukrainian Pelota Basca tournament  used  Brodlowsky proposal, and so did the Bulgarians in their 1987 basketball competition.

Brodlowsky system survived until the end of that decade, there are still some examples of its use around the world, such as: - [[Irish Rugby Union]] (1998/99); - South African National Badminton Championship (1991 to 1995); - Mexican Casting Party (1989 to 2003); - Texas Amateur Pickleball Prize, and many more.

==The Rules==

- Traditional (League) Organisation: competitors play against all the others (usually twice - home and away);

- Number of finalists vary from 3 to 8, normally;

- Key-bouts:  These are chosen in order to promote competitors to the next stage.

The idea of 'key-bouts' is essential in this system. Brodlowsky says that teams have to qualify during the tournament, not after. Thus, it's important to determine the bouts in which competitors that occupy the first place in these moments will qualify themselves to the next stage.

==Examples==

'''Regular Tournament'''

''National Hungarian Championship – [[Basketball]] (1981)''

Number of competitors: 8
Following stage: semi-final round
Key-bouts: 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th.
 
This is the most classic example of this system, as we have four different qualified teams. After the second bout, Budapest Labda Club had two successes and occupied the first position. However, after the fourth bout, Basket Club TG was the first, and so this was another qualified.
After the sixth bout, Basket Club TG lost its first position to Grand Voyage, which couldn't maintain it until the last bout, when Magyaro Club got it. So, we have four different qualified teams: Budapest Labda Club, Basket Club TG, Grand Voyage and Magyaro Club, which played normal semi-finals after that.

'''Exception Tournament'''

''Mexican [[Casting (sport)|Casting]] Party – (2002)''

Number of competitors: 32
Following stage: quarter-final round
Key-bouts: 1st, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 30th, 31st, 32nd.
 
In this example, we can see that it's not necessary to choose symmetrically the key-bouts – it depends on the goals of the tournament. In this case, managers chose the three last bouts to be key-bouts, giving special attention to the consistent competitors.

The tournament had 5 qualified competitors. However, and incongruency happened: Lucas Fernandez, with only 9 victories, was qualified after the first bout; Juan de Castro, with 17 victories, after the sixth bout; but Johnny Cudanrot, in the third position and with 28 victories, couldn't classify himself.
Asked about what managers should do with this, Brodlowsky explained: “It's necessary to make an extra-match between Johnny Cudanrot and Lucas Fernandez. Why? Because Cudanrot has more winnings than half of the other qualified (actually, 3/5 of them). So, it's unfair not to give him an opportunity. In my opinion, as the creator of this system, an extra-game between Cudanrot and Fernandez is the best solution”.
Of course, Brodlowsky was heard, the game was made and a surprise happened: Fernandez won that match and all the others, turning into the champion of that season!

'''Ivan Anz Frankopian''', or '''Giovanni Franco''', also called ({{lang-sv|Johan Vale}}), was a [[bailiff]] in service of [[Eric of Pomerania]] service, who in the 1420s held [[Stegeborg]]. He was the son of the Croatian [[viceroy]], [[Nikola Frankopan]].&lt;ref name="Larsson160"&gt;Larsson (2003), sid. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

King Eric met Franco in Venice on his way on his [[pilgrimage]] to [[Jerusalem]], and was designated an [[interpreter]].  After the arrivial in Jerusalem, the King was dubbed [[Knight of the Holy Sepulchre]] by the [[Franciscan]] [[Custos of the Holy Land]], and subsequently himself dubbed his pilgrim fellows, among them Ivan Anz Frankopian.&lt;ref&gt;''Fratris Felicis Fabri Evagatorium in Terrae sanctae, Arabiae et Aegypti peregrinationem'', [[Felix Fabri]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the journey to Jerusalem, Franco then come to the Nordic countries and became bailiff at Stegeborg.

In 1432, a Venetian ships crew shipwrecked off the coast of [[Norway]] to Stegeborg after a journey to [[Jämtland]], [[Dalarna]] and [[Västmanland]]. He took care of them, and took, among other things with them to [[Vadstena]] for a church celebration, he gave them parting gifts and housed them in farms during their journey to [[Lödöse]]. [1]

Franco also had [[Köpingshus]] [[fief]], and here he found himself in [[Engelbrekt rebellion]], so withdrew before [[Engelbrecht]] in 1434 conquered and burned the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson (2003), sid. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he also left [[Stegsholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsson (2003), sid. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magar Kaike''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan language]] of Nepal. ''Ethnologue'' classifies it as a West [[Bodish languages|Bodish]] language.

Kaike is spoken in Shahartara, Tupatara, Tarakot, and Belawa villages of [[Sahartara]] VDC, [[Dolpa District]], [[Karnali Zone]], Nepal (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

Honda (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Honda, Isao. 2008. Some observations on the relationship between Kaike and Tamangic. ''Nepalese Linguistics'' 23: 85-116.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Kaike shares many words with [[Tamangic languages|Tamangic]], but is not part of Tamangic proper. It is also in contact with Tichyurong Tibetan, a divergent [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] lect spoken near the Kaike-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;Honda, Isao. 2018.

==Early life==
Rai was born on 8 June 1915 to Duggappa and Deyyakka Rai.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; His given name is unique since it includes the [[Kannada script|Kannada alphabet]] 'ಞ' (a [[palatal]] consonant pronounced nasally as "nya"), which is used very rarely in the [[Kannada script|written Kannada]] of today and is absent in the English alphabet which often leads to various other transliterations of his given name such as ''Kinyanna'' and ''Kinnanna''. Rai first learned [[Kannada language|Kannada]] in school.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Later he published his first handwritten journal, ''Susheela'', at the age of 12.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He was influenced by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and also participated in the freedom movement of India.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; During this period he married Unyakka and is a father to eight children.

==Career==
Rai started his career as a secondary school teacher. He also delved into journalism and contributed his writings to newspapers like ''Swabhimana'', ''[[The Madras Mail|Madras Mail]]'' and ''[[The Hindu]]''.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He received the National Award for Best Teacher in 1969.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;Awards presented to Kayyara Kinyanna Rai are mentioned by {{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/25/stories/2005012502470300.htm|author=Staff Correspondent|title=Honorary doctorates for Sheni, Rai, Sathyu|work= The Hindu|accessdate=18 April 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a writer and poet who has written books on theatre, grammar and children. Some of his famous poems are ''Shreemukha'', ''Aikyagana'', ''Punarnava'', ''Chethana'' and ''Koraga''. He has written a biography of [[Govinda Pai]], the [[Kannada]] poet from whom he was highly influenced. His other important works are ''Malayala Sahitya Charithre'' (History of [[Malayalam literature]]),which is a translation of an original work by P. K.

Rai was also an avid agriculturist and was active in the cultivation of areca, rubber and rice.

==Later life==
Rai was a campaigner for the merger of [[Kasaragod district]] into [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="camp"&gt;Proposal by Kinyanna Rai to approach the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of India to urge the merger of [[Kasaragod Town|Kasargod]] into Karnataka is mentioned by {{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2002/11/25/stories/2002112503010400.htm|author=K.P.

Describing the goals of this council Rai said that ''the linguistic minorities in the district were not against the Malayalis or Kerala State, per se, but were demanding the implementation of the Justice Mahajan Commission report, vis-a-vis the fulfilment of promises made by the former Chief Ministers, [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], [[C.

'''Kazimierz Bein''' (1872 – June 15, 1959), often referred to by his pseudonym '''Kabe''',&lt;ref&gt;"Kabe", in ''Reto-vortaro'' http://reto-vortaro.de/revo/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} .  Accessed 2015 February 10.&lt;/ref&gt;     was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[ophthalmologist]], the founder and sometime director of the Warsaw Ophthalmic Institute (''Warszawski Instytut Oftalmiczny'').

He was also, for a time, a prominent [[Esperanto]] author, [[translator]] and activist, until in 1911 he suddenly, without explanation, abandoned the Esperanto movement.  Bein became at least as well known for his involvement with Esperanto as for his medical accomplishments, and as much for the manner in which he left the Esperanto movement as for what he had accomplished within it.

==Life==
{{Esperanto sidebar}}
As a young man, Bein participated in the Polish movement for independence from [[Russia]], for which he was exiled for several years; thus he was forced to finish his [[medical]] training in [[Kazan]]. Bein authored many technical books and articles, and founded the Warsaw Ophthalmic Institute and the Polish Ophthalmological Society. He was also a noted amateur [[photographer]].

==Esperanto movement==
Bein was among the earliest adopters of [[Esperanto]], the [[International auxiliary language|international language]] that had been created by a fellow Polish ophthalmologist, [[Ludwik Zamenhof]].  Bein became an eminent pioneer of Esperanto prose, writing under the pseudonym, "Kabe," an abbreviation of his actual name (and also the Polish pronunciation of his [[initialism|initial]]s, "K.B."). In 1904 he gained fame with his translation of a 1900 novel by [[Wacław Sieroszewski]], ''Dno nędzy'' (''The Depths of Misery''; Esperanto title:  ''Fundo de l' Mizero'').  

In 1906 Bein became vice-president of the [[Academy of Esperanto]].  He had a profound influence  on the language's early development. The highlights of his career were most likely his Esperanto translation of [[Bolesław Prus]]' [[historical novel]], ''[[Faraon]]'' (''Pharaoh''), and one of the first Esperanto [[dictionary|dictionaries]], ''Vortaro de Esperanto''.

Bein is, however, probably best known for his sudden, comment-less 1911 disappearance from the Esperanto scene.  Interviewed twenty years later, in 1931, by the Esperanto magazine, ''Literatura Mondo'' (World of Literature), he spoke of Esperanto's stalled progress, and said that he no longer regarded the language as a viable solution to the need for an [[International auxiliary language|international language]].

Shortly after he had left the movement, Esperantists coined the word ''kabei'',&lt;ref&gt;"kabei", in ''Reto-vortaro'' http://reto-vortaro.de/revo/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} .  Accessed 2015 February 10.&lt;/ref&gt; after "Kabe," meaning "to fervently and successfully participate in Esperanto, then suddenly and silently drop out."  The expression, ''kabei'', remains in use by Esperantists to this day.

It has been referred to as ''Lavrung'' in previous publications.

==Dialects==
{{harvtxt|Lai|2017|p=15}} identifies two major branches of Khroskyabs: Core Khroskyabs dialects and Njorogs (业隆话). Core-Khroskyabs dialects are further divided into Phosul and Thugschen. The Thugschen dialects include Siyuewu (斯跃武), Wobzi (俄热), 'Brongrdzong (木尔宗) and Guanyinqiao (观音桥).

==Phonology==

=== Onsets ===

The Wobzi dialect has 42 consonantal phonemes, shown in the table below. Other Khroskyabs dialects exhibit similar systems.

Khroskyabs dialects present complex consonant clusters. A consonant cluster in Wobzi is composed of three parts, preinitial(s), initial and medial, which can be tested through a partial reduplication process. 757 consonant clusters are attested according to {{harvtxt|Lai|2017|p=101}}. A single cluster can contain up to six consonants in a row: ''ʁjnlzdə̂'' "to be made to buy for one's benefit".

The ordering of preinitials in a consonant cluster follows a language-specific sonority hierarchy {{harv|Lai|2013}}:

ʁ- &gt; j- &gt; N-, m- &gt; v-, &gt; r-, l- &gt; s-, z-

=== Rhymes ===

Wobzi Khroskyabs has 9 vowel phonemes, listed in the table below. One diphthong is found, ''æi''. Most Core-Khroskyabs dialects have similar vowel systems. In Phosul, a complete series of velarised consonants are attested {{harv|Huang|2007|p=166}}: ''iˠ'', ''uˠ'', ''eˠ'', ''oˠ'', ''ʌˠ''.

=== Tones ===

Two tones are attested in Khroskyabs, a high (H) tone, noted σ́, and a high-falling (HL) tone, noted σ̂. Some minimal pairs in Wobzi Khroskyabs are illustrated in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
!H
!Gloss

|ʁbɑ̂ɣ
|to be numerous
|-
|sʁǽi
|language, sound
|sʁæ̂i
|to return, to give back
|}

Only one syllable in a phonological word can bear a tone, and the surface tones of the other syllable(s), if existent, are derived from the tone-bearing syllable.

==Grammar==

===Noun phrase===

====Number====

Khroskyabs dialects present two number markers, ''=ne'' for dual and ''=ɟi'' for plural: ''kɑpə̂=ne'' (book={{smallcaps|du}}) "two books", ''kɑpə̂=ɟi'' (book={{smallcaps|pl}}) "(more than two) books". Like many Asian languages, number markers are prohibited when a numeral is present:

:{||-
| ''kɑpə̂(*=ne)'' || ''jnæ̂'' 
|-
|book&lt;small&gt;(*=DU)&lt;/small&gt; || two 
|-
|colspan=2|"two books"
|}
:{||-
| ''kɑpə̂(*=ɟi)'' || ''çsə̂m'' 
|-
|book&lt;small&gt;(*=PL)&lt;/small&gt; || three
|-
|colspan=2|"three books"
|}

Khroskyabs presents a rich array of classifiers. A non-exhaustive list of classifiers in the Wobzi dialects is shown below (with the numeral prefix ''ə̂-'' "one").

|-
|ə̂-gi

|-
|ə̂-bjæ

|-
|ə̂-χpʰo

|}

====Vocative====

Vocative is formed by assigning a high-falling tone to the penultimate syllable of a noun phrase.

 {| class="wikitable"

===Verbal template===

The Khroskyabs verb exhibits a templatic morphology with a strong prefixing preference, which means every affix is obligatorily positioned in its own slot which is impossible to change. The table below shows the verbal template of Wobzi Khroskyabs {{harv|Lai|2017|p=293}}.

Prefixes: -1: Incorporated noun; -2: Reflexive ''ʁjæ̂''; -3: Causative ''s-'' and ''z-''; -4: Causative ''v-''; -5: Autobenefactive ''N-''; -6: Intransitive-passive ''ʁ-''; -7: Conditional ''zə̂-''; -8: Negative ''mə-''/''mɑ-''/''mæ-''/''tə-'', interrogative ''ɕə-''; -9: Inverse ''u-'', irrealis ''ɑ̂-''', interrogative ''ə̂-'';-10: Orientational prefixes ''æ-'', ''næ-'', ''kə-'', ''nə-'', ''læ-'', ''və-'', ''rə-''; -11 Progressive ''sə̂&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''-, superlative ''sə̂&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-''.

Suffixes: 1: Person endings: -ŋ, -j, -n; 2: Reduplication

In the following subsections, some characteristics of the affixes are presented.

====Compatibility====

The superlative prefix ''sə̂&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-'' is compatible with stative verbs and only very few dynamic verbs: ''sə̂&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-tsʰa'' (&lt;small&gt;SUPERL&lt;/small&gt;-be.good&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 'best', but *''sə̂&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-və'' (&lt;small&gt;SUPERL&lt;/small&gt;-go&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

Negative has four allomorphs. ''mə-'' is used when no other prefix precedes: ''mə-tsʰâ'' (&lt;small&gt;NEG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;-be.good) (it is not good); ''mæ-'' is used when an orientational prefix precedes: ''næ-mæ-tsʰâ'' (&lt;small&gt;IPFV.PST&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;NEG&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;-be.good&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;); ''mɑ-'' is used in perfective or past forms of a verb that prohibits the use of orientational prefixes in such situations: ''mɑ-vdé'' (&lt;small&gt;NEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;-see&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) '(s)he did not see' (''vdê'' 'to see' does not allow any orientational prefix in past form); ''tə-'' is used in irrealis situations, imperative, jussive and conditional with ''ɑ̂-'' (not ''zə̂-''): ''æ-tə-dzî-n'' (&lt;small&gt;IMP&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;NEG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;-eat&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-2) 'Don't eat!'; ''ɑ̂-tə-dzi'' (&lt;small&gt;JUSS&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;NEG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;-eat&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 'Let her/him not eat. '

The interrogative prefixes ''ə̂-'' and ''ɕə-'' cannot coexist.

The irrealis prefix ''ɑ̂-'' and the conditional prefix ''zə̂-'' cannot coexist.

====Causative s-====

The causative prefix ''s-'' in Wobzi Khroskyabs undergoes various morphophonological processes, including voicing [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], lateral [[dissimilation]], [[Affricate consonant|affrication]], [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] and lateral [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]].

• '''Voicing assimilation''': ''s-'' becomes voiced ''z-'' before voiced stops and stays voiceless before voiceless consonants and sonorants.

''s-'' + ''kʰɑ̂'' 'to give' → ''s-kʰɑ̂'' 'to cause to give'

''s-'' + ''gí'' 'to wear' → ''z-gí'' 'to cause to wear'

''s-'' + ''mó'' 'to be hundry' → ''s-mó'' 'to cause to be hundry''

• '''Lateral dissimilation''': ''s-'' becomes ''l-'' or ''ɬ-'' (depending on the voicing of the following consonant) when it precedes dental fricatives and affricates.

''s-'' + ''sɑ̂'' 'to kill' → ''ɬ-sɑ̂'' 'to cause to kill'

''s-'' + ''dzî'' 'to eat' → ''l-dzî'' 'to cause to eat'

• '''Affrication''': Affrication is not productive in Wobzi Khroskyabs. Its trace can be found in the causativisation of the verb ''rʑə̂'' 'to wash', ''l-dʑə̂'' 'to cause to watch', in which the fricative ''ʑ-'' becomes an affricate, ''dʑ-''.

• '''Metathesis''': There are two types of metatheses in Wobzi Khroskyabs, prefix ordering metathesis and ''vCVr'' metathesis.

The prefix ordering metathesis follows the sonority hierarchy of the preinitials. If the prefix ''s-'' is to be added to a verb stem already containing preinitials that ranks higher in the sonority hierarchy, it must be metathesised.

''s-'' + ''ʁbɑ́ɣ'' 'to explode' → ''ʁ⟨z⟩bɑ́ɣ'' 'to cause to explode''

''s-'' + ''jbə̂v'' 'to be swollen' → ''j⟨z⟩bə̂v'' 'to cause to be swollen'

The preinitials ''l-'' and ''r-'', ''N-'' and ''m-'' drop when the causative prefix ''s-'' is added, while the case is optional for the preinitials ''j-'' and ''v-''.

''s-'' + ''mkʰæ̂'' 'to be expert' → ''m⟨s⟩kʰæ̂'' → ''s-kʰæ̂'' 'to cause to be expert'

''s-'' + ''rlǽ'' 'to peel' → ''r⟨s⟩lǽ'' → ''s-lǽ'' 'to cause to peel'

''s-'' + ''ɬqʰǽl'' 'to be dirty' → ''ɬ⟨s⟩qʰǽl'' → ''s-qʰǽl'' 'to cause to be dirty'

''vCVr'' metathesis, as its name suggests, concerns verbs with ''v-'' as preinitial and ''-r'' as coda.

''s-'' + ''vzɑ́r'' 'to be spicy' → ''l-zɑ́v'' 'to cause to be spicy'

''vcVr'' metathesis is a Wobzi-specific process, not found in other Khroskyabs dialects.

• Some verbs with a falling tone undergo tone change into a high one when causative ''s-'' is applied. The process is not productive.

''s-'' + ''tʰê'' 'to drink' → ''s-tʰé'' 'to cause to drink'
''s-'' + ''nɑ̂r'' 'to burn' → ''s-nɑ́r'' 'to cause to burn'
''s-'' + ''brê'' 'to be loud'→ ''z-bré'' 'to play (instrument)'

• The causative form of the verb ''çtə̂'' 'to be short' is ''s-tə́m'' 'to shorten', with an additional -m coda, which may be the reflex of an old stem alternation.

====Autobenefactive N-====

Autobenefactive ''N-'' appears as an [[Phoneme#Neutralization and archiphonemes|archiphoneme]] having several surface forms according to the phonological environment, especially the [[place of articulation]].

''N-'' + ''pʰó'' 'to cut' → ''m-pʰó'' 'to harvest'

''N-'' + ''dʑə̂dʑə'' 'to drag' → ''n-dʑə̂dʑə'' 'to drag for oneself'

''N-'' + ''cʰǽ'' 'to be big' → ''ɲ-cʰǽ'' 'to grow'

''N-'' + ''kʰú'' 'to wear (shoe, sock)' → ''ŋ-kʰú'' 'to wear for oneself'

''N-'' + ''qá'' 'to pull out' → ''ɴ-qá'' 'to pull out for oneself'

====Incorporation====

Noun incorporation is attested in Wobzi Khroskyabs as well as other Khroskyabs dialects. The incorporational construction is mainly formed by a nominal part (in its full form or [[Construct_state|''Status Constructus'']] form) and a verbal part. In many cases, a denominal prefix is attached to incorporational forms. 

''fɕî'' 'tooth' + ''zê'' 'to be small' → ''fɕîze'' 'to be young'

''N-'' 'denominal prefix' + ''tɕʰæ-'' (''Status Constructus'' of ''tɕʰî'' 'road') + ''fsê'' 'to lead' → ''ntɕʰæ̂fse'' 'to guide'

''s-'' 'denominal prefix' + ''kʰrə̂m'' 'discipline' + ''ɕǽ'' 'to go' → ''skʰrəmɕǽ'' 'to scold'

Usually, the nominal part precedes the verbal part, but one example with the verbal part preceding the nominal part is attested:

''N-'' 'denominal prefix' + ''tsʰə̂r'' 'to milk' + ''lú'' 'milk' → ''ntsʰərlú'' 'to be good at lactating (cows)'

===Argument indexation===

Khroskyabs dialects distinguish transitive verbs from intransitive verbs unambiguously. Argument indexation presents two patterns, the intransitive pattern and the transitive pattern.

The intransitive paradigm in Wobzi Khroskyabs is illustrated in the table below. There are three suffixes, first person singular ''-ŋ'', first person non-singular (or plural) ''-j'', and second person ''-n''. Third person is unmarked. The subject argument agrees with verb. 

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center
! Person
! Suffix
|-
| 1sg
| Σ-(ɑ)ŋ
|-
| 1pl
| Σ-j
|-
| 2
| Σ-n
|}

:{||-
| ''ŋô'' || ''næ-qʰ-ɑ̂ŋ'' 
|-
|1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-laugh.II-1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=2|"I laughed."
|}
:{||-
| ''nû'' || ''næ-qʰî-n'' 
|-
|2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-laugh.II-2
|-
|colspan=2|"You laughed."
|}


The transitive paradigm exhibits a [[Direct–inverse_language|hierarchical alignment]]. Khroskyabs has a 1&gt;2&gt;3 [[Animacy|empathy hierarchy]]. In terms of suffixes, within SAP (Speech-act participants, usually first and second persons) arguments, the verb indexes the P (patientive argument), otherwise it indexes the SAP argument, if exists. The inverse prefix ''u-'' occurs when the P ranks higher than the A, as well as almost all 3→3 scenarios '''with''' a TAM prefix on the verb. In all inverse and 3→3 scenarios, the ergative marker ''=ɣə'' must occur on the A. The transitive paradigm in Wobzi Khroskyabs is shown in the table below. 

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center

Below are some examples of the direct configuration:

:{||-
| ''ŋô'' || ''nû'' || ''kə-rdû-n'' 
|-
|1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || 2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-go.to.meet.II-2
|-
|colspan=3|"I went to meet you."
|}
:{||-
| ''ŋô'' || ''ætə̂'' || ''kə-rd-ʊ̂ŋ'' 
|-
|1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || 3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-go.to.meet.II-1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=3|"I went to meet her."
|}
:{||-
| ''nû'' || ''ætə̂'' || ''kə-rd-ʊ̂ŋ'' 
|-
|2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || 3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-go.to.meet.II-2
|-
|colspan=3|"You went to meet her."
|}

The inverse configuration:

:{||-
| ''nû=ɣə'' || ''ŋô'' || ''k-u-rd-ʊ̂ŋ'' 
|-
|2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || 1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;INV&lt;/small&gt;-go.to.meet.II-1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=3|"You went to meet me."
|}
:{||-
| ''ætə̂=ɣə'' || ''ŋô'' || ''k-u-rd-ʊ̂ŋ'' 
|-
|3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || 1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;INV&lt;/small&gt;-go.to.meet.II-1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=3|"I went to meet her."
|}
:{||-
| ''ætə̂=ɣə'' || ''nû'' || ''k-u-rdú-n'' 
|-
|3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || 2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;INV&lt;/small&gt;-go.to.meet.II-2
|-
|colspan=3|"She went to meet you."
|}

In 3→3 scenarios, if there is a TAM prefix, the inverse marker must occur, otherwise it does not surface. 

:{||-
| ''tʂɑɕî=ɣə'' || ''srú'' || ''dzî'' 
|-
|Bkrashis=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || meat || eat.I
|-
|colspan=3|"Bkrashis eats meat."
|}
:{||-
| ''tʂɑɕî=ɣə'' || ''srú'' || ''u-dzí'' 
|-
|Bkrashis=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || meat || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;INV&lt;/small&gt;-eat.II
|-
|colspan=3|"Bkrashis ate meat."
|}

Argument indexation in Wobzi Khroskyabs is largely simplified compared to other Khroskyabs dialects. Guanyinqiao, Siyuewu and 'Brongrdzong all present the distinction between singular, dual and plural for first and second persons. The Siyuewu transitive paradigm is illustrated below.

===Stem alternation===

Most Khroskyabs verbs present two stems, a few verbs present three stems, and only a handful have only one stem. Roughly speaking, Stem 1 is used in non-past, Stem 2 in past, and Stem 3 in irrealis contexts. If a verb presents only two stems (without Stem 3), the functions of Stem 3 is covered by Stem 1; and if a verb presents only Stem 1, Stem 1 covers the functions of both Stem 2 and Stem 3. Some verbs may only present Stem 2. 

====Strategies====

In all the Khroskyabs dialects known to us, there are generally 5 strategies of stem alternation: tone alternation (glottal inversion), rime alternation, aspration alternation and suppletion. The following description is mainly based on the Wobzi dialect, if not specifically mentioned differently.

Tone alternation is by far the most common strategy between Stem 1 and Stem 2. For monosyllabic verbs, a simple inversion between the high tone and the high falling tone is observed. If the original tone is high, the Stem 2 will be assigned a falling tone and if the original tone is falling, the Stem 1 will be assigned a high tone. 

''gí'' 'to put on (Stem 1)' → ''gî'' 'to put on (Stem 2)'

''kʰɑ̂'' 'to give (Stem 1)' → ''kʰɑ́'' 'to give (Stem 2)'

As for polysyllabic verbs, there are two situations. If the last syllable has a high tone, it will change to a falling tone in Stem 2, otherwise a high tone is assigned to the last syllable in Stem 2. 

''ɴqʰɑrŋɑ́'' 'to expel (Stem 1)' → ''ɴqʰɑrŋɑ̂'' 'to expel (Stem 2)'

''tɕə̂rə'' 'to tear (Stem 1)' → ''tɕərə́'' 'to tear (Stem 2)'

''ndʐəvɑ̂'' 'to walk (Stem 1)' → ''ndʐəvɑ́'' 'to walk (Stem 2)'

Rime alternation is also widely attested. Rime alternation is usually combined with tone alternation. 

In many cases, only the vowel is changed in Stem 2. 

''lǽ'' 'to release (Stem 1)' → ''lî'' 'to release (Stem 2)'

''mɑ́ɣ'' 'not to be (Stem 1)' → ''mə̂ɣ'' 'not to be (Stem 2)'

In some other cases, the rime in Stem 2 is changed to ''-əɣ'' in spite of the original rime. 

''fsǽ'' 'to be full (Stem 1)' → ''fsə̂ɣ'' 'to be full (Stem 2)'

''ndzræ̂v'' 'to suck (Stem 1)' → ''ndzrə́ɣ'' 'to suck (Stem 2)'

Some Stem 2 forms present open syllables, while their corresponding Stem 1 forms are closed syllables. 

''vʑǽr'' 'to shave (Stem 1)' → ''vʑî'' 'to shave (Stem 2)'

Aspiration alternation is rare. It is only attested in ''(rə-)tô'' 'to come (Stem 1)', whose Stem 2 is ''(rə-)tʰó''. 

Suppletion is found in three-stem verbs. These verbs are motion verbs or conveyance verbs. See the table below. 

{| class="wikitable"
! Stem 1
! Stem 2

|-
| (rə-)və̂
| (rə-)ɕə̂

| (rə-)zə̂m
| to bring
|-
| (rə-)tʰǽ
| (rə-)tʰə̂ɣ
| (rə-)vǽ
| to take
|}

====Functions====
Verb stems usually combine with orientational prefixes to express different properties of tense, aspect, modality and evidentiality. Stem 1 is employed in non-past contexts, Stem 2 in past and perfective contexts and Stem 3 in irrealis contexts. 

A verb in Stem 1 can be used without an orientational prefix for a generic fact. It can also combine with the orientational prefix ''rə-'' in a sensory or inferential non-past context.

:{||-
| ''sú=tə'' || ''rnɑbɑ̂'' || ''dzî'' 
|-
|cattle=&lt;small&gt;DEF&lt;/small&gt; || grass ||  eat.I
|-
|colspan=3|"Cattle eat grass."
|}
:{||-
| ''sú=tə'' || ''rnɑbɑ̂'' || ''r-u-dzî'' 
|-
|cattle=&lt;small&gt;DEF&lt;/small&gt; || grass || &lt;small&gt;NPST-INV-&lt;/small&gt;eat.I
|-
|colspan=3|"The cattle are eating/will eat grass."
|}

Stative verbs distinguish past imperfective from perfective, while dynamic verbs present only a general past tense. Stem 2 is required in these situations. Examples of the Stem 2 of the stative verb ''ndæ̂'' 'to like' is illustrated below. 

:{||-
| ''cə̂=ɣə'' || ''tʂɑɕî'' || ''n-u-ndə̂ɣ'' 
|-
|3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || Bkrashis || &lt;small&gt;IPFV.PST&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;INV&lt;/small&gt;-like.II
|-
|colspan=3|"He liked Bkrashis."
|}
:{||-
|  ''cə̂=ɣə'' || ''tʂɑɕî'' || ''u-ndə̂ɣ'
|-
|3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;=&lt;small&gt;ERG&lt;/small&gt; || Bkrashis || &lt;small&gt;PFV&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;INV&lt;/small&gt;-like.II
|-
|colspan=3|"He turned out to like Bkrashis."
|}

Dynamic verbs do not make the distinction between imperfective and perfective, therefore, their meaning in Stem 2 depends on the context.

:{||-
| ''cə̂'' || ''grə̂mde'' || ''kə-ɕə̂'' 
|-
|3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt; || Thugschen || &lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-go.II
|-
|colspan=3|"He has gone/was going to Thugschen."
|}

[[Verb]]s in the [[Korean language]] come in last place in a clause. Verbs are the most complex part of speech, and a properly conjugated verb may stand on its own as a complete sentence. This article uses the [[Yale romanization of Korean|Yale romanization]] in '''bold''' to show morphology.
&lt;!--

        NOTICE: If you are editing this article to "fix the Romanization", read that last sentence carefully again!

        Feel free to add the Revised Romanization in italics, but kindly don't mess with the bold stuff unless you know how Yale works.  Thanks.

== Classification ==
Korean verbs are typically classified into four categories: action, [[Stative verb|state]] (or description), [[existential clause|existential]], and the [[copula (linguistics)|copulas]].

*Action or processive verbs involve some action or internal movement. For a list of Korean action verbs, see [[wikt:Category:Korean verbs]]
*Stative or descriptive verbs are sometimes called adjectives. For a list of Korean stative verbs, see [[wikt:Category:Korean adjectives]]
*Existential verbs convey the existence of something, or its presence in a particular location or a particular being's possession. This category was created for the verb '''iss ta''' {{lang|ko|있다}} ''itda'' "to exist" and its opposite, '''eps ta''' {{lang|ko|없다}} ''eopda'' "not to exist."
*Copulative verbs allow a non-verb to take verbal endings. In Korean this category was created for the affirmative and negative copula. The affirmative copula is '''i ta''' {{lang|ko|이다}} ''ida'' "to be," and the negative copula '''ani ta''' {{lang|ko|아니다}} ''anida'' "not to be." However, there are many other verbs in Korean that also serve to attach verb endings to nouns, most notably '''ha ta''' {{lang|ko|하다}} ''hada'' "to do."

The distinction between action verbs and descriptive verbs is visible in verb conjugation in a few places. The copulas conjugate like stative verbs, but the existential verbs conjugate like action verbs. Some verbs can be either stative or active, depending on meaning.

== Forms ==
Korean verbs are [[Verb conjugation|conjugated]]. Every verb form in Korean has two parts: a [[verb stem]], simple or expanded, plus a sequence of [[inflectional suffix]]es. Verbs can be quite long because of all the suffixes that mark grammatical contrasts.

A Korean verb root is bound, meaning that it never occurs without at least one [[suffix]]. These suffixes are numerous but regular and ordered. There are over 40 basic endings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Iksop |last1=Lee |first2= S. Robert |last2=Ramsey|title=The Korean Language |location=Albany, NY |publisher=State University of New York Press |date=2000 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over 400 when the combinations of these endings are counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Samuel E. |last1=Martin |title=Reference Grammar of Korean: A Complete Guide to the Grammar and History of the Korean Language |location=Rutland, VT and Tokyo |publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co. |date=1992 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grammatical categories of verb suffixes include [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] (passive or causative), [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (past, present, or future), [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (of an action – complete, experienced, repeated, or continuing), honorification (appropriate choice of suffix following language protocol), and clause-final conjunctives or sentence enders chosen from various speech styles and types of sentences such as interrogative, declarative, imperative, and suggestive.

=== Sound changes ===
A great many verbs change the pronunciation of the final consonant of the root after the addition of a suffix. Some of these changes are the result of regular [[korean phonology#Consonant assimilation|consonant assimilation]] or cluster simplification, but some of them are irregular. The irregular verbs contain root-final consonants that were historically [[lenition|lenited]] and which, as a result disappeared or mutated between vowels but remained next to a consonant.

=== Citation form ===
The [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]] or citation form of a Korean verb is the form that ends in '''ta''' {{lang|ko|다}} ''da''.

=== Infinitive form ===
Besides a verbal root itself that precedes '''ta''' in the citation form, there is also a long stem with an additional harmonic vowel, called by linguist [[Samuel E. Martin]] the "infinitive" form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Samuel E.|title=A Reference Grammar of Korean|year=1992|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Publishing Company Inc.|location=Singapore|isbn=978-0-8048-3771-2|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tense-neutral form also does not express any honorifics and speech levels. Thus they are often used for literary titles, subtitles and chapter titles, since they’re not specifically directed toward an individual or a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Learn Korean Ep. 17: Plain Form |url= http://gobillykorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This so-called infinitive, however, must not be confused with the citation form mentioned above. It is formed by attaching '''{{frac|e|a}}''' {{lang|ko|어/아}} ''eo/a'' to the root, according to [[vowel harmony#Korean|vowel harmony]]. If the verbal root ends in a vowel, the two vowels may merge or contract.

Without vowel contraction
* '''al''' {{lang|ko|알}} ''al'' "know" + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''al.a''' {{lang|ko|알아}} ''ara''
* '''mek''' {{lang|ko|먹}} ''meok'' "eat" + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''mek.e''' {{lang|ko|먹어}} ''meogeo''

With vowel contraction
* '''ka''' {{lang|ko|가}} ''ga'' "go" + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''ka''' {{lang|ko|가}} ''ga''
* '''o''' {{lang|ko|오}} ''o'' "come" + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''wa''' {{lang|ko|와}} ''wa''
* '''se''' {{lang|ko|서}} ''seo'' "stand" + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''se''' {{lang|ko|서}} ''seo'
* '''i''' {{lang|ko|이}} ''i'' (copula) + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''ye''' {{lang|ko|여}} ''yeo''
* '''ssu''' {{lang|ko|쓰}} ''sseu'' "use" + '''{{frac|e|a}}''' → '''sse''' {{lang|ko|써}} ''sseo''

'''toy da''' 되다 ''doeda'' "to become" may or may not undergo contraction. '''ha ta''' 하다 ''hada'' "to do" is irregular.

This infinitive form is not used as a noun, but it can be used in [[compound verb]]s, [[serial verb construction]]s, and before certain (not all) verb endings. It may be compared to the [[Japanese verb conjugation#i form|combining stem]] in Japanese.

=== Finite verb endings ===
Verbs are the most complex part of speech in Korean. Their structure when used as the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of a clause is prefix + root + up to seven suffixes, and can be illustrated with a template:

{| class=wikitable
|+Finite verb template
!Prefix!!0!!I!!II!!III!!IV!!V!!VI!!VII
|-
|[[negation (linguistics)|negative]]*||[[root (linguistics)|ROOT]]||[[valency (linguistics)|valency]]||[[Korean honorifics|honorific]]||[[grammatical tense|tense]]-[[grammatical aspect|aspect]]||[[formality]]||[[grammatical mood|syntactic mood]]||[[pragmatics|pragmatic mood]]||[[politeness|polite]]
|}

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The negative prefix is '''an''' {{lang|ko|안}} "not"; the word '''mos''' {{lang|ko|못}} ''mot'' "can't" also occurs in this position.

'''I''' Valency may be [[grammatical voice|passive]] or [[causative]]. These often involve a stem change, followed by the suffix '''i''' (the spelling of this suffix may change, depending on the stem change of the verb)

'''II''' The honorific suffix is '''-usi''' {{lang|ko|으시}} ''-eusi-'' after a consonant, '''-si''' {{lang|ko|시}} after a vowel. The '''i''' {{lang|ko|ㅣ}} is reduced to a glide before another vowel. For example, with a following past tense, '''sie-ss''' ''-si-eoss-'' reduces to '''sye-ss''' {{lang|ko|셨}} ''-syeoss-.''

:This shows deference towards the topic of the conversation, for example when speaking of one's elders.

'''III''' If there is no suffix in this slot, the verb is in present or [[gnomic tense]]. Future tense &amp; prospective aspect is '''key-ss''' {{lang|ko|겠}} ''-get-,'' past [[perfective aspect|perfective]] is '''-{{frac|e|a}}-ss''' {{lang|ko|었/았}} ''-eot-''/''-at'' but with [[vowel harmony]]. If there is no intervening consonant, this reduces, both in pronunciation and in writing: '''a-ss''' to {{lang|ko|았}} ''at-'', and ''wa-ss'' to {{lang|ko|왔}} ''wat-''. The verb '''o''' {{lang|ko|오}} "to come" is therefore '''wa-ss''' {{lang|ko|왔}} ''wat-'' in the perfective. The verb '''ha''' {{lang|ko|하}} ''ha'' "to do" is an irregular '''hay''' {{lang|ko|했 }} ''hae-'' in the perfective.

:There are also compound tenses: [[remote past tense|remote past]] '''-{{frac|e|a}}-ss-e-ss''' {{lang|ko|었었/았었}} ''-eosseot-''/''-asseot-'', past-future '''-{{frac|e|a}}-ss-key-ss''' {{lang|ko|었겠/았겠}} ''-eotkket-''/''-atkket-'', remote past-future '''-{{frac|e|a}}-sse-ss-key-ss''' {{lang|ko|었었겠/았었겠}} ''-eosseotkket-''/''-asseotkket-''{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}{{fix|text=are these past perfect, future perfective, &amp; ??}}

'''IV''' The formal suffix is '''-p''' {{lang|ko|ᄇ}} after a vowel (it is normally written in the same block as that vowel), '''-sup''' {{lang|ko|습}} ''-seup'' after a consonant in a declarative or interrogative verb, '''-up''' {{lang|ko|읍}} ''-eup'' after a consonant in a proposition. (After a consonant '''s''' or '''ss''' the {{lang|ko|ㅅ}} letter in the suffix drops.)

:This shows deference towards the audience of the conversation, for example when speaking ''to'' one's elders. If speaking both to and of one's elders, one would use both the formal and the honorific suffixes.

'''V''' The syntactic moods, for want of a better term, are the [[indicative mood|indicative]] '''-nun''' {{lang|ko|는}} ''-neun,'' '''-ni''' {{lang|ko|니}}, or '''n''' {{lang|ko|ㄴ}}; the retrospective ([[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]) '''-ten''' {{lang|ko|던}} ''-deon'', '''ti''' {{lang|ko|디}} ''-di'', or '''t''' {{lang|ko|ㄷ}} ''-d-''; and the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] '''si''' {{lang|ko|시}} ''-si'' or '''s''' {{lang|ko|ㅅ}}. None of these are used in the casual or intimate styles, and the formal plain indicative declarative can only occur in the gnomic tense.

:'''-nun''' {{lang|ko|는}} ''-neun'' and '''-ten''' {{lang|ko|던}} ''-deon'' are used in the formal plain and familiar interrogative styles. After a vowel, '''-nun''' {{lang|ko|는}} ''-neun'' reduces to '''n''' {{lang|ko|ㄴ}}. Before declarative '''la''' {{lang|ko|라}} ''ra'', '''-ten''' {{lang|ko|던}} ''-deon'' reduces to '''te''' {{lang|ko|더}} ''-deo.''

:'''-ni''' {{lang|ko|니}}, '''-ti''' {{lang|ko|디}} ''-di'', and '''-si''' {{lang|ko|시}} are used in the formal polite style.

:'''-n''' {{lang|ko|ㄴ}}, '''t''' {{lang|ko|ㄷ}} ''-d-,'' and '''s''' {{lang|ko|ㅅ}} are used in the familiar declarative and subjunctive styles.

'''VI''' The pragmatic moods, for want of a better term, are the [[declarative mood|declarative]] '''-ta''' {{lang|ko|다}} ''-da''  (formal polite), '''-la''' {{lang|ko|라}} ''-ra'' (formal plain), and '''ey''' {{lang|ko|에}} ''-e'' (familiar); [[interrogative mood|interrogative]] '''kka''' {{lang|ko|까}}, '''ya''' {{lang|ko|야}} (formal) and '''-ka''' {{lang|ko|가}} ''-ga'' (familiar); [[propositive mood|propositive]] '''-ta''' {{lang|ko|다}} ''-da'' (formal polite), '''-ca''' {{lang|ko|자}} ''-ja'' (formal plain), and '''ey''' {{lang|ko|에}} ''-e'' (familiar); and the [[imperative mood|imperative]] '''o''' {{lang|ko|오}} (formal polite), '''-{{frac|e|a}} la''' {{lang|ko|어라/아라}} ''-eola''/''-ala'' (formal plain), and '''-key''' {{lang|ko|게}} ''-ge'' (familiar).

:'''Style''': These distinctions are not made in the intimate and casual styles. Instead, this slot is taken by the intimate suffix  '''-{{frac|e|a}}''' {{lang|ko|어}} ''-eo'' ('''a''' {{lang|ko|아}} after an '''a''' {{lang|ko|ㅏ}} or '''o''' {{lang|ko|ㅗ}}) or the casual suffix '''-ci''' {{lang|ko|지}} ''-ji.''

'''VII''' The polite suffix '''yo''' {{lang|ko|요}} ('''-i yo''' {{lang|ko|이요}} after a consonant) appears in the informal styles. It expresses one's relationship to the audience.

== Negative prefixes ==
A verb is typically negated in Korean by using a [[suppletive]] negative form, if it exists, or by putting a negative prefix in front of it.

There are two possible negative prefixes: '''mos''' {{lang|ko|못}} ''mot'', and '''an''' {{lang|ko|안}}. '''mos''' and '''an(i)'''. '''mos''' is used for when a person or animate being subject tries to accomplish an action, that is, begins and is unable to finish it successfully. '''an''' is a more common negative which is used in all other instances. The two prefixes are mutually exclusive.

== Derivational suffixes ==
Derivational endings are attached directly to the verb root, and are followed by the tense suffixes. These derivational suffixes end with the high vowels '''i''' {{lang|ko|ㅣ}} or '''wu''' {{lang|ko|ㅜ}} which is reduced to a glide in the long stem form. For example, with a following past tense, '''-(u)si''' {{lang|ko|(으)시}} ''-(eu)si'' reduces to '''-(u)sye-ss''' {{lang|ko|(으)셨}} ''-(eu)syeot''.

=== Valency ===
[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]] in Korean is partly lexical and partly derivational. Many forms can change their valency by the addition of the [[grammatical voice|passive]] or [[causative]] derivational suffixes, '''-i''' {{lang|ko|이}}, '''-hi''' {{lang|ko|히}}, '''-li''' {{lang|ko|리}} ''-ri'', '''-ki''' {{lang|ko|기}}, '''-wu''' {{lang|ko|우}} ''-u'', '''-kwu''' {{lang|ko|구}} ''-gu'', or '''-chwu''' {{lang|ko|추}} ''-chu'', sometimes with additional changes to the stem.

=== Subject honorific ===
The subject honorific suffix '''-(u)si''' derives an honorific verb, that is, a verb which is used when the subject of a sentence is higher in social status than the speaker. Such verbs are used, for example, when speaking of one's elders, one's social superiors (parents, teachers, bosses), or strangers.

The full form '''-usi''' {{lang|ko|으시}} is only used after a consonant. Otherwise, the initial vowel is absorbed, becoming '''-si'''.

While the honorific suffix is necessary, some verbs have honorific alternatives which must be used in addition to '''-(u)si'''. For instance, '''iss ta''' {{lang|ko|있다}} ''itda'' becomes '''kyey'si ta''' {{lang|ko|계시다}} ''gyesida''.

== Tense and aspect ==
Following the derivational endings, Korean verbs can contain up to three suffixes in a row which represent a combination of tense, aspect, and mood.

=== Past ===
This suffix is an enclitic consonant ''''ss''' {{lang|ko|ㅆ}} after the [[Korean verbs#Infinitive form|infinitive form]] of the verb (ending in '''{{frac|e|a}}'''), forming '''{{frac|e|a}}'ss''' {{lang|ko|았/었}} (the final consonant is pronounced {{IPA|[[s͈]]}} before a vowel and {{IPA|[[t]]}} before a consonant). This suffix, which is conventionally called "past" or "perfective" by various linguists, has many different meanings, depending on the semantics of the verb that it is attached to and the context; it may be a simple past or a present perfect.

Etymologically, ''''ss''' is a contraction of the existential verb '''iss''' {{lang|ko|있}} via vowel absorption. The contracted form '''-{{frac|e|a}} iss''', was originally a present perfect.

=== Remote past ===
A verb can superficially have two copies of the above-mentioned suffix, the second of which, however, is always '''-ess''' {{lang|ko|었}} ''-eot'' and represents a true past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Nam-Il|title=The Double Past in Korean|journal=Foundations of Language|date=March 1975|volume=12|issue=4|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the combination '''{{frac|e|a}}'ss.ess''' {{lang|ko|았었/었었}} ''-eosseot/-asseot''. This combination communicates a more [[grammatical tense|remote past]] or a [[pluperfect|past perfect]].

=== Future ===
The [[Future tense|future]] suffix is '''-keyss''' {{lang|ko|겠}} ''-get'', often used to describe future events. It is used, when the speaker has valid reasons to believe something will be certain to happen. For instance, the suffix is used in broadcasting contexts in Korean such as weather forecasts.

But it may be used together with the perfective and remote past suffixes, or in a present tense context. If used with the perfective suffix, this makes an inferential or conditional past '''-{{frac|e|a}}'ss-keyss''' {{lang|ko|았겠/었겠}} ''-eotget/-atget'' "should have, would have, must have." If used with the remote past suffix it makes an inferential or conditional remote past '''-{{frac|e|a}}'ss-ess-keyss''' {{lang|ko|았었겠/었었겠}} ''-eosseotget''/-''asseotget'', though this is rare. Because this infix is occasionally used for a [[conditional mood|conditional]], or [[inferential mood|inferential]] tense, depending on context it is sometimes called [[irrealis mood|irrealis]].

Etymologically, the future suffix is the result of the merger of a [[resultative]] verb ending '''-key''' {{lang|ko|게}} and the existential root '''iss''' {{lang|ko|있}}, via vowel absorption, as mentioned above. This contraction and change in meaning has its parallel in the future tense of [[Vulgar Latin#Verbs|Vulgar Latin]].

Not all combinations of the suffixes in the template above are possible. The most common sequences after the tense suffix (that is, after the root or honorific '''-usi'''  in the present tense, after the '''-{{frac|e|a}}ss''' or '''-keyss''' in the past and future) are,

The intimate, intimate polite, casual, and casual polite endings are simpler.

=== Formality ===
The formal suffix is '''-(su)p''' {{lang|ko|ᄇ/습}} ''-(seu)p''. The short form is used after a vowel and the long form is used after a consonant. (In the Korean writing system [[hangul]], the {{lang|ko|ㅂ}} is written at the bottom of the previous syllable. In South Korea, after {{lang|ko|ㅅ}} or {{lang|ko|ㅆ}}, the syllable {{lang|ko|습}} ''was'' written as {{lang|ko|읍}}. This rule was modified at the end of the 80s, and {{lang|ko|읍니다}} is not the standard language. So, nowadays, the syllable {{lang|ko|습}} is written as {{lang|ko|습}} as its own pronunciation.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/&lt;/ref&gt; This shows deference towards the audience of the conversation, for example when speaking in a formal situation, such as ''to'' (but not necessarily ''about'') one's elders. If speaking both to and of one's elders, one would use the formal and the honorific suffixes together.

=== Syntactic moods ===
The syntactic moods, for want of a better term, are [[indicative mood|indicative]] '''-nun''' {{lang|ko|는}} ''-neun'', '''-n(i)''' {{lang|ko|니/ㄴ}}; retrospective ([[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]) '''-ten''' {{lang|ko|던}} ''-deon'', '''-t(i)''' {{lang|ko|디/ㄷ}}; and [[jussive mood|jussive]] '''-s(i)'''{{lang|ko|시/ㅅ}}.

None of these are used in the casual or intimate styles, and only the formal plain indicative declarative can occur in the gnomic tense.

=== Pragmatic moods ===
The pragmatic moods, for want of a better term, are the [[declarative mood|declaratives]] '''ta''' {{lang|ko|다}}, '''la''' {{lang|ko|라}}, and '''ey''' {{lang|ko|에}}; [[interrogative mood|interrogatives]] '''kka''' {{lang|ko|까}}, '''ya''' {{lang|ko|야}}, and '''ka''' {{lang|ko|가}}; [[propositive mood|propositive]] '''ta''' {{lang|ko|다}}, '''-ca''' {{lang|ko|자}}, and '''-ey''' {{lang|ko|에}}; and the [[imperative mood|imperative]] '''o''' {{lang|ko|오}}, '''-{{frac|e|a}} la''' {{lang|ko|어라/아라}}, and '''-key''' {{lang|ko|게}}.

These distinctions are not made in the intimate and casual styles. Instead, this place is taken by the intimate suffix  '''-{{frac|e|a}}''' {{lang|ko|어/아}} or the casual suffix '''-ci''' {{lang|ko|지}}.

=== Politeness suffix ===
The polite suffix '''yo''' {{lang|ko|요}} appears in the [[Korean speech levels#Lower levels|lower]] speech levels. It raises the level of politeness of those styles.

== Attributive endings ==
Attributive verb endings modify nouns and take the place of attributive adjectives. Korean does not have [[relative pronoun]]s. Instead, [[attributive verb]]s modify nouns, as adjectives do in English. Where in English one would say "I saw the man '''who''' walks the dog", the structure of Korean is more like "The dog-walking man I saw".

The structure is ROOT + valence + [[attributive]] suffix, with little of the complexity of finite verbs above.

|-
|[[negation (linguistics)|negative]]||[[root (linguistics)|ROOT]]||[[valency (linguistics)|valency]]||[[grammatical tense|tense]]||[[attributive]]&lt;br&gt;(tense)

Active verbs use the attributive suffix '''-un''' {{lang|ko|은}} ''-eun'' after a consonant, or '''-n''' {{lang|ko|ㄴ}} after a vowel, for the past tense. For descriptive or stative verbs, often equivalent to adjectives in English,  this form is used for generic ([[gnomic tense|gnomic]]) descriptions; effectively, "eaten food" is food which once was eaten (past), whereas "a pretty flower" is a flower which has become pretty, and still is (present/timeless). To specify the ongoing action for an active verb, the invariable suffix '''-nun''' {{lang|ko|는}} ''-neun'' is used instead. This is not found on descriptive verbs, as it makes no sense to say that *"a flower is being pretty". For the future, the suffix '''-(u)lq''' {{lang|ko|을/ㄹ}} (''-(eu)l'' with reinforcement of the following consonant) is used, and in the imperfective/retrospective (recalling what once was) it is '''-ten''' {{lang|ko|던}} ''-deon''.

For example, from the verb '''meok''' {{lang|ko|먹}} ''meok'' "to eat", the adjective '''yeyppu''' {{lang|ko|예쁘}} ''yeppeu'' "pretty", and the nouns '''pap''' {{lang|ko|밥}} ''bap'' "cooked rice" and '''kkoch''' {{lang|ko|꽃}} ''kkot'' "flower", we get:

|}

The perfective suffix '''-e-ss''' {{lang|ko|었}} ''-eoss-'' is sometimes used as well, with the same meaning, on active verbs. It precedes the attributive suffix:

*{{lang|ko|먹었던 밥}} '''mek-e-ss-ten pap''' ''meogeotdeon bap'' "cooked rice which had been eaten"

For action verbs, '''-e'ss''' {{lang|ko|었}} is used  for completed actions or processes that result in a present state. The individual verb’s meaning can help determine which interpretation is appropriate. Hence '''kyel.hon-hay'ss ta''' {{lang|ko|결혼했다}} ''gyeorhon haetda'' can mean ‘got married’, focusing on the past event, or ‘is married’, focusing on the present state resulting from the past event. But '''kong ul cha'ss ta''' {{lang|ko|공을 찼다}} ''gong-eul chatda'' ‘kicked the ball’ can only denote a past action and '''cal sayngkye'ss ta''' {{lang|ko|잘 생겼다}} ''jal saenggyeotda'' ‘is handsome’ can only denote the present state. ('''sayngkita''' {{lang|ko|생기다}} ''saenggida'' is an action verb, meaning ‘get formed/created’.)
&lt;!--['''to add''': quotative '''-ula/-la; -ke-na''']--&gt;

== Conjunctive endings ==
Verbs can take [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]] suffixes. These suffixes make subordinate clauses.

One very common suffix '''ko''' {{lang|ko|고}} ''-go'', can be interpreted as a subordinating conjunction. That is, '''mek.ko''' {{lang|ko|먹고}} ''meokko'' means approximately "eating," '''koki'l ul mek.ko''' {{lang|ko|고기를 먹고}} ''gogireul meokko'' means "eating meat," and '''nay ka koki'l ul mek.ko''' {{lang|ko|내가 고기를 먹고}} ''naega gogireul meokko'' means "I eat meat and..." or "My eating meat."

Another suffix, somewhat similar in meaning, is '''se''' {{lang|ko|서}} ''-seo'' which is, however, attached to the long stem of a verb ending in '''-{{frac|e|a}}'''.

Both juxtapose two actions, the action in the subclause and the action in the main clause. The difference between them is that with '''se''' the action in the subclause necessarily came first, while '''-ko''' conveys more of an unordered juxtaposition. '''Se''' is frequently used to imply causation, and in many common expressions like '''manna se pankapsupni ta''' {{lang|ko|만나서 반갑습니다}} ''mannaseo bangapseumnida'' (literally, "Since I met you, I'm happy" or "Having met you, I'm happy"). If '''-ko''' was used instead, the meaning would be closer to "I meet you and I'm happy," that is, without any implied logical connection.

These are both subordinating conjunctive suffixes and can not (in the more formal registers, at least) derive complete sentences of their own without the addition of a main verb, by default the existential verb '''iss ta''' {{lang|ko|있다}} ''itda''.

== Syntax ==
As a typical right-headed [[subject–object–verb]] language, verbs are typically the last element in a Korean sentence, and the only one necessary. That is, a properly conjugated verb can form a sentence by itself. The subject and the object of a sentence are often omitted when these are considered obvious in context. For example, the sentence: '''chac.ass.ta''' {{lang|ko|찾았다!}} ''chajatda!'' ("[I] found [it]!") consists of only a verb because the context in which this sentence would occur makes the identity of the arguments obvious.

'''Käte Bosse-Griffiths''' (16 June 1910 &amp;ndash; 4 April 1998) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who after moving to [[Wales]] became a writer in the [[Welsh language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008|page=337 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Käte Bosse was born in [[Wittenberg]] in Germany in 1910, and although her mother was of [[Jewish]] parentage, she was brought up as a member of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]]. After completing her secondary education in her home town, she was accepted into the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], where she gained a doctorate in Classics and Egyptology in 1935. Soon after. she started work at the Egyptology and Archaeology Department of the [[Berlin State Museums]], but she was dismissed from the post when it was discovered that her mother was a Jew.&lt;ref name="Independent obit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-kate-bossegriffiths-1155460.html | title=Obituary: Kate Bosse-Griffiths | work=[[The Independent]] | author= [[Meic Stephens]] | date=10 April 1998 | accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosse left Germany for Britain and found research work at the [[Petrie Museum]] at the University College London and later at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3822213 Lloyd, Allan B.; 'Kate Bosse-Griffiths'] JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, while at Oxford, as a senior member of [[Somerville College]] she met fellow Egyptologist [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]]. Griffiths, a Welsh and Classics scholar brought up in the [[Rhondda]], was at that time a research student at Oxford, but the two of them returned to the Rhondda and made their home in the village of [[Pentre]]. They married in 1939 and Bosse became Käte Bosse-Griffiths.

During the Second World War, Bosse-Griffiths and her husband set up the [[Cadwgan Circle]] from their home in Pentre, an [[avant-garde]] literary and intellectual group whose members included [[Pennar Davies]] and [[Rhydwen Williams]]. Among these literary Welsh speakers, Bosse-Griffiths found a love of the Welsh language. During the same years in Germany, Bosse-Griffiths's mother died at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], a notorious women's concentration camp. Her brothers Günther and Fritz were both imprisoned, and then served at [[Zöschen]] camp. An order to have them killed  at the end of the war was not carried out.&lt;ref name="Teithiau'r Meddwl"&gt;Bosse-Griffiths,Kate ''Teithiau'r Meddwl'', Y Lolfa, (2004), pp. 7–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Dorothee was imprisoned for six weeks but released.&lt;ref name="Teithiau'r Meddwl"/&gt;

==Academic and literary career==
When her husband became a lecturer at [[Swansea University]], the couple moved to [[Uplands, Swansea|Uplands]] and then [[Sketty]] in [[Swansea]]. Bosse-Griffiths became a member of Swansea Museum, where she was Keeper of Archaeology, a role she would undertake for 25 years. She helped bring Sir [[Henry Wellcome]]'s Egyptian collection, at the time held in storage, to the Department of Classics at Swansea, and would spend the next twenty years researching this 5,000 piece collection. This Wellcome collection is now housed at the Egypt Centre at Swansea University.

Bosse-Griffiths was also a published author. She wrote on German pacifist movements in ''Mudiadau Heddwch yn yr Almaen'' (1942) in the Welsh language, while academic works include her 1955 collection ''Amarna Studies and Other Collected Papers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/griffiths_kate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430080255/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/griffiths_kate.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }} Minnesota State University; Kate Bosse-Griffiths&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosse-Griffiths published scores of articles on archaeological matters. Her literary output of short stories and novels included ''Anesmwyth Hoen'' (1941), ''Fy Chwaer Efa a Storïau Eraill'' (1944), ''Mae'r Galon wrth y Llyw'' (1957; [https://www.honno.co.uk/catalogue/welsh-books/maer-galon-wrth-y-llyw/ reprinted with a new introduction] in 2016 by Honno Welsh Women's Classics), and ''Cariadau'' (1995), and two travel books, ''Trem ar Rwsia a Berlin'' (1962), and ''Tywysennau o'r Aifft'' (1970).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">'''Language learning strategies''' is a term referring to the processes and actions that are consciously deployed by language learners to help them to learn or use a language more effectively.&lt;ref name="Researching language learning strategies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Heath|editor1-last=Paltridge|editor1-first=Brian|editor2-last=Phakiti|editor2-first=Aek|title=Research methods in applied linguistics|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury|chapter=Researching language learning strategies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shatz | first1 = I | year = 2014 | title = Parameters for Assessing the Effectiveness of Language Learning Strategies | url = http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/Parameters-for-Assessing-the-Effectiveness-of-Language-Learning-Strategies.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Language and Cultural Education | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 96–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been defined as ‘thoughts and actions, consciously chosen and operationalized by language learners, to assist them in carrying out a multiplicity of tasks from the very outset of learning to the most advanced levels of target language performance’.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=Strategies in learning and using a second language|date=2011|publisher=Longman|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term language ''learner'' strategies, which incorporates strategies used for language learning and language use, is sometimes used, although the line between the two is ill-defined as moments of second language use can also provide opportunities for learning.&lt;ref name="Researching language learning strategies" /&gt;

==History==
Language learning strategies were first introduced  to the [[second language]] literature in 1975, with research on the [[good language learner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Joan|title=What the good language learner can teach us|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=9|issue=1|pages=41–51|doi=10.2307/3586011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was thought that a better understanding of strategies deployed by successful learners could help inform teachers and students alike of how to teach and learn languages more effectively. Initial studies aimed to document the strategies of good language learners. In the 80s the emphasis moved to classification of language learning strategies. Strategies were first classified according to whether they were direct or indirect, and later they were strategies divided into cognitive, [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] or affective/social categories.&lt;ref name="O'Malley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Malley|first1=J|last2=Chamot|first2=A|title=Learning Strategies in Second Language Acquisition|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Rebecca Oxford published her landmark book "Language Learning Strategies: What Every Teacher Should Know" which included the "Strategy Inventory for Language Learning" or "SILL", a questionnaire&lt;ref name="Oxford 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oxford|first1=Rebecca|title=Language Learning Strategies: What Every Teacher Should Know|date=1990|publisher=Newbury House Publisher|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used in a great deal of research in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Controversy over basic issues such as [[definition]] grew stronger in the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, with some researchers&lt;ref name="Macaro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macaro|first1=Ernesto|title=Strategies for language learning and for language use: Revising the theoretical framework|journal=Modern Language Journal|volume=90|issue=3|pages=320–337|date=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2006.00425.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving up trying to define the concept in favour of listing essential characteristics. Others&lt;ref name="Dornyei"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dornyei|first1=Zoltan|title=The Psychology of the Language Learner: Individual Differences in Second Language Acquisition|date=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|url=http://vulms.vu.edu.pk/Courses/ENG504/Downloads/[]_The_Handbook_of_Second_Language_Acquisition(BookZZ.org).pdf#page=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; abandoned the strategy term in favour of "[[Self-regulated learning|self regulation]]".

==Classification of language learning strategies==

===O'Malley and Chamot classification===
In 1990, O'Malley and Chamot&lt;ref name="O'Malley"/&gt; developed a classification of three types of language learning strategies:
*Metacognitive strategies, which involved thinking about (or knowledge of) the learning process, planning for learning, monitoring learning while it is taking place, or self-evaluation of learning after the task had been completed.
*Cognitive strategies, which involved mental manipulation or transformation of materials or tasks, intended to enhance comprehension, acquisition, or retention.
*Social/affective strategies, which consisted of using social interactions to assist in the comprehension, learning or retention of information. As well as the mental control over personal affect that interfered with learning.
This model was based on [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]], which was commended, but it was also criticized for the ad hoc nature of its third category.&lt;ref name="Dornyei"/&gt;

===Oxford taxonomy===
Also in 1990, Rebecca Oxford developed a taxonomy for categorizing strategies under six headings:&lt;ref name="Oxford 1990"/&gt;
*Cognitive—making associations between new and already known information;
*Mnemonic—making associations between new and already known information through use of formula, phrase, verse or the like;
*Metacognitive—controlling own cognition through the co-ordination of the planning, organization and evaluation of the learning process;
*Compensatory—using context to make up for missing information in reading and writing;
*Affective—regulation of emotions, motivation and attitude toward learning;
*Social—the interaction with other learners to improve language learning and cultural understanding.
In later years this classification system was criticized for its problems in separating mnemonic stratgeies from cognitive strategies, when one is a sub-category of the other,&lt;ref name="Dornyei"/&gt; and the inclusion of compensatory strategies, which are connected to how a learner uses the language, rather than learns it.

===Recent research===
More recent research has examined language learner strategies in more context-specific situations,&lt;ref name="Rose 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Heath|title=Language learning strategy research: Where do we go from here?|journal=Studies in Self Access Learning|date=2012|volume=3|issue=2|pages=137–148|url=http://sisaljournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rose.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than catch-all categories. That is, when learners study academic writing, for example, they are likely to deploy a different set of strategies than if they were to study daily conversation. The terms cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies remain common in strategy research, but others related to managing a learners' own affective state or social environment have been examined under the umbrella term self-regulation.&lt;ref name="Researching language learning strategies"/&gt;

==Controversies==
First, although originally promoted as a means of helping students to achieve success in language learning, a synthesis of historical research on language learning strategies has produced conflicting results on the relationship between strategies and language learning success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macaro|first1=Ernesto|editor1-last=Macaro|editor1-first=Ernesto|title=Continuum Companion to Second Language Acquisition, Continuum|date=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=London|chapter=The relationship between strategic behaviour and language learning success}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, much of the research that emerged in the 1990s included numerous conflicting studies based on use of the SILL as a research instrument, of which very few met rigorous research criteria.&lt;ref name="Rose 2012"/&gt;

A second problem associated with researching language learner strategies is the definitional fuzziness of major concepts in the field.&lt;ref name="Researching language learning strategies"/&gt; Researchers in field, such as Ernesto Macaro argue there is a lack of consensus of: 
*Whether strategies occur inside or outside of the brain;
*Whether learner strategies consist of knowledge, intention, action or all three;
*Whether to classify strategies in frameworks, hierarchies [or clusters]; 
*Whether strategies survive across all learning situations, tasks and contexts;
*Whether they are integral or additive to language processing.&lt;ref name="Macaro"/&gt;
Due to the definitional fuzziness of language learning strategies, critics have argued the whole field should be replaced with the psychological concept of [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="Dornyei"/&gt; However, language learning strategy researchers have argued that replacing the field would be a matter of 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Heath|title=Reconceptualizing strategic learning in the face of self-regulation: Throwing language learning strategies out with the bathwater|journal=Applied Linguistics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=92–98|date=2012|doi=10.1093/applin/amr045}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it throws away 30 years of research because of definitional issues. It has also been argued that self-regulation and language learning strategies are measuring different parts of the learning process, and thus can be used in tandem to observe a more accurate picture of how learners learn a second language.&lt;ref name="Rose 2012"/&gt;

Interest in the potential of strategies to promote learning remains strong, however, as evidenced from recent books on the topic,&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oxford|first1=Rebecca|title=Teaching and Researching Language Learning Strategies|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number of special issues of academic journals on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Special issue on Strategies and Self-Regulation in Self-Access Learning|journal=Studies in Self Access Learning|date=2012|volume=3|issue=4|url=http://sisaljournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/sisal-journal-volume-3-issue-4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Oxford|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Griffiths|editor2-first=Carol|title=Language Learning Strategy Research in the Twenty-First Century: Insights and Innovations|journal=System|volume=43|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0346251X/43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particularly important question for educators is  whether learners can benefit from strategy instruction, both in terms of improved linguistic outcomes and improved self-efficacy for learning.  For example, in a study within the context of England, Graham and Macaro (2008) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Suzanne|last2=Macaro, E|date=2008|title=Strategy instruction in listening for lower-intermediate learners of French|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00478.x/abstract|journal=Language Learning|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00478.x|pmid=|access-date=12 May 2016|volume=58|pages=747–783}}&lt;/ref&gt; found improved listening skills and improved self-efficacy for listening among learners of French who had received instruction in listening strategies.  Another important question is also the extent to which teachers have knowledge and understanding of how to incorporate language learning strategies into their teaching, with research indicating that this is an area for development .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies for second language listening:Current scenarios and improved pedagogy.|last=Graham|first=Suzanne|last2=Santos, D|publisher=Palgrave|year=2015|isbn=|location=Basingstoke|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
Language learning strategies has naturally strong links to the fields of [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulation]], [[self-directed learning]], and [[learner autonomy]] as they share core notions of independent learning, learner-centredness, and the necessity for learners to exercise responsibility for their own learning.&lt;ref name="Rose 2012"/&gt;

{{Culture of Romania}}

In Romania there are several spoken languages. Beside  [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the countrywide official language, other spoken languages are spoken and sometimes co-official at a local level. These languages include [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]].

==Official language==
{{main|Romanian language}}
According to the 2002 Romanian Census, Romanian is spoken by 91% of the population as a primary language. According to the Romanian Constitution &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=1 |title=Constitutia României |website=Cdep.ro |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law 1206 of 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dri.gov.ro/documents/li_h1206.pdf#page=3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221075455/http://www.dri.gov.ro/documents/li_h1206.pdf#page=3 |date=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the official language in Romania is Romanian both at the national and local level.

==Minority languages==
[[Image:Romania harta etnica 2011.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Ethnic composition of Romania. Localities with Hungarian majority or [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] are shown in dark green.]]
After the fall of [[Communist Romania|Romania's communist government]] in 1989, the various minority languages have received more rights, and Romania currently has extensive laws relating to the rights of minorities to use their own language in local administration and the judicial system.

While Romanian is the only official language at the national and local level, there are 14 other living languages in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=RO |title=Romania : Languages of Romania |website=Ethnologue.com |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian laws include linguistic rights for all minority groups that form over 20% of a locality's population. This includes the adoption of signage in minority languages, access to local administration and justice systems, the right to receive education in that language, and a series of other rights.

===Hungarian===
{{main|Hungarian minority in Romania}}
Hungarian is the largest minority language in Romania: the 2011 census listed 1,227,623 native Hungarian speakers in the country, or 6.1% of the total population. This minority largely lives in [[Transylvania]], which was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until 1918 ([[Northern Transylvania]] was part of Hungary again between 1940 and 1947) though there are Hungarian speaking minorities in other parts of the country as well.

===Romani===
{{main|Roma minority in Romania}}
[[Image:Budeşti.JPG|thumb|150px|left|The location of Budești within [[Călărași County]] and of Călărași County within Romania.]]
[[Roma people|Roma]] make up the second largest minority in Romania and 241,617 [[Romani language|Romani]] speakers were reported in the 2002 census, or 1.1% of the total population. Dialects of Romani spoken include [[Balkan Romani]], [[Vlax Romani]], and [[Carpathian Romani]]. Romani is used in local signage, administration, education and justice in 79 [[Communes of Romania|communes]] and one town ([[Budești]]).

===Ukrainian===
{{main|Ukrainians of Romania}}
There are 57,593 Ukrainian speakers in Romania, mostly concentrated in [[Maramureș County]], where they make up 6.67% of the population, but also in [[Suceava County|Suceava]] and [[Timiș County|Timiș]] counties. Ukrainians make up the majority in four communes: [[Bistra, Maramureș]], [[Rona de Sus]], [[Știuca]] and [[Copăcele]].

===German===
{{main|Germans of Romania}}
[[Image:SibiuHermannstadtSchild.jpg|thumb|right|150px|German/Romanian signage in [[Sibiu]] (known as Hermannstadt in German), home of the [[Transylvanian Landler]].]]
There are many different groups of Germans in Romania, the largest of whom have historically been known as the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and the [[Banat Swabians]]. Germans once constituted a much larger portion of the Romanian population than they do today, though they are still the fourth largest ethno-linguistic group. In 1938 there were 780,000, and in 1992 there were 111,301, but the 2002 census reported only 45,129 Germans. Since 1989 they have been represented by the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]], which functions in the German language.

===Russian===
[[Image:Tulcea.png|thumb|left|150px|Tulcea County, where most Romanian Lipovans live.]]
There are 29,890 [[Lipovans]], ethnically Russian emigrants from the Russian Empire who left because of religious differences with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], in Romania. They mostly speak the [[Russian language]], and most live in [[Tulcea County]].

===Turkic languages===
====Turkish====
{{main|Turks of Romania}}
[[Turkish language|Turkish]] speakers make up 0.1% of the population, with a community of some 28,714 speakers. The Turkish speaking community is largely a legacy of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule of a large part of Romania. They live in the southern parts of Romania ([[Dobrudja]]).

====Tatar====
{{main|Tatars of Romania}}
[[Tatars]] also make up roughly 0.1% of the Romanian population, with a community of 21,482 speakers. Most [[Crimean Tatars]] speak the [[Crimean Tatar language]], and the greater part of the community lives in [[Constanța County]].

===Other languages===
[[Image:South slavs romania.png|thumb|right|150px|Communities of South Slavs in Romania]]
Lesser spoken languages in Romania include: [[Serbo-Croatian]] (26,732: 20,377 [[Serbian people|Serbians]], 6,355 [[Croatian people|Croatians]]), [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (16,108), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (6,747), [[Greek language|Greek]] (4,146).

The use of [[French language|French]] developed among Romanian elites from the 18th century, and today around a quarter of Romanians have studied French.  Since 1993, Romania has been a member of [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] despite not having a native French-speaking population or ever being part of any French empire.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
Before [[World War II]], Livvi-Karelian was spoken both in [[Russia]] and in [[Finland]], in the easternmost part of [[Finnish Karelia]]. After Finland was forced to cede large parts of Karelia to the [[USSR]] after the war, the Finnish Livvi-Karelian population was resettled in Finland. Today there are still native speakers of Livvi-Karelian living scattered throughout Finland, but all areas in which Livvi-Karelian remain a community language are found in Russia.

Speakers of Livvi-Karelian may be found mainly in [[Olonetsky District|Olonetsky]], Pryazhinsky, Pitkyarantsky, and partly Suoyarvsky [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of Karelia|districts of the Republic of Karelia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livviki.karelia.ru/language/ "Karelian Language"], at the website about livvic culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Livvi-Karelian long remained relatively uninfluenced by the [[Russian language]] despite the large influx of [[Russians]] following the founding of [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1703.

'''Manoranjan Bhattacharya''' (1903–1939 in [[Faridpur-Durgapur (community development block)|Faridpur]]),  wrote Bengali children's literature.&lt;ref name="Sengupta1998"&gt;{{cite book|first=Subodhchandra |last=Sengupta|title=Sansad Bangali charitabhidhan|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=MTretgAACAAJ}}|year=1998|publisher=Sahitya Samsad|isbn=978-81-85626-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Manoranjan studied in Hindu School &amp; [[Presidency College, Calcutta]]. He earned a first-class first in Economics and Political Science followed by an M.A. &amp; B.L. Degree. He served as a professor at [[Ripon College, Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="Sengupta1998"/&gt;

==Literary works==

Manoranjan was a very special student from his very early childhood. He mastered Sanskrit Panini Grammar at an early age at his village School at Faridpur (now in Bangladesh) learning on his own. The Sanskrit College, Calcutta, in those days, used to hold Debate Competition on different subjects, depending on age and study-levels from Schools and Colleges boys. The main condition of the competition was that the students will have to speak strictly in Sanskrit only. The lowest category was "All Bengal Class-X" . While studying in Class VIII Manoranjan had a strong desire to join this debate competition at All Bengal Class-X level. He approached the Head Master of his School (Krishnanagar Collegiate School) to nominate his name as a competitor.
The head Master was very much doubtful looking at Manoranjan's age. But after long persuasion, Manoranjan managed to get an approval and an invitation from the Sanskrit College authority to take part in the competition, finally winning it.

As a student, Manoranjan contributed poems to various magazines. He switched to literature for youngsters after ''Ramdhanu'' was born (1928).

His father, District Magistrate Bishweshwar Bhattacharya, founded the teen periodical, ''Ramdhanu'' ('The Rainbow').&lt;ref&gt;from the 'Ramdhanu' post of the '''Manoranjan Museum''' blog : http://manoranjan-museum.blogspot.in/2015/12/Ramdhanu.html&lt;/ref&gt; For eight years until his untimely demise, he took over editorship from Bishweshwar. His teen detective fiction, starring the Japanese sleuth [[Hukakasi]], deviated from the prevalent sensational, melodramatic style, and was admired by the likes of [[Premendra Mitra]] and [[Satyajit Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;from the 'Hukakashi' post of the '''Manoranjan Museum''' blog : http://manoranjan-museum.blogspot.in/2015/12/Hukakashi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Manoranjan filled the pages of ''Ramdhanu'' with school stories, humorous tales, poems and informative articles. He penned a series of humorous pseudo-mythological sketches, later labelled ''Nutan Puraan''.&lt;ref&gt;from the 'Nutan Puraan Tales' post of the '''Manoranjan Museum''' blog : http://manoranjan-museum.blogspot.in/2015/12/Nutan-Puraan-Tales.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other story anthologies include ''Chaayer Dhnowaa'', ''Haashyo O Rahashyo'', ''Apriloshyo Prothom Dibawshey'' (co-authored with [[Shibram Chakraborty]]). His major works, including three Hukakashi novels and five short stories,&lt;ref&gt;from the 'Hukakashi Short Stories' post of the '''Manoranjan Museum''' blog : http://manoranjan-museum.blogspot.in/2015/12/Hukakashi-Short-Stories.html&lt;/ref&gt; a translation of [[The Channings (novel)|The Channings]]&lt;ref&gt;from the 'Translated Novel' post of the '''Manoranjan Museum''' blog : http://manoranjan-museum.blogspot.in/2015/12/Translated-Novel.html&lt;/ref&gt; were anthologized in Manoranjan Bhattacharya's ''Chhotoder Omnibus''.

Author and younger brother Kshitindranarayan followed him as editor of ''Ramdhanu''.

The '''Mesha Stele''', also known as the '''Moabite Stone''', is a [[stele]] (inscribed stone) set up around 840 BCE by King [[Mesha]] of [[Moab]] (a kingdom located in modern [[Jordan]]). Mesha tells how [[Chemosh]], the god of Moab, had been angry with his people and had allowed them to be subjugated to Israel, but at length Chemosh returned and assisted Mesha to throw off the yoke of Israel and restore the lands of Moab. Mesha describes his many building projects.{{sfn|Rollston|2010|p=53–54}} Some say it is written in the [[Phoenician alphabet]], but others say it is written in the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Old Hebrew script]], which is closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kx9Uke_IfloC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22mesha+stele%22+%22old+hebrew+script%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6qlNcQrOLw&amp;sig=Ov4ZKb9G6BFm8jVQ86l5EaO6-44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI2InSn5zYAhUP3GMKHaAjCh8Q6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mesha%20stele%22%20%22old%20hebrew%20script%22&amp;f=false|title=Writing and Literacy in the World of Ancient Israel: Epigraphic Evidence from the Iron Age|last=Rollston|first=Chris A.|date=2010|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|year=|isbn=9781589831070|location=|pages=54|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was discovered intact by [[Frederick Augustus Klein]], an [[Anglican]] missionary, at the site of ancient [[Dibon]] (now [[Dhiban, Jordan]]), in August 1868. Klein was led to it by a local [[Bedouin]], although neither of them could read the text.&lt;ref name=Lemaire1994&gt;[[André Lemaire]] [http://www.cojs.org/pdf/house_of_david.pdf "'House of David' Restored in Moabite Inscription"] ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 20:03 (May/June 1994) — ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140914000354/http://www.cojs.org/pdf/house_of_david.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, amateur explorers and archaeologists were scouring the [[Levant]] for evidence proving the [[Bible]]'s historicity. News of the finding set off a race between France, Britain and Germany to acquire the piece. A [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeeze"]] (a [[papier-mâché]] impression) had been obtained by a local Arab on behalf of [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]], an archaeologist based in the French consulate in Jerusalem. The next year, the Stele was smashed into several fragments by the [[Bani Hamida]] tribe; seen as an act of defiance against the Ottoman authorities who had pressured the Bedouins to hand over the Stele so that it could be given to Germany. Clermont-Ganneau later managed to acquire the fragments and piece them together thanks to the impression made before the Stele's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-what-yahweh-s-first-appearance-in-history-tells-us-about-early-judaism-1.6469415|title=When God Wasn't So Great: What Yahweh’s First Appearance Tells About Early Judaism|work=Haaretz|accessdate=11 October 2018|date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mesha stele, the longest [[Iron Age]] inscription ever found in the region, constitutes the major evidence for the [[Moabite language]], and is a "corner-stone of Semitic epigraphy,"{{sfn|Albright|1945|p=250|ps=: "The Moabite Stone remains a corner-stone of Semitic epigraphy and Palestinian history"}} and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Ronald|title=The Structure of Ancient Arguments: Rhetoric and Its Near Eastern Origin|date=1986|publisher=Shapolsky / Steinmatzky|location=New York|isbn=9780933503342|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stele, whose story parallels, with some differences, an episode in the Bible's [[Books of Kings]] (2 Kings 3:4–8), provides invaluable information on the Moabite language and the political relationship between Moab and Israel at one moment in the 9th century BCE.{{sfn|Rollston|2010|p=54}} It is the most extensive inscription ever recovered that refers to the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] (the "House of Omri"); it bears the earliest certain extra-biblical reference to the Israelite god [[Yahweh]], and—if French scholar [[André Lemaire]]'s reconstruction of a portion of line 31 is correct—the earliest mention of the "House of [[David]]" (i.e., the [[kingdom of Judah]]).&lt;ref name=Lemaire1994/&gt; It is also one of four known contemporary inscriptions containing the name of Israel, the others being the [[Merneptah Stele]], the [[Tel Dan Stele]], and the [[Kurkh Monolith]].{{sfn|Lemche|1998|pp=46, 62|ps=: “ No other inscription from Palestine, or from Transjordan in the Iron Age, has so far provided any specific reference to Israel... The name of Israel was found in only a very limited number of inscriptions, one from Egypt, another separated by at least 250 years from the first, in Transjordan. A third reference is found in the stele from Tel Dan - if it is genuine, a question not yet settled. The Assyrian and Mesopotamian sources only once mentioned a king of Israel, Ahab, in a spurious rendering of the name.”}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeir|first=Aren|year=|title=Maeir, A. M. 2013.

Thereafter, no reference to either Judah or Israel appears until the ninth century. The pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak; see SHESHONQ I–VI) mentions neither entity by name in the inscription recording his campaign in the southern Levant during the late tenth century. In the ninth century, Israelite kings, and possibly a Judaean king, are mentioned in several sources: the Aramaean stele from Tel Dan, inscriptions of SHALMANESER III of Assyria, and the stela of Mesha of Moab.

The stele is currently on display in France at the [[Louvre]] museum and [[Jordan]] has demanded its return.&lt;ref&gt;http://jordantimes.com/news/local/centre-planning-protest-demand-return-mesha-stele-louvre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and discovery==
The stele is a smoothed block of [[basalt]] approximately one meter tall, 60&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 60&amp;nbsp;cm thick, bearing a surviving inscription of 34 lines.{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|p=95}}

On 8 February 1870, [[George Grove]] of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] announced the find of the stele in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', attributing the discovery to [[Charles Warren]]. On 17 February 1870, the 24-year-old Clermont-Ganneau published the first detailed announcement of the stele in the Revue de l’Instruction Publique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/pefqs/1869-71_169.pdf "The Moabite Stone, With An Illustration", Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement 2.5 (1 Jan. – 31 March 1870): 169–183.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed a month later by a letter from [[Frederick Augustus Klein]] published in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', describing his discovery of the stele in August 1868:

{{quote box
 |title = Excerpts from Klein's description of the discovery of the Stele
 |quote =
&lt;poem&gt;... I afterwards ascertained that [Ganneau's] assertion as to no European having, before me, seen the stone was perfectly true. ... I am sorry to find that I was also the last European who had the privilege of seeing this monument of Hebrew antiquity in its perfect state of preservation. ...
... The stone was lying among the ruins of Dhiban perfectly free and exposed to view, the inscription uppermost. ...
... The stone is, as appears from the accompanying sketch, rounded on both sides, and not only at the upper end as mentioned by Monsieur Ganneau. In the lower corner sides there are not as many words of the inscription missing as would be the case if it were square at the bottom, as M. Ganneau was wrongly informed by his authority; for, as in the upper part, so also in the lower, in exactly the same way the lines become smaller by degrees....
...according to my calculation, had thirty-four lines, for the two or three upper lines were very much obliterated. The stone itself was in a most perfect state of preservation not one single piece being broken off, and it was only from great age and exposure to the rain and sun, that certain parts, especially the upper and lower lines, had somewhat suffered.

In November 1869 the stele was broken by the local Bedouin tribe (the [[Bani Hamida]]) after the Ottoman government became involved in the ownership dispute.{{sfn|Ginsberg|1871|p=13}} The previous year the [[Bani Hamida]] had been defeated by an expedition to [[Balqa]] led by Reşid Pasha, the [[Syria Vilayet|Wali of Damascus]]. Knowing that a demand to give up the stone to the German Consulate had been ordered by the Ottomans, and finding that the ruler of [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] was about to put pressure upon them, they heated the stele in a bonfire, threw cold water upon it and broke it to pieces with boulders.{{sfn|King|1878|p=20}}

A "squeeze" (a [[papier-mâché]] impression) of the full stele had been obtained just prior to its destruction. Ginsberg's translation{{sfn|Ginsberg|1871|p=13}} of the official report, "Ueber die Auffindung der Moabitischen Inschrift,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/21524 Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, Bd. 24 (1870)]&lt;/ref&gt; stated that Ganneau sent an Arab named Yacoub Caravacca to obtain the squeeze as he "did not want to venture to undertake the very costly [and dangerous] journey" himself.{{sfn|Ginsberg|1871|p=13–14}} Caravacca was injured by the local Bedouin while obtaining the squeeze, and one of his two accompanying horsemen protected the squeeze by tearing it still damp from the stone in seven fragments before escaping.{{sfn|King|1878|p=20}}

Pieces of the original stele containing most of the inscription, 613 letters out of about a thousand, were later recovered and pieced together. Of the existing stele fragments, the top right fragment contains 150 letters, the bottom right fragment contains 358 letters, the middle-right contains 38, and the rest of the fragments contain 67 letters.{{sfn|Ginsberg|1871|p=15}} The remainder of the stele was reconstructed by Ganneau from the squeeze obtained by Caravacca.{{sfn|Ginsberg|1871|p=15}}

* Mesha's victories over Omri's son (not named) and the men of [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]] at [[Ataroth]], [[Nabau|Nebo]] and Jehaz;

There is no authoritative full edition of the Moabite inscription.{{sfn|Parker|1997|p=44}} The translation used here is that published by James King (1878), based on translations by M. Ganneau and Dr. Ginsberg.{{sfn|King|1878|p=55-58}} Line numbers added to the published version have been removed.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad,&lt;ref&gt;This reading of Mesha's father name, quoted here for copyright reasons, is no longer accepted. In light of the [[El-Kerak Inscription]], the common reading is now "kmš[yt]", i.e. "Chemosh-yt", the second element perhaps vocalized ''yat'' or ''yatti'' (''yatti'' might be short for ''yattin'', a verbal form derived from Semitic root ''ntn'', "to give").&lt;/ref&gt; king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned after my father. And I have built this sanctuary for [[Chemosh]] in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, and made me look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and in the days of his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, And I took it, for Chemosh restored it in my days. Wherefore I made.... ...year...and I....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpretation==

===Analysis===
[[File:P1120871 Louvre stèle de Mésha AO5066 détail rwk.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Detail of a portion of lines 12–16, reconstructed from the squeeze. The middle line (14), transliterated as "את. נבה. על. ישראל" reads "Take [[Nabau]] against [[Israel]]"]]
The Mesha stele is the longest Iron Age inscription ever found in the region, the major evidence for the Moabite language, and a unique record of military campaigns. The occasion was the erection of a sanctuary for Kemosh in Qarho, the acropolis (citadel) of Dibon, Mesha's capital, in thanks for his aid against Mesha's enemies. Kemosh is credited with an important role in the victories of Mesha, but is not mentioned in connection with his building activities, reflecting the crucial need to give recognition to the nation's god in the life and death national struggle. The fact that the numerous building projects would have taken years to complete suggests that the inscription was made long after the military campaigns, or at least most of them, and the account of those campaigns reflects a royal ideology which wishes to present the king as the obedient servant of the god. The king also claims to be acting in the national interest by removing Israelite oppression and restoring lost lands, but a close reading of the narrative leaves it unclear whether all the conquered territories were  previously Moabite – in three campaign stories there is no explicit reference to prior Moabite control.{{sfn|Parker|1997|pp=44–58}}

===Parallel to 2 Kings 3===
The inscription seems to parallel an episode in {{bibleverse|2|Kings|3|NIV}}: [[Jehoram of Israel]] makes an alliance with [[Jehoshaphat]] king of Judah and an unnamed king of [[Edom]] (south of Judah) to put down his rebellious vassal Mesha; the three kings have the best of the campaign until Mesha, in desperation, sacrifices to his god Kemosh either his eldest son or the eldest son of the king of Edom; the sacrifice turns the tide, "there came great wrath against Israel", and Mesha apparently achieves victory. This apparent correspondence is the basis of the usual dating of the inscription to about 840 BCE, but [[André Lemaire]] has cautioned that the identification is not certain and the stele may be as late as 810 BCE.&lt;ref name=Lemaire2007&gt;[[André Lemaire]]  [https://books.google.com/books?id=kcVmBAEo5rcC&amp;pg=PA135 The Mesha Stele and the Omri Dynasty] in ''Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omri Dynasty'', Edited by Lester L. Grabbe. Continuum International Publishing Group. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed references to David and "House of David"===
The discovery of the [[Tel Dan Stele]] led to a reevaluation of the Mesha Stele by some scholars. In 1994, [[André Lemaire]] reconstructed BT[D]WD as "House of David", meaning Judah,&lt;ref name=Lemaire1994/&gt; in line 31. This section is badly damaged, but appears to tell of Mesha's reconquest of the southern lands of Moab, just as the earlier part dealt with victories in the north. Line 31 says that he captured Horonen from someone who was occupying it. Just who the occupants were is unclear. The legible letters are BT[*]WD, with the square brackets representing a damaged space that probably contained just one letter. This is not universally accepted—Nadav Na'aman, for instance, reads it as BT[D]WD[H], "House of Daodoh", a local ruling family;{{sfn|Green|2010|p=118 fn.84}} but if Lemaire is correct, then this is the earliest evidence of the existence of the Judean kingdom and its Davidic dynasty.

In 2001 Anson Rainey proposed that a two-word phrase in line 12—'R'L DWDH—should be read as a reference an "altar hearth of David" at Ataroth, one of the towns captured by Mesha.{{sfn|Rainey|2001|p=300–306}} The sentence reads: "I (i.e., Mesha) carried from there (Atartoth) the 'R'L of its DWD (or: its 'R'L of DVD) and I dragged it before Kemosh in Qeriot". The meaning of both words is unclear. One line of thought sees 'R'L as the name of a man (literally "El is my light") and translates DWD as "defender", so that the sense of the passage is that Mesha, having conquered Ataroth, dragged its "defender", whose name was "El is my light", to the altar of Kemosh, where he was presumably sacrificed.{{sfn|Lipiński|2006|p=339–340}} It seems more likely that some kind of cult-vessel is meant, and other suggestions have included "the lion-statue of its beloved", meaning the city god.{{sfn|Schmidt|2006|p=315}}

===Authenticity===
The stele is regarded as genuine by the vast majority of biblical archaeologists today, on the basis that there were no other inscriptions of comparable age known to scholars at the time.{{sfn|Albright|1945|pp=248–249|ps=: "In the first place, no inscription of comparable age was then known, and it would, accordingly, have been impossible for the greatest scholar of the day to have divined the true forms of characters in use in the third quarter of the ninth century B. C. E… It is very easy to determine the exact state of knowledge at that time by examining [[:de: Paul Schröder (Philologe)|Schroder]]’s handbook, ''Die phonizische Sprache'', and Levy’s monograph, ''Siegel und Gemmen'', both of which appeared in 1869. No lapidary Hebrew or Canaanite inscription antedating the sixth century (reign of [[Psamtik II|Psammetichus II]]) was then known, aside from the still unintelligible [[Nora Stone|Nora]] and Boss inscriptions and a few Old-Hebrew seals which could not then be dated at all. Since the forms of characters changed rapidly between cir. 900 and cir. 590 B. C. E., there was thus no possible way of knowing what the alphabet of Mesha's time might be. Now we have many inscriptions dating from between cir. 850 and 750 B. C. E., some of which, like the nearly contemporary [[Kilamuwa Stele|stele of Kilamuwa of Sham'al]], the Hazael inscription from [[Arslan Tash]], and the [[Stele of Zakkur|Ben-hadad stele]], resemble the Mesha Stone very closely in script. Some of the forms of characters had not then been found in any documents.  It was thus humanly impossible for the Mesha Stone to be forged.}} Back then, the [[Assyrian lion weights]] were the oldest Phoenician-style inscription that had been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rawlinson (1865), [https://archive.org/details/jstor-25207655 Bilingual Readings: Cuneiform and Phœnician. Notes on Some Tablets in the British Museum, Containing Bilingual Legends (Assyrian and Phœnician)], "Before concluding my notes on these tablet and seal legends, I would observe that they are among the most ancient specimens that we possess of Phoenician writing. I should select as the earliest specimens of all, the legends on the larger Lion Weights in the British Museum, one of which is clearly dated from the reign of Tiglath Pileser II. (b.c. 744–726). The other weights bear the royal names of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the discovery of the stele, a number of scholars questioned its authenticity, including [[Leopold Zunz]],&lt;ref name=Lowy1&gt;Albert Löwy, A critical examination of the so-called Moabite inscription in the Louvre, 1903, 3rd issue rev. and amended, p31: "In the domain of [[Semitology]] the prominent critics, Professor Steinschneider and the late Dr. Zunz, were almost the only scholars who, when asked for their opinion, expressed their strong doubts about the authenticity of the Moabite Inscription".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moritz Steinschneider]],&lt;ref name=Lowy1/&gt; [[Moses Gaster]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a9mMNsvwU8wC&amp;pg=PA468 Studies and Texts in Folklore, Magic, Mediaeval Romance, Hebrew Apocrypha, and Samaritan Archaeology, Volume 1, Moses Gaster, KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1971] "...Moabite Stone, if the latter be genuine..."&lt;/ref&gt; F.W. Schulz,&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Schultz, Professor of Theology at the University of Breslau, wrote in the 1877 [[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge|''Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche'']] [https://archive.org/details/realencyklopdie15plitgoog] (translation from German by A Lowy): "Although the authenticity is acknowledged by all who have expressed themselves on the subject, there are several points which call forth strong doubt." Schulz describes the coincidences: (a) the only Moabite king mentioned by name in the bible left the only Moabite stele discovered, and (b) nearly all the names in the biblical "prophesy against Moab" (chapters 15–16 of the [[Book of Isaiah]]) are mentioned on the stele.&lt;/ref&gt; Gustav Jahn,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Das_Buch_Daniel_propheta.html?id=m72dPgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Das Buch Daniel nach der Septuaginta Hergestellt], Leipzig: Eduard Pfeiffer, 1904, "Die Mesha-Inschrift Aufs Neue Untersucht"&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert Storr,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Die_Unechtheit_der_Mesainschrift.html?id=mZJQAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Die Unechtheit der Mesainschrift, Rupert Storr, Laupp, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly Albert Löwy, who wrote two monographs disputing the authenticity of the stele in 1887&lt;ref name=Lowy&gt;Albert Löwy, ''A Critical Examination of the So-called Moabite Inscription in the Louvre, 1903,'' 3rd issue rev. and amended. Lowy's arguments against the authenticity of the stele were related to (a) apparent errors in the language, composition and [[palaeography]] of the text, (b) signs of plagiarism from the bible, and (c) the [[rhetorical question]] "Can an absolute unicum which, as a literary production, is alleged to have emanated from an ancient, now defunct, nation, serve as acceptable evidence of its own genuineness, if such evidence be challenged?"&lt;/ref&gt; and 1903.&lt;ref name=Lowy/&gt; Its authenticity was also challenged in detail by [[Abraham Yahuda]] in 1944 in his article, "The Story of a Forgery and the Mēša Inscription".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1452562 "The Story of a Forgery and the Mēša Inscription"], A. S. Yahuda, ''The Jewish Quarterly Review New Series'', Vol. 35, No. 2 (October 1944), pp. 139–164&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist views===
[[Thomas L. Thompson]] believes that the inscription on the Mesha stele is not historical, but an [[allegory]]. In 2000 he wrote: "Rather than an historical text, the Mesha inscription belongs to a substantial literary tradition of stories about kings of the past... The phrase "Omri, king of Israel," [[eponym]] of the highland patronate ''Bit Humri'', belongs to a theological world of Narnia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, Volume 80|year=2000|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004115989|pages=323–326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFL0__dIdlcC&amp;pg=PA323|author=Thomas L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1686">'''Moses Margolies''' or '''Moshe ben Shimon Margalit''' ({{lang-he|משה מרגלית}}; c. 1710 in [[Kėdainiai]] – 1780 in [[Brody]]) was a rabbi and a commentator on the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Margalioth|first=Mordechai|title=Encyclopedia of Great Men in Israel|year=1949–1950|publisher=Joshua Chechik and Mossad ha-Rav Kook|pages=1124–1127|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36620&amp;st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Margolies is best known as the author of a dual commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud, which is printed in the standard [[Vilna]] and [[Szatmár]] editions of the text. His general glosses, which he called by the name of ''Pnei Moshe'' (the face of Moses), was intended to make the often choppy text of the Jerusalem Talmud easier to read. His second commentary, which he called ''Mareh Panim'' (showing of face), is meant to take up more complex legal issues and often surveys the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and the corpus of post-Talmudic law and commentary as well. This format of two commentaries, simple and complex, was meant to mimic the [[Rashi]] and [[Tosafot]] commentaries on the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. This style became popular among commentators on the Jerusalem Talmud and was mimicked by Rabbis [[David ben Naphtali Fränkel|David Fränkel]] and [[Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky|Jacob David Wilovsky]], among others.

His novel, ''Herbert'' (1993), was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], and adapted into a film [[Herbert (film)|of the same name]] in 2005, by [[Suman Mukhopadhyay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Storm Advisory: Cyclone of a Life on the Horizon|author=Nathan Lee|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/movies/11herb.html|publisher=New York Times |date=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bhattacharya studied in [[Kolkata]], first Geology, then English, from [[Calcutta University]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt; Nabarun married Pranati Bhattacharya, who was a professor of political science. Their only child Tathagata is a Delhi-based journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/kolkata/End-of-journey-for-the-eternal-rebel-Nabarun-Bhattacharya-passes-away/articleshow/39387182.cms|title=End of journey for the eternal rebel: Nabarun Bhattacharya passes away|last=|first=Times of India|date=August 1, 2014|website=timesofindia.com|dead-url=|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Nabarun had said that once he used to be a hardline communist but was no longer so. In response to a question regarding what he thought to be the most prominent ideological change in him, he said "I am no longer anthropocentric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textualities.net/jennie-renton/legitimate-anger/ |title=Legitimate Anger |publisher=Textualities |date= |accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Aside from fiction, he has also written poetry, of which ''Ei Mrityu Upotyoka Aaamaar Desh Na'' (This Valley of Death Is Not My Country) is an example.

===The characters called Fyataru===
His [[magic realist]] writings introduced a strange set of human beings to Bengali readers, called ''[[Fyataru]]'' (fyat: the sound created by kites while they are flown; otherwise, fyat has also a hint of someone worthless, deriving from the words foto, faaltu; uru: related to flying), who are an anarchic underclass fond of sabotage and are capable of flying whenever they utter the mantra '''fyat fyat sh(n)aai sh(n)aai''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (This mantra was made into a song by the popular Bangla band [[Chandrabindoo (band)|Chandrabindoo]] in one of its albums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandrabindoo.in/Lyrics/hulabila/hulabila.gif ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). They appear in his books ''Mausoleum'', ''Kaangaal Maalshaat'', ''Fatarur Bombachaak'', ''Fyatarur Kumbhipaak and Mobloge Novel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parabaas.com/PB35/LEKHA/pTapodhir35.html |title="Carnival-er Bisphoron" – Review of Nabarun Bhattacharya's "Kangal Malsat", by Tapodhir Bhattacharya – Parabaas Issue 35 |publisher=Parabaas.com |date= |accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suman Mukhopadhyay]], who was basically from a theatrical background, dramatized ''[[Kangal Malsat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060304/asp/calcutta/story_5925495.asp |title=The Telegraph – Calcutta : Metro |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=4 March 2006 |accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as a lawyer. He is called "Father of Bangladeshi theatre" and "Natyaguru of Bangladesh" (''The Grand Teacher of Drama and Theatre'').&lt;ref name="Jamil 2008"/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

Momen was born on 25 November 1908. His father was Nurul Arefin, a physician and Zamindar (landlord) in Alfadanga, of the then [[Jessore]] district. (After the partition of India, from 1947, Alphadanga is in [[Faridpur district]].)  He went to primary school in [[Calcutta]] and was admitted in 1916 into Khulna Zila School. At the age of ten he wrote his first poem, ''Shondhya'' (Evening), in the same verse as [[Tagore]]'s ''Shonar Tory''. In 1919 it was published in the journal ''Dhrubotara''. In 1920, he was enrolled in the [[Muslim Government High School|Dhaka Muslim High School]] where he resided in the Dafrin Hostel. After matriculation in 1924 he studied at [[Dhaka Collegiate School|Dhaka Intermediate College]]. Passing intermediate, he enrolled for a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at the newly established [[Dhaka University]] on 1926.

While he was residing at "Muslim Hall" of Dhaka University, the various halls staged the then new play ''[[Muktadhara]]'' by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. After some initial resistance, Momen received the main role of "Botu". This ignited his passion for drama and even earned him the first prize, but it was also the first time that he performed as actor himself.

After receiving his B.A. from Dhaka University in 1929, he studied law at the [[Department of Law, University of Calcutta]]. Upon completing his [[B.L.]] examinations in 1936 he started practicing at the [[Calcutta High Court]].

==Career==

=== Radio work ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

After the foundation of [[All India Radio]] in Dhaka, 1939, Momen picked up on the opportunity of the new medium and became its first Muslim author. In 1941 he wrote and directed the comedy ''Rupantor'' (Transformation) for the radio. With its progressive plot and a female main character it differed vastly form traditional Muslim plays and was actually the first modern drama of Bangladesh. Upon initiative of the critic, the poet and literary critic [[Mohitlal Majumder]], the play was also published in the yearly [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] issue of the newspaper [[Anandabazar]].

While he was in London for higher studies from 1948 on, Nurul Momen and his friend Nazir Ahmed started a [[BBC]] Bengali program, a weekly one-hour format called'' Anjuman'' where Momen was responsible for the literary content.

=== Teaching career ===
Rather than continuing to practice law even before the [[partition of India]], Momen joined the faculty of Law at the Dhaka University in 1945.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Mahmud |first=Faisal |year=2012 |chapter=Momen, Nurul |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Momen,_Nurul |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he was known for including elements from literature and music into the law classes. He encouraged Munier Chowdhury to get interested in theater and become a playwright. Momen encouraged him to read [[George Bernard Shaw]] and got many other students interested in theatre. He later translated ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''. From 1948 until 1951 Momen was on leave from the university, undergoing higher studies in England and graduating in Law from London University.

'''Oblo''' is a poorly attested, unclassified, and possibly extinct language of northern [[Cameroon]]. It is, or was, spoken in a tiny area including Gobtikéré, Ouro Bé, and Ouro Badjouma, in [[Pitoa]], [[Bénoué]] Department. (Note: the map in ''Ethnologue'' shows it in [[Mayo-Rey]] Department, possibly an error.{{cn|date=April 2018}})

Oblo has been classified as one of the [[Adamawa languages]], but it has not been included in recent classifications. It might be best left unclassified altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/equipes/index.asp?Langue=EN&amp;Equipe=50&amp;Page=Themes "Towards a new classification of African languages"], ''Linguistic Contribution to the History of Sub-Saharan Africa,'' University of Lyons&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sahajanand Saraswati''' {{audio|Sahajananda saraswati.ogg|pronunciation}} (22 February 1889 – 26 June 1950) was an [[ascetic]], a nationalist and a peasant leader of India.

Although born in North-Western Provinces (present-day [[Uttar Pradesh]]), his social and political activities focussed mostly on [[Bihar]] in the initial days, and gradually spread to the rest of India with the formation of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]]. He had set up an ashram at [[Bihta]], near [[Patna]] and carried out most of his work in the later part of his life from there. He was an intellectual, prolific writer, [[social reformer]] and revolutionary.

==Biography==
Sahajanand Saraswati was born in [[Deva Village]] near Dullahpur, Ghazipur district in eastern North-Western Provinces in 1889 to a family of the [[Jujhautiya Brahmin]] which due to marital relations became one with [[Bhumihar Brahmin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sharma |last=Raghav Sharan |title=Builders of Modern India: Swami Sahajanand Saraswati |publisher=Prakashan Vibhag, Suchna evam Prasaran Mantralaya, Bharat Sarkar |location=New Delhi |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Robb |title=Peasants, Political Economy and Law (at p. 38, fn. 36) |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-568160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last of six sons and was then called Naurang Rai. His mother died when he was a child and he was raised by an aunt. His father, Beni Rai, was a cultivator and knew little about religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/swami.html|title=Swami And Friends – Arvind N. Das|work=virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kisan Sabha movement started in Bihar under the leadership of Saraswati who had formed in 1929 the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS) in order to mobilise peasant grievances against the [[zamindari]] attacks on their occupancy rights, and thus sparking the farmers' movements in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Śekhara |last=Bandyopādhyāya |title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India |publisher=[[Orient Longman]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-81-250-2596-2 |page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasant Struggles in India |first=Akshayakumar Ramanlal |last=Desai |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually the peasant movement intensified and spread across the rest of India. All these radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) at the [[Lucknow]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in April 1936 with Saraswati elected as its first President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Śekhara |last=Bandyopādhyāya |title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India |publisher=[[Orient Longman]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-81-250-2596-2 |page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it involved prominent leaders such as [[N. G. Ranga]] and [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]]. The Kisan Manifesto, which was released in August 1936, demanded abolition of the zamindari system and cancellation of rural debts. In October 1937, the AIKS adopted the red flag as its banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mahatma Gandhi |first=Sankar |last=Ghose |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1991 |isbn=81-7023-205-8 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, its leaders became increasingly distant with Congress, and repeatedly came in confrontation with Congress governments in Bihar and United Province.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Saraswati organised the Bakasht Movement in Bihar in 1937–1938. "Bakasht" means self-cultivated. The movement was against the eviction of tenants from Bakasht lands by [[zamindar]]s and led to the passing of the Bihar Tenancy Act and the Bakasht Land Tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23eYY4sR3KQC&amp;pg=PA175|title=Rural Development And Social Change: Thoughts Of Swami Sahajanand|last=Kumar|first=Dalip|year=2007|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=9788184500004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL_yRdwbQP8C&amp;pg=PA79|title=Agrarian Movements in India: Studies on 20th Century Bihar|last=Das|first=Arvind N.|year=1982|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714632162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led the successful struggle in the Dalmia Sugar Mill at [[Bihta]], where peasant-worker unity was the most important characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvYpVtBXw5kC&amp;pg=PA24|title=Insurrection to Agitation: The Naxalite Movement in Punjab|last=Judge|first=Paramjit S.|date=1992|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788171545278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On hearing of Saraswati's arrest during the [[Quit India Movement]], [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] and [[All India Forward Bloc]] decided to observe 28 April as [[All-India Swami Sahajanand Day]] in protest of his  incarceration by the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="bose"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. K. |last=Bose |authorlink=Subhash Chandra Bose |title=Subhas Chandra Bose: The Alternative Leadership&amp;nbsp;– Speeches, Articles, Statements and Letters |publisher=[[Orient Longman]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-81-7824-104-3 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saraswati died on 26 June 1950.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Subhash Chandra Bose, leader of the Forward Bloc, said: {{quote|Swami Sahajanand Saraswati is, in the land of ours, a name to conjure with. The undisputed leader of the peasant movement in India, he is today the idol of the masses and the hero of millions. It was indeed a rare fortune to get him as the chairman of the Reception Committee of the All India Anti-Compromise Conference at Ramgarh. For the Forward Block it was a privilege and an honour to get him as one of the foremost leaders of the Left movement and as a friend, philosopher and guide of the Forward Block itself. Following Swamiji's lead, a large number of front-rank leaders of the peasant movement have been intimately associated with the Forward Block.&lt;ref name="bose" /&gt;}}

The '''Scottish Corpus of Texts &amp; Speech''' ('''SCOTS''') is an ongoing project to build a [[text corpus|corpus]] of modern-day (post-1940) written and spoken texts in [[Scottish English]] and varieties of [[Scots language|Scots]]. SCOTS has been available online since November 2004, and can be freely searched and browsed. By the end of the project, in mid-2007, SCOTS aims to increase the size of the text collection to 4 million words.

The project is a venture by the Department of English Language and STELLA project at the [[University of Glasgow]]. SCOTS is grant-funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].

==Language variety==
SCOTS contains texts in [[Scottish English]] and varieties of broad Scots, including [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]], [[Lallans]], urban varieties such as [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Insular Scots]]. SCOTS contains a [[geographical]] spread of texts as well as a [[demographic]] spread. Each text is accompanied by extensive [[metadata]], including such information as author’s decade of birth, gender, occupation, birthplace and place of residence, and details about the text such as publication information, audience, date and genre.

==Genre and mode==
SCOTS is a [[multimedia]] [[text corpus|corpus]], containing written texts and spoken texts, available as [[transcription (linguistics)|orthographic transcriptions]], accompanied by source audio or video files. SCOTS includes a large number of [[genre]]s and text types, including prose fiction, poetry, business and personal correspondence, religious texts, parliamentary and administrative documents, emails, conversations and interviews.

==Search and analysis==
SCOTS can be investigated in various ways, depending on the user’s interest. The corpus can be browsed, for example by the author’s name or date of the text, and all texts can be downloaded in [[plain text]] format. 

[[transcription (linguistics)|Transcriptions]] are synchronised with audio / video files, which are streamed and may also be downloaded. 

An Advanced Search facility allows the user to build up more complex queries, choosing from all the fields available in the [[metadata]]. Geographical results are plotted on an interactive map, so regional variation may be investigated. 

Advanced Search results can also be viewed as a [[Key Word in Context|KWIC]] concordance, which can be reordered to highlight [[collocation]]al patterns.

'''Seán Ó Catháin''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1726) was an Irish [[scribe]].

Little is known of Ó Catháin. He transcribed ''[[Trí Biorghaoithe an Bháis]]''&amp;nbsp;– by [[Seathrún Céitinn]]&amp;nbsp;– and ''[[Beatha Chaitríona]]'', "air forálamh an óig úasail róonoraigh fhíorchartannaidh .i. Fhroinnsais Óig a Blake mhic Tomais oíghreadh na bForbach" (for Francis Óg son of Thomas Blake of [[Furbogh|Furbogh, County Galway]]) in 1726, now BM Egerton 184. He wrote RIA 23 G 4, containing history, genealogy and poetry, sometime between 1722 and 1729. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

{{Life in Singapore}}

'''Singaporean Mandarin''' ({{zh|s=新加坡华语|t=新加坡華語|p=Xīnjiāpō Huáyǔ}}) is a variety of [[Mandarin Chinese]] widely spoken in Singapore. It is one of the four [[official language]]s of Singapore along with [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

Singaporean Mandarin can be classified into two distinct Mandarin dialects: '''[[Standard Singaporean Mandarin]]''' and '''[[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]]'''. These two dialects are easily distinguishable to a person proficient in Mandarin. [[Standard Singaporean Mandarin]] is the register of Mandarin used in more formal occasions in Singapore and can be heard on television and radio. It is also the form taught in all Singapore government schools, while [[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] (Singdarin) is the form used by the general populace. They tend to infuse the language with many words from other Chinese dialects, Malay and English.

Singaporean Mandarin only became widely spoken by the [[Chinese in Singapore|Chinese community in Singapore]] after the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] in 1979. It is today considered to be the second most commonly spoken language in Singapore, after English. Due to its widespread usage, Singaporean Mandarin has replaced [[Singaporean Hokkien]] as the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Chinese in Singapore|Chinese community in Singapore]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?p=20025|title=Envisioning Chinese Identity and Multiracialism in Singapore|author=Leong Koon Chan|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the economic rise of China in the 21st century, Mandarin proficiency has been viewed with greater importance and has risen in terms of prominence in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/16/singapore-china-idUSSIN36618920090916| title=RPT-FEATURE-Eyeing China, Singapore sees Mandarin as its future|author=Reuters| accessdate=14 February 2011|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, there was an increase in the number of Singaporean population who know two or more languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/news/news/press12012011.pdf|title=CENSUS OF POPULATION 2010 STATISTICAL RELEASE 1 ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND RELIGION|author=SINGAPORE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS|language=|accessdate=15 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124160522/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/news/news/press12012011.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing influx of [[mainland Chinese]] from [[mainland China]] to Singapore recently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/hr/2012/09-10/4171879.shtml|title=探讨新加坡人与中国新移民：接纳与融入间的对视(An insight into Singaporean and New Chinese immigrants: receiving and assimilation) |author=中国新闻网 (China News Site)|language=Chinese|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singaporean Mandarin has gradually inclined itself towards [[Putonghua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/hwjy/news/2010/05-19/2291175.shtml|title=新加坡内阁资政：新加坡华语尽量向普通话靠拢(Lee Kuan Yew: Singaporean Mandarin should incline itself towards Putonghua)|author=中国新闻网(China News Site)|language=Chinese|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Singaporean Mandarin continues to develop itself with major influences coming from [[Putonghua]], [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] and [[English language|English]].

==Overview==

===Standard Singaporean Mandarin===
{{Main article|Standard Singaporean Mandarin|Standard Mandarin}}
The official standard of Mandarin of [[Republic of Singapore]], known in Singapore as ''Huayu'' ({{lang|zh|华语}}), is based on the phonology of the [[Beijing dialect]] and the grammar of [[Vernacular Chinese]], is almost identical to the standard of Mandarin used in the [[People's Republic of China]] (known there as ''Pǔtōnghuà'' {{lang|zh|普通话}}) and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (known there as ''Guóyǔ'' {{lang|zh|國語}}）. [[Standard Singaporean Mandarin]], which is usually heard on Singaporean Mandarin-language TV and radio news broadcast, is generally similar to [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Guoyu]] in terms of [[phonology]], and [[Putonghua]] in terms of [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]]. Small differences only appear in the form of [[lexicon]].

===Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin===
{{Main article|Singdarin}}
In terms of colloquial spoken Mandarin, Singaporean Mandarin is subjected to influence from the local historical, cultural and social influences of Singapore. As such, there are remarkable differences between [[colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] and [[Putonghua]]. Owing to a common culture and history between the [[Chinese Singaporean]]s and [[Malaysian Chinese]], [[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] bears the closest resemblance with [[Colloquial Malaysian Mandarin]].

===Features of Singaporean Mandarin===
[[File:Chinese textbook in Classical Chinese in 1911.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese textbook used in Singapore's Chinese school in 1911. The textbook came from [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and was in [[Classical Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukit Brown: Our Roots,Our Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Singaporean Mandarin had preserved the [[vocabulary]] and certain features of the [[Classical Chinese]] and early [[Vernacular Chinese]] (baihua) of the early 20th century. Because Singapore's [[Chinese schools]] adopted Chinese teaching materials from [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in the early 20th century, Singapore's early Mandarin pronunciations was based on the [[Zhuyin]] in the ''[[Dictionary of National Pronunciation]]'' ({{zh|t=國音字典|hp=Guó yīn zìdiǎn|labels=no}}) and ''[[Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use]]'' ({{zh|t=國音常用字彙|hpGuó yīn chángyòng zìhuì|labels=no}}). As such, it had preserved the older forms of pronunciations. In addition, during its initial development, Singaporean Mandarin was also influenced by Chinese dialects of Singapore such as [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] etc.

From 1949 to 1979, due to lack of contact between Singapore and [[People's Republic of China]], [[Putonghua]] did not exert any form of influence on Singaporean Mandarin. On the contrary, the majority of Mandarin Chinese entertainment media, Chinese literature, books and reading materials in Singapore came mainly from [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. Consequently, Singaporean Mandarin has been influenced by [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] to a certain degree. After the 1980s, along with [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|Open Door Policy]], there was increasing contact between Singapore and mainland China, thus increasing [[Putonghua]]'s gradual influence on  Singaporean Mandarin. These influences included the adoption of [[pinyin]] and the shift from usage of  [[Traditional Chinese characters]] to [[Simplified Chinese characters]]. Much of the [[lexicon]] from [[Putonghua]] had also found its way into Singaporean Mandarin.

==History==

===Background===
Historical sources indicated that before 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles came to Singapore, there were already Chinese settlers in Singapore. After 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles set foot on Singapore, many [[Peranakan]] from Malaysian and European merchants began to come to Singapore. Because they required large number of labourers, [[coolies]] were brought in from China to Singapore.

Large number of Chinese labourers came to Singapore after the [[Opium War]]. Chinese settlers who came to Singapore from China during the 19th and second half of the 20th century were known as "''sinkeh''" ({{zh|t=新客|labels=no}}). Amongst them were many contract labourers, including those who worked at the docks. Most of them came to Singapore to escape from poverty and to search for a better life, while others came to Singapore to escape from wars taking place in China during the first half of the 20th century. Most of them came from Southern Chinese provinces such as [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]].

Amongst these Sinkeh, there were many [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] (Hokkien), [[Teochew people|Teochew]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hainanese people|Hainanese]]. They brought their own different native Chinese varieties to Singapore, including [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka]] and [[Hainanese]]. Because these varieties were mutually unintelligible, [[Kongsi|Chinese clans association]] were established based on their own [[ancestral home]] and dialect groups to help take care of their own people who speak the same dialect.

The use of Mandarin to serve as a [[lingua franca]] amongst the Chinese only began with the founding of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], which established Mandarin as the official tongue.

===Development of Mandarin in Singapore===
Before the 20th century, [[Old-style private Chinese school]] known as ''sīshú'' ({{zh|t=私塾|labels=no}}) in Singapore generally used Chinese dialects (such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, etc.) as their [[medium of instruction]] to teach the [[Chinese classics]] and [[Classical Chinese]]. Singapore's first Mandarin-medium classes appeared around 1898, but Chinese dialects school continued to exist till 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mail.tku.edu.tw/cfshih/ln/paper17.htm|title= 新加坡的語言政策(Singapore's language policy)|accessdate=21 August 2013|author=洪鎌德◎台大國發所教授 (Hon Liande) |date= |publisher=National Taiwan University |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, under the influence from the [[New Culture Movement]] in China, the local [[Old-style private Chinese school]] in Singapore began to follow the new education reform as advocated by China's reformist. Thus, the language of medium in school changed from other Chinese dialects to Mandarin Chinese or ''Guóyǔ'' (國語). This marked the beginning of the development of Singaporean Mandarin.

However, at that time, there was no colloquial Standard Mandarin which could be used as a basis for learning Mandarin. In addition, during the early 1900s, most Mandarin teachers in Singapore came from southern parts of China, and had strong southern Chinese accents. Thus, the pronunciations in Singaporean Mandarin were under heavy influence from China's southern Chinese dialects; for instance, there were no [[erhua]] ({{zh|t=兒化|labels=no}}), light tone ({{zh|t=輕聲|labels=no}}), and no sentences had the heavy or light accent ({{zh|t=輕重音|labels=no}}) etc.

In 1919, a group of scholars in China published the ''Dictionary of National Pronunciation''. This was one of the earliest dictionaries on modern Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. However, the dictionary was a mix of northern Chinese sounds and southern Chinese rhymes, which included a 5th tone; the [[checked tone]] (''rù shēng'' or {{zh|t=入聲|labels=no}}).  It wasn't until 1932 that a dictionary called the ''Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use'', which was based truly on the Beijing dialect, was published. This dictionary standardized the form of Mandarin taught in Singapore's Chinese schools. During the 1930s and 1940s, new immigrants from China, known as ''xīn kè'' ({{zh|t=新客|labels=no}}) helped to established more [[Chinese schools]] in Singapore, increasing the propagation of Mandarin Chinese in Singapore. The name of Mandarin in Singapore was eventually changed from ''Guoyu'' ({{zh|t=國語|labels=no}}, i.e. National Language) to ''Huayu'' ({{zh|t=華語|labels=no}}, i.e. Chinese Language).

From the 1950s till 1970, as most of the Chinese books and literature came from [[Taiwan]] or [[Hong Kong]], Singaporean Mandarin was subjected to influence from [[Taiwanese Mandarin]]. After the 1980s, due to the [[Chinese economic reform|open door policy]] of [[mainland China]], Singapore began to have greater contact with mainland China. Consequently, Singapore began to adopt [[Hanyu Pinyin]] and changed its writing system from [[Traditional Chinese characters]] to [[Simplified Chinese characters]]. After the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] in 1979, the [[Promote Mandarin Council]] started research on Mandarin standardization based on case studies in mainland China and Taiwan.

After the 1990s, due to greater contacts between [[Singapore]] and [[mainland China]], there was a large influx of new Chinese migrants from mainland China. Consequently, much of the lexicon of Putonghua found its way into Singaporean Mandarin. Today's Singaporean Mandarin continues to be influenced from Putonghua, as well as [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] and Hong Kong's Cantonese.

==Differences from Standard Mandarin==

===Lexicon (Vocabulary)===

Major differences between Singaporean Mandarin ''Huayu'' ({{zh|t=华语|labels=no}}) and [[Putonghua]] lie in the [[vocabulary]] used. A lack of contact between Singapore and China from 1949 to 1979 meant that Singaporean Mandarin had to invent its own new words to suit the local Singapore environment, as well as borrow certain words from [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] or some other Chinese dialects that were spoken in Singapore. As a result, new Mandarin words proprietary to Singapore were invented.

The ''[[Dictionary of Contemporary Singaporean Mandarin Vocabulary]]'' ({{zh|s=时代新加坡特有词语词典|labels=no}}) edited by [[Wang Huidi]] ({{zh|t=汪惠迪|labels=no}}) listed 1560 uniquely local Singaporean Mandarin words, which are not used in Mainland China or Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =  《时代新加坡特有词语词典》 (Dictionary of Contemporary Singaporean Mandarin Vocabulary) | year=1999 | publisher=新加坡联邦出版社出版|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unique Singaporean Mandarin words===
There are many new terms that are specific to living in Singapore (though some also apply in neighbouring Malaysia). These words were either translated from Malay and Chinese dialects (or invented) as there were no equivalent words in [[Putonghua]]. Some of the words are taken from the [[Hokkien]] translation of Malay words. Words translated from Malay into [[Hokkien]] include ''kampung'', ''pasar'' ({{zh|t=巴刹|labels=no}}, English 'market'). This explains the uniquely Singapore Mandarin words.

===Loanwords and English influences===

==Grammar==

In terms of standard written Mandarin in Singapore, the Singaporean Mandarin grammar is almost similar to that of Putonghua. However, the grammar of '''colloquial Singaporean Mandarin''' can differ from that of Putonghua as a result of influence from other [[varieties of Chinese]], [[classical Chinese]] and [[English language|English]]. Some of the local Singaporean Mandarin writings do exhibit certain local Singaporean features.

===Time===

When speaking of minutes, colloquial  Singaporean Mandarin typically uses the word 字 (''zì''), which represents a unit of 5 minutes. When referring to a number of hours (duration), 钟头 (''zhōngtóu'') is used instead of 小时 (''xiǎoshí''). For instance:

:5 minutes:  一个字 (yī gè zì)
:10 minutes: 两个字 (liǎng gè zì)
:15 minutes: 三个字 (sān gè zì)
:45 minutes: 九个字 (jiǔ gè zì)
:1 hour: 一个钟头 (yī gè zhōng tóu)

The use of ''zì'' (字) originates from Hokkien (''jī'' or ''lī''), Cantonese or Classical Chinese. Its origin came from the ancient Chinese units of measuring time. In ancient Chinese time measurement, hours were measured in terms of ''shíchén'' (时辰), equivalent to 2 hours while minutes were measured in terms of ''kè'' (刻), equivalent to 15 minutes. Each ''kè'' was in turn divided into 3 ''zì'' (equivalent to 5 minutes). For instance, 7:45 pm is:

:{{ruby-zh-p|七|qī}} {{ruby-zh-p|点|diǎn}} {{ruby-zh-p|九|jiǔ}} {{ruby-zh-p|个|gè}} {{ruby-zh-p|字|zì}} or {{ruby-zh-p|七|qī}} {{ruby-zh-p|点|diǎn}} {{ruby-zh-p|九|jiǔ}}。 (Singaporean Mandarin)
:{{ruby-zh-p|七|qī}} {{ruby-zh-p|点|diǎn}} {{ruby-zh-p|四十|sìshí}} {{ruby-zh-p|五|wǔ}} {{ruby-zh-p|分|fēn}}。 (Standard Mandarin)

===Days of the week===
As a result of Hokkien influence, colloquial Singaporean Mandarin typically uses the word "拜-" (''bài'') to refer to the days of the week, in lieu of Standard Mandarin "星期-" (''xīngqí-''). For instance:

:Monday: 拜一 (''bàiyī'') instead of 星期一 (''xīngqíyī'')
:Sunday: 礼拜天 (''lǐbàitiān'') or simply 礼拜 (''lǐbài'') instead of 星期日 (''xīngqírì'')
:A week: 一个礼拜  (''yī gè lǐbài'') instead of the more formal 一个星期 (''yī gè xīngqí'')

Both 拜 (''bài'') and 礼拜 (''lǐbài'') originate from Hokkien ''pài'' and ''lé-pài'' respectively.

===Large numbers===

In colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, 万 (''wàn''), referring to a "ten thousand" is often used but 十千 (''shí qiān''), referring to "ten thousands" is occasionally used too. This usage was influenced by English numbering system.

===The use of the word "而已"===

而已 (''éryǐ'') is more common in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin than in Standard Mandarin, which uses 罢了 (''bàle''). The same is true for [[Taiwanese Mandarin]]. While 而已 (''éryǐ'') is also used in colloquial Mandarin within Mainland China, but perhaps to a lesser extent as compared to Singapore or Taiwan. For example:

Translation: ''only like this / only this kind!''
:{{ruby-zh-p|这|zhè}} {{ruby-zh-p|样子|yàngzi}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''而已'''|'''éryǐ'''}} {{ruby-zh-p|啊|a}}！ (Singaporean Mandarin)
:{{ruby-zh-p|这|zhè}} {{ruby-zh-p|样子|yàngzi}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''罢了'''|'''bàle'''}}！ (Standard Mandarin)

===The use of the word "大只" "小只"===
When people describe the size of animals, for example, chicken, these are used to mean 'small' 'large'. Putonghua tends to use "肥""瘦" instead. These two words are also used to describe the 'size' your body frame. "大只" refers to people who appear to be tall, masculine or a large body build. "小只" is used to describe people with a small built, tiny frame. 

===Use of the word "啊" as an affirmative===

In colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, the word "啊" is often used in response to a sentence as an affirmative. It is often pronounced as {{IPA|/ã/}} (with a nasal tone) instead of 'ah' or 'a' (in Putonghua). Putonghua tends to use "是(的)/对啊/对呀" (''shì (de)/duì a/duì ya'')， "哦" (''ó''), "噢" (''ō''), "嗯" (en/ng) to mean "yes, it is".

===Use of the word "才" instead of "再"===
In Singaporean Mandarin, there is a greater tendency to use the word ''cái'' "才" (then) in lieu of Standard Mandarin zài "再" (then), which indicates a future action after the completion of a prior action. For instance:

:"关税申报单刚巧用完了，打算在飞机上领了'''才'''填写。"
:''The tax declaration forms have all been used up, will have to get a form on the plane then and fill it out.''

:"现在不要说，等他吃饱了'''才'''说。"
:''Don't say anything now; say it only after he has finished his meal.''

===The use of the word "有" ===

In Standard Mandarin, one typical way of turning certain nouns into adjectives, such as 兴趣 (''xìngqù'', 'interest'), 营养 (''yíngyǎng'', 'nutrition'), 礼貌  (''lǐmào'', 'politeness'), is to prefix the word "有" (''yǒu'') at the front of these nouns.

For example:

:"很'''有'''兴趣" (hěn '''yǒu''' xìngqù - ''very interested'')
:"很'''有'''营养" (hěn '''yǒu''' yíngyǎng - ''very nutritious'')
:"很'''有'''礼貌" (hěn '''yǒu''' lǐmào - ''very polite'').

The word 有 (''yǒu'') is sometimes omitted in writing.

===Reduplication of verbs preceding "一下"===

In Singaporean Mandarin, verbs preceding "一下" may be [[Reduplication|reduplicated]], unlike in Putonghua. In Putonghua grammar, the use of the word "一下(儿)" (''yīxià(r)'') is often put at the back of a verb to indicate that the action (as indicated by the verb) is momentary.

For example:

:{{ruby-zh-p|'''想'''|xiǎng}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''想'''|xiǎng}} {{ruby-zh-p|一下|yīxià}} 。(Singaporean Mandarin)
:{{ruby-zh-p|'''想'''|xiǎng}} {{ruby-zh-p|一下(儿)|yīxià(r)}} 。(Standard Mandarin)
:Think for a while.

:{{ruby-zh-p|'''研究'''|yánjiū}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''研究'''|yánjiū}} {{ruby-zh-p|一下|yīxià}} 。 (Singaporean Mandarin)
:{{ruby-zh-p|'''研究'''|yánjiū}} {{ruby-zh-p|一下(儿)|yīxià(r)}} 。(Standard Mandarin)
:Research for a little while.

===Colloquial use of the word "被"===
Singaporean colloquial Mandarin tends to use 被 (''bèi'') more commonly than Putonghua, mainly due to influence from English.

Compare the following:

:"The road has been repaired"
:{{ruby-zh-p|马路|mǎlù}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''被'''|bei}} {{ruby-zh-p|修好|xiūhǎo}} {{ruby-zh-p|了|le}} (Singaporean Mandarin)
:{{ruby-zh-p|马路|mǎlù}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''已'''|yǐ}} {{ruby-zh-p|修好|xiūhǎo}} {{ruby-zh-p|了|le}} (Putonghua)

===Using adjective as verb===

Sometimes, colloquial Singaporean Mandarin might use intransitive verbs as transitive.

For instance

"进步" (improve) is an intransitive verb. But as influenced by the use of English, "I want to improve my Chinese" is sometimes said in Singaporean Mandarin as "我要'''进步'''我的华语". The standard Mandarin should be "我要让我的华语'''进步'''"

==Phonology and tones==

The [[phonology]] and [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of Singaporean Mandarin are generally similar to that of [[Standard Mandarin]]. There are  4 tones similar to those in [[Standard Mandarin]], but [[Erhua]] (''-er'' finals) and the neutral tone (轻声, lit. 'light tone') are generally absent in Singaporean Mandarin.

The earliest development of Singaporean Mandarin includes the '''old Beijing phonology''' (老国音), followed by '''new Beijing phonology''' (新国音) and then finally [[Hanyu Pinyin]] of [[mainland China]]. In its initial development, Singaporean Mandarin was highly influenced by the [[Ru sheng]] 入声 (checked tones or "5th tones") from other Chinese varieties. As such, the 5th tone did appear in earlier Singaporean Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen  |first= Chung-Yu |date= January 1983|title= A Fifth Tone in the Mandarin spoken in Singapore|jstor=23757822 |journal= Journal of Chinese Linguistics  |publisher=  Chinese University Press|volume= 11|issue= 1|pages= 92–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of the 5th tone are as follows:

* It is a falling tone. The common tone letter is 51, but sometimes it is 53.
* The tone does not last long. It feels more like an 'interrupted stop'.
* The syllable which carries the tone had a [[glottal stop]]; sometimes the final sounds to be clear, but sometimes, it does not sound very clear. This [[glottal stop]] not only interrupts the lasting period of the tone, but also makes the start of [[consonant]] stronger, thus nearing itself more to a [[voiced consonant]].

However, due to years of development, prevalence of the 5th tone in Singaporean Mandarin is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://naccl.osu.edu/sites/naccl.osu.edu/files/25%20lee.pdf |title=The Tonal System of Singapore Mandarin |last1=Lee |first1=Leslie |date=2010 |publisher=Harvard University |book-title= Proceedings of the 22nd North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics and the 18th International Conference on Chinese Linguistics|volume=1|editor=Lauren Eby Clemens and Chi-Ming Louis Liu|pages=345–362 |location=Cambridge, MA }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Singaporean Mandarin had inclined itself towards [[Standard Chinese]].

Minor differences occur between the phonology (tones) of Standard Singaporean Mandarin and other forms of Standard Mandarin.

==Influences from other languages in Singapore==

{{Main article|Hokkien influence on Singaporean Mandarin}}

Just like any languages in Singapore, Singaporean Mandarin is subjected to influences from other languages spoken in Singapore.

[[Singaporean Hokkien]] is the largest non-Mandarin Chinese variety spoken in Singapore. The natural tendency of Hokkien-speakers to use the Hokkien way to speak Mandarin has influenced to a large degree the colloquial Mandarin spoken in Singapore. The [[Hokkien influence on Singaporean Mandarin|colloquial Hokkien-style Singaporean Mandarin]] is commonly heard in Singapore, and can differ from Putonghua in terms of vocabulary, phonology and grammar.

Besides [[Singaporean Hokkien]], Mandarin is also subjected to influence coming from  other dialects such as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka]], and [[Hainanese]], as well as [[English language|English]].

==Writing system==

{{Main article|Singapore Chinese Characters}}

In Singapore, [[simplified Chinese characters]] are the official standard used in all official publications as well as the government-controlled press. While [[simplified Chinese characters]] are taught exclusively in schools, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters. Therefore, many shop signs continue to be written in traditional characters. Menus in hawker centres and coffeeshops are also usually written in simplified characters.

As there is no restriction on the use of [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]] in the mass media, television programmes, books, magazines and music CDs that have been imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan are widely available, and these almost always use traditional characters. Most karaoke discs, being imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan, have song lyrics in traditional characters as well. While all official publications are in simplified characters, the government still allows parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters though most choose the former.

Singapore had undergone three successive rounds of character simplification, eventually arriving at the same set of simplified characters as [[mainland China]]. Before 1969, Singapore generally used traditional characters. From 1969 to 1976, the Ministry of education launched its own version of simplified characters, which differed from that of mainland China. But after 1976, Singapore fully adopted the simplified characters of mainland China.

[[File:Lat Pau (Chinese newspaper).jpg|thumb|150px|right| Lat Pau 28 August 1890, used Classical Chinese]]
[[File:Lat Pau, 8 March 1917.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lat Pau 8 March 1917, used Classical Chinese]]
[[File:Lat Pau, 16 January 1925.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lat Pau 6 January 1925, changed to vernacular Chinese]]
Before the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, Singapore Chinese writings were based on [[Classical Chinese]]. After the [[May Fourth Movement]], under the influence from the [[New Culture Movement]] in China, the Chinese schools in Singapore began to follow the new education reform as advocated by China's reformist and changed the writing style to [[Written vernacular Chinese|Vernacular Chinese]].

Singapore's Chinese newspaper had witnessed this change from [[Classical Chinese]] to [[Written vernacular Chinese|Vernacular Chinese]]. [[Lat Pau]] (叻報), one of the earliest Chinese newspaper, was still using Classical Chinese in 1890. By 1917, it continued to use Classical Chinese. But by 1925, it had changed to Vernacular Chinese. After this, all Chinese newspaper in Singapore used Vernacular Chinese.

===Singaporean Chinese Literature===
{{main article|Singaporean Chinese Literature}}

Singaporean Chinese literature was once part of Malaysia Chinese literature. It originated from the [[New Culture Movement]] in China. In 1965, Singapore was [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|expelled from Malaysia]]. Since then, Singaporean Chinese literature started to develop independently.

The development of the Singaporean Chinese literature reflected the history of immigrants in Singapore. When many Chinese writers from Southern China arrived in Singapore, they established Chinese schools, newspaper press etc. They contributed a lot to the development of Chinese literature in Singapore. In 1919, the ''New National Magazine'' 《新國民雜誌》 marked the birth of Malaysia Chinese literature. In those days, the migrant's mindset was still deeply entrenched. Many of the literary works were influenced by [[New Culture Movement]]. Most of the literary works that were published originated from the works of writers in China.

In 1925, the presence of literary supplements such as "''Southern Wind''" 《南風》, "''Light of Singapore'' 《星光》" brought a new dimension to Malaysia Chinese literature. They differed from past magazine that relied on writers from China. It was at this time, that the thoughts of [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]] began to surface the corner. In January 1927, the "Deserted Island" 《荒島》 published in the "''New National Press''" 《新國民日報》 clearly reflected the features of Nanyang in its literary work. The "localization" literary works mostly described the lifestyle in Nanyang, the people and their feelings in Nayang. The quality of Singaporean Chinese literature had greatly improved.

In 1937, the outbreak of [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] raised the anti-Japanese sentiment. The literature during these times reflected the missions of national salvation against the Japanese. This brought a halt to the localization movement and in turn re-enacted a sense of Chinese nationalism amongst the migrants in Singapore. From 1941 till 1945, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the activities for Malaysia Chinese literature was halted.

After the war, people in Singapore began to have a sense of belonging to this piece of land, and they also had a desire for freedom and democracy. During this times, Malaysia Chinese literature was inclined towards Anti-colonialism. With new arts and thoughts, between 1947 - 1948, there was a debate between "Unique Malaysian Literary Art" and "literary thoughts of migrants". The results from these debated led to a conclusion that the Malaysia Chinese literature was going to develop on its own independently. The "localization" clearly marked the mature development of Malaysia Chinese literature.

During the 1950s, writers from Malaysia and Singapore drew their literary works mostly from the local lifestyle and events that reflected the lifestyle from all areas of the society. They also included many Chinese-dialect proverbs in their works. They created unique works of literature. Writers including [[Miao Xiu]] ({{zh|t=苗秀|labels=no}}), [[Yao Zhi]] ({{zh|t=姚紫|labels=no}}), [[Zhao Rong]] ({{zh|t=趙戎|labels=no}}), [[Shu Shu]] ({{zh|t=絮絮|labels=no}}) etc. represented the writers of "localization" works.

On 9 August 1965, Singapore became independent. Malaysia Chinese literature was now divided into Malaysian Chinese literature and Singaporean Chinese literature.

From 1960 to 1970, the number of literary works published began to increase. Locally-born and locally bred Singaporean writers became the new writers in the stage of Singaporean Chinese literature. Their works were mainly based on the views of Singaporeans towards issues or context happening in Singapore. They continued the "localization" movement and brought the Singaporean Chinese literature to a new dimension.

==Arts and Entertainment==

===Music===
{{main article|Xinyao}}

After the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] in 1979, all Chinese TV programs using other Chinese varieties were replaced by Mandarin programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge, Culture and Power|author=Welch, Anthony R. Freebody, Peter.|publisher= Routledge Publishing |ISBN=1-85000-833-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore also started to broadcast [[Mandopop]]. The birth of [[Xinyao]] during the 1980s injected a new life to the creation of lyrics for [[Mandopop]] in Singapore. Singapore radios also began to have Singapore Billboards ({{zh|t=新加坡龍虎榜|labels=no}}) for [[Mandopop]]. This allowed Singapore to be developed into a major center for [[Mandopop]] in South East Asia. There were also many [[Mandopop]] artist coming from Singapore such as [[Stefanie Sun]], [[JJ Lin]], [[Tanya Chua]], etc.

==Sociolinguistics==

===Politics===
Language plays an important role in Singapore politics. Up to today, it is still important for politicians in Singapore to be able to speak their mother tongue (and even other dialects) fluently in order to reach out to the multilingual community in Singapore.

According to observation, if an election candidate is able to speak fluent Mandarin, his chance of winning an election is higher during the election campaign. As such, most election candidates will try to use Mandarin in campaign speeches in order to attract Mandarin-speaking voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huayuqiao.org/articles/wuyuanhua/wyh04.htm| title=论新加坡华语文的"政治价值"(About the political values of Mandarin)|author=吴元华 Wu Yuanhua|accessdate=28 August 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singaporean Mandarin Standard===

Some Chinese elites in Singapore had criticized that the Mandarin standard of Chinese Singaporean has dropped greatly due to the closure or subsequent conversion of Chinese-medium schools to English-medium schools in the 1980s. Others attributed the drop in standard to the lack of learning Chinese literature in schools.

Ever since 1965 when Singapore became independent, bilingual policy has become the pillar of Singapore's education. The first language of Singapore was English, while Mandarin was chosen as the "mother tongue" of Chinese Singaporean. Generally, most Chinese Singaporean can speak Mandarin fluently, but are usually weaker in writing Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntcu.edu.tw/taiwanese/ogawa100/a/tsuliau/14.%E5%90%B3%E8%8B%B1%E6%88%90-%E8%AC%9B%E7%BE%A9.pdf|title=新加坡雙語教育政策的沿革與新機遇 (Singapore's bilingual education and new opportunity)|author=吳英成 (Wu Yincheng)|publisher=Nanyang Technological University Institute of Education|accessdate=28 August 2013|language=Chinese}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence of Mainland China's economic rise on Singapore===

In recent years, with the subsequent economic rise of mainland China and a transition from a world factory to a world market, Mandarin has become the 2nd most influential language after English. Besides transmitting Chinese culture values, many people began to realize the economic values of Mandarin, which has raised the interests of local and working professionals in learning Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntcu.edu.tw/taiwanese/ogawa100/a/tsuliau/14.%E5%90%B3%E8%8B%B1%E6%88%90-%E8%AC%9B%E7%BE%A9.pdf|title=新加坡雙語教育政策的沿革與新機遇 (Singapore's Bilingual Policy and Opportunities)|author=吳英成 (Wu Yingchen)|publisher=Nanyang Technology University Institute of Education|accessdate=28 Aug 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in mother tongue and dialect preservation===
The original mother tongue of Chinese Singaporeans other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Teochew or Cantonese. This was certainly true when southern Chinese migrants came to Singapore. However, with the Speak Mandarin campaign, the Chinese Singaporean's home language experienced a change from these other varieties to Mandarin, and later from Mandarin to English. Mandarin was designated as the mother tongue of Chinese Singaporean in Singapore.

In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of dialect preservation, due to the great decline in the use of other Chinese dialects in Singapore. Most young Chinese Singaporeans were unable to speak these Chinese dialects effectively and were thus unable to communicate with their grandparents, who are more used to speaking these dialects. This has caused a generation gap. As such, there is a minority of Singaporeans working to help preserve or spread these Chinese dialects in Singapore.

===Language policy and culture===

Under the bilingual policy of Singapore, Chinese Singaporeans had a greater chance to speak and use English especially in school and at work. But this can cause a relative limitation in the use of mother tongue. Generally speaking, most Chinese Singaporeans are able to speak Mandarin, and also read newspapers in it, but only a minority is able to use it at a professional level such as academic research, literary writing etc. In the endeavor to use English, some Chinese Singaporeans even distanced themselves from the mother tongue culture, resulting in the erosion of Chinese culture in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntcu.edu.tw/ttcece2/%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%80%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E8%88%87%E5%B9%BC%E5%85%92%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2.pdf|title=語言政策與幼兒教育 (Language Policy and Children's Education)|author=陳學怡(Chen Xue Yi)|publisher=National Taichung Institute of Education Research center for kids education|accessdate=2 September 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dutch dialects}}
'''Stadsfries''', '''Stadfries''', '''Stedfrysk''' or '''Town Frisian''' is a set of dialects spoken in certain cities in the province of [[Friesland]] in the northern [[Netherlands]], namely [[Leeuwarden]], [[Sneek]], [[Bolsward]], [[Franeker]], [[Dokkum]], [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], [[Stavoren]], and to some extent in [[Heerenveen]].  For linguistic reasons, the outlying and insular dialects of [[Midsland]] ([[Terschelling]]), [[Ameland]], [[Het Bildt]], and [[Kollum]] are also sometimes tied to Stadsfries.

The vocabulary of Stadsfries is derived primarily from [[Dutch language|Dutch]].  The dialects began in the late 15th century, when [[Frisia]] lost its political independence to the Netherlands.  For many living in Frisia, learning Dutch became a necessity.  The result was a mixture of [[Hollandic]] dialect vocabulary and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] grammar and other language principles. Since this process began, the West Frisian language itself has evolved, such that Stadsfries is further away from modern Frisian than it is from [[Old Frisian]]. Norval Smith states that Stadsfries is a Frisian–Dutch [[mixed language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=An annotated list of creoles, pidgins, and mixed languages |editor-given1=Jacques |given=Norval |surname=Smith |pages=331–374 |editor-surname1=Arends |editor-given2=Pieter |editor-surname2=Muysken |editor-given3=Norval |editor-surname3=Smith |title=Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction |publisher=John Benjamins |year=1995 |isbn=978-90-272-5236-4 }} p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the dialect group, ''Stadsfries'', is not an [[endonym]] but is instead the Dutch term for the language.  ''Stad'' (German: Stadt) is a Germanic term for "city" or "town", seen in English place names such as "Hempstead".  In Stadsfries, the term for the dialect group is ''Stadsfrys'' or ''Stads'', or each dialect is known simply by a name derived from the particular city name, such as ''Liwwarders'' for the dialect of Leeuwarden.  In West Frisian, the dialects are known as ''Stedsk'' ("city-ish"), which does not indicate the idea that Stadsfries is a form of Frisian.  To indicate this difference, one can call (West) Frisian-proper ''Boerenfries'' ("farmer-Frisian").

== Vocabulary ==

The vocabulary of Stadsfries is mainly Dutch though the West Frisian language influence is notable. Furthermore, a set of word forms are used that are clearly West Frisian, not Dutch.
Examples:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

! Stadsfries

! West Frisian

! Dutch

! English
|-
| hammer
| hammer
| hamer
| hammer
|-
| joeke
| jûkje
| jeuken
| itching
|}

The language also has typical West Frisian words that don't exist (in that sense) in Dutch, usually this concerns domestic words and words from the mainly West Frisian language agricultural sector.
Examples:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

! Stadsfries

! West Frisian

! Dutch

! English
|-
| mem
| mem
| moeder
| mother
|-
| heit
| heit
| vader
| father
|-
| jaar
| jaar
| uier
| udder
|-
| jarre
| jarre
| gier
| manure
|}

Other differences between Dutch and West Frisian can be traced back to the Dutch dialect of the 16th century.
Example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

! Stadsfries

! West Frisian

! Dutch

! English
|-
| lêge
| lizze
| liggen
| lie down
|}
Finally, several words have survived in the Stadsfries language due to Dutch influence that have since disappeared from the West Frisian language.
Examples:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

! Stadsfries

! West Frisian

! Dutch

! English
|-
| kyn
| bern
| kind
| child
|-
| farndel
| fearn
| een vierde (deel)
| one fourth (as in division)
|}

== Grammar ==

Stadsfries [[phonology]] deviates from Dutch in the absence of the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] sounds /v/ and /z/ at the beginning of words.  Dutch words like this often have an equivalent Stadsfrisian translation that instead starts with the [[Voice (phonetics)|unvoiced]] sounds /f/ and /s/.  The Dutch sounds sequence /sx/ does not exist in Stadsfries, but is often replaced with /sk/.  Stadsfries has these properties in common with West Frisian, as well as several Dutch dialects.

The [[plurals]] match West Frisian ''(skip-skippen)'', as do the [[diminutives]] ''(popke, autootsje, rinkje)'', except those in Stavers ''(poppy, autootsy, rinkje)'', where [[Hollandic|Hollands]] rules are followed.

The [[verbs]] are missing two West Frisian weak classes, but do use West Frisian rules for forming [[past participles]]: they never get the affix ''ge- (ik hew maakt; hest dou dat sien?)''.  Stadsfrisian kept the West  Frisian pronouns ''do, jo and jimme'' (informal you, formal you, plural you), although ''do'' and ''jo'' are almost always written as ''dou'' and ''jou. '' These words can in fact be used as criteria for deciding whether a [[Hollandic]]-West Frisian mixed dialect can still be considered Stadsfries.  The Dutch [[West Frisian (dialect)|dialect called "West Frisian"]] spoken in the [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland region]] of [[North Holland]] for example does not have these words and is therefore considered Hollandic.

== Spelling ==

There is no standardized, officially recognized spelling for Stadsfries.  The very few authors that write in it each use their own spelling conventions.  The most commonly used spelling is that in the ''Woordenboek fan ut Liwwarders'' ([[Leeuwarden]] Dictionary).  This spelling convention is closely related to, but more phonetic than West Frisian, and does not use the letter ''û''.

== Speakers==

The use of Stadsfries is declining rapidly, especially in [[Leeuwarden]].  No more than a quarter of the city's population (approximately 20,000 people) speaks the language, although that percentage is higher in smaller towns.  In the first half of the twentieth century the town of [[Heerenveen]] had a local strand of Stadsfries known as Haagjes Fries, spoken especially around [[Oranjewoud]], near the country home of the Frisian [[Stadtholder|stadhouder]].

Use of most [[dialect]]s (as well as the West Frisian language) is declining, but because West Frisian is considered prestigious and even recognized as a Dutch national language, Stadsfries has become a [[sociolect]] of the lower classes, especially in the cities. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The transition from dialect to sociolect happened primarily in the 20th century.  Around 1900, the Stadsfries dialects were still considered regional strands of Dutch and given a much higher status than Frisian.  With the rise of [[Standard Dutch]] in society's upper classes, brought on particularly by education and mass media, Stadsfries stopped being considered a strand of Dutch.  Since the lower classes had less exposure to Standard Dutch, they remained as some of the only speakers of Stadsfries.

[[File:Supermax prison, Florence Colorado.jpg|thumb|[[United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX]]]]

'''Super-maximum security''' ('''supermax''') or '''administrative maximum''' ('''ADX''') is a term used to describe "control-unit" [[prison]]s, or units within prisons, which represent the most [[Prison#Security levels|secure levels]] of custody in the prison systems of certain countries. The term is used in the [[United States]] and a number of other countries to describe the most secure form of security within a certain prison system. The objective is to provide long-term, segregated housing for inmates classified as the highest security risks in the prison system—the "worst of the worst" criminals—and those who pose an extremely serious threat to both national and global security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mears|first=Daniel|title=Evaluating the Effectiveness of Supermax Prisons|url=http://www.urban.org/uploadedPDF/411326_supermax_prisons.pdf|publisher=Urban Institute – Justice Policy Center|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

According to the [[National Institute of Corrections]], an agency of the United States government; ''"a supermax is a stand-alone unit or part of another facility and is designated for violent or disruptive inmates. It typically involves up to 23-hour-per-day, single-cell confinement for an indefinite period of time. Inmates in supermax housing have minimal contact with staff and other inmates,"'' a definition confirmed by a majority of prison wardens.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Mears, "[http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411326_supermax_prisons.pdf Evaluating the Effectiveness of Supermax Prisons]", ''Urban Institute'', March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leena Kurki]] and [[Norval Morris]] have argued there is no absolute definition of a supermax, and that different jurisdictions classify prisons as supermax inconsistently. They identify four general features that tend to characterize supermax prisons:&lt;ref name=KurkiMorris/&gt;

# Long-term: once transferred to a supermax prison, prisoners tend to stay there for several years or indefinitely.
# Powerful administration: supermax administrators and correctional officers have ample authority to punish and manage inmates, without outside review or prisoner grievance systems.
# [[Solitary confinement]]: supermax prisons rely heavily on intensive (and long-term) solitary confinement, which is used to isolate and punish prisoners as well as to protect them from themselves and each other. Communication with outsiders is minimal to none.
# Very limited activities: few opportunities are provided for recreation, education, substance abuse programs, or other activities generally considered healthy and rehabilitative at other prisons.

In supermax, prisoners are generally allowed out of their cells for only one hour a day (one-and-a-half hours in [[California]] state prisons); often they are kept in [[solitary confinement]]. They receive their meals through ports in the doors of their cells. When supermax inmates are allowed to exercise, this may take place in a small, enclosed area where the prisoner will exercise alone.&lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S. (2009) Supermax: controlling risk by solitary confinement. Cullompton: Willan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners are under constant [[surveillance]], usually with [[closed-circuit television]] cameras. Cell doors are usually opaque, while the cells may be windowless. Conditions are plain, with poured concrete or metal furniture common. Cell walls, and sometimes plumbing, may be soundproofed to prevent communication between the inmates.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== History ==
[[File:Alcatraz Island at Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Alcatraz Island]] is a historical prototype of the supermax prison standard.]]

The term "supermax" was adopted in the US and has since been adopted in a number of other countries. The United States Penitentiary [[Alcatraz Island]], opened in 1934, has been considered a prototype and early standard for a supermax prison.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Peter M.; Garrett, Judith Simon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sY7nRteCGEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Prison and Jail Administration: Practice and Theory''], Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1999. Cf. Chapter 35, p.252, "Supermaximum Facilities", by David A. Ward.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of supermax-style prison unit appeared in [[Australia]] in 1975, when "Katingal" was built inside the [[Long Bay Correctional Centre]] in [[Sydney]]. Dubbed the "electronic zoo" by inmates, Katingal was a super-[[Incarceration#Australia|maximum security prison]] block with 40 prison cells having electronically operated doors, surveillance cameras, and no windows. It was closed down two years later over [[human rights]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final release for Katingal, misguided experiment in extreme jails |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=19 May 2004 |author=Kennedy, Les |accessdate=5 January 2012 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/18/1084783517225.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, some maximum-security prisons have gone to full lockdown as well, while others have been built and dedicated to the supermax standard.

Supermax prisons began to proliferate within the United States after 1984. Prior to 1984 only one prison in the U.S. met "supermax" standards: the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|Federal Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]]. By 1999, the United States contained at least 57 supermax facilities, spread across 30–34 states.&lt;ref name=KurkiMorris&gt;Leena Kurki and Norval Morris, "The Purposes, Practices, and Problems of Supermax Prisons", ''Crime and Justice'' 28, 2001; accessed [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147678 via JStor].&lt;/ref&gt;  The push for this type of prison came after two correctional officers at Marion, Merle Clutts and Robert Hoffman, were stabbed to death in two separate incidents by inmates [[Thomas Silverstein]] and [[Clayton Fountain]].  This prompted [[Norman Carlson]], director of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], to call for a new type of prison to isolate uncontrollable inmates.  In Carlson's view, such a prison was the only way to deal with inmates who "show absolutely no concern for human life".&lt;ref name=LastWorst&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/The-Last-Worst-Place-The-isolation-at-2970596.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Michael | last=Taylor | title=The Last Worst Place | date=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years{{when|date=January 2017}} a number of U.S. states have downgraded their supermax prisons, {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as has been done with [[Wallens Ridge State Prison]], a former supermax prison in [[Big Stone Gap, Virginia]]. Other supermax prisons that have gained notoriety for their harsh conditions and attendant litigation by inmates and advocates are the former [[Boscobel, Wisconsin|Boscobel]] (in [[Wisconsin]]), now named the [[Wisconsin Secure Program Facility]], [[Red Onion State Prison]] (in western [[Virginia]], the twin to [[Wallens Ridge State Prison]]), [[Tamms Correctional Center|Tamms]] (in [[Illinois]]), and the [[Ohio State Penitentiary]]. Placement policies at the [[Ohio]] facility were the subject of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case (''[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'') in 2005&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'' 04-495 (2005), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=04-495 Link to case text]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court decided that there had to be some, but only very limited, due process involved in supermax placement.

There is only one supermax prison in the [[United States]] [[List of U.S. federal prisons|federal system]], [[ADX Florence]] in [[Florence, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Vick | first = Karl| date = September 30, 2007| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/29/AR2007092900928_pf.html | title = Isolating the Menace In a Sterile Supermax | work = Washington Post | pages = A03 | accessdate = 21 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It houses several inmates who have a history of violent behavior in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement for 23 hours a day to a less restrictive prison within three years.  However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison.&lt;ref name=LastWorst/&gt;  Residents have included [[Timothy McVeigh]], perpetrator of the [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] who was executed by lethal injection at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute]] on June 11, 2001; [[Theodore Kaczynski]], a [[terrorist|domestic terrorist]] otherwise known as the Unabomber, who once attacked via mail bombs; [[Robert Hanssen]], an American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent turned [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|spy]]; [[Terry Nichols]], McVeigh's accomplice in the Oklahoma City Bombing; [[Richard Reid]], known as the "Shoe Bomber", who was jailed for life for attempting to detonate [[explosive]] materials in his shoes while on board an aircraft;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17663629 | work=BBC News | title=Just how bad are American 'supermax' prisons? | date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], the underwear bomber; [[Richard Lee McNair]], a persistent prison escapee; [[Charles Harrelson]], a hitman who was convicted in 1979 of killing Federal Judge [[John H.

Deprivation of social contact and the isolation of inmates has some unintended positive and negative effects. Inmates are safer being in isolation, and prisons create more jobs for their local communities. Supermax prisons however are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times the national average for a maximum security facility.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, Daniel P. "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Super max Prisons." PsycEXTRA Dataset (2006): n. pag. NCJRS, Jan. 2006. Web. 22 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many states now have created supermax prisons, either as stand-alone facilities or as secure units within lower-security prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Riveland, C. (1999) Supermax prisons: overview and general considerations. Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Corrections&lt;/ref&gt; State supermax prisons include [[Pelican Bay State Prison|Pelican Bay]] in [[California]] and [[Tamms Correctional Center|Tamms]] in Illinois. The [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|USP in Marion, Illinois]] was recently downgraded to a medium-security facility.  Some facilities such as [[California State Prison, Corcoran]] (COR) are hybrids incorporating a supermax partition, housing or having housed high security prisoners such as [[Charles Manson]].

In September 2001, the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] opened a facility in the [[Goulburn Correctional Centre]] to the supermax standard. While its condition is an improvement over that of Katingal of the 1970s, this new facility is nonetheless designed on the same principle of sensory deprivation.&lt;ref name="4corners"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2005/s1496719.htm |author=Masters, Chris |authorlink=Chris Masters (writer) |work=Four Corners |title=SuperMax |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate= 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/inside-the-walls-of-supermax-prison-goulburn/story-e6freuy9-1225710453612 |title=Inside the walls of SuperMax prison, Goulburn |author=Watson, Rhett |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been set up for 'AA' prisoners who are deemed a risk to public safety and the instruments of government and civil order, or believed to be beyond rehabilitation. [[Corrections Victoria]] in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] also operates the Acacia and Maleuca units at [[Barwon Prison]] which serve to hold the prisoners requiring the highest security in that state including [[Melbourne]] [[Melbourne gangland killings|Gangland]] figures such as [[Tony Mokbel]] and [[Carl Williams (criminal)|Carl Williams]], who was murdered in the Acacia unit in 2010.

== Controversy ==
Supermax and Security Housing Unit (SHU) prisons are controversial. One criticism is that the living conditions in such facilities violate the [[United States Constitution]], specifically, the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]'s proscription against "cruel and unusual" punishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonactivist.org/cpf/CPFshu.html PrisonActivist.org] – California's Security Housing Units.  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010053734/http://prisonactivist.org/cpf/CPFshu.html |date=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, a [[United Nations]] team assigned to investigate torture described SHU conditions as "inhuman and degrading".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paglen.com/pages/projects/carceral/shu.htm Paglen.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411212946/http://www.paglen.com/pages/projects/carceral/shu.htm |date=2006-04-11 }} – Security Housing Unit&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 New York Bar association comprehensive study suggested that supermax prisons constitute "torture under international law" and "cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20072165-TheBrutalityofSupermaxConfinement.pdf] – The Brutality of Supermax Confinement&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a federal class action suit against the Federal Bureau of Prisons and officials who run ADX Florence SHU (''[[Cunningham v. Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bacote v. Federal Bureau of Prisons]]'', Civil Action 1:12-cv-01570) alleged chronic abuse, failure to properly diagnose prisoners, and neglect of prisoners who are seriously [[mental illness|mentally ill]]. The suit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Andrew (18 June 2012) [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/06/an-american-gulag-descending-into-madness-at-supermax/258323/ An American Gulag: Descending into Madness at Supermax] The Atlantic, Retrieved 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====

In Brazil, the ''"regime disciplinar diferenciado"'' (differentiated disciplinary regime), known by the acronym RDD, and strongly based on the Supermax standard, was created primarily to handle inmates who are considered capable of continuing to run their crime syndicate or to order criminal actions from within the prison system, when confined in normal maximum security prisons that allow contact with other inmates. Since its inception, the following prisons were prepared for the housing of RDD inmates:

* [[Centro de Readaptação Provisória de Presidente Bernardes]] ([[Presidente Bernardes, São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]) – inspired by the supermax standards, although prisoners can only stay there for a maximum of 2 years. Is a part of the prison system of the Brazilian State of São Paulo.
* [[Penitenciária Federal de Catanduvas]] ([[Catanduvas, Paraná]], [[Brazil]]) – also based on the supermax standards. It is the first federal prison in Brazil, designed to receive prisoners deemed too dangerous to be kept in the states' prison systems (in Brazil, ordinarily, both convicts sentenced by States' courts or by the Federal Judiciary fulfill their prison terms in state-run prisons; the Federal Prison System was created to handle only the most dangerous prisoners in Brazil, such as major drug lords, convicted either by the Federal Judiciary or by the judiciary of a state).
* [[Penitenciária Federal de Campo Grande]] ([[Campo Grande]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Brazil]]) – the second of two Brazilian Federal prisons based on the supermax specifications.

* [[Kumla Prison]], [[Hall Prison]] and [[Saltvik Prison]] – Sweden – All three prisons have a similar security unit called Fenix, which can house 24 inmates. 
* [[Asinara]] Prison, Sardinia – Often described as the "Italian Alcatraz" for its very low succeeded evasion rate, housed criminals with Mafia-related charges, such as [[Totò Riina]], Italy's notorious bandits, such as [[Graziano Mesina]] and [[Matteo Boe]], and criminals connected to terrorist organizations such as [[Brigate Rosse]], in a restrictive detention condition known as [[Article 41-bis prison regime]].

'''''The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism''''' (1923) is a book by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]]. It is accompanied by two supplementary essays by [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[F. G. Crookshank]]. 

==Overview==
Although the original text was published in 1923 it has been used as a textbook in many fields including [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[language]], [[cognitive science]] and most recently [[semantics]] and [[semiotics]] in general.  The book has been in print continuously since 1923.  The most recent edition is the critical edition prepared by W. Terrence Gordon as volume 3 of the 5-volume set ''C. K. Ogden &amp; Linguistics'' (London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1995). The full publication history, including serialised publication in ''The Cambridge Magazine'' prior to the first edition of the book, is in W. Terrence Gordon's, ''C. K. Ogden: a bio-bibliographical study'' (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1990).

Richards sets forth a contextual theory of Signs: that Words and Things are connected “through their occurrence together with things, their linkage with them in a ‘context’ that Symbols come to play that important part in our life [even] the source of all our power over the external world” (47). In this context system, Richards develops a tri-part semiotics—symbol, thought and [[referent]] with three relations between them (thought to symbol=correct, thought–referent=adequate, symbol–[[reference]]=true) (11). Symbols are “those signs which men use to communicate one with another and as instruments of thought, occupy a peculiar place” (23). “All discursive symbolization involves […] weaving together of contexts into higher contexts” (220). So for a word to be understood “requires that it form a context with further experiences” (210).&lt;ref&gt;Richards, IA and CK Ogden. [http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004spring/mas966/Ogden%20Richards%201923.pdf ''The Meaning of Meaning''.]  Harvest/HBJ 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book would later influence [[A. J. Ayer]]'s ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'', an introduction to [[logical positivism]], and both the [[I. A. Richards|Richards]]–[[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] book and the [[A.J. Ayer|Ayer]] book would, in turn, influence [[Alec King]] and [[Martin Ketley]] in the writing of their book ''[[The Control of Language]]'', which appeared in 1939, and which influenced [[C. S. Lewis]] in the writing of his defence of natural law and objective values, ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Menuge |first=Angus J.

'''Vietnamese Quoted-Readable''' (usually abbreviated '''VIQR'''), also known as '''Vietnet''', is a convention for writing [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] using [[ASCII]] characters. Because the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] contains a complex system of [[diacritical mark]]s, VIQR requires the user to type in a base letter, followed by one or two characters that represent the diacritical marks.

== Syntax ==
VIQR uses the following convention:&lt;ref name="Lunde" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|+Diacritical marks in VIQR
|-
! Diacritical mark
! Typed character
! Examples
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|trăng}}'' ([[breve]])
| &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a(&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;ă&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|mũ}}'' ([[circumflex]])
| &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a^&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;â&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|móc}}'' ([[horn (diacritic)|horn]])
| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some software also supports &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for inserting a horn diacritic.&lt;/ref&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;o+&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;ơ&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|huyền}}'' ([[grave accent|grave]])
| &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a`&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;à&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|sắc}}'' ([[acute accent|acute]])
| &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some software also supports &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; for inserting an acute diacritic.&lt;/ref&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a'&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;á&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|hỏi}}'' ([[hook above|hook]])
| &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a?&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;ả&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|ngã}}'' ([[tilde]])
| &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a~&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;ã&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| ''{{lang|vi|nặng}}'' ([[dot (diacritic)|dot below]])
| &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;a.&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;big&gt;ạ&lt;/big&gt;
|}

VIQR uses &lt;code&gt;DD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Dd&lt;/code&gt; for the Vietnamese letter ''Đ'', and &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; for the Vietnamese letter ''đ''. To type certain [[punctuation|punctuation marks]] (namely, the [[full stop|period]], [[question mark]], [[apostrophe]], [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]], opening [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parenthesis]], or [[tilde]]) directly after most Vietnamese words, a [[backslash]] (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;) must be typed directly before the punctuation mark, functioning as an [[escape character]], so that it will not be interpreted as a diacritical mark. For example:

: {{kbd|O^ng te^n gi`\? To^i te^n la` Tra^`n Va(n Hie^'u\.}}
: {{samp|Ông tên gì? Tôi tên là Trần Văn Hiếu.}}
:: ''What is your name [Sir]? My name is Hiếu Văn Trần.''

== Software support ==
VIQR is primarily used as a Vietnamese [[input method]] in software that supports [[Unicode]]. Similar input methods include [[Telex (IME)|Telex]] and [[VNI]]. Input method editors such as [[VPSKeys]] convert VIQR sequences to Unicode [[precomposed character]]s as one types, typically allowing modifier keys to be input after all the base letters of each word. However, in the absence of input method software or Unicode support, VIQR can still be input using a standard keyboard and read as plain ASCII text without suffering from ''[[mojibake]]''.

Unlike the [[Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange|VISCII]] and [[VPS font|VPS]] code pages, VIQR is rarely used as a character encoding. While VIQR is registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] as a [[MIME]] ''charset'', MIME-compliant software is not required to support it.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1456.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Mozilla Vietnamese Enabling Project once produced builds of the open source version of [[Netscape Communicator]], as well as its successor, the [[Mozilla Application Suite]], that were capable of decoding VIQR-encoded webpages, e-mails, and newsgroup messages. In these unofficial builds, a "VIQR" option appears in the Edit | Character Set menu, alongside the VISCII, [[TCVN 5712]], VPS, and [[Windows-1258]] options that remained available for several years in [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mozilla Vietnamese Enabling Project|publisher=Văn Lang Vietnamese Language &amp; Culture Education Center|url=http://www.vnet.org/vanlangsj/mozilla/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van D. Ho"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vietnamese Unicode Font |author=Van D. Ho |date=29 October 2009 |url=http://www.reocities.com/~starkville/mozilla/vn.htm |deadurl=no |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
By the early 1990s, an ad-hoc system of mnemonics known as Vietnet was in use on the Viet-Net [[mailing list]] and [news://soc.culture.vietnamese/ soc.culture.vietnamese] [[Usenet]] group.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|title=A Unified Framework for Vietnamese Information Processing|publisher=Vietnamese Standardization Working Group|date=September 1992 |url=http://vietstd.sourceforge.net/report/rep92.htm |language=English, Vietnamese |deadurl=no |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TTB"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Bài 4 – Thử tìm kiểu gõ dấu chữ Việt nhanh nhất|author=Trần Tư Bình|magazine=Chim Việt Cành Nam|issue=32|date=2008-08-14 |url=http://vietpali.sourceforge.net/binh/CachGhiNhanhVaGoNhanhChuViet_Bai4.htm |language=Vietnamese |deadurl=no |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the Vietnamese Standardization Group (Viet-Std, ''Nhóm Nghiên Cứu Tiêu Chuẩn Tiếng Việt'') from the TriChlor Software Group in [[California]] formalized the VIQR convention. It was described the next year in RFC 1456.

'''Walfrido Antão''' was a prolific ''[[cronista]]'' and short story writer in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] Goan press, becoming particularly active as this tradition breathed its last. The crónica is a journalistic form common in [[Iberia]] and [[Latin America]] and which was widely cultivated in [[Portuguese India|Portuguese Goa]]. It can be roughly defined as a literary text combining elements of the short story, the memoir and the opinion editorial. Born in Arossim, Antão contributed several hundred such articles to ''[[O Heraldo]]'' and ''Diário da Noite'' from the late 1950s until the demise or [[Anglicisation]] of these papers.

==''Crónicas''==
Antão's ''crónicas'' reflect his preoccupations with environmental concerns, Goan culture, the future of the Portuguese language in the territory, and issues related to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], of which he was one of the first promoters in [[Goa]] &lt;ref&gt;Melo e Castro, Paul.''Lengthening Shadows''. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short stories==
Antão's stories, like the rest of his journalistic output, seem influenced by what we could loosely term [[Existentialism|existentialist]] concerns, such as [[social alienation|alienation]], freedom, [[absurdity]], authenticity and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''Lengthening Shadows''. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, anecdote holds that Antão was an acquaintance of [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre's]] in [[Paris]] at the height of existentialism's influence and prestige. Yet Antão's treatment of existential themes is always mediated by his engagement with Goan actuality, his concerns about the dissolution of Goan identity and the destruction of the Goan landscape.&lt;ref&gt;''Lengthening Shadows''. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, before the environment became an issue, he allowed his brother-in-law to extract sand from the dunes on his ancestral property - that was later sold to Park Hyatt Resort, Arossim. The extent to which the author himself was touched by existential despair, which here could be conceptualized as a loss of hope concerning the signification and transformation of life, is open to debate. His texts certainly seem delicately balanced between positive and negative elements.&lt;ref&gt;''Lengthening Shadows''. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
