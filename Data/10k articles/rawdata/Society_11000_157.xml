'''Afro-Chileans''' are citizens of [[Chile]], descended from [[Afro-Latin Americans|Africans]] who were brought to the [[New World]] with the arrival of the Spaniards toward the end of the [[slave trade]]

==War of Independence==
A specific group of blacks in Chilean history are the members of the 8th Regiment of The Andean Liberation Army that fought the Spaniards in Chacabuco. That was the Army organized in Argentinian territory and led by San Martin to liberate Chile and later allow the liberation of Peru. San Martin demanded black slaves as contribution to the Liberation Army by the Mendoza landowners, because in his opinion blacks were the only people capable of participating in the infantry component of the Army, and included them in the forces commanded later by O'Higgins. They were included in the Andean Liberation Army and received their freedom after the crossing of the Andes and the fight against the Spaniards. As members of the infantry they were exposed to higher risks during  battle. This episode of the history of Chile is very seldom mentioned and the group of blacks has never received any recognition for their contribution to the liberation of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barros Arana|first=Diego|authorlink=Diego Barros Arana|format=PDF|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0005009.pdf|title=Historia General de Chile: La Colonia, de 1610 a 1700|trans-title=General History of Chile: The Colony from 1610 to 1700|language=es|publisher=University of Santiago de Chile Research Centre|volume=5|year=1999|isbn=956-11-1550-6|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

The African minority that lived in Santiago, [[Quillota]] or Valparaiso began to mix with [[Romani people|gypsies]], and Europeans, shaping a whole new ethnic and cultural identity for Chile.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Ban of slavery==
Chile banned [[slavery]] in 1811 through the "[[Liberty of womb]]" law made by Manuel de Salas, seven years after he had read the following announcement in a newspaper: "For sale: 22 to 24-year-old [[mulatto]], nice condition, good price." Thanks to this ban, dictated in 1823,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/business/slavery-the-antislavery-movement.html|title=The Antislavery Movement|encyclopedia=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|publisher=Columbia University Press|edition=6th|year=2012|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile became the second country in Latin America to prohibit slavery, after [[Haiti]].

Despite the [[Freedom of wombs|gradual emancipation]] of most black slaves in Chile, slavery continued along the Pacific coast of South America throughout the 19th century, as [[Blackbirding|Peruvian slave traders]] kidnapped [[Polynesians]], primarily from the [[Marquesas Islands]] and [[Easter Island]], and forced them to perform physical labour in mines and in the [[guano]] industry of Peru and Chile.

==Annexation of Arica==
Finally, there was one more event that added the African inheritance to the Chilean blood. When the city of Arica was finally integrated to Chile, in 1929, a lot of Afro-descendants began living under the Chilean law. They are part of the "Black Arica", and they work daily to promote their traditions and culture, proving that their influence goes beyond the "cueca" or "zamacueca".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rioseco |first=Virginia |url=http://www.nuestro.cl/eng/stories/people/oronegro.htm |title=Oro Negro Foundation:Afro descendants organize themselves |publisher=nuestro.cl |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201224728/http://www.nuestro.cl/eng/stories/people/oronegro.htm |archivedate=1 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3956">'''Al-Hadi Ghalib''' (1823 - September 30, 1885) was an [[Imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1851-1852, and made subsequent periodical claims to the [[imamate]] up to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] intervention in 1872.

==Rivalry for the imamate==

Ghalib bin Muhammad bin Yahya was the son of Imam [[al-Mutawakkil Muhammad]]. When his father was imprisoned and murdered in 1849, Ghalib managed to escape. He took refuge with the Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn tribes.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years a number of claimants to the position of imam appeared in the Yemeni highlands. In order to settle the uneasy matter a meeting was convened in 1851 at Al Rawdah, north of the capital [[San'a]]. The claimants agreed to accept whoever was appointed. Ghalib was one of those present, and was appointed under the name al-Hadi Ghalib. During his short imamate he entertained contacts with the Ottomans, who occupied the Yemeni lowlands ([[Tihamah]]). He took a submissive position vis-à-vis the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].&lt;ref&gt;Caesar E. Farah, ''The Sultan's Yemen; 19th-Century Challenges to Ottoman Rule''. London 2002, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaos and Ottoman takeover==

His reign was turbulent, since fighting broke out with a rival called Abbas. They each held a part of San'a. In view of the civil strife, many [[ulema]] left for other cities. In 1852, finally, al-Hadi Ghalib had to leave San'a and the inhabitants chose a governor (''wali''), the [[shaykh]] Ahmad al-Haymi. According to the [[United Kingdom|British]] political agent R.L. Playfair, he was once again acknowledged in name around 1858.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor al-Haymi was counted as his [[vizier|wazir]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, when al-Hadi Ghalib tried to enter San'a in 1857/58, the gates were closed in his face. The imam and his followers besieged San'a, but governor al-Haymi thwarted his ambitions. In the following year, al-Haymi, increasingly impopular among the city dwellers, was forced to flee San'a. The city was subsequently governed by another ''wali'', Muhsin Mu'id, in 1860-1872.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, 1983, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1870s Muhsin Mu'id expelled the current imam [[al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin]] and once again elevated al-Hadi Ghalib to the dignity.

In the meantime, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 gave a new impetus to the Turks to take a steadier grip on Yemen, in order to counter [[British people|British]] influence among the tribes of the region. The new imam and Muhsin Mu'id found reason to take on a welcoming attitude to the Turks, who marched into San'a in April 1872. With these events the Zaidi state founded in 1597 was terminated, although it arose again several decades later. Turkish administration was introduced and the impoverished imam was forbidden to mix with the chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, p. 92; Caesar E. Farah, pp. 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently lived on a monthly salary provided by the Ottoman authorities, until his death in [[Ar Rawdah, San‘A’|Al Rawdah]], just to the north of San'a, in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidi biographies, in http://www.al-aalam.com/personinfo.asp?pid=4236 (in Arabic).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aloisiuskolleg''' is a co-educational, [[Jesuit]] ([[Catholic church|Catholic]]), [[University-preparatory school]] in [[Bonn]]-[[Bad Godesberg]], Germany, which includes [[boarding school|boarders]]. It is named for Saint [[Aloysius Gonzaga]]. It has an excellent reputation and is considered one of the most prestigious boarding schools in Germany. Since early 2010 the school has been investigated for cases of child abuse.

== Organization ==
Since 1921 the [[Jesuit]]s have operated a boarding school for boys in Bonn Bad-Godesberg. Ninety-four percent of its budget is provided by German [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], even though the college is non-governmental, run by the Jesuits. The remaining 6% is covered by the Archdiocese of Cologne. The school is open to everyone. The State conducts the school-leaving examination (called the Abitur, the equivalent of A-levels in the UK) and proposes the subjects of instruction. In turn, the school is recognized by the State, and a successfully completed Abitur by any graduate allows admission to a German university. Lodging, food, and boarding run about €14,000 per year, while students from impoverished families are sponsored by the Jesuits or by the charge for other boarders.

== School competitions ==
The Aloisiuskolleg (AKO) ranks high each year at regional, national, and even international school competitions in sports, as well as in subjects like physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathepro.de/html/55__mathematikolympiade.html|title=55. Mathematikolympiade|website=www.mathepro.de|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; music, art, and computer sciences, and has won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aloisiuskolleg-bonn.de/deutsch/02_schule/03_schuleplus/01wettbewerbe.htm|title=Wettbewerbe|publisher=Aloisisuskolleg|language=German|accessdate=2009-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326082746/http://www.aloisiuskolleg-bonn.de/deutsch/02_schule/03_schuleplus/01wettbewerbe.htm|archivedate=2009-03-26|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PISA study ranked the school 4th in Germany and among the best in Europe. Also in other OECD studies the school is usually ranked highly.

== International co-operation ==
The College attaches importance to international contacts, and has promoted cultural exchange with other countries since its founding. Since 1997 this has included the [[European Union]]'s COMENIUS program which promotes co-operation among European schools. Partnerships exist with [[Clongowes Wood College]] (Ireland), [[Eton College]] and [[Maidenhead]] (both in [[England]]), and [[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|Georgetown Prep]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
As a consequence of the [[Kulturkampf]], the State of Prussia took over by law the supervision of all [[Jesuit]] schools in 1872. On 12 August 1900 the German province of the Society of Jesus opened the Aloisiuskolleg in [[Sittard]], [[Netherlands]], as an all-boys school with boarding facilities. This started with German nationals, 43 internal and 38 external pupils on 29 September 1900 with a pre-class and 5th and 6th grades. This was the beginning of the Aloisiuskollegs.

===Move to Bonn Bad-Godesberg; Nazi period===
The law against Jesuits ("Jesuitengesetz") was repealed in 1917 and new schools opened again in Germany. The Aloisiuskolleg moved to Bonn in 1921. In 1927 the Jesuits also acquired a nearby villa owned by the banker August Karl Baron von der Heydt, son of [[August von der Heydt]], and turned it into "Stella Rheni", a boys' home.

During the Nazi period, the school and the Jesuits opposed the regime and the school was closed in 1938. The active resistance by the Jesuits and the pupils plays an important role in the contemporary self-understanding of the College. Well-known resistors to the Nazis were [[Georg von Boeselager|Georg Freiherr von Boeselager]] and his brother [[Philipp von Boeselager|Philipp]]. The Jesuits reopened the Aloisiuskolleg in 1946, after the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aloisiuskolleg.de/geschichte|title=Geschichte {{!}} Aloisiuskolleg {{!}} Gymnasium der Jesuiten mit Internat für Mädchen und Jungen|website=www.aloisiuskolleg.de|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse of pupils===

== Co-education ==
In the 1980s, the Aloisiuskolleg along with nearby Clara Fey High School became co-educational in the upper classes: all students had their choice of either school. After 2002 the Aloisiuskolleg accepted girls in the lower classes, then in 2005 a separate boarding facility was built for girls.

==Facilities, buildings, and plant==
===School===
[[File:Sportplaetze.jpg|180px|right]]
The school is a U-shaped, three-storey building from the 1920s. In addition to classrooms it houses two rooms each for chemistry, physics, computers, and music along with a language laboratory and a library. Workmen's equipment is located under the gyms and includes welding devices, a joinery, and printing presses.

Between the school building and the newer boarding houses is the "Fathers Tower", a five-storey square tower in which the fathers lived since improvements in the 1970s. Prior to this, boarding schools with the youngest pupils were accommodated on the two upper floors, which gave the building the nickname "boys silo".

===Sports facilities===
The sports facilities include two gymnasiums next to the school building. In front of the gyms is a basketball court. The school yard also contains a basketball and handball court. Beyond the school yard on the way to Stella there is a football field, a tartan track, five tennis courts, and a half-court (wall-court).

===Stella Rheni===
[[File:Stella I.JPG|180px|right]]
{{Main|:de:Villa von der Heydt (Bad Godesberg)}}
In 1891-1893 the [[Elberfeld]] banker Baron Karl von der Heydt commissioned the "Castle on the Juniper" by the architect Heinrich Plange&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpub.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/edocs/dokumente/fbf/architektur/diss2004/kirchhoff/df0404.pdf Heinrich Plange: e.g., p. 458. Accessed 21 November 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; in neoclassical architecture and gave it the name "Stella Rheni" (Latin for "Star of the Rhine"). From this strictly geometrical building in yellow sandstone, you can enjoy a view over the [[Rhine]] valley and [[Siebengebirge]]. [[:de:Walter von Engelhardt|Walter von Engelhardt]] who also landscaped [[Charlottenburg]] laid out the extensive park. Since 1927, the Jesuit Villa has been used as a boarding school for young and middle-class boys.

===Jägerhaus===
[[File:Jaegerhaus.jpg|right|180px]]
The "Jägerhaus", formerly belonging to the Heydts, is a highly romantic miniature version of a hunting castle and lies about 200 meters below the Stella. Here the primary students used to live on their own, without supervision.

===New===
The new building was built together with the school building in the 1960s and was connected to the Fathers' Tower. It was L-shaped and was renovated in 2006. In the renovation a part of it was demolished and replaced by a newly-built rotunda: the classic L-shape was not retained. From the new building there is direct access to the rotunda.

===Girls' house===
The girls' house was finished in September 2005 after a year of construction on the former fruit orchards opposite the school, by the office of architects Pilhatsch &amp; Partner. The girls' house opened in the summer of 2006, since in the transitional period the building was used for the boys who were boarding, who had to leave the old "new building" temporarily because of renovation work.

===Church===
[[File:KircheAlph2.png|180px|right]]
An octagonal church was built in the early 1980s, on the site of a dilapidated church from the 1960s. The showpiece of the church is a bronze sculpture of an angel by Ewald Mataré.

== Alumni ==
Former pupils of the school can remain connected through the alumni network. Former pupils of the Aloisiuskolleg, [[Kolleg St. Blasien]], and the [[Canisius-Kolleg Berlin]] College can find addresses at Stellaner webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stellaner.de|title=Home - Stellaner-Vereinigung Deutschlands e.V.|website=Stellaner-Vereinigung Deutschlands e.V.|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For alumni of the Aloisiuskolleg there is a special association, found at Aloisiuskolleg Alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aloisiuskolleg-alumni.de|title=Aloisiuskolleg Alumni: Startseite|website=www.aloisiuskolleg-alumni.de|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5403">The '''Aronson Prize''' ({{lang-de|Aronson-Preis}}) is a prize awarded for achievements in [[microbiology]] and [[immunology]]. It was established by the [[Will and testament|will]] of the pediatrician and bacteriologist [[Hans Aronson]] and has been awarded since 1921. Aronson bequeathed a large part of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] to the establishment of the prize. The prize is awarded biannually on 8 March, the date of Aronson's death.

In 1969, the foundation that awarded the prize was dissolved on the initiative of its last chairman [[Georg Henneberg]], and the responsibility for the prize and the remaining capital was transferred to the (West) Berlin government, in order to safeguard the existence of the prize. Since 1970, the prize has been awarded by the [[Senate of Berlin]].

The first laureate was [[August von Wassermann]]. Among the Aronson laureates are several scientists who later were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], such as [[Karl Landsteiner]] and [[Gerhard Domagk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Henneberg]]: ''Die Geschichte der Stiftung für experimentelle Therapie – Aronson-Stiftung'', Berlin, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund''' (AALDEF) is a New York-based national organization founded in 1974 that protects and promotes the civil rights of Asian Americans. By combining litigation, advocacy, education, and organizing, AALDEF works with Asian American communities across the country to secure human rights for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asianamericanalliance.com/AALDEF.html | title = Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | publisher = Asian American Alliance | archiveurl = http://www.asianamericanalliance.com/AALDEF.html | archivedate = 2011-03-31 | quote = The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund has been set up to help Asian Americans for needs that they may have. The AALDEF is for Asian law needs. They are an Asian American association of individuals who have practiced Asian law or those who wish to practice Asian law. The AALDEF provides free Asian law advice to any of those in need.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1974, a small group of lawyers, activists and students in Lower [[Manhattan]] came together to create a new organization focused on the legal needs of the Asian American community. AALDEF was the first nonprofit organization on the East Coast to focus specifically on defending the civil rights of the Asian American community.

'''The 1970s'''

Some early AALDEF advocacy efforts included: calling for the hiring of Chinese American construction workers at Confucius Plaza in Manhattan's Chinatown and mounting a campaign to stop the deportation of Filipino doctors, who had been recruited to fill the shortage of medical personnel in the United States.  AALDEF volunteer attorneys represented Chinese Americans arrested in a protest against police brutality in Manhattan's Chinatown and joined a rally to support an innocent bystander, Peter Yew, who was beaten by police after complaining about their mishandling of a minor traffic incident. In 1977, AALDEF organized free legal advice clinics at Hamilton-Madison House, Korean Senior Citizens Society, and other community agencies in New York City.  In an early affirmative action case, AALDEF intervened on behalf of the Asian American Law Students Association in ''Doherty v. Rutgers Law School'', defending the inclusion of Asian Americans in minority admissions programs in a lawsuit brought by rejected white law school applicant. AALDEF also filed an ''amicus'' brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Fullilove v. Kreps'', supporting the public works set-aside provision of minority businesses, including Asian American enterprises.

'''The 1980s'''

Economic justice was a primary focus in the 1980s. AALDEF represented the Chinese immigrant waiters at Silver Palace restaurant in Manhattan's Chinatown. The workers, who were fired for protesting against the employer who stole their tips, later formed the first independent Chinatown restaurant workers' union in the nation. At the first-ever rally of 15,000 Chinese garment workers at New York Chinatown's Columbus Park, who went on strike for a new Local 23-25 ILGWU union contract, AALDEF was the only community organization invited to speak at this rally because it took a clear stand in support of the labor rights of low-wage immigrant workers. AALDEF also filed [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]]s in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting the rights of undocumented immigrants to receive a public education (''Plyler v. Doe'') and to organize under the National Labor Relations Act (''Sure-Tan v. NLRB'').

AALDEF was active in two national campaigns generating broad pan-Asian American support across the country. The first involved a demand for the federal civil rights prosecution of the murderers of Vincent Chin, the Chinese American engineer beaten to death by two unemployed auto workers in Detroit. The second was the movement for redress for Japanese Americans, who were incarcerated during World War II solely because of their race and national origin. AALDEF testified in support of Japanese American redress before the U.S. Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, which led to the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Civil rights hero Fred Korematsu made his first public appearance in New York City for AALDEF's 10th anniversary celebration at Lincoln Center, featuring the East Coast premiere of Steven Okazaki's film,'' Unfinished Business'', about the Japanese American redress movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Margolick, [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/24/nyregion/legal-legend-urges-victims-to-speak-out.html Legal Legend Urges Victims to Speak Out], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nov. 24, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a local level, AALDEF represented Dr. Kaushal Sharan, one of several South Asians attacked in Jersey City by a hate group named the "dotbusters." Although federal civil rights charges against his assailants were dropped,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/19/nyregion/civil-rights-charges-dropped-in-beating-of-asian-indian-physician.html Civil Rights Charges Dropped in Beating of Asian Indian Physician], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 19, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; AALDEF then worked to secure passage of a hate crimes law in New Jersey and testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights about the rise in anti-Asian violence. AALDEF participated in the formation of the Coalition Against Anti-Asian Violence (now called CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities), which organized the first educational forum in New York City on hate violence against Asian Americans.

As to housing and environmental justice, AALDEF launched a fight against gentrification and the displacement of low-income immigrant tenants in Manhattan's Chinatown. AALDEF organized the first Chinatown housing fair in New York City, designed to educate residents about rent control and other rent regulation laws and the prohibitions against tenant harassment. In ''Jin v. Board of Estimate,'' AALDEF filed an ''amicus'' brief in NY state court, arguing that English-language notices of zoning changes violated the due process rights of Chinese-speaking tenants. This favorable decision was later reversed on appeal. AALDEF then litigated ''Chinese Staff and Workers' Association v. City of New York,'' and won a landmark New York Court of Appeals case . The state's high court ruled for the first time that new residential developments that may displace low-income tenants and small businesses are subject to environmental review.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Schmalz, [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/19/nyregion/appeals-court-bars-chinatown-building-till-effect-is-studied.html Appeals Court Bars Chinatown Building Till Effect is Studied], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nov. 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision blocked the construction of a proposed high-rise luxury condominium tower in Chinatown until an environmental assessment statement was prepared.

In 1985, the North Star Fund presented AALDEF with the Frederick Douglass Award for "outstanding contributions to the struggle for political, social and economic justice."

'''The 1990s'''

In 1993, when the Golden Venture freighter ran aground in Far Rockaway, Queens, AALDEF was among the first legal groups to gain access to the Varick Street detention center where hundreds of Chinese nationals were being held.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lee Myers, [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/nyregion/us-releases-4-of-the-chinese-seized-from-ship.html], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 11, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; AALDEF later represented Chinese immigrants seeking political asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Faison [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/nyregion/7-bodies-of-asian-immigrants-unidentified-after-3-weeks.html 7 Bodies of Asian Immigrants Unidentified After 3 Weeks], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 26, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, AALDEF supported Actors' Equity Association to protest the casting of a white British actor in a lead Asian role in the Broadway musical, ''Miss Saigon."&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn Rothstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/10/theater/equity-will-reconsider-miss-saigon-decision.html?pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all] Equity Will Reconsider 'Miss Saigon' Decision], [[The New York Times]] Aug. 10, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; AALDEF worked with the New York City Human Rights Commission to organize hearings on the discriminatory hiring practices of Broadway theater producers.

In 1992, AALDEF was the only Asian American group invited to testify before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on expanding minority language assistance under the Voting Rights Act, affecting 200,000 Asian Americans nationwide.

AALDEF led the advocacy efforts to secure the first fully translated Chinese-language voting machine ballots in New York City under the Voting Rights Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Dunn, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/nyregion/bilingual-ballot-law-fails-to-help-chinese-american-voters.html Bilingual Ballot Law Fails to Help Chinese American Voters], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Aug. 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial opposition by the NYC Board of Elections, the Board changed its position after receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice denying preclearance of its language assistance program under the Voting Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Dunn, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/nyregion/board-agrees-on-ballots-in-chinese.html Board Agrees on Ballots in Chinese], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Aug. 25, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The 2000s'''

After 9/11/01 AALDEF, located just eight blocks from the World Trade Center, convened a series of emergency meetings with Chinatown and Lower Manhattan advocates to begin the rebuilding process and address the environmental health, housing, and employment problems of displaced residents and workers. As part of the Beyond Ground Zero Network, AALDEF helped to establish a free clinic at Bellevue Hospital to provide treatment for residents and workers with 9/11-related health problems. AALDEF also defended the rights of South Asians, Arabs, Jews, Iranians, and Muslims who were detained without any criminal charges or evidence of wrongdoing. AALDEF challenged the unfair enforcement of post-9/11 immigration laws and counseled hundreds of immigrants facing deportation at legal clinics.

In 2005, AALDEF launched its Anti-Trafficking Initiative to provide legal assistance to Asian women and girls who are survivors of human trafficking.  In a 2009 case, AALDEF represented a Filipino woman who sued her employer, a consular official, when she was forced to work as a domestic worker for $100 per month and prevented from leaving the residence.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Semple, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/nyregion/10nurse.html?_r=0 Nurse Claims Employer Enslaved Her], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She overcame her employer's defense of diplomatic immunity to her claims of human trafficking, involuntary servitude, and forced labor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leagle.com/decision/2009782627mfsupp2d155_1770 ''Baoanan v. Baja''&lt;/ref&gt; and the case was resolved.

With respect to educational equity, AALDEF filed several civil rights complaints on behalf of Asian immigrant students subjected to racial violence and harassment at Lafayette high School &lt;ref&gt;Liz Willen, [http://hechingerreport.org/content/lafayette-lessons-attacks-on-asian-students-mirror-experience-at-brooklyn-school_2256/ Lafayette lessons: Attacks on Asian students mirror experience at Brooklyn school], [[The Hechinger Report]], Apr. 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and at South Philadelphia High School.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Gammage and Kristen A.

'''The 2010s'''

In 2012, AALDEF won a $1.2 million judgment in a human trafficking civil suit on behalf of a Filipina domestic worker subjected to involuntary servitude and forced labor in Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle R. Smith, [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/uae-officer-ordered-to-pay-1.2m-to-former-worker/article/feed/2059301], [[Washington Examiner]], December 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
AALDEF represents individuals and community groups that are most directly affected by racial and economic injustice: immigrants, the working poor, and persons not yet proficient in English.  From Chinese take-out delivery workers in New York and Nepalese domestic workers in New Jersey, to Vietnamese American youth in Louisiana and Bangladeshi voters in Michigan, AALDEF addresses the legal needs of diverse Asian American groups.

AALDEF has litigated several precedent-setting cases on behalf of low-wage Asian immigrant workers, winning millions of dollars in back wages and overtime pay owed to these workers in the restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;Adam B. Ellick, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/nyregion/31daniel.html Boulud Settling Suit Alleging Bias at a French Restaurant], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Faiola, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/24/AR2007082402123_pf.html 30 Immigrants On Bikes Deliver A Labor Revolt], [[The Washington Post]], Aug. 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and nail salon industries.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Gonnerman, [http://nymag.com/beauty/features/41281/ The Manicurists' Heroine], [[New York magazine]],Nov. 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Greenhouse, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/nyregion/19nails.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 At Nail Salons, Beauty Treatments Can Have a Distinctly Unglamorous Side], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Aug. 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By working in multiracial coalitions, AALDEF has brought Asian American perspectives to policy debates and organized campaigns to stop hate violence, police misconduct and human trafficking.  After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, AALDEF defended the civil liberties of South Asians, Arabs, Jews, Iranians, and Muslims who were the targets of racial and ethnic profiling. AALDEF has worked with grassroots groups to promote [[educational equity]] and youth rights and to ensure that Asian Americans have a greater voice in the political process.  AALDEF has trained hundreds of young lawyers and students through its internship programs, encouraging Asian Americans to use their legal skills to serve the community.

AALDEF has a 14-person staff, including six attorneys. The organization works with more than 300 volunteers, including pro bono attorneys, community workers, and students. AALDEF receives financial support from foundations, corporations, individual contributions and special fundraising events. AALDEF receives no government funds.

==The Asian American Exit Poll==
There is relatively little data about the voting patterns of Asian Americans. Asian American voters often are overlooked by the mainstream media and by candidates for political office. As a result, mainstream exit polls typically report racial breakdowns for whites, African Americans, Latinos and "others." When the media neglect the Asian American vote, candidates often follow suit.

Multilingual exit polls give a fuller and more accurate portrait of Asian American voters than polls conducted in English.  AALDEF conducted its first exit poll in 1988 in New York City. In the 2008 elections, AALDEF's Asian American Exit Poll reported on the preferences of almost 17,000 Asian American voters in 11 states and Washington, D.C. In the 2009 New York City elections, AALDEF's exit poll found that Asian American voters overwhelmingly supported Asian American candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer 8. Lee, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/poll-finds-asians-overwhelmingly-backed-liu/Poll Finds Asians Overwhelmingly Backed Liu], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Sept. 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 elections, AALDEF polled 9,096 Asian American voters in 14 states and Washington, D.C.

"The Asian American Vote in 2016" is AALDEF's most recent report on the 2016 multilingual exit poll of 13,846 Asian American voters in 14 states. One news report suggested that Asian American support for President Trump was overstated in national exit polls, which did not survey voters in multiple Asian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Hansi Lo Wang, [https://www.npr.org/2017/04/18/524371847/trump-lost-more-of-the-asian-american-vote-than-the-national-exit-polls-showed Trump Lost More Of The Asian-American Vote Than The National Exit Polls Showed], [[NPR]].

The '''Association of State Green Parties''' was an organization of state Green Parties in the United States between 1996 and 2001.  In 2001, it evolved into the [[Green Party of the United States]].

== Founding ==

In the aftermath of the first Green presidential campaign in 1996, 62 Greens from 30 states gathered over the weekend of November 16–17, 1996 to [http://www.gp.org/1996-founding-meeting found] the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). The meeting was held at the historic [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221831/http://www.pinkpillbox.com/glenora.htm Glen-Ora Farm] in Middleburg, Virginia where [[Jack Kennedy]] had his weekend retreat in his administration's early days (rented to the president by the mother of ASGP meeting host and Nader supporter [[Elaine Broadhead]].)

Green Parties from 13 states were the founding members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Rensenbrink |url=http://www.mainegreens.org/directaction/voices/jrensen/middle.htm |title=Maine Greens - John Rensenbrink - Report on the ASGP Middleburg Meeting 1996 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015061938/http://www.mainegreens.org/directaction/voices/jrensen/middle.htm |archivedate=October 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and approved an initial set of bylaws that set out the ASGP's purpose: (1) Assist in the development of State Green Parties and (2) Create a legally structured national Green Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/greenpages/content/volume1/issue1/article6.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010051/http://www.gp.org/greenpages/content/volume1/issue1/article6.php |date=May 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding meeting also established a national newsletter Green Pages, which carries forward today as the newspaper of the GPUS. The founding editor was [[Mike Feinstein]].

Subsequent ASGP meetings occurred in [http://www.gp.org/1997-association-of-state-green-parties-spring-meeting Portland], OR (April 5–6, 1997), [http://www.gp.org/1997-association-of-state-green-parties Topsham], ME (October 3–5, 1997),[http://www.gp.org/1998-association-of-state-green-parties Santa Fe], NM (April 24–26, 1998), [http://www.gp.org/1999-association-of-state-green-parties Moodus], CT (June 5–6, 1999) and Hiawassee, GA (December 8–10, 2000). [[Ralph Nader]] appeared in Moodus to talk about running for president the next year.

The concept of the ASGP came out of the 1991 national Greens Gathering in Elkins, West Virginia, where a committee was tasked with examining what an eventual Green Party might look it.  The committee produced a report with contributions from six authors, among them [[Greg Gerritt]] from Maine. Gerritt's suggestion was for the creation of an Association of State Green Parties based on sovereign state parties, essentially as he argued, how all parties end up structured in the US.  The reaction within the GPUSA was, according to Gerritt, to throw him out of the GPUSA. But that did not kill the concept. Instead it was shared by those involved in the establishment of the [[Green Politics Network]] in 1992, and what was founded in 1996 in Middleburg very closely reflected the proposal Gerritt originally submitted.

== ASGP and the Greens/Green Party USA ==

The ASGP was predominantly focused on establishing state Green Parties and running and electing Greens for public office, even while its member state parties and the individual Greens involved remained involved in issue activism. From 1997 to 1999, as more state Green Parties continued to form, a highly competitive environment between the ASGP and the [[Greens/Green Party USA]] (G/GPUSA) began to develop in terms of who would affiliate with which organization, and ultimately who would become the definitive national Green Party. To some extent this divide reflected philosophical differences within U.S. Greens that went back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, around how a Green political party should be organized - based upon state parties, or upon dues-paying local Green groups.

In December 1999, Santa Monica, CA Green City Councilmember [[Mike Feinstein]] and New York Green [[Howie Hawkins]] met in New Platz, New York during the state meeting of the Green Party of New York State and crafted the ''''Plan for a Single National Green Party''', which was more generally known as the Feinstein/Hawkins Proposal, meant to create a single national Green Party from among the ASGP and GPUSA by Earth Day, April 2000. The proposal found quick support within the ASGP, but not within the Greens/GPUSA in time for Earth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenparty.org/gatheringminutes.php |title=The Greens/Green Party USA |publisher=Greenparty.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boston Proposal ==

Instead it would be in October 2000 that the Feinstein/Hawkins proposal was revisited, negotiated further and renamed the 'Boston Proposal' or 'Boston Agreement' (so named because it was negotiated in [[Boston]] on October 1–2 in the days before the first 2000 presidential debate).&lt;ref name="greens1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org/~jsutter/boston.html |title=Boston ASGP-G/GPUSA joint proposal, 2 Oct 2000 |publisher=Greens.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negotiators for the Association of State Green Parties were [[Tony Affigne]], [[David Cobb]], [[Robert Franklin (activist)|Robert Franklin]], [[Greg Gerritt]], [[Anne Goeke]], [[Stephen Herrick]], and [[Tom Sevigny]]; and for the Greens/Green Party USA: [[Starlene Rankin]], [[John Stith]], [[Jeff Sutter]],  [[Steve Welzer]], [[Rich Whitney]], and [[Julia Willebrand]].
 
The Boston Proposal was approved was by the ASGP at its December 2000 meeting in Hiawasee, GA, but did not pass at the July 2001 G/GPUSA Congress in Carbondale, CO. This caused a schism in G/GPUSA membership from which it never recovered. The next week on July 29 in Santa Barbara, CA the ASGP voted to become the [[Green Party of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_30_01.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030424033902/http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_30_01.html |date=April 24, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; held a press conference in Santa Monica on July 30 to announce it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGZa8QFvkk |title=Green Party of the United States - founding press conference |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently recognized as having National Committee status&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/fec-recognition ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609142829/http://www.gp.org/fec-recognition |date=June 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Federal Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/press/pr_11_08_01.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605042149/http://www.gp.org/press/pr_11_08_01.html |date=June 5, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Text of the Boston Proposal:&lt;ref name="greens1"/&gt; JOINT PROPOSAL OF NEGOTIATING COMMITTEES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF STATE GREEN PARTIES and THE GREENS/GREEN PARTY USA

The Negotiating Committees of the Association of State Green Parties and the Greens/Green Party USA, meeting on October 1–2, 2000, have agreed unanimously to recommend to their respective organizations the following proposal for the creation of a new national Green Party, to be called "Green Party of the United States," and a National Committee of the Green Party, which will apply to the Federal Election Commission for official recognition as a national political party.

'''1.''' The Greens/Green Party USA may continue as an independent organization but will cease functioning as a political party and will adopt a new name that will omit the word, "party." It will relinquish the domain name, "www.greenparty.org" to the new party.

'''2.''' The Green Party shall leave the question of state dues entirely to the state parties and shall neither encourage state parties to collect dues nor discourage state parties from collecting dues.

'''3.''' The new Green Party shall have a paid "sustaining members" category of membership and shall encourage members of all state parties to become sustaining members of the national organization.

'''4.''' State parties in the new Green Party shall have written democratic by-laws and at least one convention a year (whether it be a general membership assembly or a delegate assembly elected by locals and members-at-large).

'''5.''' State Green Parties shall make a good faith effort, where reasonable, to have delegates to the National Committee elected by clusters of local groups. The basis of representation to the National Committee shall be one person, one vote, and in the United States, Congressional Districts are a reasonable approximation of equal population areas. Local groups within a Congressional District or Districts shall come together for the purpose of electing delegates. (Statement of intent: The exact number of delegates and the size of the areas to be used for selecting these delegates is currently under study and will be determined by the ASGP.)

'''6.''' Representation to the National Committee shall be based on the principle of one delegate per specified number of Congressional Districts, provided that there is a requisite level of Green Party activity, electoral and/or non-electoral, being conducted in those Congressional Districts.

'''7.''' The Accreditation Criteria of the Green Party National Committee shall include the following in addition to the criteria currently used by the ASGP:
'''a.''' Evidence of commitment to, and good faith efforts to achieve, gender balance in party leadership and representation.
'''b.''' Evidence of good faith efforts to empower individuals and groups from oppressed communities, through, for example, leadership responsibilities, identity caucuses and alliances with community-based organizations, and endorsements of issues and policies.

'''8.''' The Green Party National Committee shall reserve seats for representatives of nationally organized caucuses for traditionally disempowered groups, provided that each caucus shall demonstrate a total membership of at least 100 people, from at least 15 member states, use democratic procedures and choose to send representatives to the National Committee.

'''9.''' The G/GPUSA Negotiating Committee recommends to the affiliates of G/GPUSA that a mail referendum of the Green Congress be initiated. The referendum shall ask the Congress to authorize the G/GPUSA National Committee to certify whether the ASGP, at its December 2000 meeting, amends its bylaws to reflect the terms of this joint proposal. The mail referendum will also authorize the G/GPUSA National Committee to (a) adopt a new name that will omit the word "party"; (b) relinquish the domain name "www.greenparty.org" to the new party; and (c) support the request of the ASGP for an advisory opinion on the national committee status of the new party, provided that it does in fact certify that the ASGP has amended its bylaws in accordance with this proposal.

== ASGP and Nader 2000 presidential campaign ==

In September 1998, the New Mexico Green Party proposed that an ASGP Presidential Exploratory Committee be established for the 2000 elections. The ASGP Coordinating Committee passed the proposal on October 30, and on December 20 the ASGP Steering Committee appointed a seven-person committee, chaired by then Texas Green [[David Cobb]]. On February 22, 1999 the Committee sent a letter and questionnaire to prospective presidential and vice presidential candidates, asking if they were interested in running on the Green Party ticket in 2000 and if so, how would they envision conducting the campaign: [[Wendell Berry]], [[Jerry Brown]], [[Lester Brown]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Ronald Daniels (politician)|Ron Daniels]], [[Ron Dellums]], [[Lani Guinier]],  [[Dan Hamburg]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Paul Hawken]], [[Jim Hightower]], [[Molly Ivins]], [[Winona LaDuke]],  [[Bill McKibben]], [[Cynthia McKinney]], [[Toni Morrison]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Ron Ouellette]] (requested the questionnaire), [[John Robbins (politician)|John Robbins]] and [[Jan Schlichtmann]]. On May 10 the committee also sent the letter and questionnaire to: [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Joycelyn Elders]], [[Kurt Schmoke]], [[Studs Terkel]], [[Myrlie Evers-Williams]] and Gen. [[George Lee Butler]].

Brown, McKibben, Chomsky, Guinier, Hawken, Miller wrote back declining, but all graciously thanking the ASGP for its outreach, and offering sympathetic statements of support for the Green Party project.

Nader also replied: "If I seek the nomination - a decision that will not be made until next year- and receive that designation, I will pursue a dedicated and thorough campaign that meets the Federal Election Commission requirements. Such an active campaign will have the objective of strengthening our nation’s democracy by strengthening the Green Party movement at the local, state and national levels; by emphasizing the problems of, and remedies for, the excessive concentration of corporate power and wealth in our country, by highlighting the important tools of democracy needed for the American people as voters/citizens, workers, consumers, taxpayers, and small savers/investors. If there are Greens who support my seeking the nomination, I encourage them to expand the number of volunteers and increase the time spent working to build the Green Party this year in order to advance the Party’s “Key Values” and to increase the likelihood of ballot access in all fifty states."

The pair appeared on 44 state ballots and received 2,883,105 votes, or 2.7 percent of all votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;f=0 |title=2000 Presidential General Election Results |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=Atlas of US Presidential Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader's strong showing in several states solidified the changes in the Green Party, transforming it from an "anti-party party" to an organization primarily dedicated to electoral campaigns. In particular, that was the widespread understanding of thousands of recruits to the party, as it went through an unprecedented rate of growth.

== International ==

In April 2001, the ASGP was represented at the founding congress of the [[Global Greens]] by [[Mike Feinstein]], [[Annie Goeke]] and [[John Rensenbrink]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0413-03.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011093504/http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0413-03.htm |date=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASGP was also a founding member party of the [[Federacíon de Partidos Verdes de las Americas]] in 1998.

'''Baghdad Jewish Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|عربية يهودية بغدادية}}) is the [[Arabic dialect]] spoken by the [[Jew]]s of [[Baghdad]] and other towns of Southern [[Iraq]]. This dialect differs from the dialect spoken by the Jews in Northern Iraq, such as [[Mosul]] and [['Ana]].  The Baghdadi and Northern dialects may be regarded as subvarieties of [[Judeo-Iraqi Arabic]]. As with most [[Judeo-Arab]] communities, there are likely to be few, if any, speakers of the Judeo-Iraqi Arabic dialects who still reside within Iraq. Rather these dialects have been maintained or are facing critical endangerment within respective Judeo-Iraqi diasporas, namely those of [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]. In 2014, the film ''[[Farewell Baghdad (2014 film)|Farewell Baghdad]]'' ([[Arabic]]: مطير الحمام; [[Hebrew]]: מפריח היונים, lit. "The Dove Flyer"), which is performed mostly in Jewish Baghdadi Arabic dialect, became the first film to be almost completely performed in [[Judeo-Iraqi Arabic]].

==Classification==
Baghdad Jewish Arabic (and Baghdadi Christian Arabic) resemble the [[North Mesopotamian Arabic|dialect of Northern Iraq]], and more distantly [[Syrian Arabic|that of Syria]], rather than the [[Baghdad Arabic]] spoken by the Muslims.  The Muslim dialect is classified as a ''gilit'' dialect (from their pronunciation of the Arabic word for "I said") while the others are ''qeltu'' dialects. Another resemblance between Baghdad Jewish Arabic and North Mesopotamian Arabic is the pronunciation of ''ra'' as a [[Guttural R|uvular]].  This peculiarity goes back centuries: in medieval Iraqi Judaeo-Arabic manuscripts the letters ''ra'' and ''ghayn'' are frequently interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Avishur, ''Studies in Judaeo-Arabic Translations of the Bible''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the ''qeltu'' dialects represent the older Arabic dialect of Mesopotamia while the ''gilit'' dialect is of Bedouin origin.  Another factor may be the northern origins of the Jewish community of Baghdad after 1258 (see below under [[#History|History]]).  Like Northern Mesopotamian and Syrian Arabic, Jewish Baghdadi Arabic shows some signs of an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] substrate.  Violette Shamosh&lt;ref&gt;''Memories of Eden: A Journey through Baghdad''&lt;/ref&gt; records that, at the [[Passover Seder]], she could understand some of the passages in Aramaic but none of the passages in Hebrew.

==History==
The Mongol invasion wiped out most of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia. Later, the original qeltu Baghdadi dialect became extinct as a result of massive Bedouin immigrations to Lower Mesopotamia and was replaced by the Bedouin influenced Gelet dialect. The Jews of Baghdad are a largely indigenous population and they also preserve the pre-Mongol invasion dialect of Baghdad in its Jewish form, which is similar but a bit different from the general pre-Mongol Baghdadi dialect due to the linguistic influences of Hebrew and Judeo-Babylonian Aramaic, instead of the general Babylonian Aramaic that existed before the Islamic invasion.

As with other respective religious and ethnic communities coexisting in Baghdad, the Jewish community had almost exclusively spoken as well as written in their distinctive dialect, largely drawing their linguistic influences from [[Hebrew]] and [[Judeo-Aramaic]] and even non-linguistic influences from languages such as Sumerian, Akkadian, Persian and Turkish. Simultaneous fluency and literacy in the Arabic used by the dominant Muslim communities had also been commonplace.

With waves of persecution and thus emigration, the dialect has been carried to and until recently used within respective Judeo-Iraqi diaspora communities, spanning [[Bombay]], [[Calcutta]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Manchester]] and numerous other international urban hubs. After the mass emigration of Jews from Iraq to [[Israel]] between the 1940s and 1960s, Israel came to hold the single largest linguistic community of Judeo-Iraqi Arabic speakers. With successive generations being born and raised in Israel, it is mainly the older people who still actively or passively speak Judeo-Baghdadi and other forms of Judeo-Iraqi Arabic. Israelis of Iraqi descent in turn are largely unilingual [[Israeli Hebrew]] speakers.

==Orthography==
The Jews of Baghdad also have a written [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] that differs from the spoken language and uses [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew characters]].&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1991, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a sizeable published religious literature in the language, including several [[Bible translations into Arabic#Jewish|Bible translations]] and the ''Qanūn an-nisā''' ({{lang|ar|قانون النساء}} of the [[hakham]] [[Yosef Hayyim]].

The following method of describing the letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] was used by teachers in Baghdad until quite recently:&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1991, pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

JB is relatively conservative in preserving [[Classical Arabic]] phonemes. Classical Arabic {{IPA|/q/}} has remained as an uvular (or post-velar) stop,{{efn|Though in a few phrases it has become {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, e.g. ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;īd mən wára w-&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;īd mən jəddām'' 'one hand behind and one in front' (said when someone returns emptyhanded).}} like Christian Baghdad Arabic, but unlike in Muslim Baghdad Arabic where it is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡ]}}. {{IPA|/k/}} is retained as {{IPA|[k]}}, like in Christian Baghdadi, but unlike the Muslim dialect where it is sometimes {{IPA|[tʃ]}}. Classical Arabic interdental {{IPA|/ð, θ, ðˠ/}} are preserved, like in Muslim Baghdadi Arabic (Christian Baghdadi Arabic merges them into {{IPA|/d, t, dˤ/}}). {{IPA|/dˤ/}} has merged into {{IPA|/ðˠ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1991, pp. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few rare minimal pairs with {{IPA|/lˠ, bˠ/}} (e.g. ''wáḷḷa'' 'by God! (an oath)' vs. ''wálla'' 'he went away', ''ḅāḅa'' 'father, dad' vs. ''bāba'' 'her door'). In other words, there are velarized segments which cannot be demonstrated to be phonemic, but which cannot be substituted, e.g. ''ṃāṃa'' 'mother, mummy'.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1991, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a certain degree of velarization harmony.

{{IPA|/r/}} is one of the primary distinguishing features of Jewish (as opposed to Muslim, Christian) Baghdadi Arabic. Older Arabic {{IPA|/r/}} has shifted to {{IPA|/ɣ/}} (as in Christian, but not Muslim, Baghdadi Arabic). However {{IPA|/r/}} has been re-introduced in non-Arabic loans (e.g. ''brāxa'' 'blessing' &lt; [[Hebrew|Heb.]] ברכה, ''qūri'' 'teapot' &lt; [[Persian language|Pers.]] ''qūrī''). Modern loan words from other [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]] also have this sound; this sometimes leads to cases where the same word may have two forms depending on context, e.g. ''ʿáskaġ'' 'army' vs. ''ḥākəm ʿáskari'' 'martial law'. There are many instances where this alternation leads to a subtle change in meaning, e.g. ''faġġ'' 'he poured, served foot' vs. ''farr'' 'he threw'.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1991, pp. 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonants {{IPA|/p, ɡ, tʃ/}} were originally of foreign origin, but have pervaded the language to the extent that native speakers do not perceive or even realize their non-native origin.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1991, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bayad''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongol]]: Баяд/Bayad, ''lit. "the Riches"'') is the third largest subgroup of the [[Mongols]] in [[Mongolia]] and they are a tribe in [[Four Oirats]]. Bayads were a prominent clan within the [[Mongol Empire]].  Bayads can be found in both Mongolic and Turkic peoples. Within Mongols, the clan is spread through [[Khalkha]], [[Inner Mongolia]]ns, [[Buryats]] and [[Oirats]].

The Bayid are originated from Bayaud (Bayagud) tribes called Jida Bayagud (Bayaud of Jida river), Bayaud Duklas, Kheeriin Bayaud, who were inhabitants of eastern valleys of [[Selenge River]]. The Bayad Mongols were inhabitants of the [[:ru:Джида (река)|Jida river]], [[Selenge River]] valleys and Russian [[Kyakhtinsky District]] but they moved to the southwest in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="HM"&gt;History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

They played influential roles in the [[Mongol Empire]], later becoming part of the [[Four Oirat]] confederation.

[[File:Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus 20.JPG|thumb|Goths warrior of "Sarcophagus Ludovisi" with backless wearing a "braccae" baggy knickerbockers, first used by the Celts and then extended to the other barbarian tribes]]



'''Braccae''' is the Latin term for ''trousers'', and in this context is today used to refer to a style of [[trousers]], made from [[wool]]. According to the Romans, this style of clothing originate from the [[Gauls]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca Historica''&lt;/ref&gt;

Braccae were typically made with a drawstring, and tended to reach from just above the knee at the shortest, to the ankles at the longest, with length generally increasing in tribes living further north.

When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] first encountered the braccae, they thought them to be effeminate (Roman men typically wore [[tunic]]s, which were one-piece outfits terminating at or above the knee). 

==Etymology==
The word originates from the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] ''bhrāg-ikā,'' after going through a process of [[Syncope (phonology)|syncopation]] it gave rise to ''braca'' 'trouser, pants'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=C3BKPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Delamarre+dictionnaire+Gaulois&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifvp2YrPLWAhUBSRoKHfGsD1QQ6AEIJjAA|title=Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise: Une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental|last=Delamarre|first=Xavier|date=2008|publisher=Errance|isbn=9782877723695|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vindobona Hoher Markt-78.JPG|thumb|Chained Germanic, 2nd century A.D. Bronze. The prisoner wears braccae that were typical for Germanics. His hair is tied in a suebian knot.]]
The word is [[cognate]] with the English ''breeches''. It appears to derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''bhrg''- 'break', here apparently used in the sense 'divide', 'separate', as in [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|briogais}} or in [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|bragoù}} and {{lang|cy|brycan/brogau}} in [[Welsh Language|Welsh]]. The Celtic form may have first passed to the [[Etruscans]], who did not distinguish between the "c" and "g" sounds. Transition through the Etruscans accounts for the Greek {{transl|grc|amorge}} being rendered as Latin {{lang|la|amurca}}, Greek {{lang|grc|κυβερνἂν}} ({{transl|grc|kubernân}}) as Latin {{lang|la|gubernare}}.

The '''Dambazawa''' (or '''Danbazawa''') are a [[Fulani]] clan residing mainly in [[Kano State]], [[Nigeria]]. They were among the key promoters, planners and executors of the [[Fulani War|Fulani Jihad]] in Kano, which took place between 1804 and 1807 under the leadership of [[Usman dan Fodio|Shehu Usuman dan Fodiyo]]. The clan was said to be the top financier of the jihad because it was extremely wealthy at the time of the jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh. Muktar Adnan|date=2003|publisher=Gidan Dabino Publishers|location=Jakara Kano|page=7|edition=firsted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Fulani Clans that participated in the Jihad included: the [[Jobawa]], the [[Yolawa]], the [[Sullubawa]], the [[Danejawa]] and others, as well as a contingent of the local [[Hausa people]] lead by Malam Usuman bahaushe. Together they formed a formidable force and toppled the 158 year [[Kutumbawa]] dynasty led by its last ruler [[Muhammadu Alwali Ibn Yaji|Muhammad Alwali dan Yaji dan Dadi]] bakutumbe who ruled between 1781 and 1806.

==History and origin==

The origin of the Dambazawa is as unclear as that of the [[Fulani]] race itself, but sources within the clan believe it to be of a ''Dayebe'' Fulani group. It was at the time of [[Sundiata Keita]] (c. 1217–1255 A.D.) the [[Fulani|Fulbe]] of that era began adopting surnames that conformed to their socioeconomic groups. During that era, the socioeconomic group of a ''[[Fulani|Pullo]]'' could easily be identified by considering his/her [[surname]]. It is unclear how this process came to be, but it is true that all Fulbe belong to one of four tribes: The Ururbe (Ba, Diakite), Dialloube (Diallo), Ferrobe (Sow) and Dayebe (Barry, Sangare). The Ba are considered to be a warrior group; the Diallo's geniuses; the Sow's, known to be religious, the guardians of the temple; the Barry were the nobility of the Fulbe.

The Dambazawa clan believes they migrated from [[Futa Tooro]] in what is now [[Senegal]], with their whole clan consisting of their leaders, clerics, peasants and vocation castes ''(leyyi)'' that included; ''Jaawamɓe'' (courtesans/advisers), ''Maabuɓe''(weavers), ''Wayilɓe Baleeɓe /sayakooɓe'' (blacksmiths/goldsmiths), ''Buurnaaɓe'' (ceramists), ''Sakkeeɓe'' (tanners), ''Lewɓe'' (woodworkers), ''Awluɓe'' (laudators), ''Wambaaɓe'' (guitarists) and ''Maccuɓe'' (slaves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wane|first1=Yaya|title=Les Toucouleur du Fouta Tooro: Stratification Sociale et structure Familiale|url=http://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/yWane/tdm.html|website=Webpulaaku|publisher=Universite de Dakar. Institut Fondemental d'Afrique Noire|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their sojourn eastward, took them through the Republics of [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]] and [[Cameroun]]. Their migratory drift was characterized by settling in an area for months or years before moving on. They would raise their cattle, transact business, gain and disseminate Islamic knowledge in the areas they settled or passed through. For over two centuries they kept roaming until they arrived at the [[Kanem Empire]] in ([[Borno State|Borno]]-[[Nigeria]]) and settled there. By the early 16th century, they left Borno and settled for a while in Damban in present-day [[Bauchi]], Nigeria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Editors|first1=Leadership|title=I owe my 60 years on the throne to Allah|url=http://leadership.ng/news/353883/owe-60-years-throne-allah-sarkin-bai-adnan|website=Leadership|publisher=Leadership News Paper|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Damban they moved to Gasakoli (a place in [[Jigawa]], Nigeria), then to an area in what was then the eastern part of the [[Kano]] Kingdom—known today as [[Dambazau]] in [[Takai]]. They remained in that area for a while. From there, they continued their westward movement, avoiding Kano city and settling in an area {{cvt|13|mi|km|spell=on}} north of the Kano city wall. Today this area is also known as [[Dambazau]]. After Kano city fell to the Fulani forces in 1806, their nobility, clerics and most of their ''Jaawando'' and ''Maccube'' moved into the walled city. There they occupied the House of [[Sarkin Bai]], a compound north of the city, behind the city market called Jakara. Today that compound is also called Dambazau within the city wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh. Muktar Adnan|date=2003|publisher=Gidan Dabino Publishers|location=Jakara, Kano|page=8|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the clan settled permanently in Kano, some of its members moved out to other areas. Wherever they settled they tended to name that area Dambazau.

The Dambazawa have a tradition of leaving behind some of their clan members and herds, whenever they decided to leave an area they have settled. Most of the time that area is named Dambazau meaning: "The abode of the Dambazawa". The Dambazawa believed that wherever they lived, in Nigeria or beyond, the area is called Dambazau. Today in [[Nigeria]] alone there are Dambazau [[village]]s in [[Kano]], [[Katsina]], [[Sokoto]], [[Bauchi]], [[Gombe State|Gombe]] and [[Taraba State|Muri]] (Taraba) states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh. Muktar Adnan|date=2003|publisher=Gidan Dabino Publishers|location=Jakara, Kano|page=8|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dambazawa during the Jihad in Kano (1804–1807)==

Kano has always been the most populous and wealthiest of the [[Hausa Kingdoms]], and its capital was almost certainly the greatest city in the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] at the end of the 18th century. Kano's weather is well suited for cattle rearing. Kano had already been settled by a number of Fulani clans, which had already established themselves centuries before the Jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=H.A.S.|first1=Johnston|title=The Fulani Empire of Sokoto|url=http://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/hasJohnston/ch06.html#n41|website=Webpulaaku|publisher=Oxford University press|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Kano Chronicle]]'', the first wave of Fulani people arrived in Kano during the reign of the 19th ruler of Kano, Sarki Yakubu Dan Abdullahi Bar-ja who ruled between 1452 and 1463.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Publishing Company|first1=Northern Nigerian|title=Hausawa da Makwabtansu|date=1971|publisher=Gaskiya Cooporation|location=Zaria, Nigeria|page=36|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kano Fulani settlements were scattered throughout the [[Kingdom of Kano]] in such a way that they formed a ring round the walled capital city. The settlement of the Dambazawa was situated north of the city wall and their leader at the end of the 18th century was Modibbo Muhammadu (Dabo) Yunusa ''bii'' Ummaru popularly called Dabon Dambazau.

The Fulani of Kano had already been in contact with [[Usman dan Fodio|Shehu]] (Usman dan Fodiyo) long before his breach with the Gobir King Yunfa (reign: 1802-1808), The leader of the Dambazawa alongside two other prominent Fulani clan members, Modibbo Sulemanu ''bii'' Abuhama of the Mundubawa clan, and Modibbo Muhammadu Ummaru popularly called Mallam Bakatsine of the [[Jobawa]] clan, were already studying under Shehu and were with him at the time of his flight to Gudu, after which, he sent them back to Kano with the task of rallying the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=H.A.S.|first1=Johnston|title=The Fulani Empire of Sokoto|url=http://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/hasJohnston/ch06.html#n41|website=Webpulaaku|publisher=Oxford University press|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first thing Malam Dabo did after his return from Gudu was to rally his Dambazawa clan, and then proceeded, together with other Fulani clan leaders, to rally the Kano, Fulani and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] faithful.

The Dambazawa participated fully in all the major battles of the [[Fulani War|Jihad]] in Kano from its beginnings in 1804 to its end in 1807, contributing in every way, especially in terms of [[military logistics]] and [[Military intelligence|intelligence]]. The entire Jihad force camped in the northern part of the Kingdom of Kano (i.e. Tomas—an area with a water pond presently in [[Dambatta|Danbatta]] district) for almost a year before the final assault was made on the walled capital city of Kano in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emirate|first1=Kano|title=The jihad in Kano|url=http://www.kanoemirate.org/index5378.html?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=59&amp;showall=1|website=Kano Emirate|publisher=Kano Emirate|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the kingdom (Danbatta) happens to be an area the Dambazawa were very conversant with because their settlement Dambazau was located there.

==Dambazawa after the Jihad in Kano==

The Dambazawa were said to be a very united Fulani clan and were extremely devoted to their leader Malam Dabo. They followed, obeyed and protect him anywhere, anytime. After the jihad was successful, the Fulani consolidated their power by defeating the remnants of the Kano forces under the leadership of the ousted king ([[Muhammadu Alwali Ibn Yaji|King Alwali]]) in the walled town of Burumburum in 1807. For almost three years (1806–1808/9) Kano was without central leadership (an [[Emir]]). It was administered collegially by the leaders of the Kano Jihad; Malam Jibir of the Yolawa Clan, Malam Bakatsine of the [[Jobawa]] clan, Malam Jamo of the [[Sullubawa]] Clan, Malam Usman Bahaushe of the Hausa faithful and Malam Dabo of the Dambazawa Clan. By late 1808 or early 1809, the Kano Fulani decided to visit [[Usman dan Fodio|Shehu Usman]] and raised the issue of leadership in Kano. They were to meet with Shehu at Birnin Gada in [[Zamfara]], but Shehu was unable to make the journey and was represented by his son [[Muhammed Bello|Sheik Muhammadu Bello]] (who later became sultan after the death of Shehu in 1817) who appointed Modibbo Sulemanu of the Mundubawa clan as the [[Emir|Amir]] of Kano. Though Sulemanu belonged to the Mundubawa Clan, and was said to be with Shehu at the time of his flight to Gudu, he did not make the Hijra to Kwazazzabon ´yar-kwando (also called Fagoje: a place {{cvt|38|mi|spell=on}} west of Kano city, where the Fulani made camp before starting the jihad in Kano). Nor did he participate in the Kano Jihad struggles. He lived for the whole time within Kano city as an Imam. His appointment did not go down well with the Kano Jihadists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=M.G.|title=Government In Kano 1350-1950|date=1997|publisher=West View Press|location=5500 Central avenue colorado 80301-2877|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their return from Birnin Gada, things were calm for a while, but the style of Amir Sulemanu's leadership of Kano did not sit well with most of the prominent Fulani clan leaders, who saw his actions/omissions as undermining the successes achieved by the Jihadists in Kano. They opposed many of his policies and Malam Dabo became the embodiment of that opposition.

Malam Dabo later asked the hand in marriage of Shehu's daughter and it was given. This deepened the already complicated relationship between the Dambazawa and Emir Sulemanu. Sulemanu saw this as an affront to his authority by Dabo, as he was also said to be married to another of Shehu's daughters. At the height of this conflict, Sulemanu imprisoned Malam Dabo in the royal prison, but the Dambazawa went to the prison by nightfall and freed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Publishing Company|first1=Northern Nigerian|title=Hausawa da Makwabtansu|date=1971|publisher=Gaskiya Cooporation|location=Zaria, Nigeria|page=60|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again Emir Sulemanu, acting upon the advice of former Kano rulers' (Alwali) advisers, started disseminating propaganda that Malam Dabo would be killed on a certain date. But that date came and passed with nothing happening to Malam Dabo. The another day would be announced. This series of pronouncements terrified most of the Dambazawa, but Dabo was unperturbed and kept calming them saying "nothing would happen". But their fear kept increasing by the day, so they continued to urge him to leave for [[Sokoto]] (to Shehu). They later prevailed over him and Dabo left Kano for Sokoto. Upon hearing that Dabo left for Sokoto, Emir Sulemanu rode after him to [[Sokoto]], fearing what Dabo might tell Shehu. After they both arrived before Shehu, he reconciled and made peace between them, and they returned to Kano. This happened between 1810-1811 A.D. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh. Muktar Adnan|date=2003|publisher=Gidan Dabino Publishers|location=Jakara, Kano|page=25|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that day, Dabo and the Dambazawa removed themselves from the activities of the Emirate, but Dabo retained his seat at the council of Ulama (Clerics) which consisted of all clan the leaders.

Shehu Usman retired from administering the caliphate in 1815 and handed over the administration to his brother [[Abdullahi dan Fodio|Abdullahi Fodiyo]] and son [[Muhammed Bello|Muhammadu Bello]]. He later died in 1817 A.D. and upon his death Muhammadu Bello succeeded him as the commander of the faithful (Sultan). Emir Sulemanu died in 1819, but not before he wrote a letter to Sultan Muhammadu Bello requesting the appointment of [[Ibrahim Dabo|Modibbo Ibrahim Dabo]] from the [[Sullubawa]] clan as Emir in the event of his death. In his letter, he accused Malam Dabon Dambazau of haughtiness and Malam Dikko (of the [[Jobawa]] clan) of oppressive tendencies and urged Sultan Bello not to appoint either of them in the event of his death. He recommended the appointment of Malam [[Ibrahim Dabo]] of the [[Sullubawa]], who happened to be his student at one time. Their parents, Modibbo Abuhama and Modibbo Mahmudu (known as Malam mai dan gwado) were very close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwangwazo|first1=Maje Ahmad|title=Tarihin Sarakunan Kano 1805-2003|date=2003|publisher=Gwangwazo Publishers|location=Kano|isbn=978-188-078-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Emir Sulemanu died in 1819, the Dambazawa had already established themselves as a force to be reckon with. They were gunning for their leader to be appointed the next Amir of Kano and had the backing of not only the majority of the Fulani clans but also the Hausa peasants. But as fate would have it, when the Emir's seat became vacant the name of Dabon Dambazau was forwarded to the Sultan, Muhammed Bello, but he had already made up his mind to grant the wish of the late Emir Sulemanu by appointing Malam Ibrahim Dabo of the Sullubawa clan as his successor. The sultan overlooked Malam Dabo and said that Malam Dabo should be ''Sarkin Baya''. To date, no one knows precisely what the sultan meant by this&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Editors|first1=Leadership|title=I owe my 60 years on the throne to Allah|url=http://leadership.ng/news/353883/owe-60-years-throne-allah-sarkin-bai-adnan|website=Leadership|publisher=Leadership News Paper|access-date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the phrase has different meanings in the [[Hausa language]]. This was the reason Malam Dabo's supporters and admirers were calling him ''Sarkin Baya'' or ''Sarkin bai'' (as both ''baya'' and ''bai'' roughly have the same meaning in the Hausa language) which roughly translates as; "The Emir to come after"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh. Muktar Adnan|date=2003|publisher=Gidan Dabino Publishers|location=Jakara, Kano|page=53|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. after Ibrahim Dabo). Although his adversaries, and those who loathed him, also called him ''Sarkin bai'', but they called him that as a mockery, as it  can also mean; "The Emir who came last" (i.e. who lost being selected to be crowned as emir) or "The King of slaves" (as ''Bai'' can also mean "slave" in classical Hausa language).

When Malam [[Ibrahim Dabo]] ascended the emirship of [[Kano]], he decided not to have any conflict with the Dambazawa. He adopted a different approach from that of Emir Sulemanu. He officially appointed Dabo to the office of [[Sarkin bai]], and placed him in charge of all the territories ranging from between [[Ungogo]] {{cvt|2|to|4|mi}} north of Kano city to [[Kunchi, Nigeria|Kunchi]] near the northwestern boundaries of the [[Kano Emirate]] with the [[Katsina]] and [[Daura]] Emirates and [[Babura]] near the northeastern boundary of Kano with [[Zinder|Damagaran]] (now Zinder in the Niger Republic) as their fiefdom. He restored [[Dambatta|Danbatta]] and Kunya, which Emir Sulemanu had seized from him during their disagreement, to him. To formalise the new situation with the Dambazawa, he appointed his daughter Fatsumatu Zara (daughter of his senior wife Shekara) to the title of ''Magajiya'' ( the first Fulani Magajiya in Kano). He then gave Fatsumatu to Dabo as a bride, together with Kunchi as a marriage gift, thus publicly demonstrating his reconciliation with the Dambazawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=M.G.|title=Government In Kano 1350-1950|date=1997|publisher=West View Press|location=5500 central avenue colorado 80301-2877|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fiefdom of the Dambazawa happens to include [[Dambatta|Danbatta town]], which at that time was the headquarters of a rebelious Fulani clan leader named Ibrahim Dan Tunku of the [[Yarimawa]] Fulani clan of [[Dambatta|Shiddar]]. Dan Tunku began rebelling against the Emirate of Kano during the reign of Emir Sulemanu. Conquering and harassing villages in northern Kano, he carved out a sizable Kingdom for himself at the expanse of the [[Kano Emirate]]. The Dambazawa were the vanguard that fought Dan Tunku and kept him at bay. The forces of Kano were busy fighting revolts that broke out in other areas of the Kano Emirate after the appointment of Ibrahim Dabo as Emir. After they were subdued the Kano forces, lead by Emir Ibrahim Dabo himself, joined the Dambazawa forces and then proceeded to plan and executed a final assault on Dan Tunku at Danbatta town, where they defeated him. But, Dan Tunku was able to escape through the northern gate of Danbatta Town. Kano forces pursued him until they reached a pond that separated Danbatta and the plains of [[Kazaure]]. The Emir dismounted from his horse and ordered a camp to be set up. A local [[legend]] has it that while the Emir was napping in his tent, he dreamed of Shehu Usman, and in that dream Shehu told him that "this pond is the border between you and Dan Tunku". When the Emir awoke, he asked his forces to withdraw to Danbatta, whereupon Dantunku's house was razed to the ground. The Emir then left for Kano and the Dambazawa left some of their clan members to bring the town to order. They built a house beside the destroyed house of Dan Tunku and appointed Dantunku's brother (who had earlier surrendered) as ''Sarkin Fulanin Danbatta''. Dambazawa then made Danbatta the capital of their larger fiefdom and their [[military base]] against Dan Tunku. It was Kano's northern fortress where they governed and defended Kano from all northern aggression. To date, the Dambazawa are those controlling Danbatta and its environs, though they no longer control the whole of the northern Kano emirate. They still operate as the fief owners of Danbatta and Makoda. Modibbo Muhammadu Yunusa Ummaru Ba-dambaje died in 1845 and was buried under a date palm tree at his house at Dambazau, inside the walled city of Kano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh.

After his death, his son Muhammadu Kwairanga was appointed ''Sarkin Bai'' of Kano and continued operating as the fief owner of Northern Kano.

Muhammadu Kwairanga, after becoming the [[Sarkin bai]] of Kano and leader of the Dambazawa clan, decided to choose ten people from the Dambazawa to help him administer the fiefdom. He gave them titles and offices and called them ''Yan goma'' (the ten councilors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad Gidan Dabino|first1=Ado|title=Jagora Abun Koyi: Sarkin Ban Kano Alh. Muktar Adnan|date=2003|publisher=Gidan Dabino Publishers|location=Jakara, Kano|page=20|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles include: Waziri, Galadima, Madaki, Makama, Wanbai, Ciroma, Tafida, Muqaddas, Dawaki and Santali.

==Dambazawa in modern Kano Emirate==

Today, the Dambazawa are those controlling the districts of [[Dambatta|Danbatta]] and [[Makoda]]. Their leader, who always holds the title of ''Sarkin Bai'', is a permanent member of the [[Kano Emirate Council|Kano State Emirate Council]] and the secretary of the Kano King Makers Council (i.e. Kano Emirate Electoral College) which consist of [[Madakin Kano]] from the ''Ba'awa'' (Yolawa) clan as chairman of the Council, [[Sarkin Ban Kano]] from the Dambazawa clan as secretary, [[Makaman Kano]] from the [[Jobawa|Jobawa clan]] and [[Sarkin Dawaki mai Tutar Kano]] from the main body of the [[Sullubawa|Sullubawa clan]] (who were the descendants of [[Malam Jamo]] the leader of the Sullubawa during the Jihad and the custodian of the Kano Jihad flag) as members. This council is responsible for choosing a new Emir whenever the  seat becomes vacant. They forward his name to the [[Kano State]] Executive Council for subsequent approval.

==The title of Sarkin Ban Kano==

''Sarkin Bai'' is a title in Kano Emirate that is reserved exclusively for the leader of the Dambazawa Fulani Clan. Whoever is chosen as [[Sarkin Ban Kano]] automatically becomes the leader of the Danbazawa clan, the Secretary of the Kano King makers Council and District head of [[Dambatta|Danbatta local Government]].

'''Environmental mitigation''', '''compensatory mitigation''', or [[mitigation banking]], are terms used primarily by the [[United States government]] and the related environmental industry to describe projects or programs intended to offset known impacts to an existing historic or [[natural resource]] such as a stream, wetland, endangered species, archeological site, paleontological site or historic structure.  To "mitigate" means to make less harsh or hostile.  Environmental mitigation is typically a part of an environmental crediting system established by governing bodies which involves allocating debits and credits. Debits occur in situations where a natural resource has been destroyed or severely impaired and credits are given in situations where a natural resource has been deemed to be improved or preserved. Therefore, when an entity such as a business or individual has a "debit" they are required to purchase a "credit". In some cases credits are bought from "mitigation banks" which are large mitigation projects established to provide credit to multiple parties in advance of development when such compensation cannot be achieved at the development site or is not seen as beneficial to the environment.  Crediting systems can allow credit to be generated in different ways.  For example, in the United States, projects are valued based on what the intentions of the project are which may be to preserve, enhance, restore or create (PERC) a natural resource.

== Advantages ==

Environmental mitigation and crediting systems are often praised for the following reasons:

=== Development-friendly ===
Mitigation is a more development-friendly alternative to strict [[environmental law]]s because it allows development to occur where environmental laws might prohibit it.

=== Mitigation industry ===
Mitigation inevitably creates a "mitigation industry". By requiring those who impact natural resources to purchase credits, a demand for mitigation credit is formed. Businesses related to environmental work typically benefit from such a system.

=== Targeting ecological value ===
Mitigation has the potential to save and restore the most valuable environmental resources at the least cost, assuming that regulation 1) protects health and welfare as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 2) assures that a credit accurately represents measurable ecological value. Buyers are typically looking for mitigation credits that are both cheap and the most likely to meet regulatory requirements for compensatory mitigation.  Regulators must therefore find a balance between protecting the long term public interest and ensuring that buyers have the proper incentives to participate in the environmental marketplace.

=== Cost burden ===
Mitigation systems place the environmental costs of development mostly on the individuals or entities that are impacting the environment. Without environmental mitigation, costs of alleviating environmental damage caused by development could be placed in the hands of the government which would in turn pass costs on to taxpayers not responsible for environmental impacts.

=== Benefit to landowners ===
Land previously unused or impractical for development is given greater monetary value under a mitigation system. For instance, land in floodplains may be impractical for commercial or residential development but conducive for mitigation activities. Land in rural areas with very little potential for growth are more valuable when given the opportunity to be used for mitigation credits.

== Disadvantages ==

The following are criticisms of environmental mitigation and crediting systems:

=== Incorrect allocation and valuation of credits and debits ===
Mitigation regulations may not properly take into account the total ecological losses and gains associated with environmental impacts or mitigation when allocating debits and credits. Governing bodies are primarily responsible for prescribing the ecological criteria required to attain credits for mitigation. They are also responsible for valuation of credit. Therefore, it is evident that problems with the allocation and valuation of credits and debits might stem from the complexity of assessing the current comparative value of ecological resources (aka [[ecosystem services]]), ecosystem change over time, and/or a lack of understanding about what is beneficial or harmful to the environment overall.  To address these uncertainties regulators often assign 'coverage ratios' to compensatory mitigation agreements.  Coverage ratios of, for example, 3:1 require 3 compensatory mitigation credits for every 1 unit of [[ecological disturbance]].

=== Effects on land cost and availability ===
Mitigation could be seen as contributing to the increasing cost of land because some mitigation work requires that large amounts of land be purchased or put into conservation easements. Mitigation can therefore compete with other rural land uses such as agriculture and residential development.  This suggests that land owners must be alert to find the highest and best use for their properties given the potential market value that mitigation credits represent.

=== 'In perpetuity' commitments of land ===
Commitment of lands to compensatory mitigation must be done 'in perpetuity', meaning permanently into the future.  Otherwise, the long-term public interest could not be served via compensatory mitigation programs.  This means that properties must continue to be managed with ecosystem values in mind, sometimes preventing landowners from transforming the landscape to meet changing needs.  For example, future large scale development projects would not likely be permitted on previously dedicated mitigation properties.

==Background==

===Eric Harris===
Harris was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. The Harris family relocated often, as Eric's father, Wayne Harris, was a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[homemaker]]. The family moved from [[Plattsburgh, New York]], to [[Littleton, Colorado]], in July 1993, when Wayne Harris retired from military service.&lt;ref name="Suspects" /&gt;

The Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. During this time, Eric met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased a house south of [[Columbine High School]].

Klebold was born in [[Lakewood, Colorado]], to Thomas and Susan Klebold.&lt;ref name="Suspects"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children. Both Dylan and his older brother attended [[confirmation]] classes in accordance with the [[Confirmation#Lutheran view|Lutheran tradition]].&lt;ref name="mult1"/&gt; As had been the case with his older brother, Dylan was named after a renowned poet&amp;nbsp;– in Dylan's case, the playwright [[Dylan Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Mother's Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of the Columbine Tragedy'' p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

At the family home, the Klebolds also observed some rituals in keeping with Klebold's maternal grandfather's Jewish heritage.&lt;ref name="mult1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Leppek |title=Dylan Klebold led life of religious contradictions |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/11140/edition_id/213/format/html/displaystory.html  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329233932/http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/11140/edition_id/213/format/html/displaystory.html |date=April 30, 1999 |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culver, Virginia (April 28, 1999).

===Columbine High School===
At Columbine High, Harris and Klebold were active in school play productions, operated video productions and became computer assistants maintaining the school's computer server.&lt;ref name="Suspects"/&gt;

According to early accounts of the shooting, Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and targets of bullying. While sources do support accounts of bullying directed toward the pair,&lt;ref name=DenverWestword1&gt;{{cite news|author=Prendergast, Alan|date=July 13, 2000|url=http://www.westword.com/2000-07-13/news/the-missing-motive/ |title=The Missing Motive|newspaper=[[Denver Westword News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brooksbrown&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Brooks |authorlink= |author2=Rob Merritt |title=No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Death at Columbine |year=2002 |publisher=Lantern Books |location=New York City|isbn=978-1-59056-031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DenverWestword2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2009/04/forgiving_my_friend_dylan_kleb.php|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|newspaper=Denver Westword Post|author=Prendergast, Alan|date=April 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; accounts of them being outcasts have been reported to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, David (April 24, 2004).

Harris and Klebold were initially reported to be members of a group that called themselves the "Trenchcoat Mafia", although in fact they had no particular connection with the group, and did not appear in a group photo of the Trenchcoat Mafia in the 1998 Columbine yearbook.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;Wilgoren, Jodi (April 25, 1999).

April 21, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Harris's father stated that his son was "a member of what they call the Trenchcoat Mafia" in a 911 call he made on April 20, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Kass |title=Columbine: A True Crime Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHQ7OgAACAAJ |publisher=Ghost Road Publishing Group |year=2009 |ISBN=0-9816525-6-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold attended the high school prom three days before the shootings with a classmate named Robyn Anderson.&lt;ref name="FatalFriendship" /&gt;

Harris and Klebold linked their personal computers on a network and both played many games over the Internet. Harris created a set of levels for the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which later became known as the 'Harris levels'. Harris had a web presence under the [[User (computing)|handle]] "REB" (short for Rebel, a nod to the nickname of Columbine's sports teams) and other cyber aliases, including "Rebldomakr", "Rebdoomer", and "Rebdomine", while Klebold went by the names "VoDKa" and "VoDkA". Harris had various websites that hosted ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' files, as well as team information for those he gamed with online. The sites openly espoused hatred for the people of their neighborhood and the world in general. When the pair began experimenting with [[pipe bomb]]s, they posted results of the explosions on the websites. The website was shut down by [[AOL|America Online]] after the shootings and was preserved for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harris hinted at violence to come|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9904/21/harris.profile.02/index.html|publisher=CNN |date=1999-04-22 |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial legal encounters===
The two boys got into trouble with the law for breaking into a locked van and stealing computers. In January 1998, they were charged with [[mischief]], [[burglary|breaking and entering]], [[trespass]]ing, and [[theft]]. They both left good impressions on the [[Juvenile court|juvenile officers]], who offered to expunge their [[criminal record]]s if they agreed to attend a diversionary program to include [[community service]], received [[psychotherapy|psychiatric treatment]], and obeyed the law. Harris was required to attend [[anger management]] classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. They were so well-behaved that their [[probation officer]] discharged them from the program a few months earlier than the due date. Of Harris, it was remarked that he was "a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life", while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but "needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream." On April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolshooters.info/eric-harris-diversion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014005724/http://www.schoolshooters.info/eric-harris-diversion.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: "Isnt america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free, I cant deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van in plain sight in the middle of fucking nowhere on a fri-fucking-day night?

===''Hitmen for Hire''===
In December 1998, Harris and Klebold made ''Hitmen for Hire'', a video for a school project in which they swore, yelled at the camera, made violent statements, and acted out shooting and killing students in the hallway of their school as ''Hitmen for Hire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_vpW3mM5w|last1=Klebold|first1=Dylan Bennet|last2=Harris|first2=Eric David|title=Hitmen for Hire|location=Columbine, Colorado|date=December 1998|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7331878/|title=Hitmen for Hire (1998)|work=Internet Movie Database|access-date=October 4, 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both displayed themes of violence in their [[creative writing]] projects for school; of a ''Doom''-based story written by Harris on January 17, 1999, Harris's teacher said: "Yours is a unique approach and your writing works in a gruesome way — good details and mood setting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shepard, Cyn |title=Eric's writing: Creative writing story |url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric/writing/ehcw.gif |publisher=A Columbine Site |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183643/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric/writing/ehcw.gif |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Shepard, Cyn |url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/event/event.html |title=Gunfire in the halls |publisher=A Columbine Site |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917052743/http://acolumbinesite.com/event/event.html |archivedate=September 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacre==
{{Main|Columbine High School massacre}}

===Day of the massacre===
[[File:Columbine Shooting Security Camera.jpg|thumbnail|Harris (left) and Klebold (right) on the security camera the day of the shooting before committing suicide.]]
On April 20, 1999, while smoking a cigarette at the start of lunch break, Brooks Brown saw Harris arrive at school. Brown had severed his friendship with Harris a year earlier because Harris had thrown a chunk of ice at his car windshield; Brown patched things up with Harris just prior to the shooting. Brown scolded Harris for skipping his morning classes, because Harris was always serious about schoolwork and being on time. Harris reportedly said, "It doesn't matter anymore" and also said, "Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Columbine Survivor With Words for Virginia Students |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9658182 |date=April 18, 2007 |first=Brooks |last=Brown |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=August 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown quickly left the school grounds. At 11:19&amp;nbsp;a.m., he heard the first gunshots after he had walked some distance away from the school, and he informed the police via a neighbor's cell phone.

By that time, Dylan Klebold had already arrived at the school in a separate car, and the two boys left two gym bags, each containing a 20-pound propane bomb, inside the school cafeteria. When these devices failed to detonate, Harris and Klebold launched a shooting attack against their classmates. It was the deadliest attack ever perpetrated at an American high school until the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] on February 14, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/15/deadliest-mass-shootings-in-modern-america|title=Mass shootings: what are the deadliest attacks in the US?|last=Morris|first=Sam|date=February 15, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 16, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/14/florida-school-shooting-among-10-deadliest-in-modern-us-history.html|title=Florida school shooting among 10 deadliest in modern US history|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|date=February 14, 2018|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=February 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215021549/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/14/florida-school-shooting-among-10-deadliest-in-modern-us-history.html|archivedate=February 15, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was responsible for eight of the thirteen confirmed deaths ([[Rachel Scott]], Daniel Rohrbough,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daniel Lee Rohrbough |url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/victim/dannyr.html |publisher=A Columbine Site |access-date=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher identified as Dave Sanders, Steve Curnow, [[Cassie Bernall]], Isaiah Shoels, Kelly Fleming, and Daniel Mauser), while Klebold was responsible for the remaining five (Kyle Velasquez, Matthew Kechter, Lauren Townsend, John Tomlin, and Corey DePooter). There were 24 wounded, most in critical condition.

===Suicide===
At 12:02&amp;nbsp;p.m., Harris and Klebold returned to the library. This was 20 minutes after their lethal shooting spree had ended, leaving 12 students dead, one teacher dying, and another 24 students and staff injured. Ten of their victims had been killed in the library. Harris and Klebold went to the west windows and opened fire on the police outside. Six minutes later, they walked to the bookshelves near a table where Patrick Ireland lay badly wounded and unconscious. Student Lisa Kreutz, injured in the earlier library attack, was also in the room, unable to move.

At 12:08&amp;nbsp;p.m., art teacher Patti Nielson, who had locked herself inside a break room with student Brian Anderson and library staff, overheard Harris and Klebold shout out in unison: "One! Two! Three!" followed immediately by the sound of gunfire.&lt;ref name="FatalFriendship"/&gt; Harris had fired his shotgun through the roof of his mouth, and Klebold had shot himself in the left temple with his TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun.

===Acquiring arms===
[[File:Hp995carbine22.jpg|thumb|9 mm [[Hi-Point Carbine|Hi-Point 995 carbine]], one of the guns Eric Harris used]]
[[File:kg99.jpg|thumb|9 mm TEC-DC9 pistol also known as the TEC-9, one of the guns Dylan Klebold used]]

Because Harris and Klebold were both underage at the time, Robyn Anderson (with whom Klebold attended the prom three days before the shooting), an 18-year-old Columbine student and old friend of Klebold's, made a [[straw purchase]] of two [[shotgun]]s and a [[Hi-Point carbine]] for the pair. In exchange for her cooperation with the investigation that followed the shootings, no charges were filed against Anderson. After illegally acquiring the weapons, Klebold [[Sawed-off shotgun|sawed off]] his Savage 311-D 12-gauge [[double-barrel shotgun]], shortening the overall length to approximately {{convert|23|in|m}}, a felony under the [[National Firearms Act]], while Harris's Savage-Springfield 12-gauge pump shotgun was sawed off to around  {{convert|26|in|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How they were equipped that day |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/EQUIPMENT_TEXT.htm |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooters also possessed a [[Intratec TEC-DC9|TEC-DC9]] [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic handgun]], which had a long history. The manufacturer of the TEC-DC9 first sold it to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]-based Navegar Incorporated. It was then sold to Zander's Sporting Goods in [[Baldwin, Illinois]] in 1994. The gun was later sold to [[Thornton, Colorado]], [[firearms dealer]] Larry Russell. In violation of federal law, Russell failed to keep [[Federal Form 4473|records]] of the sale, yet he determined that the purchaser of the gun was twenty-one years of age or older. He was unable to identify the pictures of Klebold, Anderson, or Harris shown to him by police after the shooting. Two men, Mark Manes and Philip Duran, were convicted of supplying weapons to the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot1113.htm |title=Judge gives Manes 6 years |newspaper=The Denver Post |last1=Pankratz |first1=Howard |last2=Simpson |first2=Kevin |date=November 13, 1999 |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombs used by the pair varied and were crudely made from [[carbon dioxide]] canisters, galvanized pipe, and metal [[propane]] bottles. The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs. The two boys purchased six more propane tanks on the morning of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Columbine|last=Cullen|first=David|publisher=Twelve|year=2009|isbn=9780446546935|location=New York|pages=40|oclc=236082459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More complex bombs, such as the one that detonated on the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue, had [[time bomb|timers]]. The two largest bombs built were found in the school cafeteria and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating. It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed in the cafeteria had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=At 'perfect' school, student sat next to bomb |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_1076860,00.html |date=April 12, 2002 |work=Rocky Mountain News |first=Lynn |last=Bartels |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420145325/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_1076860%2C00.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
There was controversy over whether the perpetrators should be memorialized. Some were opposed, saying that it glorified murderers, while others argued that the perpetrators were also victims. Atop a hill near Columbine High School, crosses were erected for Harris and Klebold along with those for the people they killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crosses for Harris, Klebold join 13 others |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0428cros1.shtml |first=Tillie |last=Fong |work=Rocky Mountain News |date=April 28, 1999 |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512083419/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0428cros1.shtml |archivedate=May 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the father of Daniel Rohrbough cut them down, saying that murderers should not be memorialized in the same place as victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Authorities say Columbine shooters acted alone |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/01/school.shooting.03/index.html |date=May 1, 1999 |publisher=CNN |first=Charles |last=Zewe |accessdate=June 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211044128/http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/01/school.shooting.03/index.html |archivedate=February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
Harris and Klebold wrote much about how they would carry out the massacre, but less about why. A journal found in Harris's bedroom contained almost every detail that the boys planned to follow after 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on April 20, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Columbine Documents |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/pdf/900columbinedocs.pdf |format=PDF |work=Rocky Mountain News |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910091713/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/pdf/900columbinedocs.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In journal entries, the pair often wrote about events such as the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the [[Waco siege]], the [[Vietnam War]] and other similar events, including blurbs and notes on how they wished to "outdo" these events, focusing especially on what [[Timothy McVeigh]] did in Oklahoma City. They mentioned how they would like to leave a lasting impression on the world with this kind of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12370508/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/columbine-killers-diaries-offer-chilling-insight/|title=Columbine killers’ diaries offer chilling insight|date=2006-07-07|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much speculation occurred over the date chosen for their attack. The original intended date of the attack may have been April 19; Harris required more ammunition from Mark Manes, who did not deliver it until the evening of April 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hinton |first=Sam |chapter=Troubled Children: Dealing with Anger and Depression |title=Psychology of Children: Coping with the Dangerous Threats |publisher=Hammond |year=2012 |page=20 |isbn=0-275-98207-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinton"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Ryckman |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0516bguy2.shtml |title=Demonic plan was months in making |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |date=May 16, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125214115/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0516bguy2.shtml |archivedate=January 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris and Klebold were both avid fans of [[KMFDM]], an industrial band led by German multi-instrumentalist [[Sascha Konietzko]]. It was revealed that lyrics to KMFDM songs ("Son of a Gun", "Stray Bullet", "Waste") were posted on Harris' website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nF8YAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=KMFDM+songs | author=Wilson, Scott | title=Great Satan's Rage | chapter=Columbine | pages=138–139 | publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] | year=2008 | accessdate=January 31, 2011 | isbn=978-0-7190-7463-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the date of the massacre, April 20, coincided with both the release date of the album ''Adios''&lt;ref name="MTV-speakout"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427256/kmfdm-rammstein-speak-out-about-columbine.jhtml | title=KMFDM And Rammstein Speak Out About Columbine | publisher=[[MTV Networks]] | date=April 23, 1999 | accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the birthday of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB5CE474D7991CD&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Music Linked To Killings? | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | publisher=Knight Ridder | date=April 22, 1999 | accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris noted the coincidence of the album's title and release date in his journal.&lt;ref name="Erics_journal" /&gt;

The media was quick to jump on the apparent connection of the massacre to violent entertainment and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/april99/suspects042299.htm |author1=Duggan, Paul |author2=Shear, Michael D. |author3=Fisher, Marc | title=Shooter Pair Mixed Fantasy, Reality | work=[[Washington Post]] | page=A1 | publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth]] | date=April 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Konietzko issued a statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First and foremost, KMFDM would like to express their deep and heartfelt sympathy for the parents, families and friends of the murdered and injured children in Littleton. We are sick and appalled, as is the rest of the nation, by what took place in Colorado yesterday.&lt;ref name="MTV-speakout"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KMFDM1999"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/ | title=KMFDM.net on April 27, 1999 from archive.org | publisher=KMFDM Inc | date=April 27, 1999 | accessdate=April 21, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990427193333/http://www.kmfdm.net/ | archivedate = April 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;KMFDM are an art form—not a political party. From the beginning, our music has been a statement against war, oppression, fascism and violence against others. While some of the former band members are German as reported in the media, none of us condone any Nazi beliefs whatsoever.&lt;ref name="KMFDM1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/an-old-debate-emerges-in-wake-of-shooting-19990422 | author=Boehlert, Eric | title=An Old Debate Emerges in Wake of School Shooting|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]| publisher=Jann S.

The attack occurred on Hitler's birthday, which led to speculation in the media. Some people, such as Robyn Anderson, who knew the perpetrators, stated that the pair were not obsessed with Nazism nor did they worship or admire Hitler in any way. Anderson stated, in retrospect, that there were many things the pair did not tell friends. Dave Cullen, author of the 2009 book ''Columbine'', cites evidence that Harris did revere the Nazis. He praised them often in his journal, and some of his friends grew irritated at his frequent Nazi salutes and quotations in the months leading up to the shooting. At a certain point, Harris realized he needed to reduce this behavior, for fear of revealing his plans. He commented in his journal about how hard it was to wait until April to express all his hatred for the human race.&lt;ref name="mult2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boulderdailycamera.com/shooting/report/p10601-10700.pdf |title=The 11,000 Page Report |format=PDF |work=The Boulder Daily Camera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his journal, Harris mentioned his admiration of what he imagined to be [[natural selection]], and wrote that he would like to put everyone in a super ''Doom'' game and see to it that the weak die and the strong live.&lt;ref name="Erics_journal" /&gt; On the day of the massacre, Harris wore a white T-shirt with the words "Natural selection" printed in black.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;

====Bullying====
One of Harris' last journal entries read: "I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don't … say, 'Well that's your fault,' because it isn't, you people had my phone number, and I asked and all, but no. No no no don't let the weird-looking Eric KID come along."&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;

Dylan Klebold said on the Basement Tapes, "You've been giving us shit for years. You're fucking gonna pay for all the shit! We don't give a shit. Because we're gonna die doing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwxoDRYJ7_M|series=Zero Hour|title=Massacre at Columbine High|season=1|number=3|network=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|airdate=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Transcript of the Columbine "Basement Tapes" |date=July 29, 2014 |publisher=Schoolshooters.info |access-date= October 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts from various parents and school staffers describe bullying at the school as "rampant."&lt;ref&gt;Pankratz, Howard (October 3, 2000). [http://extras.denverpost.com/news/col1003a.htm "Columbine bullying no myth, panel told"]. ''The Denver Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, Harris's eighth-grade science partner, reported that Harris and Klebold were constantly picked on. Vanderau noted that a "cup of fecal matter" was thrown at them.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingWhy&gt;{{YouTube|KikvzIlNg9g|''Investigative Reports: Columbine: Understanding Why''}}. [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]]. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; "People surrounded them in the commons and squirted ketchup packets all over them, laughing at them, calling them faggots," Brooks Brown says. "That happened while teachers watched. They couldn't fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it."&lt;ref name=DenverWestword1/&gt; In his book, ''No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Death at Columbine'', Brown wrote that Harris was born with mild [[Pectus excavatum|chest indent]]. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students would laugh at him.&lt;ref name=brooksbrown/&gt;

"A lot of the tension in the school came from the class above us," Chad Laughlin states. "There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups certainly got preferential treatment across the board. I caught the tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was the worst day of his life." That incident, according to Laughlin, involved seniors pelting Klebold with "ketchup-covered tampons" in the commons.&lt;ref name=DenverWestword2/&gt;

===Journals and investigation===
Harris began keeping a journal in April 1998, a short time after the pair was convicted of breaking into a van, for which each received ten months of juvenile intervention counseling and community service in January 1998. They began to formulate plans then, as reflected in their journals.&lt;ref name="Hinton" /&gt;

Harris wanted to join the [[United States Marine Corps]], but his application was rejected shortly before the shootings because he was taking the drug [[fluvoxamine]], an [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressant]], which he was required to take as part of court-ordered anger management therapy. According to the recruiting officer, Harris did not know about this rejection. Though some friends of Harris suggested that he had stopped taking the drug beforehand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Nancy |author2=Timothy Roche |title=The Columbine Tapes |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992873-3,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=December 20, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the autopsy reports showed low therapeutic or normal (not toxic or lethal) blood-levels of [[Luvox]] (fluvoxamine) in his system, which would be around 0.0031-0.0087&amp;nbsp;mg%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://gototrial.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Therapeutic-and-Toxic-Drug-Levels.pdf | title=Drug and chemical blood-level data 2001 | author=Winek, Charles L. | journal=Forensic Science International | year=2001 | volume=122 | pages=107–123 | doi=10.1016/s0379-0738(01)00483-2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Shepard, Cyn|url=http://acolumbinesite.com/eric.html|title=Eric David Harris|publisher=A Columbine Site |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the shootings, [[anti-psychiatry|opponents of contemporary psychiatry]] like [[Peter Breggin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Breggin |first=Peter R. |url=http://breggin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=190. |title=Was School Shooter Eric Harris Taking Luvox? |date=April 30, 1999 |accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the [[psychiatric medication]]s prescribed to Harris after his conviction may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Ralph W. |title=Comprehending Columbine |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2007 |page=119 |ISBN=1-59213-491-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Professor Aubrey Immelman, Ph.D of the [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University]], published a personality profile of Eric Harris, based on journal entries and personal communication. Immelman's profile believes the materials suggested behavior patterns consistent with a "[[malignant narcissism]] ... pathological [[narcissistic personality disorder]] with [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features, along with some [[paranoia|paranoid]] traits, and unconstrained [[aggression]]". The report notes that such a profile should not be construed as a direct psychiatric diagnosis, which is based on face-to-face interviews, formal [[psychological testing]], and collection of collateral information.{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Harris: Personality Profile |first=Aubrey |last=Immelman |date=August 2004 |url=http://www.csbsju.edu/uspp/Criminal-Profiling/Columbine_Eric-Harris-profile.html |publisher=[[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911215748/http://www.csbsju.edu/uspp/Criminal-Profiling/Columbine_Eric-Harris-profile.html |archivedate=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his journal, Klebold wrote about his view that he and Harris were "god-like" and more highly evolved than every other human being, but his secret journal records self-loathing and suicidal intentions. Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be "god-like". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word "WRATH" printed in red.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place. Klebold was described as being "hotheaded, but depressive and suicidal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2004/04/the_depressive_and_the_psychopath.html |title=The Depressive and the Psychopath |publisher=slate.om |date=2004-04-20 |accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the home recorded videos, called "The Basement Tapes", have reportedly been destroyed by police. Harris and Klebold reportedly discussed their motives for the attacks in these videos and gave instructions in bomb making. Police cite the reason for withholding these tapes as an effort to prevent them from becoming "call-to-arms" and "how-to" videos that could inspire copycat killers.&lt;ref&gt;''Mass and Serial Murder in America'' {{ISBN|978-3-31944280-8}} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have argued that releasing the tapes would allow psychologists to study them and would help identify characteristics of future killers.

===Media accounts===
Initially,&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; the shooters were believed to be members of a clique that called themselves the "Trench Coat Mafia", a small group of Columbine's self-styled outcasts who wore heavy black [[trench coats]]. Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the Neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the 'jocks' who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia.&lt;ref name="No easy answers"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kI4YwhBD7FgC&amp;pg=PA69 | title=No easy answers: The truth behind death at Columbine | publisher=Lantern Books |author1=Brown, Brooks |author2=Merritt, Rob | year=2002 | pages=68–70 | isbn=1590560310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trench coat inadvertently became the members' uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as an inexpensive present.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Investigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre. Most did not know the shooters, apart from their association with Thiebault, and none were considered suspects in the shootings or were charged with any involvement in the incident.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

[[Marilyn Manson]] was blamed by the media in the wake of the Columbine shooting, and responded to criticism in an interview with [[Michael Moore]], in which he was asked, "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did."&lt;ref name="BFC"&gt;{{cite video|date= October 11, 2002 |people= [[Michael Moore]] interviewing [[Marilyn Manson]] |title=[[Bowling for Columbine]]|medium= Documentary |publisher=[[MGM]]|location= Los Angeles, California|time= &lt;!-- please insert the time, in the film's runtime, at which the quotation occurs --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological analysis===
One report suggested that Harris was a [[psychopath]] and Klebold was [[Major depressive disorder|severely depressed]], and consequently that Harris was influenced by sadism, whereas Klebold was influenced by revenge. This report suggested that all of the reasons the boys gave for the shooting were justifications in order to present themselves as killers with a cause.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web | last = Cullen | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Cullen | date = April 20, 2004 | title = The Depressive and the Psychopath | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2004/04/the_depressive_and_the_psychopath.single.html | website = [[Slate magazine|Slate]] | accessdate = June 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes columbine"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/opinion/sunday/the-unknown-why-in-the-aurora-killings.html|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Don’t Jump to Conclusions About the Killer |first=Dave |last=Cullen |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc columbine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30267075/ns/health-mental_health/t/destined-psychopath-experts-seek-clues/#.UTJZCVqwii8 |work=[[NBC]] |title=Destined as a psychopath?

Although early media reports attributed the shootings to a desire for revenge on the part of Harris and Klebold for [[bullying]] that they received, subsequent psychological analysis indicated Harris and Klebold harbored serious psychological problems. According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

===Reaction of Sue Klebold===
{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}

Sue Klebold, mother of Dylan Klebold, spoke about the Columbine High School massacre publicly for the first time in an essay that appeared in the October 2009 issue of ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine]]''. In the piece, Klebold wrote: "For the rest of my life, I will be haunted by the horror and anguish Dylan caused", and "Dylan changed everything I believed about myself, about God, about family, and about love." Stating that she had no clue of her son's intentions, she said, "Once I saw his journals, it was clear to me that Dylan entered the school with the intention of dying there."&lt;ref name=silence&gt;{{cite web |last=Klebold |first=Susan |url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/susan-klebolds-o-magazine-essay-i-will-never-know-why |title=I Will Never Know Why |work=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]] |date=November 2009|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Andrew Solomon's 2012 book ''Far from the Tree'', she acknowledged that on the day of the massacre, when she discovered that Dylan was one of the shooters, she prayed he would kill himself. "I had a sudden vision of what he might be doing. And so while every other mother in Littleton was praying that her child was safe, I had to pray that mine would die before he hurt anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/columbine-shooter-dylan-klebold-8217-parents-speak-191300537.html |title=Columbine Shooter Dylan Klebold’s Parents Speak Out |archive-date=29 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129202158/http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/columbine-shooter-dylan-klebold-8217-parents-speak-191300537.html |accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, Klebold posted a [[TED (conference)|TED Talk]] titled, "My son was a Columbine shooter.

The site listed Klebold's occupation as "activist", and stated: "Sue Klebold has become a passionate agent working to advance mental health awareness and intervention."

===Lawsuits against their families===
In April 2001, the families of more than 30 victims were given shares in a $2,538,000&lt;!--source rounded figure to nearest ten-thousands--&gt; settlement by the families of the perpetrators, Mark Manes, and Phillip Duran. The Harrises and the Klebolds contributed $1,568,000 to the settlement from their own homeowners' policies, the Manes contributed $720,000, and the Durans contributed $250,000. The Harrises and the Klebolds were ordered to guarantee an additional $32,000 be available against any future claims. The Manes were ordered to hold $80,000 against future claims, and the Durans were ordered to hold $50,000.&lt;ref name="NYTimes Settlement"&gt;{{cite news |date=April 20, 2001 |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |title=$2.53 Million Deal Ends Some Columbine Lawsuits |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/20/us/2.53-million-deal-ends-some-columbine-lawsuits.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One family had filed a $250-million lawsuit against the Harrises and Klebolds in 1999 and did not accept the 2001 settlement terms.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Columbine High School massacre in popular culture}}

In the 1999 black comedy, ''[[Duck! The Carbine High Massacre]]'', which is inspired by the Columbine shooting, the two shooters are played by William Hellfire and Joey Smack, who also co-wrote, directed and produced the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Buchanan|title=Duck! The Carbine High Massacre|publisher=[[Moviefone]]|url=http://www.moviefone.com/movie/duck-the-carbine-high-massacre/1264143/synopsis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404121310/http://www.moviefone.com/movie/duck-the-carbine-high-massacre/1264143/synopsis|archivedate=April 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooters are named "Derrick and Derwin", a play on Harris' and Klebold's first names.

The 2002 [[Michael Moore]] documentary film ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' focuses heavily on a perceived American obsession with handguns, its grip on [[Jefferson County, Colorado]], and its role in the shooting.

The 2003 [[Gus Van Sant]] film ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'' depicts a fictional school shooting, though some of its details were based on the Columbine massacre, such as one scene, in which one of the young killers walks into the evacuated school cafeteria and pauses to sip from someone's glass, as Harris himself did during the shooting.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingWhy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Doland, Angela|title=2003: Shades Of Columbine |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/21/entertainment/cannes/main554996.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=May 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, the killers are called "Alex and Eric" after the actors who portray them, [[Alex Frost]] and Eric Deulen.

In the 2003 [[Ben Coccio]] film ''[[Zero Day (film)|Zero Day]]'', which was inspired by the Columbine shooting, the two shooters are played by Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel and called "Andre and Calvin" after their actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Amy |last=Roeder |title=Zero Score |url=http://www.newenglandfilm.com/news/archives/02september/zeroday.htm |publisher=New England Film |date=September 1, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205111318/http://newenglandfilm.com/news/archives/02september/zeroday.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, the [[Uwe Boll]] film ''[[Heart of America (film)|Heart of America: Home Room]]'' was released. The film's main plot focuses on two bullied students, Daniel Lynn and Barry Shultz, who plan to carry out a school shooting on the last day of school after being tortured by the school jocks. Barry, the main character, has second thoughts and quits at the last minute, while Daniel carries out the plan with a female accomplice, Dara McDermott. Barry is played by Michael Belyea, Daniel is played by Kett Turton, and Dara is played by Elisabeth Rosen. The film is believed to have been inspired by several shootings that are listed before the credits, Columbine being among them.

In 2004, the shooting was dramatized in the documentary ''[[Zero Hour (2004 TV series)|Zero Hour]]'', in which Harris and Klebold were played by Ben Johnson and Josh Young, respectively.

In 2007, the massacre was documented in an episode of the [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary series, ''The Final Report''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/columbine/ ''The Final Report: Columbine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042413/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/columbine/ |date=May 2, 2013 }}. [[National Geographic Channel]]. Retrieved March 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 film ''[[April Showers (2009 film)|April Showers]]'', which was written and directed by Andrew Robinson, who was a senior at Columbine High School during the shooting,&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Villarreal, Yvonne (April 16, 2009). [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/16/entertainment/et-columbine16 "Andrew Robinson's 'April Showers' focuses on survivors of Columbine"]. ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; the single shooter, Ben Harris, is played by Benjamin Chrystak.

The 2016 biographical film ''[[I'm Not Ashamed]]'', based on the journals of Rachel Scott, includes glimpses of Eric Harris' and Dylan Klebold's lives and of interactions between them and other students at Columbine High School.

'''Glenn Michael Souther''' (January 30, 1957, [[Hammond, Indiana]] to June 22, 1989, [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]), also known as '''Mikhail Yevgenyevich Orlov''', was a [[U.S. Navy]] photographer who gave up [[U.S. citizenship]] to become a Soviet citizen in 1986.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt; At first, when he asked for Soviet citizenship, Soviet counter-intelligence was confused, suspecting him of being a [[CIA]]-plant, sent on an [[espionage]] mission.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt; However, after Soviets found out that there was no secret plot behind his endeavour, they quickly promoted him from NCO up to the [[Major]]'s rank.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt; He settled down in the USSR, married a Russian woman, who taught English in one of the Moscow universities.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt; Three years after his defection he committed suicide, aged 32.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt;

==Biography==
After graduating from high school in 1975 in [[Cumberland, Maine]], Souther enlisted in the United States Navy and was trained as a photographer. He served on the [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)]] from July 1976 to November 1978. From April 1979 to 1982, he was stationed with the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] in [[Italy]], where he married an Italian woman. In Italy in 1980, he was recruited as a Soviet spy by experienced [[KGB]] officer [[Boris Aleksandrovich Solomatin]], who had earlier recruited and [[Agent handling|handled]] [[John Anthony Walker]]. According to Solomatin, Souther was an ideological spy and not motivated by money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Earley |first=Pete |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/spies/solomatin/8.html|title=Boris Solomatin, interview by Pete Earley|publisher=Trutv |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Souther was given an [[honorable discharge]] from the Navy with a rank of petty officer first class to study [[Russian literature]] in [[Old Dominion University]]. Simultaneously, he worked as a reservist at the Atlantic fleet intelligence center in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], where he was assigned to a laboratory processing satellite-reconnaissance photos and also may have been privy to sensitive communications intercepts. In 1981, his estranged wife approached a Navy officer to report that Souther was a spy. These allegations were not taken seriously until [[John Anthony Walker]]'s arrest in 1985. Thereafter, he was interrogated by the [[FBI]] but not charged due to a lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/29/world/ex-wife-of-dead-spy-told-navy-he-worked-for-soviets-us-says.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Glenn+Michael+Souther&amp;st=nyt |title=Ex-Wife of Dead Spy Told Navy He Worked for Soviets, U.S. Says|publisher=New York Times|date=29 June 1989|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, in May 1986, Souther asked for the Soviet citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958122,00.html|title=Soviet Union The Odd Case of M. Orlov|publisher=TIME|date=10 July 1989|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He did not publicly resurface until July 20, 1988, when a television interview program with a segment about him was broadcast on [[Soviet Central Television]]. In the program, he spoke about his own disillusionment with American nuclear policies and his love for the works of Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]. He also discussed and criticized several American intelligence operations in which he took part, including the [[1986 bombing of Libya]] and the analysis of the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1989"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/28/world/defector-to-moscow-is-dead-work-for-kgb-is-lauded.html|title=Defector to Moscow Is Dead; Work for K.G.B. Is Lauded |publisher=New York Times |date=28 June 1989 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Soviet Union, he married a Russian woman named Lena and had a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gase.nl/InternettreeUSA/b712.htm#P4022|title=The Dutch and American Gase and related families |publisher=Gase |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an [[Order of Friendship of Peoples]] and was one of the few foreign agents and defectors given officer rank in the [[KGB]], where he was made a [[major]] after his defection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svr.gov.ru/history/sou.htm |title=Соутер Гленн Майкл|publisher=SVR|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Orden De La Amistad De Los Pueblos.png|thumb|100px|right|Souther was awarded the [[Order of Friendship of Peoples|Order of Friendship]], one of the supreme Soviet awards.]]
On June 22, 1989, at the age of 32, Souther reportedly committed suicide by asphyxiation after sealing himself in his garage and starting his car. Russian newspapers suggested he had been depressed by living far from his birthplace. His death was announced by the ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda|Red Star]]'' newspaper, and he was eulogized by [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], who considered him to be very important agent.&lt;ref name="nytimes1989"/&gt; He was buried in [[Kuntsevo Cemetery]].

His suicide note contained the following text:&lt;ref name="SVR"&gt;Poroskov N. [http://svr.gov.ru/smi/2006/vrnov20060615.htm He gave Russia thousands of Nuke secrets] (Russian) June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I don't have any regrets about our relations. They were the long ones, they helped me to establish myself as an individual. Everyone was tolerant, and fair towards me. I hope that you, as it was always, forgive me the unwillingness to engage the last battle.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt;
----
'''''original text''''' {{ru icon}}: Я ни в коей мере не сожалею о наших отношениях. Они были продолжительными и помогли мне вырасти как личности. Все были терпимы и добры ко мне. Надеюсь, вы, как это было всегда, простите меня за то, что я не захотел пойти в последний бой.}}
Despite some expressions which make it clear that it has been written by a foreigner, such as "as it was always," which is unusual for native Russian-speakers, who use the shortened form "as always," the note itself has been written in coherent, literary Russian.

In his earlier notes of 1988 he claimed that Russia was his Dreamland, the land which astonished him, despite the loneliness he suffered while living far from the places he was born to.&lt;ref name="SVR"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8291">A '''Husa knife''', also sometimes called '''Achang knife''', is traditional forged weapon of the [[Achang people]] of China. The Achang live mainly in the village of "Husa", and smaller villages nearby, in [[Longchuan County, Yunnan|Longchuan County]], [[Dehong Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[Yunnan Province]], near the border between China and Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=泰山之邀 (Tour of Taishan)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPxuJjb7wWAC&amp;pg=PA194|year=2001|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-864-4|pages=194–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husa is well known for its knife and sword makers, who have sold their products to Burma and regions along Nu River since ancient times. The Achang craftsmen make a variety of types of blades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westchinatours.com/husa-knife-achang-minority.html The Famous "Husa Knife"——China Minorities——West China Tours Online Travel Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140901124055/http://www.westchinatours.com/husa-knife-achang-minority.html |date=2014-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husa knives are made with a special process which gives the metal a pure texture, and a really sharp and durable blade.&lt;ref name="Yu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Defen Yu|title=Aspects of Lisu phonology and grammar, a language of Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i0aAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University|isbn=978-0-85883-579-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The handles and sheaths are also inscribed with various traditional patterns, such as "flying [[dragon]] and [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]", "tiger roaring", "eastern sunrise", making each knife a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissertationtopic.net/doc/120801 The Achang Husa knife Arts of - Master's thesis - Dissertation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204002041/http://www.dissertationtopic.net/doc/120801 |date=2016-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Achang family keeps at least one knife of high quality. When the young Achang men get married, they carry back knives to show their heroic vitality. This ethnic custom has continued to the present time.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

== History ==
Forging techniques have been passed down through the generations of the Achang people since the [[Tang Dynasty]]. 
According to historical records, around 600 years ago, during the "[[Hongwu]]" period in [[Ming Dynasty]], soldiers from the army of [[Mu Ying]], a general of the Ming government, were settled in this area.  The soldiers brought military techniques of weapon making, gathered during their campaigns against Mongolia, Tibet, the Hui and the Yi, to the local Achang people. Husa village become the "arsenal" of Ming government armies. Achang people absorbed the Ming government army’s weapon manufacturing technology and evolved a unique Husa knife forge craftsmanship, which matured during the late Ming Dynasty and early [[Qing Dynasty]] (around 1600-1680), reached a its peak in early twentieth Century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.kunming.cn/index/content/2013-11/12/content_3439165_2.htm "Unveil remote ancients villages in Yunnan"] - ''enKunming'', 2013-November-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against Napoleon's army, those sabers, forged by the Husa were highly prized by the soldiers.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

During the First World War, British forces set up a "Jingpo" nationality army in Burma and every soldier was equipped with a special Husa saber, called "[[Geleka]]".{{cn|date=January 2016}} 

In 1990, the master forgers in Husa created a "Nine dragons" commander's sword.  This sword is worn by the honor guard of Chinese People's Liberation Army, guarding the Chinese national flag on Tian'anmen Square.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Husa knives have long been in demand by nearby Han, Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Tibetan, Bai and other ethnic people. Recently, Husa knives have been sold widely from Yunnan Province to Beijing, Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and other places, and exported to Burma, Thailand, India and other countries.&lt;ref name="民族画报社1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=民族画报社|title=中國民族 (China Nationalities)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-txAAAAIAAJ|year=1998|publisher=中国民族摄影艺术出版社|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pressure of the modern culture and the social economy, the Husa knife, forged by traditional techniques and devices, faces heavy competition from less expensive knives made by modern machinery and raw materials. As the traditional masters age, apprentices are rare, and the techniques of Husa knife creation face the danger of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cctv.com/program/e_documentary/20080828/101354.shtml CCTV International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

Many variations of the Husa knife have been developed during its long history. Some of these are: back swords (cane knives), machetes, broadswords, Tibetan knives (specifically made for Tibetans), daggers, and sabers. The best known types are the back sword (long blade) and Tibetan knife, and these are made with particularly elaborate quality and style. The Tibetan knife has wide and thick blade, and is made in various lengths, with delicate inscription "tiger roaring", "swallow flying" and other traditional patterns on the handle and sheath. Many Tibetan people wear the knife as their essential tool and ornament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/44Arts9163.html "Husa Knife Making of the Achang Minority - China culture Achang Minority"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312114804/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/44Arts9163.html |date=2016-03-12 }}.

Public Co.|isbn=978-974-272-485-6|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forging process==
The production process of Husa knife has 10 steps:
#processing of raw materials
#[[billet making]]
#proofing
#[[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]
#decorating with leaf
#[[quenching]]
#polishing
#handle-making
#belt-making
#assembling.
Special technique is especially important in the process of quenching. Through heat treatment, the quenching optimizes the hardness and toughness of the blade. In historical records, the blades are described as "flexible enough to be bent, one hair blown on the blade, cut two, just can chop iron".{{cn|date=January 2016}}

The tools to make Husa knives include a wooden [[bellows]], a clay-made stove, as well as hammers, clamps, and [[iron pillows]]. Raw iron with high carbon content is selected by an experienced old master from specific locations around Baoshan, Tengchong regions, the traditional mine areas in Yunnan. Younger craftsmen, put the selected raw iron into the stove, heating, forging repeatedly, to purify the texture and form different shapes. The resulting metal is ground into blade blanks; and after all these lengthy processes, comes the most important and subtlest process: quenching. Quenching technology requires special know-how. The quality of a knife, largely depends on the quenching skills. There is a kind of thin blade Husa back sword which can bend its blade as a cycle. It can only be built after repeatedly and precisely water quenching and oil tempering.


The knife production comes under a model of co-operation between each "Zhai"(small stockaded village) in Husa. Each "Zhai"   has its "fist" product. The whole Husa "Bazi"(small plain), likes a handicraft factory, and each "Zhai" is one workshop, which is famous for one special product.  
Laifu "Zhai" has well-known black cane knife, Mangdong "Zhai" has broadsword and dagger, Lajie "Zhai" has sharp sickles, Xin "Zhai" has back knife and Mangsuo "Zhai" has delicate sheaths.

On August 31, 2014, a collection of almost 500 private pictures of various celebrities, mostly women, and with many [[Imagery of nude celebrities|containing nudity]], were posted on the [[imageboard]] [[4chan]], and later disseminated by other users on websites and social networks such as [[Imgur]] and [[Reddit]]. The images were initially believed to have been obtained via a breach of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Cloud computing|cloud services]] suite [[iCloud]],&lt;ref name="guardian-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name = mccoy /&gt;&lt;ref name = McCormack /&gt; or a security issue in the iCloud [[API]] which allowed them to make unlimited attempts at guessing victims' passwords.&lt;ref name="stars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimes2" /&gt; However, access was later revealed to have been gained via [[Phishing#Spear phishing|spear phishing]] attacks.&lt;ref name="Apple 2014-09-02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-iclouddenied&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple denies iCloud breach in celebrity nude photo hack|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/2/6098107/apple-denies-icloud-breach-celebrity-nude-photo-hack|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The event, which media outlets and Internet users referred to under names such as "'''The Fappening'''" (a [[portmanteau]] of the words "fap"—a slang term for [[masturbation]]—and the film ''[[The Happening (2008 film)|The Happening]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elle.com.au/news/zeitgeist/2014/12/the-sex-crime-we-need-to-talk-about/ |title=The sex crime we need to talk about |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/reddit-fappening-ban-triggers-outraged-response-nude-photo-distributor-1681708 |title=Reddit Fappening Ban Triggers Outraged Response From Nude Photo Distributor |last1=Stone |first1=Jeff |last2= |first2= |date=September 8, 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and "'''Celebgate'''", was met with a varied reaction from the media and fellow celebrities. Critics felt that the distribution of the images was a major invasion of privacy for their subjects, while some of the allegedly depicted subjects questioned their authenticity. The leak also prompted increased concern from analysts surrounding the privacy and security of [[cloud computing]] services such as iCloud—with a particular emphasis on their use to store sensitive, private information.

== Procurement and distribution == 
The images were obtained via the [[cloud storage|online storage]] offered by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iCloud]] platform for automatically backing up photos from [[iOS]] devices, such as [[iPhone]]s.&lt;ref name="The Next Web 2014-09-01" /&gt; Apple later reported that the victims' iCloud account information was obtained using "a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions", such as [[phishing]] and [[brute force method|brute-force]] guessing.&lt;ref name="Apple 2014-09-02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-iclouddenied /&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-timcook /&gt; It was initially believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the [[Find My iPhone]] service.&lt;ref name="The Next Web 2014-09-01" /&gt; Court documents from 2014 indicated that one user created a fake email account called "appleprivacysecurity" to ask celebrities for security information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/feds-raided-another-chicago-home-in-nude-celeb-hack-inv-1753200305 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116132106/http://gawker.com/feds-raided-another-chicago-home-in-nude-celeb-hack-inv-1753200305 |title=Feds Raided Another Chicago Home in Nude Celeb Hack Investigation, Still No Charges Pressed |first=Sam |last=Biddle |work=Gawker |year=2016 |accessdate=January 27, 2016 |archivedate=January 16, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos were being passed around privately for at least a couple of weeks before their public release on August 31.

== Reaction ==
Writer [[Van Badham]] condemned the photo leaks and the people who shared the photos.&lt;ref name=Badham /&gt; Actress [[Lena Dunham]] pleaded on Twitter for people not to view the pictures, saying doing so "violat[es] these women over and over again. It's not okay."&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; Actress [[Emma Watson]] condemned not only the release of the photos, but also "the accompanying comments [on social media] that show such a lack of empathy."&lt;ref name=worse /&gt;  Actors [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Lucas Neff]] also spoke out against the hackers and people who posted the pictures.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt; Justin Verlander, then a pitcher for the [[Detroit Tigers]], told the media prior to a game against the [[Cleveland Indians]] that he keeps his private life private and would rather focus on the Tigers' race with the [[Kansas City Royals]] for the [[American League Central|AL Central]] title than be a distraction to his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11455134/justin-verlander-detroit-tigers-addresses-online-photo-hacking Justin Verlander addresses scandal] [[ESPN.com]] (September 2, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Security analysts have stated that the breach could have been prevented through the use of [[Multi-factor authentication|two-factor authentication]],&lt;ref name="Re/code 2014-09-01" /&gt; while a ''[[Forbes]]'' writer recommended turning off the iCloud "Photo Stream" feature (which uploads photos taken with an [[iOS]] device to iCloud servers automatically) entirely.&lt;ref name=gordonkelly /&gt;

The incident has been given many names, including "The Fappening" (a [[portmanteau]] of "The Happening" and "[[wikt:fap#Etymology 2|fap]]", an [[internet slang]] term for male [[masturbation]])&lt;ref name=Volkert /&gt; and "Celebgate" (a [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|reference]] to the [[Watergate scandal]]).&lt;ref name=Alfonso /&gt; The term "The Fappening" has received criticism from journalists like Radhika Sanghani of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and Toyin Owoseje of ''[[The International Business Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owoseje|first1=Toyin|title=A New Kind of Pervert?

In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] stated that in response to the leaks, the company planned to take additional steps to protect the privacy and security of iCloud users in the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakabayashi|first=Daisuke|date=September 5, 2014|title=Tim Cook Says Apple to Add Security Alerts for iCloud Users|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tim-cook-says-apple-to-add-security-alerts-for-icloud-users-1409880977|journal=Wall Street Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notifications will be provided whenever data is restored to a device via iCloud and after logging into iCloud via a web browser,&lt;ref name=verge-emailnotification&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple just added another layer of iCloud security, a day before iPhone 6 event|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/8/6121515/apple-just-added-another-layer-of-icloud-security-a-day-before-iphone|accessdate=September 8, 2014|work=The Verge|date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to existing notifications when a user's iCloud password is changed. Additionally, Apple will broaden and encourage the use of [[two-factor authentication]] in future versions of its software and operating systems, such as the then-upcoming [[IOS 8]].

Jennifer Lawrence contacted authorities and her publicist has stated that the authorities will prosecute anyone who posts leaked images of her.&lt;ref name= fox /&gt;  ''Forbes'' columnist Joseph Steinberg questioned whether the reactions by law enforcement and technology providers indicated that celebrities were being treated differently from ordinary Americans, which, in the case of law enforcement, may be illegal.&lt;ref name=josephsteinberg /&gt;

On October 1, 2014, [[Google]] was threatened with a lawsuit by lawyer Martin Singer for $100 million on behalf of unnamed victims of the leaks, alleging that Google had refused to respond to requests for the images to be removed from its platforms (including [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[YouTube]]), "[failing] to act expeditiously, and responsibly to remove the images", and "knowingly accommodating, facilitating, and perpetuating the unlawful conduct".&lt;ref name=deadline-googlelawsuit&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Blasted With $100M Lawsuit Threat Over Hacked Celeb Photos|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/hacked-celebrity-photos-google-lawsuit-jennifer-lawrence-844715/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-googlelawsuit&gt;{{cite web|title=Google threatened with $100m lawsuit over nude celebrity photos|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/google-lawsuit-nude-celebrity-photos|website=The Guardian|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Lawrence called the leak a "sex crime" and a "sexual violation" and added, "anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense and you should cower with shame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/jennifer-lawrence-cover|title=Cover Exclusive: Jennifer Lawrence Calls Photo Hacking a "Sex Crime"|work=Vanity Fair|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was contrasted by another victim of the hack, [[Emily Ratajkowski]], who told ''GQ'', "A lot of people who were victims of [the hack] said anyone who looks at these pictures should feel guilty, but I just don't think that's fair", and "I'm not sure that anyone who Googles it is necessarily a criminal.

== Investigation ==
The [[FBI]] said that it was "aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter."&lt;ref name="CBS News 2014-09-01" /&gt; Similarly, Apple stated that it had been investigating whether a security breach of the iCloud service was responsible for the leaked photographs, as per the company's commitment to user privacy.&lt;ref name="Re/code 2014-09-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BI /&gt; On September 2, 2014, Apple reported that the leaked images were the result of compromised accounts, using "a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet".&lt;ref name="Apple 2014-09-02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-iclouddenied"/&gt;

In October 2014, FBI searched a house in [[Chicago]] and seized several computers, cell phones and storage drives after tracking the source of a hacking attack to an IP address linked to an individual named Emilio Herrera. A related search warrant application mentioned eight victims with initials A.S., C.H., H.S., J.M., O.W., A.K., E.B., and A.H., which supposedly point to stolen photos of [[Abigail Spencer]], [[Christina Hendricks]], [[Hope Solo]], [[Jennette McCurdy]], [[Olivia Wilde]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Emily Browning]], and [[Amber Heard]].

During the investigation, it was found that Collins phished by sending e-mails to the victims that looked like they came from Apple or Google, warning the victims that their accounts might be compromised and asking for their account details. The victims would enter their passwords, and Collins gained access to their accounts, downloading e-mails and iCloud backups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/prosecutors-find-that-fappening-celebrity-nudes-leak-was-not-apples-fault/ Prosecutors find that ‘Fappening’ celebrity nudes leak was not Apple’s fault] March 15, 2016, Techcrunch&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, Collins was sentenced to 18 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/27/nude-celebrity-photos-hacker-prison-sentence-ryan-collins Hacker who stole nude photos of celebrities gets 18 months in prison] October 27, 2016, ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37796986|title=Celebgate hack: Collins sentenced over nude photos theft|date=October 28, 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2018,  Christopher Brannan, a former Virginia teacher, became the fifth man to be convicted in relation to the hacking.

Tisa rejects her husband and she and Bora get married in the church. Tisa tries to get to Belgrade, while Bora stabs a man in a [[knife fight]].

'''Indian Singaporeans''' or '''Singaporean Indians''' ({{lang-ta|'''சிங்கப்பூர் இந்தியர்கள்'''}}, ''Ciṅkappūr Intiyarkaḷ'') – defined as persons of South Asian [[ancestry]] – constitute 9.0% of the country's citizens,&lt;ref name="pop2017"/&gt; making them the third largest [[ethnic group]] in Singapore.

While [[Greater India|contact with ancient India]] left a deep impact on Singapore's indigenous [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] culture, the mass migration of Indians to the island only began with the [[founding of modern Singapore]] by the British in 1819. Initially, the Indian population was transient, mainly comprising young men who came as workers, soldiers and convicts. By the mid-20th century, a settled community had emerged, with a more balanced [[sex ratio|gender ratio]] and a better [[demographic profile|spread of age groups]].

Singapore's Indian population is notable for its [[class stratification]], with large elite and [[Working class|lower income]] groups. This has grown more visible since the 1990s with an influx of both well-educated and unskilled migrants from India, which has created new contradictions.

Singapore Indians are linguistically and religiously diverse, with ethnic [[Tamil people|Tamils]] and nominal [[Hindu]]s forming majorities. The local Indian culture has endured and evolved over almost 200 years. By the 1990s, it had grown somewhat distinct from contemporary South Asian cultures, even as Indian elements became diffused within a broader [[Culture of Singapore|Singaporean culture]]. Since then, new immigrants have increased the size and complexity of the local Indian population. [[Low-cost carriers]], cable television and the Internet now connect the local Indian community with the culture of India and the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]].

Several in-depth studies have been conducted and published in the recent years on the Indian communities in Singapore such as Rajesh Rai's, Indians in Singapore, 1819 -1945: Diaspora in the Colonial Port City, Anitha Devi Pillai's, From Kerala to Singapore: Voices from the Singapore Malayalee Community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962741080|title=From Kerala to Singapore : voices from the Singapore Malayalee community|last=Pillai|first=Anitha Devi|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|others=Puva Arumugam,|year=2017|isbn=9789814721837|location=Singapore|pages=|oclc=962741080}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mathew Mathews, The Singapore Ethnic Mosaic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1012427552|title=The Singapore ethnic mosaic : many cultures, one people|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Mathews, Mathew, 1974-|year=2017|isbn=9789813234734|location=Singapore|pages=|oclc=1012427552}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others.

Prominent Indian individuals have long made a mark in Singapore as leaders of various fields in national life. Indians are also collectively well represented, in areas such as [[Politics of Singapore|politics]], [[Education in Singapore|education]], [[Foreign relations of Singapore|diplomacy]] and the [[Law in Singapore|law]].

{{main|Race in Singapore}}

The [[Organisation of the Government of Singapore#Departments/Divisions 10|Singapore Department of Statistics]] defines 'Indians' as a '[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]' (or '[[ethnic group]]'), comprising "''persons of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Sri Lankan origin such as [[Tamil people|Tamils]], [[Malayali people|Malayalis]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s, [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] etc.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/publications/publications_and_papers/cop2010/census_2010_release1/cop2010sr1.pdf|title=Census of Population 2010 Statistical Release 1: Demographic Characteristics, Education, Language and Religion|last=|first=|date=2010|website=Department of Statistics, Singapore|publisher=|page=185|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516214219/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/publications/publications_and_papers/cop2010/census_2010_release1/cop2010sr1.pdf|archive-date=16 May 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leow, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indians 'in Singapore' may be further defined in terms of nationality and residency status. Most ethnic Indians are Singapore citizens, known as 'Singaporean Indians', or 'local Indians'. They are usually the locally born second, third, fourth or even fifth generation descendants of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. In addition, there are many ethnic Indian [[immigrant workers in Singapore]]. Citizens of the Republic of India are called 'Indian nationals', or even 'Indian Indians'.&lt;ref&gt;In his 2006 National Day Rally, Singapore's Prime Minister said "A Chinese Chinese is different from a Singapore Chinese. An Indian Indian is different from a Singapore Indian. In fact, when I met Mr. Koizumi last year and I told him, you know, we are bringing in Chinese Chinese, Indian Indians, he looked at me, he said, "Chinese Chinese?" I had to explain, "Ya, indeed, they come from China. Singapore Chinese come from Singapore. We are different." {{cite web|url=http://www.singaporeangle.com/2006/08/transcript-of-pms-rally-speech-in.html|title=Transcript of PM's Rally Speech in English: Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loong's NDR 2006 (English speech): Singapore--Our Future, Our Home|publisher=singaporeangle.com|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=6 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726093934/http://www.singaporeangle.com/2006/08/transcript-of-pms-rally-speech-in.html|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Indians may be distinguished in terms of residency status.

Well educated professionals or entrepreneurs with a high earning capacity are granted renewable Employment Passes. These entitle the holder’s spouse, children and parents to Dependents Passes. Students may enter on Students Passes. Pass holders may apply for Permanent Residence, which lets them live in Singapore on a long term-basis. As part of [[Singaporean nationality law]], they are also eligible to apply for Singapore Citizenship. In contrast, unskilled foreign workers enter Singapore with Work Permits. They are rarely allowed to stay in Singapore for more than two years and are never allowed to bring dependents with them. Nor are they eligible to apply for either Permanent Residence or Citizenship.

Demographic statistics are generally restricted to 'Singapore residents', defined as both Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents. Many of the statistics about Indians in Singapore in this article are restricted to this group. Scholars have noted "(o)fficial figures for workers on temporary contracts are difficult to obtain because the Ministry of Manpower in Singapore considers the information sensitive."&lt;ref name="Lal-p176"&gt;Lal, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there is limited information about short-term or 'non-resident' Indians in Singapore. Note that use of the term 'non-resident' Indian should not be confused with the concept of the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non Resident Indian]] or NRI, which the government of the Republic of India uses to describe its citizens living abroad. In Singapore, an NRI may be statistically non-resident (in the case of work permit or pass holders) or he/she may be considered a Singapore resident (in the case of permanent residents).

==Ethno-linguistic profile==
{{main|Indian languages in Singapore}}
Singaporean Indians are grouped according to their respective ethnolinguistic backgrounds in the [[Indian subcontinent]], or 'dialect group'. Most Indians in Singapore have ancestral links to [[southern India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], with substantial groups from [[northern India]] and [[western India]] accounting for most of the remainder. These are generally the descendants of both free and indentured immigrants from [[India]] during the 19th and early half of the 20th century.

In 2010, the [[Singapore]] census categorised 237,473 Singaporeans and 110,646 permanent residents into a number of '[[dialect]]' groups. However, these groups included [[Sikh]]s, who are a religious rather than linguistic group.  Virtually all of the Sikhs are [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], which was also captured as a separate 'dialect' category (comprising mainly Hindu Punjabis). Given their small absolute and relative numbers, the following table adapts the 2010 census data by combining the 'Sikh' (12,952) and 'Punjabi' (5,672) category under 'Punjabi'.

The percentages in the table refer to the proportion of each language group within the larger Resident Indian community in Singapore.

Singapore's Indian community is characterised by an ethnic Tamil majority (54.18%) and a large number of smaller groups. Ethnic [[Tamils]] in Singapore include both [[Tamil people|Tamils from India]] and [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] (sometimes referred to as '[[Ceylon]]ese'). [[Malayalee]]s from [[Kerala]] in southern India form the second largest community, making up 7.57% of the Indian population. Tamils and Malayalees are the two main [[south Indian]] communities in Singapore, forming two-thirds of the Indian population. Meanwhile, the three main [[north Indian]] groups in Singapore (the [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], and [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] communities) constitute 7.67% of all Indians. The remaining 29.68% comprises many smaller groups from both southern India (such as the [[Telugu people|Telugus]] and [[Telugu people|Kannadigas]]), eastern India (such as the [[Bengalis]]), and northern India ([[Hindustani people|Hindustanis]]).

==History==
{{main|History of Singapore Indians}}

===Pre-colonial period===
[[File:SingaporeStone-bwphoto.jpg|thumb|200px|A fragment of the [[Singapore Stone]], inscribed with an [[Indic script]], c 10th to 13th century.]]
{{main|Greater India}}
Ancient [[Indian History|India]] exerted a profound influence over Southeast Asia through [[spice trade#spice islands|trade]], [[Asoka#Missions to spread the Dharma/Dhamma|religious missions]], [[Rajendra Chola#Overseas conquests|wars]] and other forms of contact. [[Early history of Singapore|Pre-colonial]] Singapore was part of 'Indianised Kingdoms' like [[Srivijaya]] and the [[Majapahit]], which formed part of a cultural region known as [[Greater India]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 12–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the spread of [[Islam]], Singapore and the rest of the [[Malay World]], was Hindu-Buddhist. One of the most extensive and enduring Indian influence in [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] culture is the vast number of [[Malay language#Borrowed words|Indian loan words]] in the [[Malay language]].

Indian influence is also seen in symbols and mythology associated with ancient Singapore. . The [[Sejarah Melayu]] or Malay Annals describe the Indian prince who founded Singapore – [[Sang Nila Utama]] – as being a descendant of [[Alexander the Great]] and an Indian Princess.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Cheryl-Ann Mei Gek, 'Singapore from the 14th to 19th Century' in Miksic &amp; Low (2004) p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the royal and sacred associations of [[Fort Canning Hill]], the seat of ancient rulers, are related to the Hindu [[Mount Meru]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Cheryl-Ann Mei Gek, 'Singapore from the 14th to 19th Century' in Miksic &amp; Low (2004) p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological digs have unearthed Hindu-Buddhist artefacts from the pre-colonial period. In 1822, [[John Crawfurd]] documented the ruins of a Hindu or Buddhist temple on [[Fort Canning Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, Cheryl-Ann Mei Gek, 'Singapore from the 14th to 19th Century' in Miksic &amp; Low (2004) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore's two most important pre-colonial artefacts are the [[Singapore Stone]], which is inscribed with an [[Indic script]], and a gold armlet bearing the motif of a Hindu 'kala' head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lim|first=Wei Chean|title=Singapore's Treasures|publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|date=31 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period: 1820s–1950s===

====Migration and settlement====
Following the Portuguese colonisation of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]) in 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to bring their married Indian women who were converted already to Roman Catholic Christianity, under a policy set by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], then [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India|India]]. These people were [[Goan Catholics]] ([[Konkani people|Konkani]] Catholics) and [[East Indians]] (Catholics of [[Marathi people|Marathi descent]]). Kuparis who were of mixed Samvedic Brahmin, Goan and Portuguese descent also arrived. [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and their children from Portuguese that include [[Portuguese Burghers]] from [[Portuguese Ceylon]] also came later. Their children already intermarried with Malay population, losing their ethnic identities. Indian contact was rekindled from 1819 to [[World War II]], when both [[British India|India]] and Singapore were under [[British Empire|British colonial rule]]. Unlike earlier forms of contact, this led to mass migration and, eventually, the formation of a large, settled and distinct population. By 1824, Singapore's first census counted 756 Indian residents, or about 7% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1826, official figures give a total population of 13,750, of which 1,021 are Indians – 244 from [[Bengal]] and 777 from the [[Coromandel Coast]], most of whom were males.&lt;ref name="census 1826"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n43/mode/2up |editors=Wright, Arnold and Cartwright, H.A. |date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Indian immigrants were predominantly adult men who came from India to find work, serve military duties or prison sentences for several years before returning home. There was a constant flow of Indians in and out of the city, keeping the local community fairly transient.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lal, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of Indians were also wealthy merchants who settled in Singapore and built local commercial and social institutions. Best known amongst them was [[Naraina Pillai]], the earliest Indian community leader and the island's first building contractor. In 1827, he also founded the [[Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore|Sri Mariamman Temple]], Singapore oldest Hindu place of worship.

The influx of Indians in the half century after 1819 led to a brief period when Indians, for the only time, overtook the Malays to become the second largest ethnic group. In 1860, they formed 16% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, pp.36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their number then fell from 13,000 that year to 12,000 in 1880, or 8.7% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Indians slowly began to settle permanently in greater numbers and the relative size of the community in colonial Singapore became stable, fluctuating between 7.7% and 9.4%.

====Social characteristics====
[[File:KITLV - 103786 - Indian couple in Singapore - circa 1890.tif|thumb|right|upright|An Indian-Muslim couple in Singapore, circa 1890.]]
Scholars have characterised the Indian community in colonial times as being diverse and highly stratified along class lines. According to Dr Rajesh Rai, the social hierarchy comprised four main groups: the educated professional elite (over 0.5% of the Indian community), mercantile groups (under 10%), the white collar middle class (5–7%) and the uneducated labourers (over 80%).&lt;ref&gt;Lal, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic class and job functions were also aligned with the ethnic origins of immigrants. For example, [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s and [[Malayalee]]s formed the core of the English educated upper middle class. Mercantile families tended to be [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], and Tamil Muslim. South Indian upper caste Hindus tended to perform traditional skilled jobs, such as moneylenders ([[Chettiars]]) and priests ([[Brahmins]]). [[Sikh]]s were often policemen or private security guards. Most of these migrants were voluntary migrants who entered and left Singapore freely on their own resources. Unskilled [[coolies]] tended to be landless Tamil peasants from the [[Shudra]] caste as well as [[Adi Dravida]]s or '[[Untouchable (social system)|Untouchable]]s'. These were often indentured labourers who were brought through various labour recruitment systems to work on rubber plantations in [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]]. Many later came to work in Singapore once free of their bonds. Another group which was less than free was the military. The first Indians in Singapore were 120 [[sepoys]] in the Bengal Native Infantry and a 'bazaar contingent' of washermen, servants and others who came with [[Stamford Raffles]] on his first visit in 1819. Throughout the colonial period, military personnel came from all over India. Most returned home after their service without settling in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Netto, p.14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lal, p.178-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there were the convicts. In the 19th century, the British shipped Indian convicts to Singapore to relieve overcrowded Indian jails. These men (and some women) were used as labour to build public buildings and roads in Singapore. Like the sepoys, they came from all parts of India. While some returned to India, several settled in Singapore after serving their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lal, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Netto, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social reform movements====
[[File:RamakrishnaSg.jpg|thumb|200px|Ramakrishna Mission, Singapore.]]
From the 19th century, '''[[Hindu reform movement]]s''' emerged in India as part of a broader cultural modernisation. These movements sought to promote what they saw as a more authentic form of Hinduism while addressing social abuses, such as the [[Hindu caste system]]. These movements spread to overseas Indian communities, including Singapore. Groups like the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], [[Arya Samaj]] and Sree Narayana Mission were active conduits of this reform movement. Traditional religious practices, especially among lower caste Hindus, centred around various rural folk traditions, esoteric rituals and superstitions. In contrast, the new movement appealed to better educated urban Hindus, by conducting religious education classes for children and adults, and interpreting the values, concepts and principals behind the religion for lay people. These groups also encouraged a more direct relationship with God, unmediated by Brahmin priests and rituals, through individual devotion (stemming from the [[Bhakti movement]]), chanting Bhajans, or hymns, as well as through [[yoga]]. Charitable service was also promoted. The Ramakrishna Mission in Singapore set up a home for boys from troubled homes, while the Sree Narayana Mission set up a home of the destitute elderly.

Another social reform movement was the '''[[Self-Respect Movement]]''', which emerged in Tamil Nadu in the 1920s to liberate [[Dravidian people]], and especially [[Adi Dravida]]s and lower caste Tamils from what was seen as [[Brahmin]] oppression. This movement sought inspiration from Tamil history and culture. In Singapore, groups like the Tamil Reform Association were inspired by this movement. They imported publications from India that promoted the movement, and they also hosted visiting leaders of the Self-Respect Movement from Tamil Nadu when they visited Singapore. The Singapore groups focussed on moral, social and religious reform. For example, they campaigned against caste distinctions and alcohol abuse. These groups also promoted the use of the Tamil language, and the development of Tamil literature in Singapore, through the establishment of Tamil newspapers and schools. They were also involved in the union activism, especially in those work sectors dominated by Tamils. Tamil-educated journalists and teachers were at the forefront of this movement. Leaders like [[Thamizhavel G. Sarangapani]] were especially instrumental in championing the rights of Tamils and Indians, by encouraging Indians to register for Singapore citizenship in the 1950s, and by campaigning to make Tamil one of Singapore's official languages.&lt;ref&gt;Lal, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1915 Singapore Mutiny====
{{main|1915 Singapore Mutiny}}
[[File:1915 Singapore Mutiny.jpg|thumb|200px|Sepoy mutineers awaiting execution in 1915.]]
The [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]], also known as the 1915 Sepoy Mutiny, was an incident concerning 850 [[sepoys]] (Indian soldiers) who mutinied against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] on 15 February 1915 in Singapore, as part of the [[1915 Ghadar Conspiracy]] (not to be mistaken for the [[Indian Mutiny of 1857]]). The mainly Muslim sepoys mutinied because they believed they were being sent to fight for the British against Muslim Turks, as part of the [[First World War]]. This mutiny lasted nearly 7 days, and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians. The mutineers were later rounded up and executed. In general, the mutiny was restricted to the Muslim sepoys, and did not involve the wider Indian population. While the mutiny was a significant event in the history of Singapore, and one of the most important ones specifically involving the Indian community, it was somewhat distinct from the mainstream development of Indian nationalist sentiments in the local Indian population, which emerged most prominently around the time of the [[Second World War]].

====Political movements====
[[File:Newly-arrived Indian troops.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Indian troops in Singapore, 1941.]]
Nationalist movements in India established branch organisations in Singapore to draw on local Indian support for Indian independence. The '''[[Indian Independence League]]''' was a [[Resistance movement|political organisation]] operated from the 1920s to the 1940s to organise those living outside of India to remove the British from India. Founded in 1928 by Indian nationalists [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the organisation was active in Singapore and Malaya following Japan's successful [[Malayan Campaign]] in the [[Second World War]].

The '''[[Indian National Army]]''' (INA) was an armed force formed by [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalists]] in 1942 in [[South east Asia]], also during [[World War II]]. Their aim was to overthrow the [[British Raj]] in colonial India, with [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] assistance. Many Indian soldiers and civilians were recruited in Singapore and Malaya to join the INA during the Japanese occupation. Many of them died fighting alongside the Japanese against the British in Burma during the war.

Indian nationalist sentiments in Singapore and Malaya were paralleled by the rise of Chinese nationalism amongst the overseas Chinese in these territories. As these colonies progressed towards independence, Indians and Chinese in Malaya organised themselves along the lines of ethnic political parties. For instance, the Indian Association in Singapore, today a social and recreational club, was one of a network of such clubs in early 20th century Malaya which came together to form what would become the '''[[Malaysian Indian Congress]]''' (MIC), the current ethnic Indian party within Malaysia's ruling [[Barisan National]] coalition government.
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:SRajaratnam smiling.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam|S. Rajaratnam]].]] --&gt;
Unlike Malaysia's delicate ethno-demographic balance, Singapore had a large Chinese majority. This rendered ethnic-based politics less viable, and tended to support class-based politics instead. For example, several Indian professionals supported the more conservative pro-British parties, as they had been beneficiaries of the colonial system. In contrast, the ruling '''[[People's Action Party]]''' (PAP) espoused an ideology of [[social democracy]] which gained the support of Indian union workers. [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam|S. Rajaratnam]] was one of the founding members of the PAP, and he worked to define and champion its vision of a multi-racial country, in contrast to the Malaysian model.

More left-leaning Indian leaders and intellectuals, such as [[C.V. Devan Nair]] and James Puthucheary initially supported more radically left-wing groups. They had been imprisoned by the British for their radical union activism. Later, some of these men join the more moderate wing of the PAP. Devan Nair went on to build the modern trades union movement in Singapore, the [[National Trades Union Congress]].  Consequently, Indians in Singapore tended to align themselves, both individually and as groups, with parties advocating specific political or economic ideologies, rather than along purely racial lines. This basic difference between the Indian communities of Singapore and Malaysia has endured to the present day.

===Post-colonial history: 1960s – present===

====Immediate post-colonial period: 1960s – 1980s====
Scholars have identified two phases in the development of the Indian community after Singaporean independence in 1965.&lt;ref name="Lal-p185"&gt;Lal, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase, from 1965 to the early 1990s, saw a decline in the proportion of the community from 9% in 1957 to a low of 6.4% in 1980. One reason was the withdrawal of British military forces in the early 1970s, which led to the repatriation of many Indian base workers. Another factor was the retirement of older men, who chose to return to families in India. Meanwhile, post-1965 immigration restrictions ended new migration from India. Furthermore, there was a rise in the emigration of Indian Singaporeans to the West in the late 1980s. During this time, the Indian population continued to grow in absolute terms due to natural increase. Even as it grew proportionally smaller, the community also became more settled, with several new generations born locally.

From the 1960s to 1980s, the [[People's Action Party]] government tried to cultivate a shared national identity and to end the historical tendency of Singaporeans to identify with the national – and often nationalistic – politics of their ancestral homelands. While different ethnic groups were allowed, and sometimes encouraged to retain their cultural identities, they were also pushed to integrate socially, politically and economically across ethnic lines. The government pursued policies to integrate the races in public housing estates and national schools. Young men underwent two years of compulsory national service in ethnically mixed military or police camps. Traditional family businesses were superseded by government agencies or foreign multi-national corporations, which hired multi-ethnic workforces on the basis of meritocratic ability rather than kinship or ethnicity. Consequently, "the cultivation of a Singaporean identity has been largely successful in converting Indian migrants into Indian-Singaporeans."&lt;ref name="Lal-p185" /&gt; In general, Indian social patterns and political activities became aligned and integrated within the national mainstream from the 1960s.

Although the Singapore government championed public policies and a political discourse of racial integration and national identity, it came to recognise that important differences in the socio-economic profiles of the three main races continued to endure in the post-colonial period. Initially, it had set up Mendaki, a quasi-autonomous [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] community self-help group to promote educational advancement within that community to address underperformance by Malay students. In the 1980s, this approach – which was initially seen as an exceptional measure taken in the case of the Malay community – became entwined with the rhetoric of [[Asian values]], which saw the promotion of a greater consciousness and pride in each citizen's own ethnic heritage, as a bulwark against the supposedly negative influence of Western culture. Consequently, the government established the [[Singapore Indian Development Association]] (SINDA) in 1991 to address the educational and social problems of the Indian community. Shortly after, a similar body was set up for the majority Chinese community.

Apart from ethnic self-help groups like SINDA (which remain controversial in Singapore), the government has in the main pursued policies emphasising racial integration and national identity. It is against this backdrop that immigration policies were liberalised in the 1990s, leading to an influx of foreigners in Singapore, particularly Indian nationals. This led to a new phase in the history of the Indian community in Singapore.

====Contemporary period: 1990s – present====
[[File:Singapore LittleIndia.JPG|thumb|200px|Foreign construction workers at [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]].]]
A second phase began in the early 1990s, when immigration policies were liberalised to attract foreign professionals to boost the size and skills of the local workforce. The government was keen to draw in well educated migrants from Asian countries who, it was hoped, would be both keen and able to settle permanently. This also addressed the problem of Singapore's extremely low fertility rates. In addition to these professionals, unskilled foreign workers were recruited as low cost manual labour for construction sites and the cleaning sector, albeit without the prospect of permanent settlement. As a result of these policies, the Indian population grew faster than other groups. The proportion of Indian citizens and permanent residents rose from 6.4% in 1980 to 9.23% in 2010. This was mainly due to rapid growth in the number of Indian nationals who acquired Singapore citizenship or permanent residency.

For some years now, the Department of Statistics has stopped providing ethnic data about the short-term or 'non-resident' foreign citizens living in Singapore (i.e. those without Singapore Permanent Residence). As of end June 2007, there were 1,005,500 such persons, or 21.5% of the total population.&lt;ref name="singstat-10"&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/mdsmar10.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This group includes two-year work permit holders as well as those holding renewable Employment, Dependant and Student Passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits|title=Work passes and permits|publisher=[[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]]|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Dr Rajesh Rai from the [[National University of Singapore]] has observed that "independent surveys approximate the number of South Asians on work permits to be… approximately 90,000–100,000."&lt;ref name="Lal-p176" /&gt; In November 2007, a cabinet minister said "more than 20,000 Indian professionals had set up home" in Singapore, although it is unclear if this referred only to Employment Pass holders, or if it included Permanent Residents, Student Pass and/or Dependant Pass holders.&lt;ref&gt;'Leeway for DBS' Indian expansion' by Ravi Velloor in The Straits Times 5 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these figures, the number of short-term or 'non-resident' Indians in Singapore in 2007 is likely to be in the region of 100,000. As such, the proportion of Indians in the total population is likely to range from 9% to 10% (suggesting 89,000 to 135,000 'non-resident' Indians).

The advance release figures from Singapore's 2010 Census show, for the first time, the number of ethnic Indian Singapore citizens, and ethnic Indian Singapore Permanent Residents, separately – instead of combining the two. As of 2010, there were 237,473 Indian Singapore citizens, or 7.35% of the citizen population. There were 110,646 Indian PRs, or 20.45% of the PR population. In total, ethnic Indians formed 348,119, or 9.23% of the 'resident' population of citizens and PRs.

==Demographics==

===Income and education===
[[File:School300.jpg|thumb|[[DPS International School Singapore]].]]
Alongside other ethnic groups, Indians from all social backgrounds have achieved significant advances in their educational levels, income, life expectancy and other social indicators. Singapore's extraordinary economic growth from the 1960s to 1990s lifted many out of poverty and created a broad middle class. In the process, many Indians experienced upward social mobility for the first time. Despite this progress, Indians remain somewhat stratified in terms of class relative to other ethnic groups. With the influx of highly qualified Indian Permanent Residents, the socio-economic indicators of the Indian community have improved, arguably masking the under-achievement of some Indians. In 2005, both the average and median monthly income for Indian Residents (S$3,660 and $2,480 respectively) exceeded those for all Residents (S$3,500 and S$2,410 respectively). In the same year, 25% of Indian Residents had a [[university degree]] as their highest qualification attained. In contrast the national average was only 17%.&lt;ref name="singstat-indicators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/ghsr1/indicators.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919204403/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/ghsr1/indicators.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2007|title=Wayback Machine|date=19 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other educations statistics are less positive. In 2004, only 73% of Indians among the [[Education in Singapore#Primary education|Primary]] One cohort were [[Education in Singapore#Admission to post-secondary institutions|admitted to a post-secondary institution]], compared with 86% for the Chinese, and 75% for the Malays.&lt;ref name=esd&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/esd/ESD%20Interactive/Table%2033%20(2005).pdf |title=Table 33: Percentage of pupils with at least 5 'O' level passes by ethnic group |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Singapore)]] |work=Education Statistics Digest |date=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224653/http://www.moe.gov.sg/esd/ESD%20Interactive/Table%2033%20%282005%29.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, 73.7% of Indian students received 5 or more passes in the [[Singaporean GCE 'O' Level]] examinations, compared with 86.5% of Chinese students and 59.3% of Malays.&lt;ref name = esd/&gt; Given their performance in the 'O' level examinations, it would appear Indians would have been under represented among students who sat for the [[Education in Singapore#Singapore-Cambridge GCE "Advanced" Level Curriculum &amp; Examinations|'A' level examination]]. However, those Indians who did reach the 'A' level and sat for this exam marginally outperformed the national average. 93% of Indians received 2 'A' and 2 'AO' level passes, compared with 92.6% among Chinese students, and 92.3% nationally.&lt;ref name = esd/&gt; The socio-economic problems, and especially educational under-performance, facing Singapore Indians is addressed by the community through [[Singapore Indian Development Association]] (SINDA), the national self-help group for the Indian community.

Singapore has the following international schools for expatriate Indians:
* [[Global Indian International School Singapore]]
* [[DPS International School Singapore]]
* [[National Public School Singapore]]

===Languages===
[[File:DangerKeepOut.jpg|thumb|Construction site sign showing Singapore's four [[official languages]]: English, [[Chinese language|Chinese (in Traditional Script)]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Malay language|Malay]].]]

{{main|Languages of Singapore|Indian languages in Singapore}}

The official languages of Singapore are English, [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese (Mandarin)]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref name='sgindepact'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1997-REVED-RSI&amp;doctitle=REPUBLIC%20OF%20SINGAPORE%20INDEPENDENCE%20ACT%0A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=whole |title=Republic of Singapore Independence Act |accessdate=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national language of Singapore is Malay for historical reasons,&lt;ref name='sgindepact'/&gt; and it is used in the national anthem, "[[Majulah Singapura]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act|cap=296|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons of [[Tamil people|ethnic Tamil ancestry]] form about 60% of Singapore's Indian residents. Minority Indian groups include [[Malayalee]]s, [[Telugu people|Telugu]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s, [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s, [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]s, [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], and [[Hindi]]-speaking people, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Leow, Bee Geok (2001). Census of Population 2000: Demographic Characteristics. p.47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of actual daily language use, 39% of Indian residents speak mainly English at home, and a similar number use [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The remainder speak either [[Malay language|Malay]] (11%) or other languages, including other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] and [[Kristang language|Kristang]] (11%).There are about 3000 families which speak Marathi at home.&lt;ref name="singstat-indicators" /&gt;

Tamil content (produced locally or abroad) is available on free-to-air and cable television as well as radio channels, and in libraries, cinemas, theatres and bookshops. Tamil is used in temples, mosques and churches catering to the community. Some business and non-profit groups, especially those in the [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] neighbourhood, use Tamil on a daily basis.

Many Indian loan words are found in Malay, and, to a lesser extent, in English. The influence of Indian vocabulary, syntax and pronunciation are also found in [[Singlish]], the local English dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Singapore Tamil is slightly distinct from the versions spoken in India and Sri Lanka, with its closest cousin being the Malaysian Tamil spoken across the border. Local usage includes some words from English, Malay and other languages. Meanwhile, certain Tamil words or phrases that are archaic in India and Sri Lanka are still used in Singapore.

===Religions===

====Hinduism in Singapore====
{{main|Hinduism in Singapore}}
In the year 2010, 5.1% of the resident population aged above 15 years, were Hindu. Almost all Hindus in Singapore were ethnic Indians. The majority of Singapore's ethnic Indians (58.9%) are Hindu.
In the year 2015, 4.96% of the resident population aged above 15 years, were Hindu and Singapore's ethnic Indians (59.88%) are Hindu.&lt;ref name="Singapore Census 2015"/&gt;

There are approximately [[List of Hindu temples in Singapore|35 temples]] serving Hindus in Singapore. Most are built in the South Indian Dravidian style. Specific communities have established their own temples. For instance, the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] community built the Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple at Ceylon Road, while the [[Chettiar]] community set up the Sri Thandayuthapani Temple at Tank Road. The [[North India]]n community also established the Sri Lakshminarayan Temple, built in the North Indian style. Two Hindu temples have been gazetted as [[National Monuments of Singapore]].
[[File:Thaipusam8.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Thaipusam]] participant.]]
Although temples may be historically associated with certain communities, Hindu temples in Singapore are open to all regardless or language, caste or religion (non-Hindus may visit the temples). A unique feature of Hinduism in Singapore is the fact that a noticeable number of non-Indians, usually Buddhist Chinese, do participate in a variety of Hindu activities, including praying to Hindu deities, donating money to the temple funds and participating in Hindu festivals like the [[fire-walking]] ceremony, and [[Thaipusam]].

The most visible Hindu festivals in Singapore are [[Deepavali]] and [[Thaipusam]]. Minor celebrations include the [[Fire walking]] festival, [[Holi]] and Hindu temple chariot processions. [[Deepavali]] is a national public holiday in Singapore. For a month before it, the Little India district is decorated with ornamental fairy lights. Bazaars are held in different parts of the district, with stalls selling religious paraphenilia, greeting cards, food, decorations, clothes, etc. Deepavali day itself is marked with a ritual bath and prayers in the morning, followed by feasting and visits to family and friends.

Thaipusam is celebrated prominently in Singapore, Malaysia and other countries with large Tamil populations. As a [[penance]], participants carry 'kavadis' along a processional route. Some men carry kavadis attached to their bodies via hooks and spears that pierce their skin. Thaipusam is the only time when major Singapore roads are closed for a religious procession. The festival is a major religious and urban event, drawing thousands of devotees, supporters and onlookers.

====Other religions====
[[File:Central Sikh Temple.JPG|thumb|200px|Established in 1912, the [[Central Sikh Temple]] was the first [[gurdwara]] in Singapore.]]

Singapore's 9,733 Sikhs formed 0.4% of the Resident population aged above 15 years. As a long-established community in Singapore, Sikhs have also been given special space by the state, in the form of special exemptions from having to wear motorcycle helmets or standard military headgear (including caps, berets and helmets), due to their religious requirement to wear turbans. Likewise, Sikh schoolboys are allowed to wear turbans in national public schools, which otherwise maintain a strict policy of standardised uniforms. Like other religious communities, Sikhs have built several places of worship in Singapore, the oldest of which is the [[Central Sikh Temple]], founded in 1912.

Among Muslim Singapore Residents, 12.4% were Indian, with most of the remainder being Malay; Indian Muslim Singaporeans easily intermarried with Malays.  predate the Islamic period (c. 570-632 AD), or the birth of Islam. In reality, Indonesians and Malays came to know about Islam through the merchants of South India and not through Arab missionaries. Among Christian Singapore Residents, 6.0% were Indian, with most of the remainder being Chinese. Within the Christian community, Indians formed 10.3% of [[Roman Catholic]]s (including [[Kristang people|Kristangs]] of part-Indian descent), and 3.9% of Non-Catholic Christians (mainly [[Protestant]]s).

Within the wider Muslim and Christian communities, Indians have established their own places of worship, where sermons, services and prayers are conducted in Indian languages. Consequently, there are a substantial number of 'Indian' churches, mosques and Buddhist temples in Singapore. For example, the [[Masjid Jamae]], built in 1826, is the oldest Tamil mosque in Singapore, and a National Monument. In 1888, the Tamil Catholic community set up the [[Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Singapore|Church of Our Lady of Lourdes]], Singapore's oldest Tamil Catholic Church, as well as a National Monument. The [[Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple]] is a [[Theravada]] temple, built in a mix of Chinese, Indian, Sri Lankan and Thai styles, and is quite different from most Chinese Buddhist [[Mahayana]] temples in Singapore. The small Indian Buddhist community (mainly Sri Lankan [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]]) in Singapore often frequents this temple, which is located in Little India.

==Institutions==
{{main|List of Indian organisations in Singapore}}

Many of the clubs and associations established by and for Indians in Singapore are defined along narrower linguistic, religious or other sub-ethnic lines. The following groups are among the more important national Indian organisations in Singapore that cater to all Indians, regardless or cultural background.
[[File:IndianAssocSg.jpg|thumb|200px|Indian Association building in Singapore.]]
* '''[[Singapore Indian Development Association]]''' (SINDA) – SINDA was set up in 1991 to address educational under-performance in the Indian community. It also deals with other social and economic problems faced by Indians.
* '''[[Singapore Indian Association]]''' (IA) – The IA was set up in 1923 by Singapore's Indian elite to promote the social, physical, intellectual, cultural and the general welfare of its members. While the association initially focussed on social and political issues faced by the Indian community, it has evolved into a private sports and recreation members-only club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ia.sg/|title=Anonym Technology Ptd Ltd|website=Ia.sg|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Netto, p.31-33.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry''' (SICCI) – Established first in 1924 as the Indian Merchants Association, the SICCI is an independent, non-profit organisation with over 500 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicci.com/|title=Sicci|website=Sicci.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[http://www.sois.org/ Society of Indian Students]''' (SOIS) – Established first in 1999 in the National University of Singapore, the primary objective of SOIS is to provide a framework for students to interact with and to assist one another; Virtually all Indian students at NUS are directly or indirectly linked to SOIS.

==Cuisine==
{{main|Indian cuisine in Singapore}}
[[File:Indian rojak.JPG|thumb|200px|Indian [[rojak]].]]
The great variety of Singapore food includes [[Indian cuisine|Indian food]], which tends to be [[Tamil cuisine]] and especially [[Mamak stall#Mamak fare|local Tamil Muslim cuisine]], although [[North Indian cuisine|North Indian food]] has become more visible recently. Indian dishes have become modified to different degrees, after years of contact with other Singapore cultures, and in response to locally available ingredients as well as changing local tastes. The local forms of Indian food may be seen as localised or even regional variations of Indian food, or in some cases, a form of hybrid Indian-Singaporean cuisine. Popular 'Indian' dishes and elements of Indian cuisine (although sometimes prepared and sold by non-Indians) include [[Indian pickle|achar]], [[curries|curry]] (such as [[laksa]] and [[Fish head curry]]), Indian [[rojak]], Indian [[mee goreng]], [[murtabak]], nasi [[biryani]], [[roti john]], [[roti prata]] and [[teh tarik]].

Other dishes were popular during the colonial period, when Indian ingredients and other culinary influences spread with the Empire to places like Singapore. Many of them endure in some homes and restaurants. Some of these dishes include [[Ground meat|mince]], [[mulligatawny soup]], [[fish moolie]], curry tiffin, pork [[vindaloo]] and spiced [[Mutton chop (meat)|Mutton chop]].

There are also many other Indian foods that are less widely available foods, but which can still be found in several areas serving a more specifically Indian clientele, especially in and around [[Little India, Singapore]]. These include [[appam]], [[bhatura]], [[chutney]], [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[idli]], [[muruku]], [[putu mayam]], [[samosa]], [[tandoori]], [[thosai]], [[upma]] and [[List of Indian sweets and desserts|various sweets]], including [[jalebi]], [[halva]], [[laddu]], [[paayasam]] and [[gulab jamun]].

==Little India==
[[File:Deepavali 22, Little India, Singapore, Oct 06.JPG|thumb|200px|Annual [[Deepavali]] light-up of [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]].]]
The Indian imprint on Singapore's urban landscape can be seen most prominently in the form of the [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] neighbourhood. On 7 July 1989, at the start of [[architectural conservation]] in Singapore, this area was gazetted for conservation, which makes its buildings legally protected from unauthorised modifications and demolition. Bounded by [[Serangoon Road]], Sungei Road and [[Jalan Besar]], the area is recognised as the hub of the Indian community in Singapore. It contains mainly two-storey [[shophouse]]s of the Early, Transitional, Late and Art Deco Shophouse Styles, as well as several places of worship for different [[faith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] | url = http://www.ura.gov.sg/conservation/india.htm | title = Little India Conservation Area}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from serving the social, cultural and commercial needs of the Indian community, the area is established as one of the more historic urban districts in Singapore, with a colourful personality that makes it an indelible part of the national landscape and identity. In 2004, it was also Singapore's third most popular free-access tourist attraction, after [[Orchard Road]] and [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Singapore Tourism Board]] | url = http://www.stb.com.sg/doc/sarts2004.pdf |format=PDF| title = Annual Report on Tourism Statistics 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming conventions==
[[File:Indian Heritage Centre, Singapore - 20150423-05.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Indian Heritage Centre]] in [[Little India, Singapore]].]]
{{main|Indian names}}
Because of their linguistic and religious diversity, Singapore Indians use a variety of [[naming conventions]]. Traditionally, most Tamil Hindus place their father's name after their given name, linked by 's/o' (son of) or 'd/o' (daughter of), e.g. 'Ravi s/o Govindasamy'. Similarly, Tamil Muslims have names in the form 'Abdul s/o Rahman' (in contrast to [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] Muslims, who use the connector 'bin' (son of) or 'binte / bte' (daughter of) instead). Likewise, a Tamil Christian name might be Daryl s/o David. The use of these connectors arose during the colonial period. However, this format is somewhat rare today.

Often, an individual will reduce their father's name to an initial, hence 'G. Ravi'. This approach is popular among many Singapore politicians, as it simplifies names that, to non-Indian Singaporeans, can be very long, complicated and difficult to pronounce. Thus, the late Senior Minister Sinnathamby Rajaratnam was known as S. Rajaratnam, while former President Sellapa Ramanathan is known as S.R. Nathan. Likewise, other prominent Indians include S. Dhanabalan, S. Jayakumar and J.B. Jeyaratnam (also known simply as 'JBJ'). Likewise, Tamil Muslims and Christians also use initials in a similar way. It should be noted that this convention is regularly used in [[South India]].

Another popular approach is to omit the 's/o' or 'd/o' connector altogether, e.g. 'Ravi Govindasamy'. While the name appears to conform to a Western format, the last name (Govindasamy) technically remains the father's name, and is not the family surname. As such, the individual should properly be addressed as 'Mr Ravi', rather than 'Mr Govindasamy'. However, some people use their father's name as a surname, i.e. Ravi calls himself 'Mr Govindasamy' and uses it as a surname for his children. Instead of naming his son 'Arun (s/o) Ravi', he would name him 'Arun Govindasamy' (or even 'Arun Govind'). This approach is also adopted among several Tamil Christians. Some new surnames have been created in this way.

Several [[South India]]ns use [[caste]] names as surnames in the Western mode. Common examples of such names in Singapore include [[Iyer]] and [[Pillay]]/[[mudaliyar]] (Tamil), [[Nair]] and [[Menon (subcaste)|Menon]] (Malayalee) or [[Naidu]] (Telugu). Mention should also be made of some Tamil Christian families that have retain Indian names (as given and/or 'family' names) either instead of or alongside Western or Christian names, e.g. Vivian Balakrishnan.

Some [[West India|West]] and [[East India]]n groups, such as the [[Gujarat]]is, [[Marathi people|Marathis]] and [[Bengal]]is, use family surnames, although the Gujaratis may choose whether to merge their father's name with the surname. [[Sikh]] men invariably adopt '[[Singh]]' as their surname, while Sikh women adopt '[[Kaur]]', as is their traditional practice. However, some Sikhs have also re-introduced supplementary family or [[clan]] names, thus instead of simply 'Charanjit Singh', an individual might adopt the name 'Charanjit Singh Siddhu' for himself or his son.

{{main|List of Singaporean Indians}}
Indian Singaporeans have made their mark nationally and even internationally in a variety of arenas.

* '''Politics''' – Indians have been well represented in national politics, including the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) as well as opposition parties. Indians have served as two out of eight [[President of Singapore|Presidents of Singapore]], two out of four [[Senior Minister]]s and three out of eleven [[Deputy Prime Minister (Singapore)|Deputy Prime Ministers]]. At some point, Indians have been Ministers of almost all ministries, including Foreign Affairs and Finance. The only key posts Indians have not held are Prime Minister and Defence Minister. As of June 2018, Indians were over-represented in the Cabinet (5 out of 19 cabinet ministers, or 26% of the total). They also comprise 10 out of 89 MPs in the 13th Parliament of Singapore, and one of three of its Non-constituency MPs. 
* '''The law''' – Historically, Indians have been prominent in the [[Legal profession in Singapore|legal profession]], including the judiciary. In 2007, 21 out of 81 persons listed in the [[Singapore Academy of Law]]'s [[senior counsel]] directory in June 2018, or 26%, were Indian. In the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore]], 9.8% of all District Judges was ethnic Indian. Meanwhile, in the [[Supreme Court of Singapore]], 14%, or two of the 14 [[Judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore|Supreme Court Judges]] and [[Judicial Commissioner]]s, are Indian.&lt;ref name = sgdi&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sgdi.gov.sg/ | title = Singapore Government Directory Interactive | publisher = [[Government of Singapore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Diplomacy''' – Indians have traditionally served in the Singapore Diplomatic Service in disproportionate numbers. The Second Permanent Secretary to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Mr [[Bilahari Kausikan]], is Indian, as have been three of its five Ministers to date. As of March 2007, a survey of the Singapore Government Directory Interactive website showed about 27% of the heads of [[Singaporean diplomatic missions]] abroad were Indian, including heads of missions to the UN in New York and [[Geneva]], High Commissioners to Malaysia and South Africa and Ambassadors to Belgium (de facto representative to the [[European Union]]) Germany, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name = sgdi/&gt;
* '''Education''' – Since colonial times, teaching was a job Indians were traditionally involved in. In 2006, Indians remained well represented in the teaching service. In March 2007, the Singapore Government Directory Interactive website showed that 13.3% of primary school [[Principal (school)|principal]]s were Indian, as were 10.3% of secondary school principals.&lt;ref name = sgdi/&gt; Indians also head prominent higher education schools and [[think tank]]s, including the [[National University of Singapore|NUS]] Faculty of Engineering, [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]], Institute of South Asian Studies, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]].
[[File:Bharatanatyam 44.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Bharatnatyam]]'', a form of classical Indian dance.]]
* '''The arts''' – Indian Singaporeans have distinguished themselves in a number of cultural fields, including contemporary forms of art targeted at a broad national and international audience, as well as more traditional Indian art forms. From 1979 to 2006, Indian Singaporeans have won 10, or 11.4%, of the 88 [[Cultural Medallion]]s conferred, the highest honour to artists given by the Singapore government.
* '''Civil Service''' – In addition to the foreign, legal and education services, Indians have also traditionally entered the [[Singapore Civil Service]]. Several individuals have risen to prominence in various [[Government of Singapore#List of government ministries|government ministries]] and [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory boards]]. 9.4% of the heads of Singapore's 64 statutory boards are Indian – these are the [[National Library Board]], [[Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority]], [[Hindu Endowments Board]], Hindu Advisory Board and Sikh Advisory Board.&lt;ref name = sgdi/&gt;
* '''Business''' – In 2006, [[Forbes]] listed four ethnic Indians among the 40 largest private individual and family fortunes in Singapore, which is 10% of the list. These four individuals each represent large and diversified business empires in their own right, ranging from commodities to retail to electronics, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Forbes]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/79/06singapore_Singapores-40-Richest_Rank.html | title = Singapore's 40 Richest | date = 24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
[[Iran]]ians from within the modern-day or previous borders of disestablished Iranian empires have a relatively long history in France. [[Jean Althen]] (Hovhannès Althounian), a [[Armenians in Iran|Persian-Armenian]] agronomist from [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], is known to have introduced [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]] to southern France in the 1750s.{{sfn|Dédéyan|2007|p=919}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henri|first1=Michel|title=Հայազգի ժան Ալթենը՝ Ֆրանսիայում բամբակի և տորոնի մշակության առաջնեկ [Armenian J.

During his embassy, a group of forty-two Persian students, who became known as ''les enfants de Perse'' (Thieury, p.&amp;nbsp;39) and who were chosen mostly from the graduates of the recently founded [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar al-fonūn]], were sent to France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-xvii ''FRANCE xvii. Persian Community in France'' - retrieved 19 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the course of the latter part of the 19th century, the Persian upper classes gradually began to send their sons to Europe and especially to France to pursue higher studies.&lt;ref&gt;(Maḥbūbi, Moʾassasāt I, pp. 320-39)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
France was a popular destination for [[Persian people|Persian]] (Iranian) [[international student]]s in the early 20th century. The first government-sponsored Persian students, a group of 20, all went to France in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|2003|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] government drew up a competitive examination to determine the distribution of government scholarships to aspiring international students; 110 out of the 125 students who passed the examination went to France, making them the overwhelming majority of all Persian students abroad. Another 66 chose France as their destination the following year. Aside from government-sponsored students, there were also 537 privately financed Persian students living in France in 1934, nearly half of the total 1,165 privately financed international students. However, in 1938, a governmental decree prohibited students from going abroad on private funds to pursue degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|2003|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian students in France lived in dormitories on their school campuses, unlike [[Iranians in Germany|Iranian students in Germany]] who rented private accommodations by themselves; this meant that they were often subject to surveillance by officials from the Iranian embassy, and prevented the growth of anti-Pahlavi activism among them. Germany, rather than France, would thus become the major European centre of Iranian dissent in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chehabi|1990|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Iranians who studied in France include [[Mehdi Bazargan]], the first Iranian to pass the entrance examination to any of the ''[[grandes écoles]]''; he went on to become [[Prime Minister of Iran|prime minister of Iran]] after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chehabi|1990|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Iranians in France consist primarily of "political emigrants", who left Iran immediately after the revolution, because their association with communists, monarchists, or other opposition groups put them in danger, and "socio-cultural emigrants"&amp;mdash;especially women and youths&amp;mdash;who had little political affiliation but left Iran more slowly in the years following the revolution due to despair over the future of Iranian society.&lt;ref name="NassehiBehnam"&gt;{{harvnb|Nassehi-Behnam|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; France expelled some of the political migrants, including [[Massoud Rajavi]] and his [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]], in an effort to improve relations with Iran and secure the release of French hostages held by pro-Iranian forces in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ibrahim|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese management culture''' refers to working philosophies or methods in Japan. It included concepts and philosophies such as [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just in Time]], [[Kaizen]] and [[Total Quality Management]].
&lt;!--
== Japanese management studies in India ==
While Japanese management has always been a subject of great interest worldwide, particularly concepts and philosophies such as Just in Time, [[Kaizen]] and [[Total Quality Management]], in recent times there has been considerable interest in India for Japanese management. This is mainly due to the growing bi-lateral economic co-operation &lt;ref&gt;[http://wwno fqegc d in Japan. The popularity for Japanese management studies in India has grown due to the demand for skilled professionals who can deal effectively with Japanese companies in Japan or implement the management culture of the Japanese company in India. 

Currently, there is one full-time diploma program in Japanese Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/getahead/2008/aug/13iycu1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; offered by the RV-Nihongo Bashi Centre of Japanese Management Studies in Bangalore. The Institution is a joint venture between the RV Group of Institutions from Karnataka, India and Singapore-based Nihongo Bashi.One of the key features of this program is the emphasis on preparing students to the "Asian" / Japanese way of doing business, with considerable importance to the development of Emotional Quotient (EQ).--&gt;

==Managerial style==
The Japanese term "hourensou" (also rendered as “[[Ho-Ren-So]]”) refers to frequent reporting, touching base and discussing -- important attributes that are said to characterize collaboration and information flow within effective Japanese corporate culture. Hou’ stands for ‘Houkoku’, the Japanese word for ‘reporting’. ‘Ren’ comes from ‘Renraku’, the word for ‘informing’. ‘Sou’ is derived from ‘Soudan’, the word for ‘consulting’. refers to "getting your hands dirty", to identify or solve immediate problems and leaders are not exempt from this.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of these principles are often mistaken by western managers "micromanagement."&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, these principles are used as tools to shepherd processes.

Mohammed Ala and William Cordeiro (1999) described the Japanese decision-making process of “ringiseido.” “Ringiseido” provides the opportunity for equal ranking managers or employees of a group within a company to partake in an individual’s idea. The process adheres to the Japanese cultural desire of harmony among people. The physical action of “ringiseido” is referred to as the “ringi decision-making process.” It fosters an environment of support and agreement for a decision once a higher ranking manager has reviewed and accepted the recommended decision.&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The term of “ringi” has two meanings. The first meaning being of “rin," ‘submitting a proposal to one’s supervisors and receiving their approval,’ and "gi" meaning ‘deliberations and decisions.’ Corporate policy is not clearly defined by the executive leadership of a Japanese company. Rather, the managers at all levels below executives must raise decisions to the next level except for routine decisions. The process of “ringi decision-making” is conducted through a document called a “ringisho.”&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999 (p.&amp;nbsp;22-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

The “ringisho” is created and circulated by the individual who created the idea. As the “ringisho” reaches a peer for review, the peer places his or her “personal seal (hanko) right side up” to agree, “upside down” to disagree, and sideways to indicate being undecided. Once all peers have reviewed the “ringisho” the peers’ manager reviews the “ringisho” and places his or her hanko on it. The upper level manager’s decision is final and the “ringisho” is sent back to the originator who either initiates the idea or re-evaluates, based on the “hanko” of the upper level manager.&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999 (p.&amp;nbsp;22-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership values ==
Tony Kippenberger (2002) elaborates on the leadership values that are deeply rooted in the Japanese business culture. These values were created by [[Konosuke Matsushita]], the prominent deceased entrepreneur of Matsushita’s Electric Company, who cared deeply for the employees of his company as if they were family. Matsushita firmly believed that a business as large as his was responsible to help all of society prosper, and not simply for those that owned and ran the company to prosper. 

In 1933 Matsushita, during the great depression, created seven “guiding principles":&lt;ref&gt;*Kippenberger, T. (2002). ''[http://www.capstonepub.com/default.aspx Leadership styles]''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Service to the public – by providing high-quality goods and services at reasonable prices, we contribute to the public’s well-being;
*Fairness and honesty – we will be fair and honest in all our business dealings and personal conduct;
*Teamwork for the common cause – we will pool abilities, based on mutual trust and respect;
*Uniting effort for improvement – we will constantly strive to improve our corporate and personal performances;
*Courtesy and humility – we will always be cordial and modest and respect the rights and needs of others;
*Accordance with natural laws – we will abide by the laws of nature and adjust to the ever-changing conditions around us; and
*Gratitude for blessings – we will always be grateful for all the blessings and kindness we have received.”

The “guiding principles” were “remarkable for their time.” The seven principles are used by Matsushita’s company today and serve as principles for other Japanese companies. Because the “guiding principles” are such powerful statements and an extension of the Japanese cultural into business, the principles have been renamed  the “Seven Spirits of Matsushita" to honor Matsushita.&lt;ref&gt;*Kippenberger, T. (2002). ''[http://www.capstonepub.com/default.aspx Leadership styles]''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing. p.71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smaller companies==
In smaller companies, an entirely different corporate culture developed. Similar to the ''Meister'' system of Germany, new recruits are placed under skilled senior specialists and spend years learning every technique that they have. They are trained to develop deeper understanding of specific areas of skills instead of the broader and less deep training that those in a larger corporation receive. They learn to produce work of high quality using few simple tools and few or no advanced industrial tools.

==Japanese women in management==
As the modern cultures of the world continue to advance, cultural concepts either lose presence or evolve with the modern concepts. Japan is experiencing such an evolution in regard to women in the workplace and in management roles. While a main reason for this evolution is the adoption of western influence on Japanese society, Japan is being forced to support this evolution because it is grappling with a declining population and lower birth rate which will lead to a smaller workforce. 

According to “Cloud, or Silver Linings?” published in the ''Economist'' (2007), it was reported that in 2006 Japan’s birth rate was 1.32 and has been below 2.1 since the 1970s. A birthrate of 2.1 is necessary to successfully maintain current population numbers. The article described that the OECD has proven there is a “positive correlation between fertility and female employment.” Thus, if an effort is made to support females work ambitions and family desires, then women will be more willing and likely to want to have children and families and not have to sacrifice their career in the process. Japanese officials are not taking this information lightly. During his last year in office, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] (2002-2007) began legislation to foster “financial support for families with young children and an expansion of child-care facilities (p.27).&lt;ref&gt;Cloud or silver linings? Japan’s changing demography. (2007 July 28). ''The Economist'' 384(8539) p.27. http://www.economist.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Langueskanak.jpg|thumb|450px|Populations of the native languages of New Caledonia]]
[[New Caledonia]], a part of the [[French Republic]], uses [[French language|French]] as its official language, following the constitutional law 92-554 (June 1992). The thirty [[New Caledonian languages]] form a branch of the [[Southern Oceanic languages]]. Their speakers are known as [[Kanak people|Kanaks]].

==The languages present at the time of colonization==

At the time of colonization, native speakers used their native language to communicate, and, in case of need, they used [[Bislama]], an Anglo-Melanesian language whose lexical basis is essentially [[English language|English]]. This language allowed them to communicate with shopkeepers or with the other [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] populations. Those native languages have been favoured by some of the missionaries to evangelize the population, the Catholic missionaries preferred the usage of [[French language|French]].

Thus, there were three languages used: French, English, and Bislama.

In 1853, a decree imposed the teaching of French in every school of the colony, and in 1863, only the teaching of French was allowed because the colonizers did not want the other languages to compete with French.&lt;ref name="LJ"&gt;Jacques Leclerc, L’aménagement Linguistique dans le Monde http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/pacifique/ncal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==

[[New Caledonia]] is constituted of numerous populations, but the vast majority is represented by Kanaks or Europeans. Nowadays, there are about 30 [[Melanesian]] languages present, and also other languages peculiar to the immigrant populations ([[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Overseas Indonesian|Indonesian]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], Flipino and others). Those populations have immigrated to [[New Caledonia]] during the nickel rush. The native languages of [[New Caledonia]] are part of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian family]]. This family extends from the island of [[Madagascar]], [[Taiwan]], [[Southeast Asia]] and covers almost all of the [[Pacific]]. Those languages have great differences between them (in grammar, phonetic {{Clarify|date=May 2011}}).
English (as a foreign language) is also present in [[New Caledonia]], as everywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="LJ"/&gt;

=== Native languages ===
{{main|New Caledonian languages|Loyalty Island languages|West Uvean language}}
The forty native languages of New Caledonia form two branches of the [[Southern Oceanic languages]], part of the [[Austronesian]] family; West Uvean is [[Polynesian language|Polynesian]]. Their speakers are known as [[Kanak people|Kanaks]]. The most important are: [[Drehu language|Drehu]], [[Nengone language|Nengone]], [[Paicî language|Paicî]], [[Ajië language|Ajië]], and [[Xaracuu language|Xârâcùù]]. The other languages are spoken by a few hundred to couple thousand people and are endangered. Many Kanaks do not know their native languages very well because of the wide usage of [[French language|French]].

=== French ===

"Whites" or "Europeans" from [[New Caledonia]] speak French, but as said previously, Kanaks also speak a dialect of [[French language|French]], the New Caledonian French, which is characterized by some phonetic particularities and some specific grammatical constructions based on native languages.&lt;ref name="LJ"/&gt; Thus, this is a "regional French", which differs from standard [[French language|French]], the official language used in administration, tribunals, schools, media...

=== Languages from immigrant populations ===

These languages have to be taken into account too because of the numerous number of immigrants in [[New Caledonia]] (Polynesians, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Filipinos ...). Nevertheless, these languages are a minority, mainly spoken in the capital, [[Nouméa]].

==French in New Caledonia==

[[New Caledonia]] being a part of [[French Republic]], its official language is [[French language|French]], following the constitutional law  92-554 (June 1992). This law is applicable to every field (justice, tribunals, administration, schools...).
At the level of legislation and justice, on some occasions they may have recourse to a [[Melanesian]] language (in spoken conversation, for example).
A series of decrees and clauses allow the usage of [[Melanesian]] languages in education in some cases. The more important law to that purpose is the "Loi d’orientation d’Outre-Mer" (law 2000-1207, December 2000) which stipulates that we have to respect these native languages which are a part of New Caledonian culture.&lt;ref name="LJ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Bril, En Pays Kanaks&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

[[Secondary school]] is under State authority (as opposed to nursery and primary school, which are under Provincial authority), therefore, the language in application is [[French language|French]]. Some schools give optional native languages lessons, but it is still very rare. Nevertheless, four languages are proposed at the baccalaureate: [[Ajië language|Ajië]], Drehu, Nengone and Paicî.
There has been controversy about the educational system, as it has been claimed, that the programs are not adjusted to the population. As a [[DOM-TOM|French overseas department]] [[New Caledonia]] is almost exclusively under the administrative control of [[France]] at the educative level and the textbooks are tailored to European students. Moreover, [[French language|French]] is only a second language for significant minority of New Caledonians. This situation has been described as a major cause for the high rate of [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and academic failure by New Caledonian students. The success rate at the [[bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] is very low.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Bril, En Pays Kanak, 282-8&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have advocated to increase the importance of native languages as a teaching medium in school, while reducing the status [[French language|French]] to that of a second language.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Bril, En Pays Kanak, 286-7&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed out, that proposal denies reality as French is the predominant native language among New Caledonian students.

'''Lewu 乐舞''' is an unclassified extinct [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] language of [[Jingdong Yi Autonomous County]], [[Yunnan]], China. The Lewu are officially classified by the Chinese government as ethnic [[Yao people|Yao]] people.

==Demographics==
According to the ''Jingdong County Almanac'' (1994:519), ethnic Yao numbered 3,889 individuals in 1990, and lived mainly in Chaqing 岔箐&lt;ref name="ynszxc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=217095|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=景东彝族自治县太忠乡岔箐村委会|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dasongshu 大松树&lt;ref name="ynszxc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=217070|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=景东彝族自治县太忠乡大松树村委会|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villages of Taizhong Township 太忠乡. Yao language speakers, known as the Lewu Yao 乐舞瑶族, are found in Puya Village 普牙村, Chaqing Township 岔箐乡 (''Jingdong County Ethnic Gazetteer'' 2012:144).&lt;ref name="ynszxc3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=217633|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=景东彝族自治县太忠乡岔箐村委会上普牙|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynszxc4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=217632|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=景东彝族自治县太忠乡岔箐村委会中普牙|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynszxc5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=217630|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=景东彝族自治县太忠乡岔箐村委会下普牙|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Lewu may have been related to the [[Lawu language]] of [[Xinping County]], [[Yunnan]], but classification remains uncertain due to the paucity of data.&lt;ref&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2017. ''[https://zenodo.org/record/1249178/files/Lawu_languages.pdf The Lawu languages: footprints along the Red River valley corridor]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
A word list of the Lewu Yao language is transcribed using [[pinyin]] in the ''Jingdong County Ethnic Gazetteer'' (2012:144-145). The language is already extinct, and was recorded in 1985 from 85-year-old Zhu Zhaojin 祝兆金 of Puya Village 普牙村, who could remember only some words.

'''Masks among Eskimo peoples''' served a variety of functions. Masks were made out of [[driftwood]], animal skins, bones and feathers. They were often painted using bright colors. There are archeological miniature maskettes made of [[walrus ivory]], coming from early [[Paleo-Eskimo]] and from early [[Dorset culture]] period.&lt;ref name="Hessel &amp; Hessel 1998: 12–13"&gt;Hessel &amp; Hessel 1998: 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early masks ==
Archeological masks have been found from early Paleo-Eskimo and from early Dorset culture period.&lt;ref name="Hessel &amp; Hessel 1998: 12–13"/&gt; It is believed that these masks served several functions including being in rituals representing animals in personalized form;&lt;ref name=syndia&gt;Oosten 1997: 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; being used by shaman in ceremonies relating to spirits (as in the case of a wooden mask from southwestern [[Alaska]]);&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; it is also suggested that they could be worn during song contest ceremonials.&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated beliefs ==
[[File:Ivorymasks.jpg|thumb|right|Ceremonial ivory [[masks]] produced by [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] in [[Alaska]]]]
Although beliefs about unity between human and animal did not extend to that of absolute interchangeability,&lt;ref&gt;Oosten 1997: 99&lt;/ref&gt; several Eskimo peoples had sophisticated soul concepts (including variants of [[soul dualism]]) that linked living humans, their ancestors, and their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Oosten 1997: 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996:14&lt;/ref&gt; Besides synchronical beliefs, there were also notions of unity between human and animal, and myths about an ancient time when the animal could take on human form at will.&lt;ref name="syndia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barüske 1969: 7, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ''transformation mask''s reflected this unity.&lt;ref name="transformational_mask"&gt;[http://www.fareasternpress.com/SacredHoopArticlebyLes.pdf Thomas 2008]: +4 (= third page after the opening page of the article)&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual ceremonies could enable the community to enact these stories with the help of masks, sometimes with the masked person representing the animal.

== [[Yup'ik masks]] ==

The [[Yup'ik]] are Eskimos of Western Alaska whose masks vary enormously but are characterised by great invention. They differ in size from forehead and finger 'maskettes' to enormous constructions that dancers need external supports to perform with.&lt;ref name="Yup'ik Masks 1996"&gt;The Living Tradition of Yup'ik Masks; Ann Feinup-Riordan; University of Washington Press, Seattle 1996. {{ISBN|0-295-97501-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these masks were used almost as stage props, some which imbued the dancer with the spirit that they represented - and most were often destroyed after use. Others represented animal people, ''(yuit)'', and insects, berries, plants, ice and objects of everyday life.&lt;ref name="Yup'ik Masks 1996"/&gt;

=== Note ===
Eskimo groups comprise a huge area stretching from [[Eastern Siberia|Siberia]] through Alaska and [[Northern Canada]] (including [[Nunatsiavut]] in [[Labrador]] and [[Nunavik]] in [[Quebec]]) to  [[Greenland]]. The term ''Eskimo'' has fallen out of favour in Canada and Greenland, where it is considered [[pejorative]] and the term ''Inuit'' has become more common. However, ''Eskimo'' is still considered acceptable among [[Alaska Natives]] of [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] (Inuit) heritage, and is preferred over ''Inuit'' as a collective reference.

Dalton was active in the New African independence struggle in the U.S. and considered herself a citizen of the [[Republic of New Afrika]].

==Early life and education==
Born Cheri Dalton in New York City in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/jan/18/us-fugitives-cuba-have-mixed-view-possibly-thawing/&lt;/ref&gt; she began her activist work as a child. At the age of ten, she was a tenant organizer. Dalton graduated from [[Columbia University]] in New York in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2008/08/hip-hop-cuban-abiodun-black&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/exiled-in-havana-6354908&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1978, Dalton began using the alias "Nehanda Abiodun."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/exiled-in-havana-6354908&lt;/ref&gt; She has also used the aliases Nahanda Abiodun, Nahanda Obafemi, Nahanda Obatemi, Cheri Cotton, Betty Carter, Betty W. Carter, Elizabeth Carter, Laverne Dalton, Laverne Cheri Dalton, and "Flame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[FBI]] |title=CHERI LAVERNE DALTON |quote= |newspaper=FBI.gov |date= |url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/cheri-laverne-dalton/view |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later worked with the National Black Human Rights Coalition, and later to help heal drug addicts at the [[Black Acupuncture Association of North America]] with [[Mutulu Shakur]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nehanda: Tribute to A Woman Warrior in Exile" Afro Cuba Web. 1997.

==Legal issues==
She was later sued for malpractice{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, and a warrant was put out for her arrest.

Dalton is among those linked by U.S. authorities to [[Assata Shakur]]'s 1979 escape from prison. She is also wanted for a string of robberies, including the robbing of a [[The Brink's Company|Brink's]] Armored Car in New York in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/cheri-laverne-dalton/@@download.pdf|title=CHERI LAVERNE DALTON|last=|first=|date=23 January 2018|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life on the run==
She has lived in Havana, Cuba since about 1990. She is a [[rap music]] activist there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Marc Lacey |title=Cuba's Rap Vanguard Reaches Beyond the Party Line |quote=One of those working behind the scenes to aid Cuba's rappers is Cheri Dalton, an American who goes by the name Nehanda Abiodun.

'''Nobility''' is a [[social class]] in [[aristocracy]], normally ranked immediately under [[Royal family|royalty]], that possesses more acknowledged [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s and higher [[social status]] than most other classes in a society and with membership thereof typically being [[hereditary]]. The privileges associated with nobility may constitute substantial advantages over or relative to non-nobles, or may be largely honorary (e.g., [[order of precedence|precedence]]), and vary by country and era. The Medieval [[chivalry|chivalric]] motto "[[noblesse oblige]]", meaning literally "nobility obligates", explains that privileges carry a lifelong obligation of duty to uphold various social responsibilities of, e.g., honorable behavior, customary service, or leadership roles or positions, that lives on by a familial or kinship bond.

Membership in the nobility and the prerogatives thereof have been historically acknowledged or regulated by a monarch or government and thereby distinguished from other sectors of a nation's upper class wherein wealth, lifestyle, or affiliation may be the salient markers of membership. Nobility per se has nonetheless rarely constituted a closed caste; acquisition of sufficient power, wealth, military prowess, or royal favour has enabled commoners with varying frequency to ascend into the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/royals-who-married-commoners-kate-middleton-prince-william|title=Move Over, Kate Middleton: These Commoners All Married Royals, Too|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is often a variety of ranks within the noble class. Legal recognition of nobility has been more common in monarchies, but nobility also existed in such regimes as the [[Dutch Republic]] (1581–1795), the [[Republic of Genoa]] (1005–1815), the [[Republic of Venice]] (697–1797), and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] (1300–1798), and remains part of the legal social structure of some non-hereditary regimes, e.g., [[Channel Islands]], [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] in Europe.

[[Hereditary title]]s often distinguish nobles from non-nobles, although in many nations most of the nobility have been un-titled, and a hereditary title need not ipso facto indicate nobility (e.g., [[vidame]]).  Some countries have had non-hereditary nobility, such as the [[Brazilian nobility|Empire of Brazil]] or [[life peer]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
{{no footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}
[[File:Crusader cavalry.jpg|thumb|left|Nobility offered protection in exchange for service]]
The term derives from Latin ''nobilitas'', the [[abstract noun]] of the adjective ''nobilis'' ("well-known, famous, notable").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tacitean "Nobilitas" |first=Revilo P. |last=Oliver |author-link=Revilo P. Oliver |journal=Illinois Classical Studies |volume=3 |year=1978 |page=238-261 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |jstor=23062619 |hdl=2142/11694 |url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/11694/illinoisclassica31978OLIVER.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y |format=PDF |access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Social class in ancient Rome|ancient Roman society]], ''[[nobiles]]'' originated as an informal designation for the political governing class who had allied interests, including both [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeian families]] ''([[gens|gentes]])'' with an ancestor who had risen to the [[Roman consul|consulship]] through his own merit (see ''[[novus homo]]'', "new man").

In modern usage, "nobility" is applied to the highest social class in [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern societies]], excepting the [[royal family|ruling dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/26235457/LUP_161.pdf |title=The Wealth of the Richest: Inequality and the Nobility in Sweden, 1750–1900 |first=Erik |last=Bengtsson |first2=Anna |last2=Missiaia |first3=Mats |last3=Olsson |first4=Patrick |last4=Svensson |date=12 June 2018 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |doi=10.1080/03468755.2018.1480538 |format=PDF |page=1-28 |via=[[Lund University Libraries]] |access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[feudalism|feudal system]] (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a [[fief]], often land or office, under [[vassalage]], i.e., in exchange for [[allegiance]] and various, mainly military, services to a [[suzerain]], who might be a higher-ranking nobleman or a monarch. It rapidly came to be seen as a hereditary [[caste]], sometimes associated with a right to bear a hereditary title and, for example in pre-revolutionary France, enjoying fiscal and other privileges.

While noble status formerly conferred significant privileges in most jurisdictions, by the 21st century it had become a largely honorary dignity in most societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://zodml.org/sites/default/files/%5BJerzy_Lukowski%5D_The_European_Nobility_in_the_Eigh.pdf |format=PDF |title=The European Nobility in the Eighteenth Century |first=Jerzy |last=Lukowski |author-link=Jerzy Lukowski |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |editor-first=Lesley |editor-last=Hall |editor2-first=Keith D. |editor2-last=Lilley |editor3-first=Neil |editor3-last=MacMaster |editor4-first=W.

(Compare the entrenched position and [[leadership]] expectations of the nobility of the Kingdom of [[Tonga]].)

Nobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, differing from high [[social status|socio-economic status]] in that the latter is mainly based on income, possessions or [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Being wealthy or influential cannot ''[[ipso facto]]'' make one noble, nor are all nobles wealthy or influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself).

Various republics, including former [[Iron Curtain]] countries, Greece, [[Mexican nobility|Mexico]], and Austria have expressly abolished the conferral and use of titles of nobility for their citizens. This is distinct from countries which have not abolished the right to inherit titles, but which do not grant legal recognition or protection to them, such as Germany and Italy, although Germany recognizes their use as part of the legal surname. Still other countries and authorities allow their use, but forbid attachment of any privilege thereto, e.g., Finland, Norway and the European Union, while French law also protects lawful titles against [[usurpation]].

Although many societies have a privileged [[upper class]] with substantial wealth and power, the status is not necessarily hereditary and does not entail a distinct [[legal status]], nor differentiated [[style (manner of address)|forms of address]].

==Noble privileges==
[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|A French political cartoon of the three orders of [[Social class|feudal society]] (1789). The rural third estate carries the clergy and the nobility.]]

Not all of the benefits of nobility derived from noble status ''per se''. Usually privileges were granted or recognised by the [[monarch]] in association with possession of a specific title, office or estate. Most nobles' wealth derived from one or more [[estate (land)|estates]], large or small, that might include fields, pasture, orchards, timberland, hunting grounds, streams, etc. It also included infrastructure such as castle, well and mill to which local peasants were allowed some access, although often at a price. Nobles were expected to live "nobly", that is, from the proceeds of these possessions. Work involving [[manual labour]] or subordination to those of lower rank (with specific exceptions, such as in military or ecclesiastic service) was either forbidden (as derogation from noble status) or frowned upon socially. On the other hand, membership in the nobility was usually a prerequisite for holding offices of trust in the realm and for career promotion, especially in the military, at court and often the higher functions in the government, judiciary and church.

Prior to the [[French Revolution]], European nobles typically commanded tribute in the form of entitlement to cash rents or usage taxes, labour or a portion of the annual crop yield from [[commoner]]s or nobles of lower rank who lived or worked on the noble's [[Manorialism|manor]] or within his ''[[feudalism|seigneurial]]'' domain. In some countries, the local lord could impose restrictions on such a commoner's movements, religion or legal undertakings. Nobles exclusively enjoyed the privilege of [[hunting]]. In France, nobles were exempt from paying the ''[[taille]]'', the major direct tax. Peasants were not only bound to the nobility by dues and services, but the exercise of their rights was often also subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of courts and police from whose authority the actions of nobles were entirely or partially exempt. In some parts of Europe the right of [[private war]] long remained the privilege of every noble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Nobility |volume=19 |page=728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early Renaissance, [[duel]]ling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]], and was an accepted manner of resolving disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Since the end of World War I the hereditary nobility entitled to [[special rights]] has largely been abolished in the [[Western World]] as intrinsically [[discrimination|discriminatory]], and discredited as inferior in efficiency to individual [[meritocracy]] in the allocation of societal resources.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite book | title=Titles: How the King became His Highness | publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books | author-link=L.G.

By the 21st century even that deference had become increasingly minimised.

==Ennoblement==

In France, a ''seigneurie'' (lordship) might include one or more manors surrounded by land and villages subject to a noble's prerogatives and disposition. ''Seigneuries'' could be bought, sold or mortgaged. If erected by the crown into, e.g., a barony or countship, it became legally [[entail]]ed for a specific family, which could use it as their title. Yet most French nobles were untitled ("seigneur of Montagne" simply meant ownership of that lordship but not, if one was not otherwise noble, the right to use a title of nobility, as commoners often purchased lordships). Only a member of the nobility who owned a countship was allowed, ''ipso facto'', to style himself as its ''comte'', although this restriction came to be increasingly ignored as the ''[[ancien régime]]'' drew to its close.

In other parts of Europe, sovereign rulers arrogated to themselves the exclusive prerogative to act as ''[[fount of honor|fons honorum]]'' within their realms. For example, in the United Kingdom royal [[letters patent]] are necessary to obtain a title of the [[peerage]], which also carries nobility and formerly a seat in the [[House of Lords]], but never came without automatic [[entail]] of land nor rights to the local peasants' output.

{{Main|Royal and noble ranks}}
Nobility might be either inherited or conferred by a ''[[fount of honour|fons honorum]]''. It is usually an acknowledged preeminence that is hereditary, i.e. the status descends exclusively to some or all of the [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]], and usually [[patrilineality|male-line]], descendants of a nobleman. In this respect, the nobility as a class has always been much more extensive than the [[primogeniture]]-based [[title of nobility|titled nobility]], which included [[peerage of France|peerages in France]] and [[peerage of the United Kingdom|in the United Kingdom]], ''[[grandee|grandezas]]'' in Portugal and Spain, and some noble titles in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Prussia and Scandinavia. In Russia, Scandinavia and non-Prussian Germany, titles usually descended to all male-line descendants of the original titleholder, including females. In Spain, noble titles are now equally heritable by females and males. Noble estates, on the other hand, gradually came to descend by [[primogeniture]] in much of western Europe aside from Germany. In Eastern Europe, by contrast, with the exception of a few [[Hungary|Hungarian]] estates, they usually descended to all sons or even all children&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/140393374X.Pdf The consolidation of Noble Power in Europe, c. 1600–1800]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, some wealthy ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]'', most particularly the members of the various ''[[parlement]]s'', were ennobled by the king, constituting the ''[[nobles of the Robe|noblesse de robe]]''. The old nobility of [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[chivalry|knightly]] origin, the ''[[nobles of the Sword|noblesse d'épée]]'', increasingly resented the influence and pretensions of this ''[[parvenu]]'' nobility. In the last years of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' the old nobility pushed for restrictions of certain offices and [[chivalric order|orders of chivalry]] to noblemen who could demonstrate that their lineage had extended "[[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]s", i.e. several generations of noble ancestry, to be eligible for offices and favors at [[court (royal)|court]] along with nobles of [[medieval]] descent, although historians such as [[William Doyle (historian)|William Doyle]] have disputed this so-called "Aristocratic Reaction".&lt;ref&gt;W. Doyle, ''Essays on Eighteenth Century France'', London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Various court and military positions were reserved by tradition for nobles who could "prove" an ancestry of at least ''seize quartiers'' (16 quarterings), indicating exclusively noble descent (as displayed, ideally, in the family's [[coat of arms]]) extending back five generations (all 16 great-great grandparents).

This illustrates the traditional link in many countries between [[heraldry]] and nobility; in those countries where heraldry is used, nobles have almost always been [[gentry|armigerous]], and have used heraldry to demonstrate their ancestry and [[family history]]. However, heraldry has never been restricted to the noble classes in most countries, and being armigerous does not necessarily demonstrate nobility. [[Scotland]], however, is an exception.&lt;ref&gt;An opinion of [[Innes of Learney]] differentiates the system in use in Scotland from many other European traditions, in that armorial bearings which are entered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland by warrant of the [[Lord Lyon]] [[King of Arms]] are legally "Ensigns of Nobility", and although the historical accuracy of that interpretation has been [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/lordlyon.htm challenged], Innes of Learney's perspective is accepted in the ''[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]'' entry, 'Heraldry' (Volume 11), 3, The Law of Arms. 1613. The nature of arms.&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of recent cases in Scotland the Lord Lyon King of Arms has controversially (vis-à-vis Scotland's Salic law) granted the arms and allocated the chiefships of medieval noble families to female-line descendants of lords, even when they were not of noble lineage in the male line, while persons of legitimate male-line descent may still survive (e.g. the modern [[Chiefs of Clan MacLeod]]).

In some nations, [[hereditary title]]s, as distinct from noble rank, were not always recognised in law, e.g., Poland's ''[[Szlachta]]''. European ranks of nobility lower than [[baron]] or its equivalent, are commonly referred to as the [[petty nobility]], although [[baronet]]s of the British Isles are deemed titled [[gentry]]. Most nations traditionally had an untitled lower nobility in addition to titled nobles. An example is the [[landed gentry]] of the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k04RAQAAIAAJ | last=Larence | first=Sir James Henry | title=The nobility of the British Gentry or the political ranks and dignities of the British Empire compared with those on the continent | edition=2nd | location=London | publisher=T.Hookham -- Simpkin and Marshall | year= 1827 | origyear=first published 1824 | accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruling of the Court of the Lord Lyon (26/2/1948, Vol. IV, page 26): "With regard to the words 'untitled nobility' employed in certain recent birthbrieves in relation to the (Minor) Baronage of Scotland, Finds and Declares that the (Minor) Barons of Scotland are, and have been both in this nobiliary Court and in the Court of Session recognised as a ‘titled nobility’ and that the estait of the Baronage (i.e., ''Barones Minores'') are of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland". This title is not, however, a [[peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]], thus Scotland's ''noblesse'' ranks in England as gentry.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike England's gentry, the ''[[Junker]]s'' of Germany, the ''[[noblesse de robe]]'' of France, the ''[[hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgos]]'' of Spain and the ''nobili'' of Italy were explicitly acknowledged by the monarchs of those countries as members of the nobility, although untitled. In Scandinavia, the [[Benelux]] nations and Spain there are still untitled as well as titled families recognised in law as noble.

In Hungary members of the nobility always theoretically enjoyed the same rights. In practice, however, a noble family's financial assets largely defined its significance. Medieval Hungary's concept of nobility originated in the notion that nobles were "free men", eligible to own land.&lt;ref&gt;Ölyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemességi könyv. Koroknay-Nyomda. Szeged, Hungary. 45p.&lt;/ref&gt; This basic standard explains why the noble population was relatively large, although the economic status of its members varied widely. Untitled nobles were not infrequently wealthier than titled families, while considerable differences in wealth were also to be found within the titled nobility. The custom of granting titles was introduced to Hungary in the 16th century by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Historically, once nobility was granted, if a nobleman served the monarch well he might obtain the title of baron, and might later be elevated to the rank of count. As in other countries of post-medieval central Europe, hereditary titles were not attached to a particular land or estate but to the noble family itself, so that all patrilineal descendants shared a title of baron or count (cf. [[peerage]]). Neither nobility nor titles could be transmitted through women.&lt;ref&gt;Ölyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemességi könyv. Koroknay-Nyomda. Szeged, Hungary. 85.p&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[con artist]]s sell [[fake titles of nobility]], often with impressive-looking documentation. This may be illegal, depending on local law. They are more often illegal in countries that actually have nobilities, such as European monarchies. In the United States, such commerce may constitute actionable [[fraud]] rather than criminal [[usurpation]] of an exclusive right to use of any given title by an established class.

==Other terms==
"Aristocrat" and [[aristocracy]], in modern usage, refer [[colloquially]] and broadly to persons who inherit elevated social status, whether due to membership in the (formerly) official nobility or the monied [[upper class]].

''Blue blood'' is an [[wiktionary:Category:English idioms|English idiom]] recorded since 1834 for noble birth or descent; it is also known as a translation of the Spanish phrase ''sangre azul'', which described the Spanish [[royal family]] and other high nobility who claimed to be of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDwJEZGTpVkC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=blue+blood+visigoth&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The politics of aristocratic empires by John Kautsky]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[Moors]]. The idiom originates from ancient and medieval societies of Europe and distinguishes an [[upper class]] (whose [[superficial vein]]s appeared blue through their untanned skin) from a [[working class]] of the time. The latter consisted mainly of agricultural peasants who spent most of their time working outdoors and thus had tanned skin, through which superficial veins appear less prominently.

[[Robert Lacey]] explains the genesis of the blue blood concept:&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats.'' Little, Brown and Company, 1983, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Europe==
[[File:Bojaren.jpg|thumb|Russian [[boyars]]]]

European nobility originated in the feudal/seignorial system that arose in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nobility and Analogous Traditional Elites'', p. 94 [http://www.tfp.org/tfp-home/books/nobility-and-analogous-traditional-elites.html TFP.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ferdinand Werner]], ''Naissance de la noblesse. L'essor des élites politiques en Europe.'' Fayard, Paris 1998, {{ISBN|2-213-02148-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, [[knight]]s or nobles were mounted  [[warrior]]s who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land (usually together with [[serf]]s living thereon). During the period known as the [[Military Revolution]], nobles gradually lost their role in raising and commanding private armies, as many nations created cohesive national armies.
[[File:MS Ghent - Battle of Tewkesbury.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471. Large numbers of English nobility perished in the [[Wars of the Roses]]]]

This was coupled with a loss of the socio-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the [[Renaissance]] and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes, which increased still further during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, the ''bourgeoisie'' gradually grew in power; a rich city merchant came to be more influential than a nobleman, and the latter sometimes sought inter-marriage with families of the former to maintain their noble lifestyles.

However, in many countries at this time, the nobility retained substantial political importance and social influence: for instance, the United Kingdom's government was dominated by the nobility until the middle of the 19th century. Thereafter the powers of the nobility were progressively reduced by legislation. However, until 1999, all [[hereditary peer]]s were entitled to sit and vote in the [[House of Lords]]. Since then, only 92 of them have this entitlement, of whom 90 are elected by the hereditary peers as a whole to [[Representative peer|represent the peerage]].

The countries with the highest proportion of nobles were [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (probably 10%), [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (15% of an 18th-century population of 800,000), Spain (722,000 in 1768 which was 7–8% of the entire population) and other countries with lower percentages, such as Russia in 1760 with 500,000–600,000 nobles (2–3% of the entire population), and pre-revolutionary [[Kingdom of France|France]] where there were no more than 300,000 prior to 1789, which was 1% of the population (although some scholars believe this figure is an overestimate). In 1718 Sweden had between 10,000 and 15,000 nobles, which was 0.5% of the population. In Germany 0.01%.

In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] nobles made up 5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jonathan|first=Dewald|title=The European nobility, 1400–1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fct5tlRFwEC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|page=25|isbn=0-521-42528-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the nobles in 18th-century Europe numbered perhaps 3–4 million out of a total of 170–190 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jean|first=Meyer|title=Noblesses et pouvoirs dans l'Europe d'Ancien Régime, Hachette Littérature|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Noblesses_et_pouvoirs_dans_l_Europe_d_An.html?id=jXbaAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Hachette|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jean-Pierre|first=Labatut|title=Les noblesses européennes de la fin du XVe siècle à la fin du XVIIIe siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Les_noblesses_europ%C3%A9ennes.html?id=V4e1AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many peoples and nations have had noble or aristocratic classes of various kinds: these are so diverse that there may be no clear equivalents in other cultures' histories, and care in translation and context is important to minimize misconstrual, in particular when contrasting concepts and terminology with those derived from Western [[feudalism]].

{{for|the historical hierarchy of the Indian subcontinent|princely state}}

===China===
In [[East Asia]] the system was often modelled on imperial China, the leading culture. Emperors conferred [[Chinese nobility|titles of nobility]]. Imperial descendants formed the highest class of ancient Chinese nobility, their status based upon the rank of the empress or concubine from which they descend maternally (as emperors were polygamous). Numerous titles such as ''Taizi'' (crown prince), and equivalents of "prince" were accorded, and due to complexities in [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] rules, [[house law|rules]] were introduced for Imperial descendants. The titles of the junior princes were gradually lowered in rank by each generation while the senior heir continued to inherit their father's titles.

It was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew with a title of nobility and a fief of land so that they could offer sacrifices to their ancestors, in addition to members of other preceding dynasties.

China had a feudal system in the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasties]], which gradually gave way to a more bureaucratic one beginning in the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC). This continued through the [[Song dynasty]], and by its peak power shifted from nobility to bureaucrats.

This development was gradual and generally only completed in full by the Song dynasty. In the [[Han dynasty]], for example, even though noble titles were no longer given to those other than the Emperor's relatives, the fact that the process of selecting officials was mostly based on a vouching system by current officials as officials usually vouched for their own sons or those of other officials meant that a de facto aristocracy continued to exist. This process was further deepened during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period with the introduction of the [[Nine-rank system]].

By the [[Sui dynasty]], however, the institution of the [[Imperial examination]] system marked the transformation of a power shift towards a full bureaucracy, though the process would not be truly completed until the Song dynasty.

Titles of nobility became symbolic along with a stipend while governance of the country shifted to scholar officials.

In the [[Qing dynasty]] titles of nobility were still granted by the emperor, but served merely as honorifics based on a loose system of favors to the Qing emperor.

Under a centralized system, the empire's governance was the responsibility of the Confucian-educated scholar-officials and the local gentry, while the [[Scholar-official|literati]] were accorded gentry status. For male citizens, advancement in status was possible via garnering the top three positions in imperial examinations.

The Qing appointed the Ming imperial descendants to the title of [[Marquis of Extended Grace]].

The oldest held continuous noble title in Chinese history was that held by the descendants of [[Confucius]], as [[Duke Yansheng]], which was renamed as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius in 1935 by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. The title is held by [[Kung Tsui-chang]]. There is also a "Sacrificial Official to Mencius" for a descendant of [[Mencius]], a "Sacrificial Official to Zengzi" for a descendant of [[Zengzi]], and a "Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui" for a descendant of [[Yan Hui]].

The bestowal of titles was abolished upon the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, as part of a larger effort to remove feudal influences and practises from Chinese society.

===Islamic world===
In some Islamic countries, there are no definite noble titles (titles of hereditary rulers being distinct from those of hereditary intermediaries between monarchs and commoners). Persons who can trace legitimate descent from [[Muhammad]] or the clans of [[Quraysh]], as can members of several present or formerly reigning dynasties, are widely regarded as belonging to the ancient, hereditary Islamic nobility. In some Islamic countries they inherit (through mother or father) hereditary titles, although without any other associated privilege, e.g., variations of the title ''[[Sayyid]]'' and ''[[Sharif]]''. Regarded as more religious than the general population, many people turn to them for clarification or guidance in religious matters.

In [[Iran]], historical titles of the nobility including ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', ''[[ed-Dowleh]]'' and ''Shahzada'' ("Son of a Shah), are now no longer recognised. An aristocratic family is now recognised by their [[family name]], often derived from the post held by their ancestors, considering the fact that family names in Iran only appeared in the beginning of the 20th century.
Sultans have been an integral part of Islamic history .

During the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Imperial Court and the provinces there were many [[List of Ottoman titles and appellations|Ottoman titles and appellations]] forming a somewhat unusual and complex system in comparison with the other Islamic countries. The bestowal of noble and aristocratic titles was widespread across the empire even after its fall by independent monarchs. One of the most elaborate examples is that of the Egyptian aristocracy's largest clan, the [[Abaza family]].

===Japan===
[[File:Ｓａｍｕｒａｉ.jpg|thumb|Japanese samurai, 1798]]

Medieval Japan developed a feudal system similar to the European system, where land was held in exchange for military service. The ''[[daimyō]]'' class, or hereditary landowning nobles, held great socio-political power. As in Europe, they commanded private armies made up of ''[[samurai]]'', an elite [[Edo society#Samurai|warrior class]]; for long periods, these held the real power without a real [[central government]], and often plunged the country into a state of civil war. The ''daimyō'' class can be compared to European peers, and the samurai to European knights, but important differences exist.

Feudal title and rank were abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, and was replaced by the ''[[kazoku]]'', a five-rank [[peerage]] system after the British example, which granted seats in the upper house of the [[Imperial Diet (Japan)|Imperial Diet]]; this ended in 1947 following Japan's defeat in World War II.

Like other Southeast Asian countries, many regions in the [[Philippines]] have indigenous nobility, partially influenced by Hindu, Chinese, and Islamic custom. Since ancient times, ''[[Datu]]'' was the common title of a chief or monarch of the many [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-colonial]] principalities and sovereign dominions throughout the isles; in some areas the term ''Apo'' was also used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subicbaypi.com/sub_stories_olongapostory.htm The Olongapo Story], July 28, 1953 – Bamboo Breeze – Vol.6, No.3&lt;/ref&gt; With the titles ''[[Sultan]]'' and ''[[Rajah]]'', ''Datu'' (and its [[Malay language|Malay]] [[cognate]], ''Datok'') are currently used in some parts of the Philippines, [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. These titles are the rough equivalents of European titles, albeit dependent on the actual wealth and prestige of the bearer.

====Recognition by the Spanish Crown====

Upon the [[History of the Philippines#Spanish settlement during the 16th and 17th centuries|islands' Christianisation]], the datus retained governance of their territories despite annexation to the [[Spanish Empire]]. In a law signed 11 June 1594,&lt;ref&gt;"It is not right that the Indian chiefs of Filipinas be in a worse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that would gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to His true knowledge, the temporal blessings may be added and they may live contentedly and comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were formerly lords. In all else the governors shall see that the chiefs are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism, provided it be without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or prejudicial to that which pertains to their encomenderos." Felipe II, ''Ley de Junio 11, 1594'' in ''Recapilación de leyes'', lib. vi, tit. VII, ley xvi. Also cf. [[Emma Helen Blair]] and James Alexander Robertson, ''The Philippine Islands (1493–1898)'', Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XVI, pp. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Philip II of Spain]] ordered that the indigenous rulers continue to receive the same honours and privileges accorded them prior their conversion to [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholicism]]. The baptised nobility subsequently coalesced into the exclusive, landed ruling class of the lowlands known as the ''[[Principalía]]''.&lt;ref&gt;SCOTT, William Henry (1982). Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, and Other Essays in Philippine History. Quezon City: New Day Publishers. {{ISBN|978-9711000004}}. OCLC 9259667, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 1697, King [[Charles II of Spain]] confirmed the privileges granted by his predecessors (in Title VII, Book VI of the [[Laws of the Indies]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://fama2.us.es/fde/ocr/2006/leyesDeIndiasT1.pdf Recopilación de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias]&lt;/ref&gt; to indigenous nobilities of the Crown colonies, including the [[Principalía|Principales]] of the Philippines, and extended to them and to their descendants the preeminence and honors customarily attributed to the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hidalgos]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;''Por cuanto teniendo presentes las leyes y cédulas que se mandaron despachar por los Señores Reyes mis progenitores y por mí, encargo el buen tratamiento, amparo, protección y defensa de los indios naturales de la América, y que sean atendidos, mantenidos, favorecidos y honrados  como todos los demás vasallos de mi Corona, y que por el trascurso del tiempo se detiene la práctica y uso de ellas, y siento tan conveniente su puntual cumplimiento al bien público  y utilidad de los Indios y al servicio de Dios y mío, y que en esta consecuencia por lo que toca a los indios mestizos está encargo a los Arzobispos y Obispos de las Indias, por la Ley Siete, Título Siete, del Libro Primero, de la  Recopilación, los ordenen de sacerdotes, concurriendo las calidades y circunstancias que en ella se disponen y que si algunas mestizas quisieren ser religiosas  dispongan el que se las admita en los monasterios y a las profesiones, y aunque en lo especial de que quedan ascender los indios a puestos eclesiásticos o seculares, gubernativos, políticos y de guerra, que todos piden limpieza de sangre y por estatuto  la calidad de nobles, hay distinción entre los Indios y mestizos, o como descendentes de los indios principales que se llaman caciques, o como procedidos de indios menos principales que son los tributarios, y que en su gentilidad reconocieron vasallaje, se considera que a los primeros y sus descendentes se les deben todas las preeminencias y honores, así en lo eclesiástico como en lo secular que se acostumbran conferir a los nobles Hijosdalgo de Castilla y pueden participar de cualesquier comunidades que por estatuto pidan nobleza, pues es constante que estos en su gentilismo eran nobles a quienes sus inferiores reconocían vasallaje y tributaban, cuya especie de nobleza todavía  se les conserva y considera, guardándoles en lo posible, o privilegios, como así se reconoce y declara por todo el Título de los caciques, que es el Siete, del Libro Seis, de la Recopilación, donde por distinción de los indios inferiores se les dejó el señorío con nombre de cacicazgo, transmisible de mayor en mayor, a sus  posterioridades...''

The [[Laws of the Indies]] and other pertinent Royal Decrees were enforced in the Philippines and benefited many indigenous nobles. It can be seen very clearly and irrefutably that, during the colonial period, indigenous chiefs were equated with the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Spanish Hidalgos]], and the most resounding proof of  the application of this comparison is the General Military Archive in [[Segovia]], where the qualifications of “Nobility” (found in the Service Records) are attributed to those Filipinos who were admitted to the Spanish Military Academies and whose ancestors were [[cacique]]s, [[encomendero]]s, notable Tagalogs, chieftains,  [[Gobernadorcillo|governors]] or those  who held positions in the municipal administration or government in all different regions of the large islands of the Archipelago, or of the many small islands of which it is composed.&lt;ref&gt;''Por ella se aprecia bien claramente y de manera fehaciente que a los caciques indígenas se les equiparada a los Hidalgos españoles y la prueba más rotunda de su aplicación se halla en el Archivo General Militar de Segovia, en donde las calificaciones de «Nobleza» se encuentran en las Hojas de Servicio de aquellos filipinos que ingresaron en nuestras Academias Militares y cuyos ascendientes eran caciques, encomenderos, tagalos notables, pedáneos, por los gobernadores o que ocupan cargos en la Administración municipal o en la del Gobierno, de todas las diferentes regiones de las grandes islas del Archipiélago o en las múltiples islas pequeñas de que se compone el mismo.''

At the ''Real Academia de la Historia'', there is a substantial number of records providing reference to the Philippine Islands, and while most parts correspond to the history of these islands, the ''Academia'' did not exclude among its documents the presence of many genealogical records. The archives of the ''Academia'' and its royal stamp recognized the appointments of hundreds of natives of the Philippines who, by virtue of their social position, occupied posts in the administration of the territories and were classified as ''"nobles"''.&lt;ref&gt;''Por otra parte, mientras en las Indias la cultura precolombiana había alcanzado un alto nivel, en Filipinas la civilización isleña continuaba manifestándose en sus estados más primitivos. Sin embargo, esas sociedades primitivas, independientes totalmente las unas de las otras, estaban en cierta manera estructuradas y se apreciaba en ellas una organización jerárquica embrionaria y local, pero era digna de ser atendida. Precisamente en esa organización local es, como siempre, de donde nace la nobleza. El indio aborigen, jefe de tribu, es reconocido como noble y las pruebas irrefutables de su nobleza se encuentran principalmente en las Hojas de Servicios de los militares de origen filipino que abrazaron la carrera de las Armas, cuando para hacerlo necesariamente era preciso demostrar el origen nobiliario del individuo.''

Madrid: HIDALGUIA. {{ISBN|9788487204548}}, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these notables demonstrates the cultural concern of Spain in those Islands to prepare the natives and the collaboration of these in the government of the Archipelago. This aspect of Spanish rule in the Philippines appears much more strongly implemented than in the [[Americas]]. Hence in the Philippines, the local nobility, by reason of charge accorded to their social class, acquired greater importance than in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indies]] of the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;''También en la Real Academia de la Historia existe un importante fondo relativo a las Islas Filipinas, y aunque su mayor parte debe corresponder a la Historia de ellas, no es excluir que entre su documentación aparezcan muchos antecedentes genealógicos… El Archivo del Palacio y en su Real Estampilla se recogen los nombramientos de centenares de aborígenes de aquel Archipiélago, a los cuales, en virtud de su posición social, ocuparon cargos en la administración de aquellos territorios y cuya presencia demuestra la inquietud cultural de nuestra Patria en aquéllas Islas para la preparación de sus naturales y la colaboración de estos en las tareas de su Gobierno.

With the recognition of the Spanish monarchs came the privilege of being addressed as [[Don (honorific)|Don]] or [[Don (honorific)|Doña]].&lt;ref&gt;''Durante la dominación española, el '''cacique''', jefe de un barangay, ejercía funciones judiciales y administrativas.

Other honors and high regard were also accorded to the Christianized Datus by the [[Spanish Empire]]. For example, the [[Gobernadorcillo]]s (elected leader of the [[Cabeza de Barangay|Cabezas de Barangay]] or the Christianized Datus) and Filipino officials of justice received the greatest consideration from the Spanish Crown officials. The colonial officials were under obligation to show them the honor corresponding to their respective duties. They were allowed to sit in the houses of the Spanish Provincial Governors, and in any other places. They were not left to remain standing. It was not permitted for Spanish Parish Priests to treat these Filipino nobles with less consideration.&lt;ref&gt;BLAIR, Emma Helen &amp; ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds. (1903).

The recognition of the rights and privileges accorded to the Filipino Principalía as [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hijosdalgos]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] seems to facilitate entrance of Filipino nobles into institutions of  under the Spanish Crown, either civil or religious, which required proofs of nobility.&lt;ref name="cardenasvv"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=235}} However, to see such recognition as an approximation or comparative estimation of rank or status might not be correct since in reality, although the principales were vassals of the Crown, their rights as sovereign in their former dominions were guaranteed by the [[Laws of the Indies]], more particularly the Royal Decree of Philip II of 11 June 1594, which Charles II confirmed for the purpose stated above in order to satisfy the requirements of the existing laws in the Peninsula.

It must be recalled that ever since the beginning of the colonialization, the conquistador [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] did not strip the ancient sovereign rulers of the Archipelago (who vowed allegiance to the Spanish Crown) of their legitimate rights. Many of them accepted the Catholic religion and were his allies from the very beginning. He only demanded from these local rulers [[Vassal state|vassalage]] to the Spanish Crown,&lt;ref&gt;FERRANDO, Fr Juan &amp; FONSECA OSA, Fr Joaquin (1870–1872). ''Historia de los PP. Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas y en las Misiones del Japon, China, Tung-kin y Formosa'' (Vol. 1 of 6 vols) (in Spanish). Madrid: Imprenta y esteriotipia de M Rivadeneyra, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the similar [[Mandala (political model)|overlordship]], which previously existed in a few cases, e.g., [[Sultanate of Brunei]]'s overlordship of the [[Kingdom of Maynila]]. Other independent [[polity|polities]] which were not vassals to other States, e.g., [[Madja-as|Confederation of Madja-as]] and the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], were more of [[Protectorate]]s/[[Suzerainty|Suzerainties]] having had alliances with the Spanish Crown before the Kingdom took total control of most parts of the Archipelago. An interesting question remains after the cessession of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, that is, what is the equivalent of the rank of the [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[Principalía]], freed from vassalage yet not able to exercise their sovereignty within the democratic society in the Archipelago?

One logical conclusion would be their ancient Royal and noble [[Royal and noble ranks|title]] as [[Datu]] — the historical [[Royal and noble ranks|title]] of local nobles of [[Indigenous peoples of the Philippines|ancient domains]] respected and protected by the [[Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997]], the existing pertinent law of the [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippines]]; and by a related international legislation, the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]. Retaining as a [[subsidiary title]] the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hidalguía]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] — their former protector State — without prejudice to their ancestral title, appears most suitable to the hispanized Filipino nobles. Besides, as stated in the above-mentioned Royal Decree of Charles II, the ancient nobility of the Filipino Principales ''"is still retained and acknowledged"''.

Just like the deposed royal families elsewhere in the world, which still lay claim to their hereditary rights as [[pretender]]s to the former thrones of their ancestors, the descendants of the [[Principalía]] have the same [[de iure]] claims to the historical domains of their forebears.

==Africa==
Africa has a plethora of ancient lineages in its various constituent nations. Some, such as the numerous ''[[sharif]]ian'' families of North Africa, the [[Keita dynasty]] of [[Mali]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopia]] and the [[Sherbro Tuckers|Sherbro Tucker]] clan of [[Sierra Leone]], claim descent from notables from outside of the continent. Most, such as those composed of the descendants of [[Shaka]] and [[Moshoeshoe I|Moshoeshoe]] of [[Southern Africa]], belong to peoples that have been resident in the continent for millennia. Generally their royal or noble status is recognized by and derived from the authority of traditional custom. A number of them also enjoy either a constitutional or a statutory recognition of their high social positions.

===Ethiopia===
[[Ethiopia]] has a [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|nobility]] that is almost as old as the country itself. Throughout the history of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] most of the titles of nobility have been tribal or military in nature. However the Ethiopian nobility resembled its European counterparts in some respects;  until 1855, when [[Tewodros II]] ended the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' its aristocracy was organised similarly to the feudal system in Europe during the Middle Ages. For more than seven centuries, Ethiopia (or [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], as it was then known) was made up of many small kingdoms, principalities, emirates and [[imam]]ates, which owed their allegiance to the ''nəgusä nägäst'' (literally "King of Kings"). Despite its being a Christian monarchy, various Muslim states paid tribute to the emperors of Ethiopia for centuries: including the [[Adal Sultanate]], the [[Emirate of Harar]], and the [[Awsa sultanate]].

Ethiopian nobility were divided into two different categories: ''Mesafint'' ("prince"), the hereditary nobility that formed the upper echelon of the ruling class; and the ''Mekwanin'' ("governor") who were appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the nobility (''[[cf.]]'' the ''[[Ministerialis]]'' of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). In  Ethiopia there were titles of nobility among the ''Mesafint'' borne by those at the apex of medieval Ethiopian society. The highest royal title (after that of emperor) was ''[[Negus]]'' ("king") which was held by hereditary governors of the provinces of [[Begemder]], [[Shewa]], [[Gojjam]], and [[Wollo]]. The next highest seven titles were ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]]'', ''[[Dejazmach]]'', ''Fit'awrari'', ''[[Grazmach]]'', ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Qenyazmach|Qenyazmach]]'', ''[[Azmach]]'' and ''[[Balambaras]]''. The title of ''Le'ul Ras'' was accorded to the heads of various noble families and [[cadet branch]]es of the [[Solomonic dynasty]], such as the princes of Gojjam, Tigray, and Selalle. The heirs of the ''Le'ul Rases'' were titled ''Le'ul Dejazmach'', indicative of the higher status they enjoyed relative to ''Dejazmaches'' who were not of the blood imperial. There were various [[hereditary title]]s in Ethiopia: including that of ''[[Jantirar]]'', reserved for males of the family of Empress [[Menen Asfaw]] who ruled over the mountain fortress of [[Ambassel]] in Wollo; ''[[Wagshum]]'', a title created for the descendants of the deposed [[Zagwe dynasty]]; and ''Shum Agame'', held by the descendants of ''Dejazmach'' [[Sabagadis]], who ruled over the [[Agame]] district of Tigray. The  vast majority of titles borne by nobles were not, however, hereditary.

Despite being largely dominated by Christian elements, some Muslims obtained ''entrée'' into the Ethiopian nobility as part of their quest for aggrandizement during the 1800s. To do so they were generally obliged to abandon their faith and some are believed to have feigned conversion to Christianity for the sake of acceptance by the old Christian aristocratic families. One such family, the Wara Seh (more commonly called the "Yejju dynasty") converted to Christianity and eventually wielded power for over a century, ruling with the sanction of the Solomonic emperors. The last such Muslim noble to join the ranks of Ethiopian society was [[Mikael of Wollo]] who converted, was made ''Negus'' of Wollo, and later King of Zion, and even married into the Imperial family. He lived to see his son, [[Iyasu V]], inherit the throne in 1913—only to be deposed in 1916 because of his conversion to Islam.

===Madagascar===
The nobility in [[Madagascar]] are known as the ''[[Andriana]]''. In much of Madagascar, before French colonization of the island, the [[Malagasy people]] were organised into a rigid social caste system, within which the ''Andriana'' exercised both spiritual and political leadership. The word "Andriana" has been used to denote nobility in various ethnicities in Madagascar: including  the ''[[Merina]]'', the ''[[Betsileo]]'', the ''[[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]]'', the ''[[Tsimihety]]'', the ''[[Bezanozano]]'', the ''[[Antambahoaka]]'' and the ''[[Antemoro]]''.

The word ''Andriana'' has often formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests that the origin of the title ''Andriana'' is traceable back to an ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] title of nobility. Before the colonization by France in the 1890s, the ''Andriana'' held various privileges, including land ownership, preferment for senior government posts, free labor from members of lower classes, the right to have their tombs constructed within town limits, etc. The ''Andriana'' rarely married outside their caste: a high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man took on her husband's lower rank, but a high-ranking man marrying a woman of lower rank did not forfeit his status, although his children could not inherit his rank or property (''[[cf.]]'' [[morganatic marriage]]).

In 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar endorsed the revival of a Christian ''Andriana'' monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition.

===Nigeria===
Contemporary [[Nigeria]] has a class of traditional notables whose titles are tied to those of its reigning monarchs, the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]]. Though their functions are largely ceremonial, their titles are often centuries old and are usually vested in the members of historically prominent families in the various subnational kingdoms of the country.

Membership of initiatory societies that have inalienable functions within the kingdoms is also a common feature of Nigerian nobility, particularly among the southern tribes, where such figures as the ''[[Ogboni]]'' of the ''[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]'', the ''[[Nze na Ozo]]'' of the ''[[Igbo people|Igbo]]'' and the ''[[Ekpe]]'' of the ''[[Efik people|Efik]]'' are some of the most famous examples. Although many of their traditional functions have become dormant due to the advent of modern governance, their members retain precedence of a traditional nature and are especially prominent during festivals.

Outside of this, many of the traditional nobles of Nigeria continue to serve as [[privy counsellor]]s and [[viceroy]]s in the service of their traditional sovereigns in a symbolic continuation of the way that their titled ancestors and predecessors did during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. Many of them are also members of the country's [[political elite]] due to their not being covered by the prohibition from involvement in politics that governs the activities of the traditional rulers.

Holding a [[chieftaincy]] title, either of the [[traditional]] variety (which involves taking part in ritual re-enactments of your title's history during annual festivals, roughly akin to a British [[peerage]]) or the honorary variety (which does not involve the said re-enactments, roughly akin to a [[knighthood]]), grants an individual the right to use the word "chief" as a pre-nominal [[honorific]] while in Nigeria.

== Latin America==
In addition to a variety of indigenous peoples (such as the ''[[Aymara people|Aymara]]'' and the ''[[Quechua people|Quechua]]'', who have long traditions of being led by nobles called ''[[Apu Mallku]]s'' and ''[[Mallku]]s''), tribal connections exist among a number of other groups. Peerage traditions dating to the colonial period of such countries as Brazil, [[Cuba]] and [[Mexico]] have left noble families in each of them that have ancestral ties to those nations' native tribes, while such figures as the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] and the [[high priestess]] of the ''[[Ile Maroia Laji]]'' sect of Brazilian ''[[Candomblé]]'' trace their ancestries to and derive their prestige from ancient monarchs and nobles of the pre-colonial African continent.

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Marquis of Parana by Emilio Bauch.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná|Marquis of Paraná]], [[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil|Prime Minister of Brazil]].]]

The nobility in Brazil began during the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial era]] with the [[Portuguese nobility]]. When Brazil became a [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|united kingdom with Portugal]] in 1815, the first Brazilian titles of nobility were granted by the King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.

With the independence of Brazil in 1822 as a constitutional monarchy the titles of nobility initiated by the King of Portugal were continued and new titles of nobility were created by the [[Emperor of Brazil]]. However, according to the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1824]], the Emperor conferred titles of nobility, which were personal and therefore non-hereditary, unlike its Portuguese and Portuguese-Brazilian predecessor, being inherited exclusively to the royal titles of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During the existence of the [[Empire of Brazil]] 1211 noble titles were acknowledged. 
With the proclamation of the [[First Brazilian Republic]], in 1889, the Brazilian nobility was extinguished. It was also prohibited, under penalty of accusation of [[high treason]] and the suspension of political rights, to accept noble titles and foreign decorations without the proper permission of the State. In particular, the nobles of greater distinction, by respect and tradition, were allowed to use their titles during the republican regime. The Imperial Family also could not return to the Brazilian soil until 1921, when the Banishment Law was repealed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Pacific Islands==
Amongst the [[Polynesians]] of the Pacific the ''[[Ali'i]]'' occupied the traditional place of an Aristocratic class. The Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]], [[Kingdom of Tahiti|Tahiti]] and presently the Kingdom of [[Tonga]] were all ruled by a ruling class known as the ''Ali'i''

The ''Ali'i'' routinely provided the kings and nobles of various Polynesian Kingdoms; including the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] prior to its dissolution 1893, and have served as a bastion of Native Hawaiian [[revivalism]] since its occurrence. In [[Tonga]], after contact with Western nations, the traditional system of chiefs was developed into a Western-style monarchy with a hereditary class of "barons", the Tongans even adopting that English title as a synonym for chief.

== Syllable structure ==
Syllables in Pnar can consist of a single nucleic vowel. Maximally, they can include a complex onset of two consonants, a diphthong nucleus, and a coda consonant. A second type of syllable contains a syllabic nasal/trill/lateral immediately following the onset consonant. This syllabic consonant behaves as the rhyme. (Ring, 2012: 141-2)

'''Remembrance of the Dead''' ({{lang-nl|Dodenherdenking}}) is held annually on [[May 4]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dictionary of Dutchness - Dodenherdenking|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/dictionary/dodenherdenking/|website=DutchNews.nl|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorates all civilians and members of the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] who have died in wars or peacekeeping missions since the beginning of the [[Second World War]].

== Definition ==
Since 2011 the official text of the Memorandum for Remembrance Day on 4 May is as follows:

{{quote|During the [[Dutch people|national]] commemoration of Remembrance Day we remember all Dutch victims – civilians and soldiers – who have been killed or murdered in the Kingdom of the Netherlands or anywhere else in the world in [[War|war situations]] or during [[Peacekeeping|peace-keeping operations]] since the outbreak of the Second World War.|source=Memorandum 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4en5mei.nl/english/commemorating Commemorating], The National Committee for 4 and 5 May&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Local committees apply their own interpretation to the commemorations and also bear responsibility for that interpretation.

== Description ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}
Until 1961 the commemoration only related to the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] victims of [[World War II]]. Since 1961, the victims of other military conflicts (such as the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in [[Indonesia]]) and peacekeeping missions (such as in [[Lebanon]] or [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]) are remembered on May 4 as well.

Traditionally, the main ceremonies are observed in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[National Monument (Amsterdam)|National Monument]] on [[Dam Square]]. This ceremony is usually attended by members of the cabinet and the [[House of Orange-Nassau|royal family]], military leaders, representatives of the [[Dutch resistance|resistance movement]] and other social groups. At 20:00 two minutes of [[moment of silence|silence]] is observed throughout the Netherlands. Public transport is stopped as well as all other traffic. Radio and TV only broadcast the ceremonies from 19:00 until 20:30. Since 4 May 1994 flags, having hung at [[half-mast]] from 18:00, are then hoisted to the music of the [[Wilhelmus]], the Dutch [[national anthem]]. Since 2001 the new protocol says it is allowed to let the flag hang at half-mast.

The main commemorations in Amsterdam are broadcast by the public broadcasting company [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] and there are ceremonies in other cities and places as well.  Especially notable are those at the [[Waalsdorpervlakte]] near [[The Hague]] where many Dutch resistance fighters were executed during the war, and at the war cemetery [[Grebbeberg]], which are broadcast by the commercial broadcasting companies. In many towns, before or after the two minutes of silence, people gather around a monument, listen to speeches, and lay down flowers to remember the dead.

The next day, on [[May 5]], people [[Liberation Day (The Netherlands)|celebrate the liberation]] of the nation from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation of 1940 to 1945.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15454">'''Remunicipalisation''' commonly refers to the return of previously [[privatised]] water supply and sanitation services to municipal authorities. It also encompasses regional or national initiatives.

== Overview ==

The concept is broadly used to cover:
* Changes from [[Private ownership|private]] to wholly [[public ownership]] of assets or companies.
* Changes from [[outsourcing]] (or contracting-out) of services to direct provision by a public authority.
* Replacement of concessions or lease contracts by public management.

Remunicipalisation happens at many levels:
* [[Municipality|Municipal]] and community levels (such as in France or the US), including inter-municipal groups or associations.
* Regional levels (as in the Buenos Aires and Santa Fe provinces of Argentina).
* National levels (such as in Malaysia).

At least 234 cases of water remunicipalisation in 37 countries were recorded between 2000 and March 2015, including high profile cases in [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. By then, the total number of people served by remunicipalised water services had grown to exceed 100 million. Cases are more concentrated in high-income countries, where 183 remunicipalisations took place in the last 15 years, compared to 51 cases in middle- and low-income countries. Two countries, France with 94 cases and the US with 58 cases, account for the greatest majority of cases in high-income countries. Analysts also signal that the pace of remunicipalisation has doubled in the 2010-2015 period compared with the first decade of the millennium.

== Actors ==

Very often, utility managers, bureaucrats and politicians are the ones to recognise problems with water privatisation. Labour involvement is critical for the success of remunicipalisation because frontline workers have important insights into operational challenges and opportunities. Civil society movements have proven key to promoting remunicipalisation as a policy option, as well framing it as an opportunity to build socially desirable and environmentally sustainable public water models to benefit present and future generations. Researchers have been playing a role in international exchange of expertise on how to achieve transparent, accountable and effective public water management following remunicipalisation.

== Reasons for remunicipalisation ==

Direct experience with common problems of private water management has persuaded many communities and policy makers that the public sector is better placed to provide quality services to citizens and promote the human right to water. These problems with water privatisation include: 
* Poor performance of private companies (e.g. in Dar es Salaam, Accra, Maputo). 
* Under-investment (e.g. Berlin, Buenos Aires). 
* Disputes over operational costs and price increases (e.g. Almaty, Maputo, Indianapolis),  
* Soaring water bills (e.g. Berlin, Kuala Lumpur). 
* Difficulties in monitoring private operators (e.g. Atlanta). 
* Lack of financial transparency (e.g. Grenoble, Paris, Berlin). 
* Workforce cuts and poor service quality (e.g. Atlanta, Indianapolis).

At the global level, 92 of the 234 cases of remunicipalisation recorded followed contractual termination, while 69 cases were non-renewals of private contracts after expiry. In the great majority of cases private contracts proved to be unsustainable. Local governments, then, opted to remunicipalise even though they knew that they may have to pay compensation, because they evaluated that it would be less costly than continuing with privatisation in the long run.
  
David McDonald puts remunicipalisation debates in a historical perspective: 
“Most contemporary water services around the world started as private enterprises (as early as the mid-1800s), but as the inefficiency of private sector providers became increasingly evident, and as private companies denied water services to the poor (contributing to outbreaks of cholera and other illnesses), local governments began to municipalise these services for the first time.”

== Benefits ==

Financially, there have been direct savings from remunicipalisation for most of the municipalities – around €35 million in the first year in Paris, and about C$6 million in the first three years of remunicipalisation in Hamilton – some of which was realised immediately when profit-taking fees for private management were removed. As a result, some new public operators significantly increased investments in the water systems, such as in Grenoble (France), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Arenys de Munt (Spain). In turn, such longer term infrastructure development helps avoid future cost burdens associated with the types of health and environmental hazards experienced under privatisation, much of which was borne by the state in the past.

Further, the social benefits of water remunicipalisation have been visible in Arenys de Munt (Spain), where the local government and the new public operator restructured the tariff system to guarantee equitable access to water for low-income households. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, achieving universal access to water became a top priority for the new public operator AySA. The utility increased investment in infrastructure dramatically, and extended training programmes for employees who work with poor neighbourhood residents to expand services.

Remunicipalisation also allows strengthening accountability and transparency. In Paris and Grenoble (France), the new public water operators have introduced advanced forms of public participation. This allows civil society to partake in decisions on the management of this basic public service, and to make operations responsive to the interests of local communities.

With remunicipalisation, the perspective often changes from a narrow, profit-oriented one to broader social and political objectives. Many remunicipalised water entities have demonstrated their ability to think beyond their sector to be more holistic in their planning and action. Intergovernmental coordination is often essential on issues such as watershed management for example.

Research on Buenos Aires and Hamilton has shown that public water employees became more engaged in the planning and operation of water services than they were in the past and more committed to public water services beyond the narrow financial and technocratic concerns that dominate private water management.

== Criticisms ==

{{Empty section|date=June 2015}}

== Risks ==

Successful remunicipalisation requires careful planning and assessment of external risks, even more so for countries of the South which are under the grips of multilateral agencies. Each privatisation experience leaves significant structural, financial and ideological legacies that shape the direction of remunicipalisation and often constrain the potential for public sector success.

Even where political will is strong and financial and technical capacity exists, reverting to public ownership and management is fraught with difficulties. There is institutional memory lost, degraded assets, communication and accounting systems that do not mesh with public sector systems, and so on. The deep asset deficit left by many private water companies means that municipalities are working with decrepit equipment and collapsing infrastructure that can be more expensive to repair than to replace and build anew. Private firms have also demonstrated that they can be politically difficult, sabotaging transition efforts to try and undermine the public provider. In many cases the private companies refuse to release critical operational information, attempt to take the municipalities to court for breach of contract, or initiate PR campaigns in an effort to undercut the credibility of the remunicipalisation initiatives.

When a private contract is terminated before its expiry date, private companies can sue local governments to receive compensation for the full profits granted under the contract. A private concessionaire in Arenys de Munt, Spain obstructed fiercely the remunicipalisation process by filing complaints against the city council. The city of Indianapolis, US was forced to pay a $29-million fee to French multinational Veolia to terminate the 20-year contract over a decade early. Berlin residents have had to accept very high costs to buy back the shares held by two private operators. Private concessionaires sued Tucuman and Buenos Aires, Argentina before an international arbitration tribunal to obtain compensation. The risk of having to pay hefty compensation can distort the decision-making process of local governments who are considering termination and remunicipalisation (e.g. Jakarta, Indonesia; Szeged, Hungary; Arezzo, Italy). But in other cases the potential benefits are so clear that local authorities are ready to face such risks.

Finally, it must be noted that donor funding cannot be relied on for remunicipalisation efforts. After decades of generous (and ongoing) political and financial support for privatisation from international financial institutions and bilateral donors, these development organisations have effectively ignored the remunicipalisation trend. Support for the implementation of remunicipalisation is practically non-existent (with the exception of limited funding for public-public partnerships from UN-Habitat ). In some cases international donors even have attempted to undermine remunicipalisation efforts, making the transition to public services an even more difficult one (such as the World Bank’s attempts to block remunicipalisation in Dar es Salaam and Lagos).

== Innovative public models ==

Experiments with public participation in water services planning, worker cooperatives, community water systems and other innovative models of service delivery are challenging older models of public water delivery. Proponents argue that remunicipalisation cannot be an unquestioned return to what was offered before privatisation; it must be an improvement on what is meant by public and an expansion of the democratic terms of engagement.
Nonetheless, entrenched neoliberal beliefs in market-based incentives, ring-fenced accounting, cost-reflexive pricing, and competition within and between government departments (commonly defined as corporatization) has transformed the ways in which people think about and manage public services, raising questions about the potential for deep reform in the public sector.

'''Public-public partnerships'''

Public water operators and national or regional associations are increasingly helping each other through the remunicipalisation process. In Spain, the regional public company Aguas del Huesna (Andalusia) facilitated remunicipalisation for 22 municipalities. The remunicipalised water operators from Paris and Grenoble played a key role in helping other local authorities in France and elsewhere to remunicipalise and improve their water services. French local authorities and public water operators have benefited from the exchange of experience and knowledge on remunicipalisation that has been facilitated by associations of local governments and public enterprises. The regional institution CONGIAC in Catalonia also played a key role in Arenys de Munt’s remunicipalisation process from decision making to implementation. There are other such examples across boundaries. After failed public-private partnerships (PPPs), the Mozambican government entered into a not-for-profit partnership with a Dutch public water company focusing on local capacity building. Cooperation between public water companies as part of public-public partnerships is a viable alternative to costly PPPs and the most effective way to assist public water authorities in improving services.

'''Other sectors'''

Hospitals and electricity services have also been taken back into public hands, at all levels of government, and there are vibrant debates around the world about how various services can be returned to public ownership and control. Each service sector offers its own managerial, technical, geographic and political challenges, but there is much to be learned from inter-sectoral debate and dialogue.

== Remunicipalisation Tracker ==

Corporate Europe Observatory and the Transnational Institute have jointly developed a tracker to showcase cities, regions and countries that have rolled back privatisation and embarked on securing public water for all. This initiative mirrors the private water industry practice of listing upcoming privatisations and public-private partnerships as opportunities for commercial expansion. Cases focus on understanding why and how the remunicipalisation process took place as well as the obstacles encountered and the results achieved. In many cases, more detailed information is available through links. To provide a more realistic overview of the trend, the tracker also includes ongoing campaigns advocating for the remunicipalisation of water services.

'''Slavery in Mali''' exists today, with as many as 200,000 people held in direct servitude to a master. Since 2006, a movement called ''Temedt'' has been active in Mali struggling against the persistence of slavery and the discrimination associated with ex-slaves. There were reports that in the [[Tuareg Rebellion (2012)|Tuareg Rebellion]] of 2012, ex-slaves were recaptured by their former masters.

Slavery in Mali existed across different ethnic groups of [[Pre-Imperial Mali]] before the [[Muslim conquest of the Sudan|Muslim conquest]]. Slavery increased in importance with the [[Arab slave trade]] [[trans-Saharan trade|across the Sahara]] during the Middle Ages. Following the collapse of the [[Mali Empire]] (c. 1600 AD), slave raiding increased and the slave trade became a key part of the economy in the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]], and [[Fula people|Fula]] communities which would eventually be the major ethnic groups in the country of [[Mali]].

When the area came under French colonial control in 1898, as [[French Sudan]], the French authorities formally abolished slavery in 1905. Despite this declaration, traditional patterns of servitude persisted. Although some slaves left their positions of servitude following the declaration of 1905, many remained and in much of the country, slavery continued more or less unimpeded. With the political opening of the creation of the [[French Fourth Republic]] in 1946, large number of slaves left their positions and the slavery issue became a key political issue for the [[Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally]] (US-RDA) party.

When the [[Republic of Mali]] achieved independence in 1960, the government tried to further undermine the institution of slavery but efforts were largely stalled when the military dictatorship of [[Moussa Traoré]] took over the country from 1968 until 1991.

==Slavery before colonization==
[[File:African slave trade.png|thumb|550px|The trade routes of the [[Arab slave trade]] in [[History of Africa#500 to 1800|medieval Africa]].]]
Inside the borders of present-day Mali, slavery existed for many centuries in the [[Mali Empire]] and the surrounding communities and kingdoms. Slavery continued to exist after the fall of the Mali Empire being a significant part of the economies of [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]], and [[Fula people|Fula]] communities. With the chaos at the fall of the Mali Empire, slave raiding and the slave trade increased significantly throughout the region.{{sfn|Lyon|2005|p=119}}

The sale and trade of slaves in the 19th century was often regulated by Islamic legal codes allowing trade between different communities in the area.{{sfn|Lyon|2005|pp=137-139}} Slavery was not practiced in a uniform way and a variety of forms of servitude existed with distinctions often made between different types of slaves: for example between people bought or captured and those born into a household and also a distinction between those who tended herds and those who dealt with household tasks.{{sfn|Klein|1998|pp=7-9}}

Slavery was not as important in some communities with some in the southern part of present-day Mali having few or no slaves.{{sfn|Klein|1998|p=4}} However, in many parts of present-day Mali, slave labor was a key pillar of the economic system and relied on extensively.{{sfn|de Bruijn|Pelckmans|2005|p=74}} This reliance on slave labor was noted by early French administrators of the territory when the French were taking control of the area in the 1890s as a critical issue.{{sfn|Klein|1998|pp=77-79}}

==French control==
The French took control over the region in the 1890s and established a limited administration as part of [[French West Africa]]. Eventually the area would be organized and called the [[French Sudan]] colony, but administration was often linked to other colonies in the region for much of the early 1900s.  In 1903, French administrators were instructed to not use slave as an administrative category anymore: functionally, slave status could not be used anymore to decide legal or property issues.{{sfn|Klein|2005|p=831}}

=== French abolition of slavery (1905) ===
This was followed in 1905 when the French issued a formal decree ending slavery throughout French West Africa, including the area to become the country of Mali.{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=197}} Throughout French West Africa almost a million slaves responded to this by moving away from their masters and settling elsewhere,{{sfn|Klein|2005|p=831}} with the French supporting this effort by creating settlements around the [[Niger River]] and digging wells for communities elsewhere to engage in agriculture away from their former masters.{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=200}}

This process impacted the Southern and Western parts of present-day Mali most significantly, but in the Northern and Eastern parts of the colony large numbers of slaves remained in relationships of servitude to their masters.{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=197}} Throughout the area of present-day Mali, rough estimates say that about one-third moved away and ended the slavery relationship while two-thirds remained with their masters.{{sfn|Klein|2005|p=833}} In the 1920s, most Tuareg households still had slaves who tended to the house and animals.{{sfn|Seddon|2000|p=220}}

[[File:French Sudan.png|thumb|350px|French Sudan (Lime) and the rest of the French colonies in Africa (Dark Green).]]
Although slavery persisted, some aspects of the relationship changed with the French administration. Slaves who escaped their masters could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for limited amounts of time.{{sfn|Seddon|2000|p=220}} Slaves were sometimes able to renegotiate the terms of their servitude in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to maintain servitude status if they received control over their family life and were given some land to pass to their children.{{sfn|Klein|2005|p=833}} In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves.{{sfn|de Bruijn|Pelckmans|2005|p=76}}

The efforts of the French administration on slave issues was largely connected to policies regarding the Tuareg areas.  The Tuareg people had actively resisted French rule in the area until 1903 and were the cause of frequent revolts for many of the early decades of the 1900s (namely the [[Kaocen Revolt]]  of 1916-1917). French administration largely sought to replace the political power of Tuareg society by undermining what they saw as a rigid hierarchy and [[caste system]].{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=199}}

The French saw Tuareg society divided into groups of nobles, vassals, and slaves and decided to largely support the vassals in order to undermine the power of the nobles. In this effort, slaves were not considered a crucial aspect.{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=199}} The caste system was similarly imputed to have a racial dimension with vassals and nobles being defined as white and slaves defined as black.{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=45}}

As a result of the continued persistence of large numbers of slaves in Tuareg societies and the focus on vassals rather than slave populations, French administrators in the French Sudan reported incorrectly that slavery did not exist in Tuareg society so that the 1905 declaration ending slavery was largely being adhered to.{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=48}} Thus, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued to exist in much of French Sudan.{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=203}}

The situation changed with a large number of slaves resiting their status starting in 1946. In that year, the [[French Fourth Republic]] was founded and a key part of the new constitution was direct elections for positions in the colonies.{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=206}}{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=43}} Along with these efforts, a political party came to prominence in the French Sudan, called the [[Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally]] (US-RDA), which had a strong political base in the south of the colony. As a result of both its socialist ideology and to gain a political base in the north, the US-RDA encouraged slaves to resist their masters and become free.{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=49}} As a result, large numbers of slaves in the country began claiming ownership over their herds and land or simply moving to other areas where employment opportunities were available (mainly to the cities of [[Gao]] or [[Timbuktu]] or to other colonies like the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]).{{sfn|Mauxion|2012|p=206}}

Large scale emancipation and many slave revolts occurred throughout the colony.{{sfn|Seddon|2000|p=226}} One prominent example in 1955 in the town of Norben in the [[Gourma-Rharous Cercle]]. With encouragement from the US-RDA, slaves in the area took the entire herds they cared for and moved away from their master's land. The master then organized a violent raiding party on the slaves to attempt and take back the animals. The case came to the French administrator in the area who ruled that the slaves would be given independent status from their master and that they would receive more than half of the herd.{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=52}}

Despite these efforts by the French administration, the institution of slavery persisted through much of the colony and it was still possible in 1958 to purchase a slave in [[Timbuktu]].{{sfn|Seddon|2000|p=226}}

==Independent Mali to the present (1960–)==
Since independence in 1960, slavery continues to persist in Mali. In recent years there has been a movement trying to fight the continued practice of slavery and discrimination against ex-slaves. Although slavery is illegal, slave relationships continue to persist throughout Mali in every ethnic group in the country, although mainly in Tuareg communities.{{sfn|de Bruijn|Pelckmans|2005|pp=70-71}}{{sfn|Hicks|2008}}

In addition, there are reports that the status of ex-slaves and restrictions on their behavior exists in the Malian [[diaspora]] living in other countries.{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=52}} Some in the government claim that since there is freedom to leave the situations are not properly defined as slavery.{{sfn|Hicks|2008}} The anti-slavery Malian organization ''Temedt'' contributed to a report claiming that up to two million people continue to be held in passive and active slave relationships,{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=149}} with as many as 200,000 people forcibly held as slaves.{{sfn|Tran|2012}}

===Persistence of slavery===
[[File:Keita 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A poster of [[Modibo Keïta]], the first President of Mali, who encouraged slaves to leave their masters.]]

In the early 1960s the first [[President of Mali]], [[Modibo Keïta]], and the US-RDA party made ending slavery a main issue for the party.{{sfn|Lecocq|2005|p=49}} Slavery was formally outlawed in the country and some efforts were made to continue the French efforts to resettle ex-slave populations.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=147}} The US-RDA encouraged every slave in the country to leave their masters and many did.  However, many returned within a year or two as a result of limited economic opportunities provided for ex-slaves in the country.{{sfn|Seddon|2000|p=231}} Even these limited efforts were largely halted with the dictatorship of [[Moussa Traoré]] from 1968 until 1991.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=147}}

Although legally allowed to leave, economic and social issues have kept many people in situations that are defined as slavery.{{sfn|Hicks|2008}} In addition, even when freed, discrimination and political power is wielded over ex-slaves in many instances.{{sfn|de Bruijn|Pelckmans|2005|pp=70-71}} Democratization in the 1990s did not necessarily entail emancipation and there are examples of former masters pressuring and forcing ex-slaves to vote for the candidates they prefer; however, there have also been examples of resistance to this pressure.{{sfn|de Bruijn|Pelckmans|2005|p=88}}

Some people who were formerly slaves or whose parents or grandparents were have risen to political prominence in post-dictatorship Mali (including [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] who was the President of Mali from 2002 until 2012). The discussion of their slave origins is largely suppressed and kept as a public secret to avoid the stigma attached with that history.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=143}}

There are efforts by social movements to criminalize slavery and struggle against the stigma attached to ex-slaves.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=143}} News reports about youth from Mali being involved in forcible work conditions in neighboring countries caused the government to introduce migration restrictions on all teenage Malians.{{sfn|Dottridge|2005|p=703}}

In 2002, New York Times writer [[Michael Finkel]] was fired from his job for creating a composite fictional character in reports of a child slave in Mali.{{sfn|Snyder|2002}}

With the [[Tuareg Rebellion (2012)|Tuareg Rebellion of 2012]], the anti-slavery organization Temedt reported that the first people punished under the [[sharia]] system implemented were former slaves and some Tuareg families used the chaos to recapture slaves which had resisted in recent years.{{sfn|Tran|2012}}{{sfn|Norris|2012|p=4}}

===Temedt===
Temedt is a social movement which tries to end slavery throughout Mali and fight against negative stereotypes and discrimination against ex-slaves.  It develops out of two efforts in the 1990s and today has over 30,000 members.{{sfn|Tran|2012}}

In the 1990s, Ibrahim Ag Idbaltanant (the current President of Temedt) founded the Groupement des Artisans Ruraux d’Intadeyni (GARI) which organized around providing education and micro-credit for people of slave descent in Tuareg areas.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=143}} Similarly in 1994, Mohammed Ag Akeratane (the former President of Temedt) founded a movement known as Tazolt, a reference to the black paint that is sometimes added under the eyes of Tuareg people. These movements resulted in the creation of Temedt, meaning genealogy or solidarity, in 2006 in the city of [[Essakane]].{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=148}}

The organization brings together intellectuals with a slave lineage to publicly challenge the practice and stigma of slavery.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=148}} To protect themselves at their meetings, they invite government officials, other nongovernmental organizations, and Tuareg leaders to the events.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=148}}

Temedt is involved in public awareness campaigns, assisting legal challenges to slavery, and political pressure on the government to improve attention to the issue. The public awareness campaigns include parades and folklore presentations as well as other efforts to end discrimination against ex-slaves.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=143}} The organization also provides key lawyers to help with the prosecution of slave cases, and with assistance from the [[American Bar Association]], have provided key legal efforts on a number of cases.{{sfn|Norris|2012|p=27}}

One prominent case occurred in October 2011 when the first person in Mali was prosecuted on allegations of slavery for exploiting Iddar Ag Ogazide. Temedt pressured for the case and provided financial assistance to Ag Ogazide's family during the difficult period. After a first hearing in which the accused claimed that he had paid Ag Ogazide for his work, the trial was delayed when the judge had to flee [[Gao]] for his safety. With the [[Tuareg Rebellion (2012)|Tuareg Rebellion]] and the military coup, the case has been delayed further.{{sfn|Norris|2012|p=27}} The organization also pushes the government to further criminalize slavery and add additional sanctions against the practice and works with anti-slavery organizations in other countries and with [[Anti-Slavery International]] to coordinate efforts.{{sfn|Hahonou|Pelckmans|2011|p=143}}

In 2012, the organization received the yearly prize from Anti-Slavery International for their efforts against slavery.{{sfn|Tran|2012}}

[[Image:Socialist competition 1973 award.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"1973 socialist competition winner" award.]]

'''Socialist competition''' or '''socialist emulation''' (социалистическое соревнование, "sotsialisticheskoye sorevnovanie",  or "соцсоревнование", "sotssorevnovanie") was a form of competition between state enterprises and between individuals practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and in other [[Eastern bloc]] states. 

== Competition vs. emulation ==

The first variant is a literal translation of the Russian term, commonly used by Western authors. The second form is an official Soviet translation of the term, intended to put distance from the "capitalist [[competition]]", which in its turn was translated as "капиталистическая конкуренция", "kapitalisticheskaya konkurenciya". 

Implied was that "[[capitalism|capitalist]] competition" only profited those that won, while "socialist emulation" benefited all involved.

In Soviet practice, according to [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] and [[Mikhail Heller]], the competition between workers and industries was, however, not voluntary and much fiercer than the Western one. It was enforced by the collective pressure orchestrated by state security services ([[KGB]]) and local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] representatives using collective responsibility and laws on dronery or [[Wrecking (Soviet Union)|wrecking]]. The race between teams and team members for [[counterplan (Soviet planning)|overcompletion]] of the [[five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|plans]] led to increasingly unrealistic targets, which could be only satisfied with cheating, double accounting, hoarding of resources, and ''[[shturmovshchina]]'' (last-minute cramming)—which, in the long term, led to a collapse of the supply chain in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cogs in the Wheel: The Formation of Soviet Man|last = Heller|first = Mikhail|publisher = Alfred A.

In 1987,  Soviet economist Nikolai Shmelov estimated that out of 450 billion roubles worth of inventories of raw materials and parts, around 170 billion was kept as surplus, with the sole purpose of securing the successful completion of plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://echelon.pl/content/%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87-%D1%88%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%91%D0%B2-nikolay-shmelyov-%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8B-%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B8-avansy-i-dolgi-credits-and-debts-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2|title = Avansi i dolgi|last = Shmelov|first = Nikolai|date = 1987|journal = Novyi Mir|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 6|trans-title = Credits and debts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[File:socialist competition winner flag 10.jpg|250px|right|Socialist competition winner flag]]
Socialist emulation was nominally voluntary everywhere where people worked or served: in industry, in agriculture, in offices, institutions, schools, hospitals, army, etc. With the natural exception of the armed forces, committees of the [[Soviet trade unions|trade unions]] were in charge of managing the socialist emulation. 

An important component of socialist emulation was "'''socialist self-obligations'''" (социалистические обязательства). While the [[production plan]] was the major benchmark, employees and work collectives were supposed to put forth "socialist self-obligations" and even "enhanced socialist self-obligations" (повышенные соцобязательства) beyond the plan. 

Deadlines for tallying up the results of a socialist emulation were usually set at major Socialist and Communist holidays or notable dates, like the birthday of [[Vladimir Lenin]] or the anniversary of the [[October Revolution]].

Winners were awarded both materially and morally. Material awards were money, goods, or perks specific to Socialist systems, such as tickets to resorts, authorizations for a trip abroad, right to obtain a dwelling, or a car outside the main [[wikt:queue|queue]], etc. Moral awards were honorary diplomas, [[honorary badge]]s, and/or putting winners' portraits on the "Board of Honor" (Доска Почета); work collectives were awarded with the  "[[Transferrable Red Banner]] of the Socialist Emulation Winner" (Переходящее знамя победителя в социалистическом соревновании).

== History ==

Vladimir Lenin was the originator and promoter of the idea of socialist emulation as a means for organising "the majority of working people into a field of labour in which they can display their abilities, develop the capacities, and reveal those talents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marx2mao.com/Lenin/HOC17.html How to Organise Competition?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His milestone article was "How to organize the emulation?" ("Как организовать соревнование?"), in which among the important goal of the emulation was discovery of persons with organizational and management skills, to replace [[tsarist]]-era specialists. Also, he was the first to set "socialist emulation" against "capitalist competition".
Later, [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote in his streamlined style: 

:''Principles of (capitalist) competition: '''defeat''' and '''death''' of ones and victory and dominance of the others.''
:''Principles of socialist emulation: friendly assistance to lagging ones by the leading ones in order to achieve a common rise.'' ...etc.

While criteria of socialist emulation were easy to set, understand, and quantify in production areas, it was not so in non-production areas: medicine, education, work of clerks, etc., where significant formalism took place and among the criteria a significant weight was attributed to "social activism", not related to the work done.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The '''Statoil corruption case''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: Statoils Horton-sak)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Morten Ånestad|Ånestad, Morten]]|title=Falske fakturaer i fleng|newspaper=[[Dagens Næringsliv]]|date=2011-10-06|page=17|quote=Saken er den største saken siden Statoils Horton-sak}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refers to [[Norway|Norwegian]] oil company [[Statoil]]’s misconduct and extensive use of [[Political corruption|corruption]] in [[Iran]] in 2002/2003 in an attempt to secure lucrative [[oil contract]]s for the company in that country. This was mainly achieved by hiring the services of [[Horton Investments]], an Iranian consultancy firm owned by [[Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani]], son of former Iranian President [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]]. Horton Investments was paid US$15.2 million by Statoil to influence important political figures in Iran to grant oil contracts to Statoil. The corruption scandal was uncovered by Norwegian paper ''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]'' on September 3, 2003. Although this case became infamous in the western media and Statoil was found guilty by the Norwegian courts no verdict was reported by the Iranian side regarding Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani's bribery case.

==Verdict reached by the Norwegian court==

On June 29, 2004 Statoil was found guilty of corruption by the Norwegian courts and ordered to pay [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 20 million in fines. The Director for international operations [[Richard John Hubbard]] was also ordered to pay NOK 200,000 in fines for his involvement in the case. The uncovering of the corruption scandal also led to the resignation of Statoil Chairman [[Leif Terje Løddesøl]], Statoil CEO [[Olav Fjell]] and Director for international operations Richard John Hubbard. The charges against Olav Fjell were dropped owing to insufficient evidence. Statoil agreed to pay the fines, but insisted that this did not imply any admittance of guilt on its part.

==Verdict reached by the US court==

On October 13, 2006 Statoil reached a settlement with US authorities for its involvement in the case and was ordered by a US court to pay US$21 million in fines. As part of the settlement agreement, Statoil had to agree to the following counts:

1. Statoil agreed that it had paid bribes to an Iranian public servant in June 2002 and January 2003, with the aim of securing contracts for Statoil in the development of stage 6,7,8 of the [[South Pars gas field]] in Iran.

2. Statoil agreed that [[bribes]] were paid to secure other contracts in the country, and to get hold of confidential information.

3. Statoil agreed that it had used wrong accounting procedures in order to hide the bribes from its records.

The settlement also stipulated that no Statoil employee or representative for the company could make any statements to the media that contradicted the verdict for the next three years.

==Views on the verdicts==

Former Iranian ambassador to Norway, and defector, [[Perviz Khazai]], criticized Statoil strongly for its business methods in Iran. In a statement he said that,

''This smells to high heavens of corruption. And this incident can contribute to the tarnishing of Norway's reputation.''&lt;ref name="aftenposten"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alf Ole |last=Ask |title=Statoil's international director resigns |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article624131.ece |work=Aftenposten |date=2003-09-12 |accessdate=2007-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also went on record to say that the Rafsanjani family were known for their close links to corruption.

[[Jan Borgen]] of [[Transparency International|Transparency International Norway]] was also highly critical of Statoil's conduct in Iran. When asked to make a comment on the case by Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, he said,

''It is true that you can hardly get into these countries without using agents or advisers. But here, like anywhere else, you should know your agents. It is always dangerous to get involved with a consultant who has close contacts to the political elite.''."&lt;ref name="aftenposten"/&gt;

[[Helge Lund]], who succeeded Olav Fjell as CEO of Statoil, has also publicly admitted that the corruption scandal tarnished Statoil and Norway's reputation abroad.

The '''Taron''' or '''Trone''' (တရုမ်း, ta. rum:) are a small ethnic group in the Himalayan foothills of northern [[Kachin State|Kachin]], [[Myanmar]], whose population is declining to the point where they are in danger of disappearing entirely. They have been referred to as the "Asian pygmies". They are allegedly descended from an ethnic group concentrated in China known as [[Derung people|Derung]] who migrated to Burma from Tibet in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="myanmarburma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmarburma.com/blog/591/the-uncertain-fate-of-myanmars-little-people|title=The Uncertain Fate of Myanmar's Little People|publisher=myanmarburma.com|date=22 March 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]] of Central Africa and the [[Negritos]] of [[Southeast Asia]], the Tarons are very small, averaging less than 129.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4 feet and 3 inches).

==Evolutionary history==
The Tarons have received their name from their original homeland, the headwaters of the [[Taron River]]. Leaving their original homeland around 200 years ago, the Tarons moved into [[Burma]] territory through the Thalalarkha mountain pass. 
They settled in [[Kachin State]], in the lower Adunlaung River valley in the Naung Mun Township of [[Putao District]]. The landscape is dense forests and difficult terrain, with torrential streams and snow-clad mountains that are home to rare wild animals such as the [[blue sheep]] and the [[leaf deer]].

In the 1960s, a Burmese research expedition found over 50 pure-blood pygmies, and although cases of [[cretinism]], mental retardation, [[goiter]], and other physical and mental ailments were noted, they felt as though the community would sustain itself.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A 1997 field trip commissioned by the [[Kachin State]] Peace and Development Council revealed that only eight individuals of pure Taron stock remained. It makes the Taron one of the most highly endangered human populations in the world today.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Alan Rabinowitz]] visited their village to learn about the Taron pygmies in the late 1990s,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and discovered the fate of the tribe. Dawi, age 39, the youngest remaining Taron pure-blood, explained that Taron babies were being born with increasingly severe birth defects, without any known cause. The Taron elders decided that rather than risk any more misshapen children, their race would go extinct. As a child, Dawi's father demanded that he would not marry or have children.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Rabinowitz's visit was followed by anthropologist P. Christiaan Klieger of the California Academy of Sciences in 2003.  Then, Dawi announced he would travel to Tibet or Yunnan in order to search for a wife, since many Taron/Dulong people lived there.&lt;ref name="canyons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canyonsworldwide.com/tibet/dawiNewsletter/html/search_for_the_dawi.html|title=The search for 'Dawi'|publisher=canyonsworldwide.com|accessdate=12 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908131226/http://canyonsworldwide.com/tibet/dawiNewsletter/html/search_for_the_dawi.html#|archive-date=2013-09-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible link with the Derung people==
It has been proposed by [[Richard D. Fisher]] that the Taron people are descended from the [[Derung people]] who are based in the [[Dulong Valley]] in [[Yunnan]], China. There are currently approximately 5,000 ethnic Derung people living in six designated villages within the valley.&lt;ref name="canyons"/&gt; This is based on Klieger's work.  Derung is simply a Chinese term for Taron or T'rung.

Genetic similarities between the two ethnic groups have been observed, and it has been purported that all the Taron people were derived from three Derung people who migrated from Tibet to Myanmar in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="myanmarburma"/&gt;

'''Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus''' ([[Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;TI·SEMPRONIVS·TI·F·P·N·GRACCVS&lt;/small&gt;; born c. 169–164 – 133 BC)&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/240427/Tiberius-Sempronius-Gracchus|title=Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/gracchus.html Life of Caius Gracchus by Plutarch]: Plutarch says Tiberius "was not yet thirty when he was slain."&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Populares|populist]] and reformist politician of the 2nd century BC. He was a son of [[Tiberius Gracchus the Elder]] and [[Cornelia Africana]]. As a [[Tribune of the Plebs|plebeian tribune]], Tiberius Gracchus caused political turmoil in the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] with his reforms of [[agrarian law|agrarian legislation]] that sought to transfer land from wealthy, predominantly [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] landowners to poorer citizens. He was murdered, along with many of his supporters, by members of the [[Roman Senate]] and supporters of the conservative ''[[Optimate]]'' faction. A decade later, his younger brother, [[Gaius Gracchus]], attempted similar legislation, and suffered a similar fate.

==Background==
Tiberius was born between 169 and 164 BC (his birth-date cannot be confirmed);

His family, the Gracchi branch of the [[gens Sempronia]], was one of the most politically connected in Rome. Tiberius' maternal grandparents were [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]] and [[Aemilia Paulla]], [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus]]' sister, and his own sister Sempronia was the wife of [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus]], another important general and politician. Tiberius was raised by his mother, with his sister and his brother [[Gaius Gracchus]]. Later he married Claudia Pulchra, daughter of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 143 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]].

==Military career==
Tiberius' military career started in the [[Third Punic War]], as [[military tribune]] appointed to the staff of his [[brother in law]], Scipio Aemilianus. During his tenure as military tribune under Aemilianus, Tiberius became known for his bravery and discipline, recorded as the first to scale the enemy walls.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 4,&lt;/ref&gt; In 137 BC he was appointed [[quaestor]] to consul [[Gaius Hostilius Mancinus]] and served his term in [[Numantia]] (Hispania [[Roman province|province]]). The campaign was part of the [[Numantine War]] and was unsuccessful; Mancinus's army suffered major defeats and Mancinus himself had tried disgracefully to withdraw at night and caused his rearguard to be cut to pieces and the Roman camp looted.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Books, p. 673&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberius, as quaestor, saved the army from destruction by signing a [[peace treaty]] with the Numantines, an action generally reserved for a [[Legatus|Legate]].&lt;ref name ="page674"&gt;The Great Books, p. 674&lt;/ref&gt;  In the negotiations, Tiberius recalled the exploits of his father Tiberius, who had also waged war in Spain but had struck a peace agreement with the Numantines.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 5"&gt;Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Numantines so respected Tiberius that when they learned he had lost his ledgers when they had despoiled the Roman camp, they invited him back to their city, offering him a banquet and allowing Tiberius to take back not only his ledgers but anything else he wanted from the spoils. Tiberius, however, refused to take anything else save some incense used for sacrificial rituals.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 5"/&gt;

Tiberius' actions stirred up a frenzy in Rome; his opponents argued that Tiberius' negotiation made Rome appear weak and the losers of the war, while his proponents maintained that the general Mancinus  was several times defeated and had tried to ignobly retreat and Tiberius' actions saved the lives of many citizen-soldiers.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 7"&gt;Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The people voted to have Mancinus sent back to the Numantines in chains, a proposition Mancinus himself accepted, though later the Numantines refused to accept him as a prisoner. Scipio Aemilianus played a significant role in supporting Tiberius and his officers, but failed to prevent further punishment meted out to Mancinus nor did he support the ratification of Tiberius' treaty.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 7"/&gt; Despite this, Plutarch mentions that this caused little friction between the two men, and even posits that Tiberius would have never fallen victim to assassination had Scipio not been away campaigning against the very same Numantines given the amount of political clout that Scipio wielded in Rome.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Ti. Gracch. 7"/&gt;

==Political career==
Rome's internal political situation was not peaceful. In the last hundred years, there had been several wars. Since [[legionary|legionaries]] were required to serve in a complete campaign, no matter how long it was, soldiers often left their farms in the hands of wives and children. Small farms in this situation often went bankrupt and were bought up by the wealthy [[upper class]], forming huge private estates.&lt;ref name ="page674"/&gt;

Furthermore, some lands ended up being taken by the state in war, both in Italy and elsewhere. After the war was over, much of this conquered land would then be sold to or rented to various members of the populace. Much of this land was given to only a few farmers who then had large amounts of land that were more profitable than the smaller farms. The farmers with large farms had their land worked by slaves and did not do the work themselves, unlike landowners with smaller farms.&lt;ref name ="page674"/&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], "when Tiberius on his way to Numantia passed through Etruria and found the country almost depopulated and its husbandmen and shepherds imported barbarian slaves, he first conceived the policy which was to be the source of countless ills to himself and to his brother."&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Tiberius_Gracchus*.html|title=Plutarch • Life of Tiberius Gracchus|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the soldiers returned from the [[Roman legion|legions]], they had nowhere to go, so they went to Rome to join the thousands of unemployed who roamed the city. As only men who owned property were allowed to enroll in the army, the number of men eligible for army duty was therefore shrinking; and hence the [[Armed forces|military power]] of Rome.  Plutarch noted, "Then the poor, who had been ejected from their land, no longer showed themselves eager for military service, and neglected the bringing up of children, so that soon all Italy was conscious of a dearth of freemen, and was filled with gangs of foreign slaves, by whose aid the rich cultivated their estates, from which they had driven away the free citizens."&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

In 133 BC Tiberius was elected [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribune of the people]]. Soon he started to legislate on the matter of the homeless legionaries. Speaking before a crowd at the Rostra, Tiberius said, "The wild beasts that roam over Italy have their dens, each has a place of repose and refuge. But the men who fight and die for Italy enjoy nothing but the air and light; without house or home they wander about with their wives and children."&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

==Lex Sempronia Agraria==
[[File:Comic History of Rome p 238 Tib Gracchus canvassing.jpg|thumb|left|Tiberius Gracchus [[canvassing]].

The [[top hat]] worn by Gracchus is a deliberate [[anachronism]] intended to compare him to 19th Century British politicians.]]

Seeking to improve the lot of the poor, Tiberius Gracchus proposed a law known as the Lex Sempronia Agraria. The law would reorganize control of the [[ager publicus]], or [[public land]], meaning land conquered in previous wars that was controlled by the state. Previous agrarian law specified that no citizen would be allowed to possess more than 500 [[jugerum|jugera]] (that is, approximately 125 [[hectare]]s) of the ager publicus and any land that they occupied above this limit would be confiscated by the state. However, this law was largely ignored&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Ancient History vol.9, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; and rich landowners continued to acquire land through fictitious tenants initially before transferring the land directly to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; They then began to work it with slave labour, giving rise to [[latifundia]], alienating and impoverishing free Roman citizens.

The 500 jugera limit was a reiteration of previous land laws, such as the [[Lex Licinia Sextia|Licinian Laws]] passed in 367 BC, which had been enacted but never enforced. As it stood in Tiberius Gracchus's time, a good deal of this land was held in farms far in excess of 500 iugera by large landholders who had settled or rented the property in much earlier time periods, even several generations back. Sometimes it had been leased, rented, or resold to other holders after the initial sale or rental.

Tiberius saw that reform was needed. He met with three prominent leaders: Crassus, the [[Pontifex Maximus]], the consul and jurist [[Publius Mucius Scaevola]], and [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 143 BC)|Appius Claudius]], his father-in-law. Together, the men formulated a law which would have fined those who held more than their allotted land and would require them to forfeit illegal possessions to the ager publicus, for which they would be compensated. The people simply wanted assurances of future protection, but the senatorial elites opposed the law, claiming Tiberius was seeking a redistribution of wealth, thereby shaking the foundations of the Republic and inciting social revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposed his law in 134 BC, and to mollify these landowners, they would be allowed to own their land rent-free, and would be entitled to 250 jugera per son above the legal limit.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Books, p. 675&lt;/ref&gt;  They would also be paid for the land they had to forfeit.&lt;ref&gt;Swords Against the Senate, p. 38 Erik Hildinger&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Tiberius Gracchus called for the redistribution of the re-confiscated public land to the poor and homeless in Rome, giving them plots of 30 iugera upon which to support themselves and their families, not to mention that the redistributed wealth would make them eligible for taxation and military service. Thus the law sought to solve the twin problems of increasing the number of men eligible for military service (thereby boosting Rome's [[Military|military strength]]) and also providing for homeless war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Books, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate and its conservative elements were strongly against the Sempronian agrarian reforms, with most of their hostility due to Tiberius’ highly unorthodox method of passing the reforms. Because Tiberius clearly knew the Senate wouldn’t approve his reforms, he sidestepped the Senate altogether by going straight to the [[Concilium Plebis]] (the Plebeian Assembly) which supported his measures. This measure, together with the unprecedented removal of the Tribune Marcus Octavius, who had vetoed the measure, insulted the Senate and alienated Senators who otherwise might have shown support.

However, any tribune could [[veto]] a proposal, preventing it from being laid before the Assembly. In an effort to stop Tiberius, the Senate persuaded [[Marcus Octavius]], another tribune, to use his veto to prevent the submission of the bills to the Assembly. Gracchus then moved that Octavius should be immediately deposed, arguing that Octavius as a tribune acted contrary to the wishes of his constituents. Octavius, Tiberius reasoned, violated a basic tenet of the office of the tribune, which was to ensure the protection of the people from any political or economic oppression by the Senate. Octavius remained resolute. The people began to vote to depose Octavius, but he vetoed their actions as was his legal right as tribune. Tiberius, consigning himself to the worst situation, had him forcibly removed from the meeting place of the Assembly and proceeded with the vote to depose him.&lt;ref name="The Great Books, p. 677"&gt;The Great Books, p. 677&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions violated Octavius' right of sacrosanctity and worried Tiberius' supporters, and so instead of moving to depose him, Tiberius commenced to use his veto on daily ceremonial rites in which Tribunes were asked if they would allow for key public buildings, for example the markets and the temples, to be opened. In this way he effectively shut down the entire [[Rome|city of Rome]], including all businesses, trade and production, until the Senate and the Assembly passed the laws. The Assembly, fearing for Tiberius's safety, formed a guard around Tiberius and frequently escorted him home.&lt;ref name="The Great Books, p. 677"/&gt;

Tiberius justified the expulsion of Octavius by stating that a tribune was
&lt;blockquote&gt;
sacred and inviolable, because he was consecrated to the people and was a champion of the people... If, then he should change about, wrong the people, maim its power, and rob it of the privilege of voting, he has by his own acts deprived himself of his honourable office by not fulfilling the conditions on which he received it; for otherwise there would be no interference with a tribune even though he should try to demolish the Capitol or set fire to the naval arsenal. If a tribune does these things, he is a bad tribune; but if he annuls the power of the people, he is no tribune at all... And surely, if it is right for him to be made tribune by a majority of the votes of the tribes, it must be even more right for him to be deprived of his tribuneship by a unanimous vote.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Appian presents a slightly different version of events. Tiberius Gracchus only moved to have Marcus Octavius removed from office after a vote was put to the Assembly. In Appian's version, after 17 of the 35 tribes voted in favor of Tiberius, Tiberius implored Octavius to step aside lest he be deprived of his office. When Octavius refused, the 18th tribe voted in favor of Tiberius, giving him the majority and the resolution, which included both his land law and the abrogation of Octavius' office. It was only after this, according to Appian, that Octavius slinked away unnoticed and was replaced as tribune by Quintus Memmius.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', 1.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; This version effectively mitigates the accusation that Tiberius ever laid hands on an inviolate person such as Octavius, instead showing that Tiberius won his support with full legality.

Having passed his law, Tiberius was lauded as a founding hero not just of a single city or race, but as the founding hero of all the Italians, who had come to endure immense poverty and deprivation, denied of their rightful land because of their military service and having lost work because of the influx of slaves, who were loyal to no man while citizens were loyal to the state. In Appian's account, Tiberius Gracchus is seen as a popular hero, and there is no account given of Tiberius' justification for deposing Octavius.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Senate gave trivial funds to the agrarian commission that had been appointed to execute Tiberius' laws. This commission was composed entirely of members of Tiberius' family, including Appius Claudius, his father-in-law, Tiberius and his brother Gaius. This, of course, did little to soothe the bitterness between the Gracchi and the Senate, and the Senate and conservatives took every opportunity to hamper, delay and slander Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch 13&lt;/ref&gt;  However, late in 133 BC, king [[Attalus III]] of [[Pergamum]] died and left his entire fortune (including the whole kingdom of Pergamum) to Rome. Tiberius saw his chance and immediately used his tribunician powers to allocate the fortune to fund the new law. This was a direct attack on Senatorial power, since the Senate was traditionally responsible for the management of the treasury and for decisions regarding overseas affairs. The opposition of the Senate to Tiberius Gracchus' policies increased. [[Quintus Pompeius#Opponent of Tiberius Gracchus|Quintus Pompeius]] addressed the Senate and said that he "was a neighbour of Tiberius, and therefore knew that Eudemus of Pergamum had presented Tiberius with a royal diadem and a purple robe, believing that he was going to be king in Rome."&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt;  Pompeius's fears were reflective of a growing number of senators who were afraid that Tiberius was claiming too much power for himself.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Books, p. 679&lt;/ref&gt; They feared that Tiberius was seeking to become King of Rome, a loathed office which had been dismantled with the ousting of the [[Tarquins]] and the establishment of the Republic. Such fears tipped the Senate from hatred and paranoia into committing the first outright bloodshed in Republican politics.

==Death==
Tiberius Gracchus' overruling of the tribunician veto was considered illegal, and his opponents were determined to prosecute him at the end of his one-year term, since he was regarded as having violated the constitution and having used force against a tribune. In one standoff between Tiberius and Titus Annius, a renowned orator, Annius argued that if a colleague of Tiberius stood to defend him and Tiberius disapproved, he would simply in a passion physically remove the man. Tiberius realized that his actions against Octavius had won him ill repute among the Senate and even among the People.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib, Gracch. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of a friend of Tiberius, rumors circulated that the man had been poisoned. Seizing the opportunity to win sympathy with the People, Tiberius dressed in mourning clothes and paraded his children in front of the Assembly, pleading for the protection of him and his kin.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to repair the perception of his error against Octavius by arguing that the office of the tribune, a sacrosanct position, could be acted upon if the holder violated his oath. To support this he posited that other sacrosanct office holders were seized when they violated their duties, such as Vestal Virgins or the Roman kings, done so the state would benefit from their removal.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 15&lt;/ref&gt; To protect himself further, Tiberius Gracchus stood for re-election to the tribunate for 132 BC, promising to shorten the term of military service, abolish the exclusive right of senators to act as jurors and include other social classes, and admit allies to [[Roman citizenship]], all moves popular with the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. Mommsen]], ''The History of Rome'', (Meridian Books, 1958), ch. I., p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius continued to plead with the People, lamenting that he feared for his safety and that of his family, and moved them so much that many camped outside his house to ensure his protection.

When the People assembled on the Capitol, Tiberius set out, despite many inauspicious omens. While the tribes were being assembled, a skirmish broke out on the outskirts of the crowd as Tiberius' supporters were attempting to block a group of his opponents from entering into the area to mingle about. A sympathetic senator, Fulvius Flaccus, was able to make his way to Tiberius to warn him that the Senate was seated and plotting to kill him, having armed slaves and their men since they could not convince the consul to do the deed.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius' men then armed themselves with clubs and staves, prepared to meet any violence in kind. Tiberius, trying to shout above the din, gestured to his head to signal his life was in danger, but his opponents took this as a sign requesting for a crown and ran back to the Senate to report the signal.

When the Senate heard this, outrage spread among them. Tiberius' cousin, [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio|Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica]], the newly elected Pontifex Maximus, saying that Tiberius wished to make himself king, demanded that the consul take action. When he refused, Nasica girded his toga over his head, shouting "Now that the consul has betrayed the state, let every man who wishes to uphold the laws follow me!" and led the senators up towards Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting confrontation, Tiberius was beaten to death with clubs and staves made from benches which lay strewn about. His fellow tribune, Publius Satyreius, dealt the first blow to his head. More than 300 supporters, including Tiberius, were slain by stones and staves, but none by sword, and their bodies thrown into the [[Tiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]|year=2006|page=26|isbn=0-300-12048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an act denied them a proper funeral. This, according to Plutarch, was the first outbreak of civil strife in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch - Life of Tiberius 20.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the massacre, many of Tiberius' supporters were sent into exile without a trial, while others were arrested and executed, including being sewn up in a bag with poisonous vipers.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate attempted to mollify the People by allowing the agrarian law to go into effect and a vote to replace Tiberius on the commission; the job fell to Publius Crassus, father-in-law of Tiberius' brother Gaius. When threatened with impeachment, Nasica was reassigned to Asia to remove him from the city. The People made no attempt to conceal their hatred of him, accosting him publicly, cursing him and calling him a tyrant. Nasica wandered, despised and outcast, until he died shortly later near Pergamum.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Even Scipio Africanus the Younger, who had formerly enjoyed the love of the People, incurred their wrath when he said he disapproved of Tiberius' politics, and was thereafter frequently interrupted when giving speeches, causing him to only lash out more at them.

Later, following the murder of his brother, statues of both were placed throughout the city in prominent locations, where they were worshiped as heroes of the People, sometimes even being sacrificed to as if they were gods.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Senate sought to placate the plebeians by consenting to the enforcement of the Gracchan laws. An increase in the register of citizens in the next decade suggests a large number of land allotments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scullard|first=H. H.|title=From the Gracchi to Nero|year=1982|publisher=Taylor Francis|location=U.K.|isbn=0415025273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the agrarian commission found itself faced with many difficulties and obstacles.

Tiberius' heir was his younger brother [[Gaius Gracchus|Gaius]], who shared Tiberius' fate a decade later, while trying to apply even more revolutionary legislation.

==Gracchus Babeuf==

The French revolutionary [[François-Noël Babeuf]] took up the name "[[Gracchus Babeuf]]" in conscious emulation of the Roman brothers, and published a newspaper, ''Le tribun du peuple'' ("the tribune of the people"). Ultimately he, like them, met a violent end.

'''Timoto–Cuica people''' were an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous group]] composed primarily of two tribes, the '''Timote''' and the '''Cuica''', that inhabited in the [[Andes|Andean]] region of western [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=mahoney&gt;Mahoney 89&lt;/ref&gt; They were closely related to the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] of the [[Andes]], who spoke [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]], a version of [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]. The Timoto-Cuicas were not only composed of the Timoto and the Cuica tribes, but also the Mucuchíes, the Migures, the Tabayes, and the Mucuñuques.

== Culture and society ==
[[File:Campo de Mérida.JPG|thumb|left|Timoto-Cuica territory, in present-day [[Mérida State|Mérida, Venezuela]].]]
[[Pre-Columbian]] Venezuela had an estimated indigenous population of one million,&lt;ref name=mahoney/&gt; with the Andean region being the most densely populated area. The two tribes lived in what are today the states of [[Mérida State|Mérida]], [[Trujillo State|Trujillo]], and [[Táchira State|Táchira]].

Timoto-Cuica society was complex with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. They also stored water in tanks.&lt;ref name=mahoney/&gt; Their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful, for the most part, and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and [[ulluco]]s.&lt;ref name=art&gt;[http://en.amigosprecolombino.es/cultures/central-america-and-intermedia/venezuela Venezuela] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904200841/http://en.amigosprecolombino.es/cultures/central-america-and-intermedia/venezuela |date=2011-09-04 }} ''Friends of the Pre-Columbian Art Museum.'' (retrieved 9 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

They left behind works of art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the [[arepa]], a staple in [[Venezuelan cuisine|Venezuelan]] and [[Colombian cuisine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1738">'''Transitional housing''' provides temporary housing for the certain segments of the [[homeless]] population, including working homeless making insufficient wages who have trouble affording long-term housing, and is set up to transition their residents into permanent, affordable housing. It is not in an emergency homeless shelter but usually a room or apartment in a residence with support services.

==Description==
The transitional time can be short, for example one or two years, and in that time the person must file for and get permanent housing and usually some gainful employment or income, even if Social Security or assistance. Sometimes, the transitional housing residence program charges a room and board fee, maybe 30% of an individual's income, which is sometimes partially or fully refunded after the person procures a permanent place to live in. In the USA, federal funding for transitional housing programs was originally allocated in the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Martha R.,

A '''turn construction unit''' (TCU) is the fundamental segment of speech in a conversation, as analyzed in [[conversation analysis]].

The idea was introduced in (Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson 1974) and is meant to describe pieces of conversation which may comprise an entire turn. The end of a TCU, called a ''transition relevance place'' (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.

== Turn Construction Unit (TCU) ==
A '''Turn Construction Unit (TCU)''' is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act.

=== Types of TCU ===

There are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance:

1. '''Lexical TCU''': e.g. "Yes", "There"&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Phrasal TCU''': e.g. "In the basket", "out of here"&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Clausal TCU''': e.g. "When I am free", "If I got the job"&lt;br /&gt;
4. '''Sentential TCU''': e.g. "I am working on my thesis", "He has got my car"

=== Criteria for Turn Construction Unit ===
A general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU:&lt;br /&gt;
1. '''Intonationally Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance.&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Grammatically Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure.&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Pragmatically Complete''': This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance "She is really" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, "That girl is really pretty!", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment.

Scholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.

== Transition Relevance Place (TRP)==
'''Transition Relevance Place''' (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.

'''Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic''', including residents and citizens, form the largest immigrant community in the country, as well as the third largest ethnic minority overall (after [[Slovaks]] and [[Ukrainians]]), numbering more than 83,000 people according to 2011 census. 

It is the third largest [[Vietnamese diaspora]] in Europe, after [[Vietnamese people in France|France]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Germany]], and one of the most populous Vietnamese diasporas of the world.

According to the 2001 census, there were 17,462 ethnic [[Vietnam]]ese in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/euromosaic/cz5_en.html#8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405180432/http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/euromosaic/cz5_en.html#8|archivedate=2008-04-05|title=Other languages in the Czech Republic|work=The Euromosaic Study|publisher=European Commission|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese population has grown very rapidly since then, with the Czech Statistics Office estimating that there were 61,012 Vietnamese residing in the [[Czech Republic]] in October 2009.&lt;ref name="statsoffice-09"/&gt; Nguyen, the most common Vietnamese surname, is now the 9th most common surname in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/nguyen-je-devatym-nejcastejsim-prijmenim-v-cesku-porazi-i-prochazky-1ik-/domaci.aspx?c=A110608_131133_domaci_jj |title=Nguyen je devátým nejčastějším příjmením v Česku, poráží i Procházky |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese immigrants began settling in Czechoslovakia during the Communist period, when they were invited as [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] by the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government. Migration was encouraged by the Vietnamese authorities, with the intention that the migrants would return with skills and training.&lt;ref name="oconnor"&gt;{{cite news|first=Coilin|last=O'Connor|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/91826|title=Is the Czech Republic's Vietnamese community finally starting to feel at home?|work=Czech Radio|date=29 May 2007|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|reason=the citation used is totally unrelated. Please do not roll back without adding a proper citation|date=November 2015}}

Following the collapse of communism in Czechoslovakia, many Vietnamese decided to remain in the country rather than return home. This first generation of immigrants has traditionally made a living as vendors in street markets or stalls. In recent years, however, a significant number have moved towards establishing their own businesses and integrating more broadly into society, similar to the experience of other [[overseas Vietnamese]] in Western countries. However, the small business sector remains the key economic domain of first-generation Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="Provokator"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.provokator.org/articles/still-thorn-eye-vietnamese-czech-dialog|title=Still a Thorn in the Eye: The Vietnamese-Czech dialog|journal=Provokator Magazine|first=Martina|last=Čermáková|date=4 April 2007|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese immigration continued in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), with Vietnam being one of the countries targeted by the Czech Republic's skilled migration programme.

==Geography==
The majority of Vietnamese (over 10,000 people as of 2011) live in [[Prague]], and 2% of the population of [[Karlovy Vary Region]] have Vietnamese citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_8_2_population_by_citizenship_and_by_regions/$File/PVCR082_ENG.pdf 2011 Czech census results by citizenship] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224955/http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_8_2_population_by_citizenship_and_by_regions/$File/PVCR082_ENG.pdf |date=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the border town of [[Cheb]] being a main centre for Vietnamese people. Also the northernmost part of Bohemia – around the town [[Varnsdorf]] – has a significant Vietnamese population.

==Status==
&lt;!-- citizenship --&gt;
In the Czech Republic, national minorities are afforded classic national minority rights, including government funding for the protection of their language and culture. In recent years, the Vietnamese community has sought recognition as a national minority. In 2004, however, the Government Council for National Minorities, the advisory body of the Czech Government on the issues of national minorities, concluded that the Vietnamese do not constitute a "national minority", as this term only applies to indigenous minorities who have inhabited the Czech territory for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="prague-policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praha-mesto.cz/(thqmni55wvwoc2e2w0h2rk45)/default.aspx?id=67308&amp;ido=6383&amp;sh=-888388072|title=The City of Prague's National Minority Policy|publisher=Prague City Hall|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually in 2013, a representative of the Vietnamese was accepted as a member of the Government Council for National Minorities, which in the absence of precise legal criteria, has been understood as an official recognition of the Vietnamese ethnic minority as a national minority by both authorities and the public.&lt;ref name="Status 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1132158?journalCode=cjms20|first=Marián|last=Sloboda|date=2016|title=Historicity and citizenship as conditions for national minority rights in Central Europe: old principles in a new migration context|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|volume=42|issue=11|pages=1808–1824|accessdate=2017-08-23|doi=10.1080/1369183x.2015.1132158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Status 2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.brill.com/products/reference-work/european-yearbook-minority-issues-volume-2013|first1=Kyril|last1=Kascian|first2=Hanna|last2=Vasilevich|date=2013|title=Czech Republic Acknowledgement of Belarusian and Vietnamese as New Minorities |journal=European Yearbook of Minority Issues|volume=12|pages=353-371|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Prague, which has the largest community of Vietnamese, a Vietnamese representative had been a member of the city's National Minority Council and Vietnamese had been included in Prague's policy for national minorities before this happened at the national level.&lt;ref name="prague-policy" /&gt;

==Criminal activities==
In some regions, such as Northern Bohemia, Vietnamese lead the statistics of crimes committed by foreigners, being second only to Slovaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://litomericky.denik.cz/zlociny-a-soudy/kriminalita-u-cizincu-20111007.html |title=Kriminalita u cizinců: Vedou stále lidé ze Slovenska a z Vietnamu |last=Roček |first=František |date=7 October 2011 |work=Deník|location=Czech Republic|language=Czech |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drugs related crimes, Vietnamese are the most common foreigner group.&lt;ref name="tyden" /&gt; Also, 60% of [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech Police]] drug crime detectives, that generally suffer from lack of personnel, are focused on the Vietnamese drug crime, leaving them short when it comes to investigation of other ethnic criminal groups, such as Turkish gangs specialized in heroin.&lt;ref name="60p"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/protidrogovych-detektivu-je-malo-vetsina-bojuje-s-gangy-viet/r~bd41842ab9f211e584160025900fea04/ |title=Protidrogových detektivů je málo.

Vietnamese criminal gangs in the Czech Republic usually have a three-level structure. The kingpin is usually a well-established man, who came to the country as a student in 1980s. The second level consists of his close friends from studies or family members, while the third level comprises "soldiers", who are often in the country illegally and are fully dependent on the criminal organization.&lt;ref name="policista"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aplikace.mvcr.cz/archiv2008/2003/casopisy/pol/0411/nemec_info.html |title=Organizační struktura vietnamských zločineckých gangů působících v České republice a hlavní druhy jimi páchané kriminality |last=Němec |first=Miroslav |date= June 2008 |work=Policista|location=Czech Republic|language=Czech |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Criminal activities of Vietnamese gangs in the country consist mainly of tax evasion, infringement of intellectual property rights, smuggling and frauds, but include also racketeering, robbery and murders.&lt;ref name="policista" /&gt;

Dramatic rise in metamphetamine use in the neighboring [[Bavaria]] and [[Sachsen]] led in 2013 to German pressure for change of Czech drug laws, under which for example possession of up two grams of metamphetamine or up to fifteen grams of mariujana are not a criminal offense.&lt;ref name="rozhlas"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/evropa/_zprava/v-nemecku-se-dramaticky-zvysil-pocet-konzumentu-ceskeho-pervitinu--1204452 |title=V Německu se dramaticky zvýšil počet konzumentů českého pervitinu  |last=Stejskalová |first=Klára |date=25 April 2013 |work=Rozhlas|location=Czech Republic|language=Czech |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German authorities, the high legal threshold allows easy purchase for German drug users. However, Czech addiction experts refused lowering of the threshold, saying, that this would merely lead to criminalization of addicts and would not solve the issue.&lt;ref name="aktualneApr28"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/zahranici/evropa/clanek.phtml?id=777966 |title=Vnitro chce nové nařízení o pervitinu, gramy zůstanou  |last=Kleknerová |first=Zuzana |date=26 April 2013 |work=aktualne.cz|location=Czech Republic|language=Czech |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Czech authorities intensified international cooperation and investigation.&lt;ref name="aktualneApr28" /&gt;

In April 2013, the Czech Republic and Vietnam announced a new bilateral treaty, under which [[Vietnam People's Public Security|policemen from Vietnam]] were to join [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech teams]] fighting Vietnamese drug mafia, while convicted Vietnamese were to be repatriated to the home country and serve their sentences there.&lt;ref name="idnesApr28"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vietnamsti-policiste-v-cesku-kvuli-drogam-fjp-/krimi.aspx?c=A130425_1921316_vary-zpravy_ba |title=Vietnam pošle do Česka své policisty kvůli dealerům drog v pohraničí|last=Houdek |first=Michal |date=25 April 2013 |work=idnes.cz|location=Czech Republic|language=Czech |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walloons''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ɑː|ˈ|l|uː|n|z}}; {{lang-fr|Wallons}}, {{IPA-fr|walɔ̃|IPA}}; {{lang-wa|Walons}}) are a [[Italic peoples|Romance]]&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |author-link= |title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC |date=2000 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |page=776 |isbn=0313309841 |quote=Romance (Latin) nations...}}&lt;/ref&gt; ethnic people native to [[Belgium]], principally its southern region of [[Wallonia]], who speak [[French language|French]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. Walloons are a distinctive ethnic community within Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Groups Worldwide,'' a ready reference Handbook, David Levinson, ORYX Press, ({{ISBN|1-57356-019-7}}), p. 13 : « Walloons are identified through their residence in Wallonia and by speaking dialects of French. They, too, are descended from the original Celtic inhabitants of the region and Romans and Franks who arrived later. Walloons are mainly Roman Catholic. »&lt;/ref&gt;  Important historical and anthropological criteria (religion, language, traditions, folklore) bind Walloons to the [[French people]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Groups Worldwide, a ready reference Handbook'', David Levinson, ORYX Press, {{ISBN|1-57356-019-7}}, p.13 : "Walloon culture was heavely influenced by the French"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Peoples of the World,'' A Henri Holt Reference Book, page 645 : « Culturally there is continuity between the French and the Walloons, Wallon culture consisting mainly of dialect literary productions. While historically most Wallons came within France's cultural orbit&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the term is also extended to refer to the inhabitants of the Walloon region in general, regardless of ethnicity or descent. Besides French and Walloon, a minority of Walloons also speak various regional [[Romance languages]] and dialects such as [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]]. Walloons are described as being descendants of [[Gallo-Romans]] with Germanic [[Franks|Frankish]] admixture, in this regard similar to the [[French people|French]].

==Etymology==
The term ''Walloon'' is derived from ''*[[walha]]'', a Proto-Germanic term used to refer to [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Latin]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien]], ''English and Welsh'', in ''Angles and Britons: O'Donnell Lectures'', University of Cardiff Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Walloon'' originated in [[Romance languages]] alongside other related terms, but it supplanted them.  Its oldest written trace is found in Jean de Haynin's ''Mémoires de Jean, sire de Haynin et de Louvignies'' in 1465,{{disputed inline|date=June 2016}} where it refers to Roman populations of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. Its meaning narrowed yet again during the French and Dutch periods and, at Belgian independence, the term designated only Belgians speaking a Romance language (French, Walloon, [[Picard language|Picard]], etc.) The linguistic cleavage in the politics of Belgium adds a political content to "the emotional cultural, and linguistic concept".&lt;ref&gt;French: ''Au concept sentimental, linguistique et culturel s'est ajouté peu à peu, par la suite de l'évolution intérieure en Belgique, depuis 1880 surtout, un contenu politique'' Albert Henry, ''Histoire des mots Wallons et Wallonie'', Institut Jules Destrée, Coll. «Notre histoire», Mont-sur-Marchienne, 1990, 3rd ed. (1st ed. 1965), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''Walloon'' and ''Wallons'' can be seen in the book of Charles White, ''The Belgic Revolution'' (1835): "The restless Wallons, with that adventurous daring which is their historical characteristic, abandoned their occupations, and eagerly seizing the pike and the musket marched towards the centre of the commotion.".&lt;ref&gt;Charles White, ''The Belgic Revolution of 1830'', Whittaker, London, 1835, p. 308, see also, pp. 5, 45, 266, 307 where the same word as in French -  ''Wallons'' -  was used [https://books.google.com/books?id=yakkxan5MaYC&amp;dq=The+belgic+revolution&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dePp7v3ln7&amp;sig=YLFfICce8tVMj9sqRe3uCiwGZxQ&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Oxford University's copy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted also by Maurice Bologne, ''L'insurrection prolétarienne de 1830 en Belgique''.

Albert Henry wrote that although in 1988 the word ''Walloon'' evoked a constitutional reality, it originally referred to Roman populations of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and was also used to designate a territory by the terms ''provinces wallonnes'' or [[Walloon country]] (Pays wallon), from the 16th century to the [[Belgian revolution]], and later Wallonia.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Henry, ''En 1988, le terme ''Wallonie''  évoque (...) une réalité politique et administrative constitutionnellement reconnue (...) En 1830, et au cours des années qui suivirent, on avait continué à se servir des expressions ''provinces wallonnes'', cette dernière déjà employée au seizième siècle, au moins et ''pays wallon'' plus rarement attestées avant le dix-huitième siècle'', opus citatus, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Walloon country' was also used in Dutch viz.

===Institutional aspects===
{{Main|Wallonia|State reform in Belgium}}
The term "''state reform''" in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] context indicates a process towards finding [[constitution of Belgium|constitutional]] and [[language legislation in Belgium|legal]] solutions for the problems and tensions among the different segments of the Belgian population, mostly  Dutch-speakers of [[Flanders]] and French-speakers of [[Wallonia]]. In general, Belgium evolved from a unitary state to a federal state with [[communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities, regions and language areas]].&lt;ref&gt;''"Belgium is a federal State composed of Communities and Regions."''&amp;nbsp;– Article 1 of the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual and emotional aspects==

===Wallonia===
The extent of Wallonia, the area defined by the use of the language, has shifted through the ages.  The low-lying area of Flanders and the hilly region of the [[Ardennes]] have been under the control of many city-states and external powers.  Such changing rule brought variations to borders, culture, and language.  The Walloon language, widespread in use up until the [[Second World War]], has been dying out of common use due to growing internationalisation.  Although official educational systems do not include it as a language, the French government continues to support the use of French within the "[[Francophonie]]" commonwealth.

This is complicated by the federal structure of Belgium, which splits [[Belgium]] into three communities with the privilege of using their own tongues in official correspondence, but also into three autonomous regions.  The communities are: [[French Community of Belgium|French community]] (though not Walloon, but sometimes controversially called ''Wallonia-Brussels''),&lt;ref&gt;From 1 January 2009, "Wallonia-Brussels International (WBI) "will further enhance the visibility of Wallonia-Brussels international activities, both in Belgium and abroad. WBI will pool all of the international relations work of the French Community, the Walloon Region and the French Community Commission of the Brussels-Capital Region. [http://www.wbi.be/cgi/bin3/render.cgi?id=0134055_article&amp;ln=ln3&amp;userid=&amp;rubr=gen Wallonia-Brussels International]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flemish community]] (which uses Dutch), and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking community]].  The division into political regions does not correspond with the communities: [[Flemish Region]], [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] (including the German community but generally called Wallonia), and the bilingual (French-Dutch) [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]].

===Brussels - not Walloon but mostly French-speaking===
Many non-French-speaking observers (over)generalize ''Walloons'' as a term of convenience for all Belgian French-speakers (even those born and living in the Brussels-Capital Region).  The mixing of the population over the centuries means that most families can trace ancestors on both sides of the linguistic divide.  But, the fact that Brussels is around 85% French-speaking, but is located in Dutch-speaking Flanders, has led to friction between the regions and communities.  The local dialect in Brussels, ''Brussels Vloms'', is a [[Brabantic]] dialect, reflecting the Dutch heritage of the city.

Walloons are historically credited with pioneering the [[industrial revolution]] in Continental Europe in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/eu "Walloons pioneered the industrial revolution in the Continent"], ''The Guardian'', 7 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In modern history, Brussels has been the major town or the capital of the region. Because of long [[Spain|Spanish]] and minor French rule, French became the sole [[official language]].  After a brief period with Dutch as the official language while the region was part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the people reinstated French after achieving independence in 1830.  The Walloon region, a major coal and steel-producing area, developed rapidly into the economic powerhouse of the country.  Walloons (in fact French-speaking elites who were called ''Walloons'') became politically dominant.  Many Flemish immigrants came to work in Wallonia.  Between the 1930s and the 1970s, the gradual decline of steel and more especially [[coal mining|coal]], coupled with too little investment in service industries and light industry (which came to predominate in Flanders), started to tip the balance in the other direction.  Flanders became gradually politically and economically dominant.  In their turn, Walloon families have moved to Flanders in search of jobs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} This evolution has not been without political repercussions.

===Walloon identity===
The heartland of Walloon culture are the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] river and [[Sambre]] valleys, [[Charleroi]], [[Dinant]], [[Namur (city)|Namur]] (the regional capital), [[Huy]], [[Verviers]], and [[Liège (city)|Liège]].

====Regional language statistics====
The [[Walloon language]] is an element of Walloon identity.  However, the entire French-speaking population of Wallonia cannot be culturally considered Walloon, since a significant portion in the west (around [[Tournai]] and [[Mons]]) and smaller portions in the extreme south (around [[Arelerland|Arlon]]) possess other languages as mother tongues (namely, [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Champenois]], [[Luxembourgish]], and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]]).  All of them can speak French as well or better.

A survey of the ''Centre liégeois d'étude de l'opinion''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleo-ulg.be/pages/012/Accueil.fr.php |title=Centre d'étude de l'opinion |publisher=Cleo-ulg.be |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out in 1989 that 71.8% of the younger people of Wallonia understand and speak only a little or no Walloon language; 17.4% speak it well; and only 10.4% speak it exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Baugnet, ''L'identité culturelle des jeunes Wallons'', Liège 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Based on other surveys and figures, Laurent Hendschel wrote in 1999 that between 30 and 40% people were bilingual in Wallonia (Walloon, Picard), among them 10% of the younger population (18–30 years old).  According to Hendschel, there are 36 to 58% of young people have a passive knowledge of the regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;L.Hendschel, ''Quelques indices de la vitalité du wallon'', in Walloon ''Qué walon po dmwin?'' pp 114-134, Quorum, Gerpinnes {{ISBN|2-87399-072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[Givet]] ''commune'', several villages in the [[Ardennes]] ''département'' in [[France]], which publishes the journal ''Causons wallon'' (Let us speak Walloon);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardenne-wallonne.fr/FR~Lassociation|title=L'association|trans-title=The Association|language=fr|work=Ardenne Wallonne|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two villages in [[Luxembourg]] are historically Walloon-speaking.

====Walloons in the Middle Ages====

Since the 11th century, the great towns along the river [[Meuse river|Meuse]], for example, [[Dinant]], [[Huy]], and [[Liège]], traded with Germany, where ''Wallengassen'' (Walloons' neighborhoods) were founded in certain cities.&lt;ref&gt;Félix Rousseau, ''L'art mosan, introduction historique'', Duculot, Gembloux,1970 p. 44, {{ISBN|2-8011-0004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cologne]], the Walloons were the most important foreign community, as noted by three roads named ''Walloonstreet'' in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Félix Rousseau, opus citatus, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The Walloons traded for materials they lacked, such as copper, found in Germany, especially at [[Goslar]].

In the 13th century, the medieval German colonization of [[Transylvania]] (central and North-Western Romania) also included numerous Walloons.  Place names such as ''Wallendorf'' (Walloon Village) and family names such as ''Valendorfean'' (Wallon peasant) can be found among the [[Romanians|Romanian]] citizens of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Gündisch ''Without a doubt, among the settlers were not only Germans, be they Teutonici from Southern Germany or Saxons from Middle and Northern Germany but also Romanic people from the western regions of the then German Empire. One of the earliest documents on Transylvanian Saxons points at Flandrenses who had at least two independent settler groups. These came from an economically highly developed region of the empire, where during the 11th and 12th centuries shortage of land was overcome through intensive planning and building of dike systems. Cities were developed through the textile industry and trade. Many knights of the first crusade came from here. It is undisputed that Flandrenses played an important role in the German East-Migration.  Latins, settlers of Romanic-Walloon origin, were also represented. For example, Johannes Latinus, who arrived as knight but also as one of the first Transylvanian merchants; Gräf Gyan from Salzburg who frightened the bishop of Weißenburg; and Magister Gocelinus, who presented Michelsberg to the Cistercian abbey Kerz. Also to be mentioned is the name of the town Walldorf (villa Latina, "Wallonendorf", town of Walloons) and villa Barbant or Barbantina, a name which brings to mind Brabant in Belgium. Based on the described and often contradictory research results, answers to the question of the origin of Transylvanian Saxons cannot be considered as final. An incontestable clarification cannot be expected since it is probable that the colonists of different religions and ethnic background came in small groups from all regions of the then empire and grew, once in Transylvania, into a group with its own distinct identity, with German language and culture. In any event, their number was negligibly small and has been estimated at 520 families, approximately 2600 persons.'' in  ''Siebenbürgen und die Siebenbürger Sachsen'', Taschenbuch - 304 Seiten (1998) Langen-Müller, München.; {{ISBN|3-7844-2685-9}}.

====Walloons in the Renaissance====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jean bodin.jpg|thumb|100px|Jean Bodin 1530-1596 French political philosopher who invented ''Wallons-nous?'']] --&gt;
In 1572 [[Jean Bodin]] made a funny play on words which has been well known in Wallonia to the present:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{quote| Ouallonnes enim a Belgis appelamur [nous, les "Gaulois"], quod Gallis veteribus contigit, quuum orbem terrarum peragrarent, ac mutuo interrogantes qaererent ''où allons-nous'', id est quonam profiscimur? ex eo credibile est Ouallones appellatos quod Latini sua lingua nunquam efferunt, sed g lettera utuntur.''&lt;ref&gt;Albert Henry, opus citatus, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation: "We are called ''Walloons'' by the Belgians because when the ancient people of [[Gallia]] were travelling the length and breadth of the earth, it happened that they asked each other: 'Où allons-nous?' [Where are we going? : the pronunciation of these French words is the same as the French word ''Wallons'' (plus 'us')], i.e. 'To which goal are we walking?.' It is probable they took from it the name ''Ouallons'' (''Wallons''), which the Latin speaking are not able to pronounce without changing the word by the use of the letter G."  One of the best translations of his (humorous) sayings used daily in Wallonia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=fr&amp;q=Wallons-nous%3F&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr= |title=Wallons-nous? |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "These are strange times we are living in."

[[Shakespeare]] used the word Walloon: "A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace/Thrust Talbot with a spear in the back."  A note in ''[[Henry VI, Part I]]'' says, "At this time, the Walloons [were] the inhabitants of the area, now in south Belgium, still known as the 'Pays wallon'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gv4RdLciiwIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Shakespeare+%2B+Walloon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zVrme85mUM&amp;sig=kimA3D1MGizSq3rPOn5tV1qeV54&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA104,M1 William Shakespeare, ''Henry VI, Part 1]'', (Michael Taylor, ed.)

====Walloons in Sweden====

Starting from the 1620s, numerous Walloon miners and iron-workers, with their families, settled in [[Sweden]] to work in [[iron mining]] and refining.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Courtois,''De fer et de feu l'émigration wallonne vers la Suède'' (Ouvrage publié avec l'aide du Fonds national de la recherche scientifique), Fondation wallonne, Louvain-la-neuve, 2003 {{ISBN|2-9600072-8-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walloon methods of iron production were incorporated into Swedish practice, to supplement the existing German techniques. Many Walloon workers settled around the mine at [[Dannemora, Sweden|Dannemora]] producing [[Öregrund iron]] which represented 15 per cent of [[Swedish iron industry|Sweden's iron production]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2006/Assets/IIDRyden.doc | title=Swedish Economic History and the ’New Atlantic Economy’, Paper, presented at the "Economic History Society Annual Conference | publisher=[[University of Reading]] | date=31 March – 2 April 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925051110/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2006/Assets/IIDRyden.doc | archivedate=25 September 2006 | accessdate=30 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were originally led by the entrepreneur [[Louis De Geer (1587-1652)|Louis de Geer]], who commissioned them to work in the iron mines of [[Uppland]] and [[Östergötland]]. The wave of migration continued substantially into the 18th century.  Walloons became gradually integrated into Swedish society, but it was not until the end quarter of the 20th century when they were fully integrated, when the Swedish legislation allowed Catholics to become civil servants.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  Walloon ancestry is traceable through Walloon surnames.  Some people of Walloon descent belong to the ''Sällskapet Vallonättlingar'' (Society of Walloon Descendants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/HUGUENOTS-WALLOONS-EUROPE/2000-04/0956199264 Huguenots-Walloons-Europe Archives"], Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Walloons and the Enlightenment====

A 1786 history of the Netherlands noted, "[The] [[Province of Hainaut|Haynault]] and [[Province of Namur|Namur]], with [[Artois]], now no longer an Austrian Province, compose the Walloon country.  The Walloon name and language are also extended into the adjacent districts of the neighbouring Provinces. A large part of Brabant, where that Province borders on Haynault and Namur, is named [[Walloon Brabant]]. The affinity of language seems also on some occasions to have wrought a nearer relation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nKEBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;hl=fr James Shaw, ''Sketches of the History of the Austrian Netherlands: With Remarks on the Constitution, Commerce, ...''], London: G. G. J. and J. Robinson, 1786, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Belgian revolution of 1830====

The [[Belgian revolution]] was recently described as firstly a conflict between the [[Brussels]] municipality which was secondly disseminated in the rest of the country, "particularly in the Walloon provinces".&lt;ref&gt;French une ''tension entre l'autorité communale bruxelloise et le pouvoir hollandais dans un premier temps, et une diffusion de la colère dans le reste du pays -notamment dans les principales villes wallonnes - dans un deuxième temps'' Bruno Demoulin and Jean-Louis Kupper (editors) ''Histoire de la Wallonie'' opus citatus, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; We read the nearly same opinion in Edmundson's book:    &lt;blockquote&gt;The royal forces, on the morning of September 23, entered the city at three gates and advanced as far as the Park. But beyond that point they were unable to proceed, so desperate was the resistance, and such the hail of bullets that met them from barricades and from the windows and roofs of the houses. For three days almost without cessation the fierce contest went on, the troops losing ground rather than gaining it. On the evening of the 26th the prince gave orders to retreat, his troops having suffered severely. The effect of this withdrawal was to convert a street insurrection into a national revolt. The moderates now united with the liberals, and a Provisional Government was formed, having amongst its members [[Charles|Rogier]], [[Sylvain Van de Weyer|Van de Weyer]], [[Alexandre Gendebien|Gendebien]], {{Interlanguage link multi||nl|3=Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst|lt=Emmanuel van der Linden d'Hooghvorst}}, [[Félix de Mérode]] and [[Louis de Potter]], who a few days later returned triumphantly from banishment. The Provisional Government issued a series of decrees declaring [[Belgium]] independent, releasing the Belgian soldiers from their allegiance, and calling upon them to abandon the Dutch standard. They were obeyed. The revolt, which had been confined mainly to the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] districts, now spread rapidly over [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;George Edmundson ''The History of Holland'' Cambridge
at the University Press, 1922, pp. 389-404 [http://www.authorama.com/history-of-holland-33.html The History of Holland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jacques Logie wrote: "On the 6th October, the whole [[Wallonia]] was under the Provisional Government's control. In the Flemish part of the country the collapse of the Royal Government was as total and quick as in Wallonia, except [[Ghent]] and [[Antwerp]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Logie, ''1830. De la régionalisation à l'indépendance'', Duculot, Gembloux,1980, p.168, {{ISBN|2-8011-0332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Demoulin who was Professor at the [[Université de Liège]] wrote:  "[[Liège (city)|Liège]] is in the forefront of the battle for liberty",&lt;ref&gt;RobertDemoulin, La révolution de 1830, La Renaissance du Livre, Bruxelles, 1950, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; more than Brussels but with Brussels. He wrote the same thing for [[Leuven]]. According to Demoulin, these three cities are the ''républiques municipales'' at the head of the Belgian revolution. In this chapter VI of his book, ''Le soulèvement national'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;93–117), before writing "On the 6th October, the whole Wallonia is free",&lt;ref&gt;Robert Demoulin, opus citatus p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; he quotes the following municipalities from which volunteers were going to Brussels, the "centre of the commotion", in order to take part in the battle against the Dutch troops    : [[Tournai]], [[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Wavre]] (p.&amp;nbsp;105) [[Braine-l'Alleud]], [[Genappe]], [[Jodoigne]], [[Perwez]], [[Rebecq]], [[Grez-Doiceau]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Limelette|fr}}, [[Nivelles]] (p.&amp;nbsp;106), [[Charleroi]] (and its region), [[Gosselies]], [[Lodelinsart]] (p.&amp;nbsp;107), [[Soignies]], [[Leuze-en-Hainaut|Leuze]], [[Thuin]], [[Jemappes]] (p.&amp;nbsp;108), [[Dour]], [[Saint-Ghislain]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pâturages|fr}} (p.&amp;nbsp;109) and he concluded: "So, from the Walloon little towns and countryside, people came to the capital.."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Demoulin, opus citatus, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch fortresses were liberated in [[Ath]] ( 27 September), [[Mons]] (29 September), [[Tournai]] (2 October), Namur (4 October) (with the help of people coming from [[Andenne]], [[Fosses]], [[Gembloux]]), [[Charleroi]] (5 October) (with people who came in their thousands).The same day that was also the case for [[Philippeville]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Mariembourg|fr}}, [[Dinant]], [[Bouillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Demoulin, opus citatus, pp. 111-113&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Flanders]], the Dutch troops capitulated at the same time in [[Brugge]], [[Ieper]], [[Oostende]], [[Menen]], [[Oudenaarde]], [[Geeraardsbergen]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;113–114), but nor in [[Ghent]] nor in [[Antwerp]] (only liberated on 17 October and 27 October).
Against these interpretation, in any case for the troubles in Brussels, John W. Rooney Jr wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear from the quantitative analysis that an overwhelming majority of revolutionaries were domiciled in Brussels or in the nearby suburbs and that the aid came from outside was minimal. For example, for the day of 23 September, 88% of dead and wounded lived in Brussels identified and if we add those residing in Brabant, it reached 95%. It is true that if you look at the birthplace of revolutionary given by the census, the number of Brussels falls to less than 60%, which could suggest that there was support "national" (to different provinces Belgian), or outside the city, more than 40%.But it is nothing, we know that between 1800 and 1830 the population of the capital grew by 75,000 to 103,000, this growth is due to the designation in 1815 in Brussels as a second capital of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the rural exodus that accompanied the Industrial Revolution. It is therefore normal that a large part of the population of Brussels be originating provinces. These migrants came mainly from Flanders, which was hit hard by the crisis in the textile 1826-1830. This interpretation is also nationalist against the statements of witnesses: [[Charles Rogier]] said that there were neither in 1830 nor nation Belgian national sentiment within the population. The revolutionary [[Jean-Baptiste Nothomb]] ensures that "the feeling of national unity is born today." As for [[Joseph Lebeau]], he said that "patriotism Belgian is the son of the revolution of 1830.." Only in the following years as bourgeois revolutionary will "legitimize ideological state power.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Rooney Jr., ''Profil du combattant de 1830'' dans ''Revue belge d'histoire contemporaine'', T. 12, 1981, p.487 [http://www.flwi.ugent.be/btng-rbhc/pdf/BTNG-RBHC,%2012,%201981,%203,%20pp%20479-504.pdf Profil du combattant de 1830]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====In the Belgian State====

A few years after the [[Belgian revolution]] in 1830, the historian Louis Dewez underlined that "Belgium is shared into two people, Walloons and Flemings. The former are speaking French, the latter are speaking Flemish. The border is clear (...) The provinces which are back the Walloon line, i.e.: the [[Province of Liège]], the [[Walloon Brabant|Brabant wallon]], the [[Province of Namur]], the [[Province of Hainaut]] are Walloon [...] And the other provinces throughout the line [...] are Flemish. It is not an arbitrarian division or an imagined combination in order to support an opinion or create a system: it is a fact..."&lt;ref&gt;French ''La Belgique est partagée entre deux peuples, les Wallons et les Flamands. Les premiers parlent la langue française; les seconds la langue flamande. La ligne de démarcation est sensiblement tracée. [...] Ainsi les provinces qui sont en deçà de la ligne wallonne, savoir: la [[Province of Liège|province de Liège]], le [[Walloon Brabant|Brabant wallon]] la [[Province of Namur|Province de Namur]], la [[Province of Hainaut|Province de Hainaut]], sont wallonnes [...] Et celles qui sont au-delà de la ligne [...] sont flamandes. Ce n'est point ici une division arbitraire ou un plan fait d'imagination pour appuyer une opinion ou créer un système; c'est une vérité de fait...'' Louis Dewez, ''Cours d'histoire de Belgique contenant les leçons publiques données au musée des Lettres ert des Sciences de Bruxelles'', tome II, pp. 152-153, JP Méline, Bruxelles, 1833&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Michelet]] traveled in Wallonia in 1840 and we can read many times in his ''History of France'' his interest for Wallonia and the Walloons pp 35,120,139,172, 287, 297,300, 347,401, 439, 455, 468 (this page on the [[Culture of Wallonia]], 476 (1851 edition published online)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceEvAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Jules+Michelet+%2B+hIstoire+de+France&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result |title=Histoire de France |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with the German-speaking community====

The Walloon Region institutionally comprises also the [[German-speaking community of Belgium]] around [[Eupen]], in the east of the region, next to [[Germany]] which ceded the area to Belgium after the [[World War I|First World War]]. Many of the 60,000 or so inhabitants of this very small community reject being considered as Walloon and – with their community executive leader [[Karl-Heinz Lambertz]] want to remain a federating unit, and to have all the powers of the Belgian Regions and Communities. Even if they do not want them absolutely and immediately (10 July 2008, official speech for the Flanders' national holiday).&lt;ref&gt;''Neben Flandern, Brüssel und der Wallonie möchten sie [die deutschsprachigen Belgier] ein eigenständiger Bestandteil, eine autonome gliedstaatliche Körperschaft, eine eigene „Gemeinschaft/Region“ bleiben, die für alle Gemeinschaftszuständigkeiten und jene regionalen Zuständigkeiten verantwortlich ist, die sie eigenverantwortlich gestalten will. Und auch wenn sie diese nicht unbedingt und unmittelbar fordert.''

Women comprise approximately 5% of the citizenry of [[Vatican City]]. According to the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' in March 2011, there were only 32 females out of 572 citizens issued with Vatican passports. One of them was a nun.&lt;ref name=HS&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/only-32-women-in-vatican-city/story-e6frf7lf-1226014488697 Only 32 women in Vatican City], Herald Sun, March 02, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2013, ''Worldcrunch'' reported that there were around 30 women who were citizens of Vatican City. In 2003, ''Worldcrunch'' had reported that there were 2 South American women, 3 Swiss women, 2 Polish women, and some Italian women. As of February 2013, the majority of the women were from Italy.&lt;ref name=WC/&gt;

==Female residents==
Among the women who lived in Vatican City was one of the daughters of an electrician, who later got married and "lost her right to live" in the city. Another woman who lives in Vatican City was [[Magdalena Wolińska-Riedi]], who is a Polish translator and wife of one of the [[Swiss Guard]]s.&lt;ref name=WC/&gt;

==Vatican City citizens==
Among the women who have citizenship in Vatican City, there is one officer in the military, two teachers (one teaches in high school, the other teaches in kindergarten), and one academic. Women obtain Vatican City citizenship by marriage (as a baptized Catholic) to their husbands; however such citizenship "lasts only for the duration of their stay" in Vatican City.&lt;ref name=WC&gt;Mrowińska, Alina. [http://www.worldcrunch.com/dossier-the-next-pope/behind-the-walls-what-it-039-s-like-to-live-inside-the-vatican-for-a-woman/vatican-vatican-city-communion-and-liberation-pope-benedict-xvi/c8s11033/ BEHIND THE WALLS: WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE INSIDE THE VATICAN, FOR A WOMAN], GAZETA WYBORCZA/Worldcrunch, February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of women==
In the past, women were not allowed to open a bank account in Vatican City, but, during the leadership of [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], the value of women in the city was highlighted. One of Pope Benedict XVI's assistant editors and confidential adviser was a woman. Her name is [[Ingrid Stampa]].&lt;ref name=WC/&gt; On April 21, 2013, ''The Telegraph'' reported that [[Pope Francis]] will be appointing "more women to key Vatican" positions. In addition to this, the ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' - the daily newspaper in Vatican City - is now publishing supplementary pages that address women's issues.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/10008833/Pope-Francis-to-appoint-more-women-to-key-Vatican-posts.html Pope Francis 'to appoint more women to key Vatican posts'], The Telegraph, April 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Women are not allowed to be ordained to the presbyterate or episcopate, though a commission is currently studying the question of whether women can serve as un-ordained female [[deacon]]s (deaconesses).

== Clothing ==

Women (and men) visiting [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] or the Vatican Museums in Vatican City are expected to wear appropriate attire. Low cut or sleeveless clothing, shorts, miniskirts and hats (for men, indoors) are not allowed. Women may or may not wear the traditional "black hat or veil". Dress code for Papal audiences is somewhat more formal.&lt;ref name=VatMuseum&gt;[http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/visita-i-musei/consigli-utili.html Vatican Museums - useful information for visitors], Vatican museums and churches visitor information, museivaticani.va&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buzzle&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/vatican-city-dress-code.html Dress Code for Women], Vatican City Dress Code, buzzle.com&lt;/ref&gt; Women cannot wear clothing that does not cover the shoulders and the knees.&lt;ref name=WC/&gt;

== Voting rights ==
No elections are held in Vatican City, and consequently, neither male nor female citizens or residents have voting rights. The [[Pope]], who serves as the [[head of state]], is [[Papal conclave|elected]] by the [[College of Cardinals]] of the Catholic Church. The College is part of the [[Holy See]], which forms a separate sovereign entity from Vatican City. [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinals]] in the Catholic Church are required, as of now, to be male, with voting Cardinals generally always Bishops, and only men are eligible to be elected Pope. With that being said, however, the cardinalate is a privilege and office bestowed by the Pope; it is not a separate, fourth degree of Holy Orders, along with deacon, priest, and Bishop, though it ranks above them, so theoretically, the laws could be amended to allow for women to be Cardinals, though that is very unlikely currently. Members of the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], which forms the legislature of Vatican City, are appointed by the Pope and must be cardinals.

As women are unable to vote, or hold any executive or legislative position in either the City State or the Holy See, Vatican City is the only country remaining with no voting or electoral rights for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=Alli|title=As Saudi Arabian women celebrate the vote, the (brief) history of global suffrage must be examined|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/08/26/as-saudi-arabian-women-celebrate-the-vote-the-brief-history-of-global-suffrage-must-be-examined/|website=New York Times|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zarya|first=Valentina|title=There Is Now Only One Country Left in the World Where Women Can’t Vote|url=http://fortune.com/2015/12/11/one-country-women-vote/|website=Fortune|accessdate=9 January 2017|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divorce ==
Vatican City is one of two [[sovereign state]]s that do not allow divorce, the other being the [[Philippines|Republic of the Philippines]].

== Total abortion ban ==
Vatican City is one of six countries worldwide that ban abortion completely, even if the mother's life is in danger.

==''Donne in Vaticano''==
In September 2016, the High Authority of the Vatican approved the creation of ''Donne in Vaticano'', the first women-only association of the Vatican. The members of the association are journalists, theologians, and economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://it.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/12/07/e_nata_dva,_la_prima_associazione_di_donne_in_vaticano/1277438 E' nata la prima Associazione di donne in Vaticano], ''Radiovaticana.va'', 7 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [https://www.buzz-europa.com/2017/05/14/donne-in-vaticano-1ere-association-feminine-vatican/ Donne in Vaticano, la 1ère association féminine au Vatican], ''Buzz-europa.com'', 14 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''WaYeyi''' (also: ''Yeyi'' or ''Bayei'', autoethonym: ''Mayeyi'') are [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people of north-western [[Botswana]] and north-eastern [[Namibia]]. The Yeyi immigrated to the area in the 18th century from the north, and lived in close cooperation with the [[Bushmen|San]] people, or ''Basarwa,'' who had lived in the area previously. They speak [[Yeyi language|ShiYeyi]], a language that was influenced by the [[San people|San]] and exhibits the characteristic [[click consonant|clicks]].&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite news

==History==
According to oral tradition, the baYei emigrated from the kingdom of the [[Lozi people]] in the 18th century, and were led into [[Ngamiland]] by the skilled fisherman and hunter Hankuzi. When the baYei met the baKhakwe people, Hankuzi married one of their women, possibly as a guarantee of peace. A number of immigration waves followed. The baYei learned many of the baKhakwe's survival skills, including new fishing techniques, while the baYei are credited with bringing the canoe-building technology to Ngamiland. The baYei also had connections to the Lozi in the north, and traded tobacco for iron with them. Iron was important in the baYei economy for producing spearheads and tools.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the early 19th century the baTswana tribe known as baTawana arrived in the Ngamiland. After the arrival, many of the baYei became serfs, or ''batlhanka'', of the baTawana. Initially the servitude was voluntary in many cases, as it offered protection to attach oneself to a powerful household.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In Namibia, the Mayeyi were first recognised as an independent tribe in 1992; before they were covered under the [[Mafwe people|Mafwe]] traditional authority.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; The seat of their ''khuta'' (royal homestead) is the settlement of [[Sangwali]] in the [[Judea Lyaboloma Constituency]] of the [[Zambezi Region]]. This is also the place where ''Batsara Batsapi'', the annual cultural festival of the Mayeyi people, is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|url=https://www.newera.com.na/2015/08/04/batsara-batsapi-festival-attracts-thousands/
|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The baYei had a [[matrilineal succession]], i.e. the inheritor of a kingdom is the son of a sister to the king.

The baYei believed in a creator god who lived among the humans. One day the god became angry with the humans for their wickedness and went to heaven. He does not interfere much in the world, except for throwing down the occasional thunderbolt. The baYei also venerate ancestor spirits.

Crops that are important for the baYei culture includes sorghum and tobacco.
