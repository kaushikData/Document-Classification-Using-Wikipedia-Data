[[File:Tjugo snörband (bindikor) som tillhört Gustav II Adolf - Livrustkammaren - 73698.tif|thumb|right|Bundle of 20 braided gold and silver laces with stamped brass tags or aiglets, first half of the 17th century]]

An '''aiguillette''', also spelled '''aguillette''', '''aiglet''' or '''aglet''' (from [[French (language)|French]]  "aiguille", ''needle''), is a [[Cord (sewing)|cord]] with metal tips or '''lace tags''', or the decorative tip itself.&lt;ref name="Picken"&gt;Picken, Mary Brooks: ''The Fashion Dictionary'', "Aglet" and "Aiguillette", p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;* {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0003581500073777| issn = 0003-5815| volume = 82| pages = 157–196| last1 = Gaimster| first1 = David| last2 = Hayward| first2 = Maria| last3 = Mitchell| first3 = David| last4 = Parker| first4 = Karen| title = Tudor Silver-Gilt Dress-hooks: A New Class of Treasure Find in England| journal = The Antiquaries Journal| date = 2002| url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquaries-journal/article/div-classtitletudor-silver-gilt-dress-hooks-a-new-class-of-treasure-find-in-englanddiv/45C2FC277BA5F34DB28D3E87BF56AE0A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional or purely decorative fasteners of silk cord with metal tips popular in the 16th and early 17th centuries, sometimes of [[gold]] set with [[gemstone]]s or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ed, are generally called "aiglets", "aglets" or "points".&lt;ref name="AJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewellery"&gt;Scarisbrick, Diana, ''Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery'', London, [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], 1995, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, an "aiguillette" is an ornamental braided cord with decorative metal tips worn on [[uniform]]s or as part of other costumes such as [[academic dress]],&lt;ref name="Picken" /&gt; where it will denote an honour. This usage of "aiguillette" derives from lacing used to fasten plate armor together. As such, a knot or loop arrangement was used which sometimes hung from the shoulder.

These aiguillettes should not be confused with [[lanyard]]s, which are cords also worn from the shoulder (or around the neck), but do not have the pointed aiguillette tips and are usually of fibre rather than gold or silver wire, and often not braided.

The modern [[aglet]] or shoelace tip and the decorative tips on [[bolo tie]]s are types of aiguillettes.

Portraits of the 16th and 17th centuries show that aiglets or metal tips could be functional or purely decorative, though many were used to "close" seams and slashes that are not always apparent on dark garments in portraits.  They were made in matched sets, might be of silver, [[silver-gilt]], or gold, and were worn in masses.&lt;ref name="Jewellery" /&gt;

A 1547 inventory of [[Henry VIII of England]]'s wardrobe includes one coat with 12 pairs of aiglets, and 11 gowns with a total of 367 pairs.&lt;ref name="AJ" /&gt;  The ''Day Book of the Wardrobe of Robes'' of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] records items given and received into storage, including details of buttons and aiglets lost from the Queen's clothing.  This entry suggests the huge numbers of matching aiglets fashionable forty years later:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lost the 2 of February ... [1582] 1 bunsh of small gold tagges or aglettes from a gowne of black satten at Sittingbourne parcell [part] of uppon the same gowne 193 bunshes&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Janet, ''Lost from Her Majesties Back'', p.74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elizabeth's aiglets were variously enameled with white, red, black, blue, and purple details or set with [[diamond]]s, [[garnet]]s, [[ruby|rubies]], and {{nowrap|pearls;&lt;ref name="Jewellery" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Janet, ''Lost from Her Majesties Back''&lt;/ref&gt;}} those of [[Anne of Denmark]] in the early years of the 17th century were larger, shaped in triangles and pyramids.  One set of 24 were made three-sided, with "27 diamonds in the sides and one in the top", for a total of 642 diamonds in the set.&lt;ref name="Jewellery" /&gt;

==Military usage==

[[File:Edward Fiennes de Clinton, Earl of Lincoln.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln|Lord High Admiral Clinton]] in an [[gambeson|arming doublet]] of 1562, showing the decorative ''points'' or laces with metal tips for securing armour.]]
The modern aiguillette derives from the laces used to secure plates of armor together—the breast- and back-plates would be attached on one side with short loops of cord acting as a hinge, and on the other by a longer and more ornate tied one,to support the arm defences.&lt;ref&gt;"Origin of Aiguillettes", All Hands 615 (April 1968): 34-35, Naval Department Library, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing knots would hang down the shoulder. (As with combat boots, the longer the lace, the less the need to undo the entire lace.) As armour became more ornamental and less practical, so too did the ties. This would also explain the aiguillettes of varying levels of complexity in the uniforms of the Household Cavalry (see picture above), as opposed to other "unarmored" troops.

A version that says that aiguillettes originated in aides-de-camp and adjutants wearing a pencil at the end of a cord hanging from the shoulder has no historical base.

=== Argentina ===
Aiguillettes are worn on the right shoulder by armed forces officers serving in specific positions, such as [[Aide-de-camp#Argentina|aide-de-camp to the President]], the [[Ministry of Defense (Argentina)|Minister of Defense]], each service's chief of staff and unit commanding officers, and by military attachés to Argentinian embassies abroad. The color of the aiguillette may be golden, silver or tan, depending the nature of the assignment.

Olive green aiguillettes are worn with the combat uniform in very special circumstances, such as ceremonies and inspections. Otherwise, aiguillettes are not worn with the combat uniform. A special red aiguillette is worn by the adjutants to the commanding officers of the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers|Horse Grenadiers Regiment]] (the presidential guard) and the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación|Military Academy]]. Also, a red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by the senior NCO of each Army unit. A thinner, yellow aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by NCOs who have completed the instructor course.

In the [[Argentine Navy|Navy]], adjutants to very senior officers wear golden aiguillettes on the left shoulder.

===Australia===
Aiguillettes distinguish officers of Flag, General and Air rank in specific command appointments, Military Attachés and Aides-de-camp. Most senior officers and aides-de-camp to the Governor-General or state governors wear the Aiguillette on the right shoulder,  whilst Military Attachés and staff aides-de-camp wear the Aiguillette on the left. Royal Aiguillettes are of plain gold, naval aiguillettes are of blue and gold, army aiguillettes are of red and gold, air force aiguillettes of light blue and gold.

The [[Governor-General of Australia]], as the Commander in Chief of the [[Australian Defence Force]], is entitled to wear a uniform on which an Aiguillette made of platinum is worn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.gov.au/Our-history/Traditions/Aiguillettes Aiguillettes - Australian Army&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Aiguillettes with shoulder boards are worn by military aides-de-camp to the Governor General. The aiguillette is gold with brass tags and worn on the right shoulder. Aides-de-camp to the provincial lieutenant governors wear the same gold-pattern aiguilette on the right shoulder, but do not wear shoulder boards. Aiguillettes are worn on the left shoulder by aides-de-camp to generals, flag officers and diplomats. Aides-de-camp assigned to the Sovereign or officers holding a royal appointment wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder. Obsolete-style gold-braid aiguilettes mixed with army crimson, navy blue, or air force blue may also still be worn by aides-de-camp to lieutenant governors, flag and general officers and diplomats who still have them.

===Denmark===
[[File:Tambur 01.jpg|thumb|Royal Danish Naval Band with red aiguillettes]]
The Danish military uses Aiguillettes for a number of different positions.

* Blue and red: the [[Bugle]] corps by [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron]].
* Red: Royal Danish Naval Band
* Green: Danish [[Military police]].

===France===
[[File:Republican Guard Élysée Palace 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Garde Républicaine|Republican Guard]] wearing a gold-wire aiguillette on the left shoulder]]
The aiguillettes are worn only with the dress uniform. There are several types of aiguillettes in the [[French military]]:
*Aiguilettes on the right shoulder are worn by officers filling certain duties.
** Staff officers in the [[President of France|President]]'s staff, the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]'s staff, the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of Defence]]'s staff and the [[Maréchal de France|Maréchaux]]'s Staff. The aiguillette is always in gold wire.
** The [[aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] to the President, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the [[Légion d'honneur]], the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] and the [[Délégation Générale pour l'Armement|DGA]]. The aiguillette can be silver or gold, depending on the officer's corps. The AdC to the generals in the army and the air force and all the staff officers in the navy can also wear this aiguillette.
** The [[military attaché]]s of an embassy. The aiguillette is always in gold wire.
* Aiguillettes on the left shoulder are worn by all members of some units :

** The Bands. This aiguillette can be blue, red, or gold.

Aiguillettes should not be confused with ''[[fourragère]]s'', which can be worn in the same way on the left shoulder in parade dress.

===Ghana===

In [[Ghana]], aiguillettes form part of the ceremonial uniforms of commissioned officers in the army and other security services including the police, Prisons service, Fire service, customs and immigration. Senior police officers wear white aiguillettes with dark-blue uniforms, prison officers also wear yellow aiguillettes over the official ceremonial number one uniform while customs and immigration officials wear red aiguillettes with olive-green outfits. When worn, the aigullettes denote on-duty status.

[[File:US Navy 020905-N-3228G-005 Change of Command aboard USS O'Kane.jpg|thumb|U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard Dress Aiguillette (White Uniform): One dark blue braided loop and two single loops.]]
The aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by military aides to the [[President of the United States|President]] and the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. It is worn on the left shoulder by military assistants to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], aides to the Service Secretaries ([[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] &amp; [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]]), aide to the NOAA Administrator, military attachés, [[general staff|General Staff Corps]] officers, and aides to [[flag officer]]s. The cord colors are gold for the  Army and silver for the Air Force, gold and blue for the Coast Guard, Navy and NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps,with one braid "per star" of the Flag Officer (one for RDML, two for RADM, three for VADM and four for ADM), and gold and red for the Marines, with the number of braids corresponding to the rank of the General Officer similar to the Navy use. The gold cord aiguillette is worn by the directors of the [[United States Marine Band]], while the enlisted personnel wear aiguillettes of white cord.

A red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by [[United States Navy]] Recruit Division commanders, whereas a blue aiguillette is worn by Recruit Division commanders in training, Recruit Division commanders wearing these are referred colloquially as "red ropes" and "blue ropes" respectively. The U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard in Washington, D.C. wears a blue aiguillette on summer white uniforms and a white one on winter blue uniforms.

A blue aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by cadets in charge of quarters at the [[United States Air Force Academy]], as well as by military training leaders at technical training bases. Student airmen leaders at technical training bases (sometimes called "ropes" in reference to the aiguillette) also wear aiguillettes, with green representing the lowest level of student leadership, yellow representing the intermediate level of student leadership, and red representing the highest level of student leadership. Students wearing a white rope are commonly referred to as chapel guides, and are charged with providing social or moral support to their fellow airmen. Airmen who wear the black rope are experts in drill, choir, or ceremonies, and pride themselves on appearance and uniform wear. Airmen who wear a blue and white rope are members of the drum &amp; bugle corps for their base. In the United States Air Force, honor guard members wear a silver aiguillette on the left shoulder.

==Other military cords==

The aiguillette should not be confused with the [[fourragère]], which is worn by soldiers and Marines who are assigned to units that were awarded certain decorations by the French and Belgian governments for valorous conduct in the First and Second World Wars.

Nor should it be confused with the [[German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship|Schützenschnur]], a multi-weapon marksmanship decoration awarded by Germany to qualifying soldiers of NATO countries serving in Germany.

A similar, albeit thicker, device, the [[Infantry Blue Cord]], is worn on the right shoulder by all enlisted soldiers and officers in the [[United States Army]] whose primary [[United States military occupation codes|military occupational speciality]] is infantry.

Many military units wear dress [[lanyard]]s.

The '''''Albani Torlonia Altarpiece''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]],  executed in 1491 and housed in the [[Torlonia Collection]], [[Rome]]. It was commissioned by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future [[pope Julius II]].

==Description==
The [[polyptych]] includes two levels: the lower one has at center a Nativity scene and, at the sides, two arched panels depicting [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Jerome]] and [[Saint George]], sharing the same background. The upper one as, in the center, a [[lunette]] with a ''Crucifixion'', flanked by two small panels, with the Annunciation Angel and the Annunciation to the Virgin, set in a double portico.

The main scene, that of the Nativity, is perhaps inspired by that painted by Perugino in the [[Sistine Chapel]], which is now lost. The Child is housed in the Virgin's dress, lying on a red cushion; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph]] are adoring him, flanked by two kneeling angels and, behind, the ox and the donkey. The scene is set inside a perspective portico, while the background includes a series of hills.

'''Anthony Godby Johnson''' is the subject and supposed author of the 1993 memoir ''A Rock and a Hard Place: One Boy's Triumphant Story''. Subsequent investigations suggest that Johnson may have been the literary creation of Vicki Johnson, who purported to be Johnson's adoptive mother.

The book initially appeared as an autobiography, describing Johnson's survival of an [[child abuse|abusive]] childhood at the hands of his parents and their friends, his adoption by a new family, and his subsequent contraction of [[HIV/AIDS]].

A second, lesser-known book was published under Johnson's name in 1994, a collaboration with [[Maya Angelou]] entitled "Love Letters To Hawaii From Aboard The A-Train".

==Investigation==
[[Image:803Summit11STByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|right|Residence at the corner of Summit Avenue and 11th Street in [[Union City, New Jersey]]. The arrow points to the windows indicated by the ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' story to have been the apartment where Vicki Johnson lived.]]
When several magazines and journalists, including ''[[Newsweek]]'' and [[Keith Olbermann]], attempted to investigate the claims of the book and profile Anthony, they contacted the woman who claimed to be his [[adoption|adoptive]] mother, Vicki Johnson. Suspicion was raised when it was learned that no one other than Vicki Johnson had actually seen Anthony – not his agent, his editor, nor his publicist.  Further concerns were raised when a [[voice analysis]] expert analyzed calls from "Anthony" and identified the voice to be that of Vicki Johnson. As a result of these irregularities, Olbermann hired an investigator, who suggested that there was no Anthony and the story was fabricated.&lt;ref name="olbermann_scammed"&gt;{{cite news|first=Keith |last=Olbermann |title=Olbermann gets scammed, but he is not alone |author= |author2= |url=http://www.olbermann.org/ko/video_detail.cfm?id=1081 |date=August 4, 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928192455/http://www.olbermann.org/ko/video_detail.cfm?id=1081 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Rock and a Hard Place'' claimed that Anthony's biological parents were arrested and tried for [[child abuse|abusing]] him, and that his police officer father was killed in prison. An alleged [[Cabal|conspiracy]] of rogue police officers trying to kill Anthony was Vicki Johnson's justification for zealously preserving Anthony's privacy. However, no case matching that description could be found at any [[social service]] agency.

Many sources find it medically implausible that Anthony could be alive, given that he has supposedly been living with AIDS for over 19 years.&lt;ref name="Phantom Boy"&gt;{{cite news | first =Sara | last =Stewart | author2 =| url =http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/phantom_boy_entertainment_sara_stewart.htm | title = Phantom Boy: Bogus Tale of 'AIDS' Child – From White Lie to H'wood Film | work = New York Post (online edition) | date = July 30, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-07 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most long-term survivors are actually living with HIV but had not yet developed AIDS; furthermore the medications that slow the progress of the disease were not known at the time that Anthony's AIDS allegedly became severe.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

With so many similarities between the purported life of Anthony and proven hoaxes such as that of [[Kaycee Nicole]] and [[Kodee Kennings]], the prevailing belief is that Anthony never existed.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Further investigation by [[snopes.com]] has turned up still more evidence that Anthony never existed. No birth records are available for Anthony and adoption is a time consuming and lengthy legal process. The state of New York has no record of a boy by that name or fitting that description having ever been adopted by anyone with his supposed adoptive mother's name. Even in a time before computers, it would have been impossible to adopt a child without creating a paper trail. Also, in his book Anthony stated that his biological father was an ex-police officer in New York, and that he had been tried, convicted, and killed in prison. However, no record exists of a police officer with his supposed biological father's name, and the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision]] lists no inmate by that name having ever been incarcerated, let alone killed in prison.  Were these things true, verification could easily be obtained by internet searches or [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests. Lastly, no court records exist which list a couple with the names of Anthony's supposed biological mother and father, who were supposedly tried and convicted of the crimes Anthony alleged in his book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/kaycee.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Paul Monette]] wrote a foreword for an edition of ''A Rock and a Hard Place'', later defending the book's veracity. [[Armistead Maupin]], who wrote a [[blurb]] for an edition of ''A Rock and a Hard Place'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = David Valdes Greenwood |url = http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/books/00/10/06/ARMISTEAD.html |title = Serial thriller: Armistead Maupin returns to serialize again |work = The Portland Phoenix |date = October 5–12, 2000 |accessdate = 2006-06-27 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070514164740/http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/books/00/10/06/ARMISTEAD.html |archivedate = May 14, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; later wrote ''[[The Night Listener (novel)|The Night Listener]]'', a novel subsequently made into [[The Night Listener (film)|a film]], in which the main character begins correspondence with an HIV-positive boy who is not what he seems. The book parallels Maupin's experience with Johnson. The story was also adapted for a 2002 episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' entitled "[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (season 1)#ep21|Faith]]", with the child's sex being changed to female and illness to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].

On January 12, 2007, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] newsmagazine program ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' revealed new evidence that Anthony was Vicki Johnson's fictional creation. The photo of "Anthony" that Vicki had sent to Anthony's supporters was revealed to be a childhood photo of a healthy adult man who was shocked to find his childhood photo being represented to people as that of Anthony Godby Johnson; one childhood teacher of this man had been Vicki Johnson, who was said to have taken pictures of the children in her class.

Vicki Johnson, whose real name was Joanne Vicki Fraginals, had allegedly handed Anthony over to another caretaker in 1997 when she moved to Chicago and married [[Marc Zackheim]], a child psychologist and owner of the ''Associates of Clinical Psychology''. In 2004, Zackheim was indicted for abusing child patients at a treatment center for troubled children in [[Indiana]]; his trial began in 2006 at the [[Marshall County, Indiana|Marshall County]] courthouse. He was acquitted of one felony count of practicing medicine without a license and three misdemeanor counts of battery for inappropriately touching boys.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2006-06-17/news/26952308_1_psychologist-practice-psychology-group-homes/ " Psychologist relieved following acquittal"&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later Zackheim was found in court again, confessing to accepting [[Medicaid]] for patients no longer in his clinic, accepting payments before services had been provided or for services never received, billing for therapeutic services when no licensed therapist was on site, billing for more expensive therapy services than provided, and fabricating diagnosis. In 2009 Marc Allen Zackheim was charged and sentenced to prison in federal court on felony charges for aiding and abetting [[health care fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;United States of America vs Marc Allen Zackheim, Case Number: 3:09-CR-00021(01)RM, The US Attorney Charges, March 2, 2009, Chief Judge US District Court Robert L. Miller, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/40661177.html wbst.com ''Plymouth psychologist pleads guilty to Medicaid fraud" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309104849/http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/40661177.html |date=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zackheim died of a [[heart attack]] in November 2009 before his sentence was served.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepilotnews.com/content/view/137804/27/ "Zackheim dies after suffering heart attack"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129155413/http://www.thepilotnews.com/content/view/137804/27 |date=January 29, 2010 }} ''The Pilot News''; November 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2009-11-21/news/26743885_1_medicaid-fraud-lake-forest-hospital-prison-for-health-care/ "Heart attack claims Plymouth Psychologist Accused in Medicaid Fraud- Zackheim was ordered to prison for Medicaid fraud&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC subsequently ran an update to the story, which included a 147-page response from Vicki Johnson's lawyer in response to ABC's questions. ABC also reported that Johnson and Zackheim have both died since their original 2007 story. Since the alleged death of Vicki Johnson, Anthony has seemingly vanished and has not been in contact with any of his previous supporters, lending credence to the assertion that he never existed. Since Vicki has supposedly died, the truth or fiction of Anthony and his story cannot be verified, leaving the story without resolution. Though the majority of people now believe that he never existed, there are still some people that believe that Anthony is/was real, and with the death of Vicki Johnson, their claims cannot be completely disproven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2221860&amp;page=2 "Not Believing in 'Tony'" ].

[[File:Girl wearing Sperrys.jpg|thumb|Boat shoes are traditionally worn without socks]]
'''Boat shoes''' (also known as '''deck shoes''') are typically canvas or leather with non-marking rubber soles designed for use on a boat. A [[Siping (rubber)|siping]] pattern is cut into the soles to provide grip on a wet deck; the leather construction, along with the application of oil, is designed to repel water; and the stitching is highly durable. Boat shoes are traditionally worn without [[socks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/style/ask-nick/top-siders-0309 |title=When to Break Out the Boat Shoes: Ask Nick Sullivan |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Modern boat shoes were invented in 1935 by American [[Paul A. Sperry]] of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] after noticing his dog's ability to run easily over ice without slipping. Using a knife, he cut siping into his shoes' soles, inspiring a shoe perfect for boating and a company called Sperry Top-Sider. [[Sperry Top-Siders]] are still a popular brand of boat shoe today, among many others, including [[Sebago (company)|Sebago]] and [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]].&lt;ref name="women's brands"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.boats.com/reviews/boat-shoes/ |title=Boat Shoes |work=[[boats.com]] |date=February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boat shoes are worn by both women and men.&lt;ref name="women's brands"/&gt;

Boat shoes are used by sailors, as the name suggests; however, since the 1970s they have become casual  footwear in coastal areas of the [[Netherlands]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Some boat shoes today have traditional white, non-marking soles, though many others today have dark non-marking soles. They usually have a ''moc-toe'' (like a [[moccasin]]) construction. They are usually seen as somewhat of a status symbol (owning boating shoes usually denotes the owner of a boat with a deck large enough to walk around on- a moderately expensive vessel)

In the 1980s through to the early 1990s,  they became a fashion trend and returned in 2007-2008 and continuing in the 2000 10's,as a fashion trend and were worn with everyday and dressy wear alike by both boys and girls and men and women. Taking off big time with the upper elementary through middle school, high school, and college crowds. Besides being worn by themselves, many children and adults wear them with socks, especially low-cut, ankle socks and crew in white and many other bright neon and pastel colors. Many schools with uniform requirements allow boat shoes as acceptable uniform shoes. 

In the 1980's through the early 1990's they were worn with the [[slouch socks]] trend. They were worn a lot with tight rolled/french rolled jeans to show off the [[slouch socks]]. Girls would also wear them with a crew neck or v neck sweater over a turtleneck or a crew neck top with the v neck sweater and [[leggings]] with [[slouch socks]] over them and Sebagos with many wearing their hair with a hair band or or hair wrap or ponytail and [[scrunchie]] and bangs for a comfortable and fashionable look that could be worn casually everyday to school, college, church, hanging out, etc  or would look just as in as a dressy casual or dressy informal wear. Sebago, Sperry Top-Siders and Eastland were the three most popular brands at the time and have remained so through the 2008 into 2000 10's fashion trend revival.

'''Critical making''' refers to the hands-on productive activities that link digital technologies to society.
It was invented to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiSalvo, C|title=Design and the Construction of Publics|journal=Design Issues|year=2009|volume=25|series=1|page=48|doi=10.1162/desi.2009.25.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of critical making resides in the learning extracted from the process of making rather than the experience derived from the finished output. The term "critical making" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/article/critical-making-matt-ratto/&lt;/ref&gt; Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as way "to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ratto, M. |author2=Ree, R. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Materializing information: 3D printing and social change.|journal=First Monday|year=2012|volume=17|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Critical making", as defined by practitioners like Matt Ratto and Stephen Hockema, "is an elision of two typically disconnected modes of engagement in the world — "critical thinking," often considered as abstract, explicit, linguistically based, internal and cognitively individualistic; and "making," typically understood as tacit, embodied, external, and community-oriented."

[[File:Materials for critical making.jpg|thumb|right|Arduino Hardware]]
==History of Critical Making==
=== Matt Ratto and Critical Making ===
Matt Ratto coined the term in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Ratto, Matt. "Flwr Pwr: Tending the Walled Garden." 2-day Critical Making Workshop for the Walled Garden conference, Virtueel Platform, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, November 20–22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making. This concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards [[Critical design|creating]] and/or making things within a technological context.&lt;ref name="CriticalMaking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratto|first=Matt|title=Critical Making: Conceptual and Material Studies in technology and Social Life|journal=The Information Society|year=2011|volume=27|pages=252|doi=10.1080/01972243.2011.583819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratto's first publication to use the term was in 2009. Ratto claims that his goal was to connect the conceptual understanding of technology in social life to materialized activities. By situating himself within the area of "design-oriented research" rather than "research-oriented research," Ratto believes that critical making enhances the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio-technical issues.&lt;ref name="CriticalMaking"/&gt; However, critical making should not be reviewed as design, but rather as a type of practice. The quality of a critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical "making" process, regardless of quality of the final material production.&lt;ref name="OpenDesignCriticalMaking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratto|first=Matt|title=Open Design and Critical Making|journal=Open Design Now: Why Design Cannot Remain Exclusive|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior studies have noted the separation between critical thinking and physical "making". Specifically, experts in technology lack a knowledge of art, and vice versa. However it is very important that technology be embedded in a context rather than being left in isolation, especially when it comes to critical making.

The Critical Making Lab was founded by Matt Ratto in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The Critical Making Lab provides participants tools and basic knowledge of digital technology used in critical making. The mission of the lab is to enhance collaboration, communication, and the practice-based engagement in critical making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Lab|url=http://criticalmaking.com/about/|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of critical making is open design.&lt;ref name="OpenDesignCriticalMaking"/&gt;Open design develops a critical perspective on the current institutions, practices and norms of society, reconnecting materiality and morality. Matt Ratto introduces Critical Making as processes of material and conceptual exploration and creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves. Critical Making includes digital software and hardware. Software usually refers to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Hardware refers to a computer, or any other device that facilitates an operation.

=== Garnet Hertz and Critical Making ===
In 2012, [[Garnet Hertz]] adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled "Critical Making" published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/ &lt;/ref&gt; It explores how hands-on productive work ‐ making ‐ can supplement and extend critical reflection on technology and society. It works to blend and extend the fields of design, contemporary art, DIY/craft and technological development. In this project, 70 different authors - including [[Norman White]], [[Julian Bleecker]], [[Dunne &amp; Raby]], [[Daniel Charny]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Golan Levin]], [[Matt Ratto]], [[Natalie Jeremijenko]], [[McKenzie Wark]], [[Paul Dourish]], [[Mitch Altman]], [[Dale Dougherty]], [[Mark Pauline]], [[Scott Snibbe]], [[Reed Ghazala]] and others - reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement. Generally speaking, Hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as "things to think with".&lt;ref&gt;http://futureeverything.org/events/critical-making/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertz initially set out to make a zine of about 50 pages but was flooded with almost 300 pages of original content from approximately sixty people. It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing multiple booklets. The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment. Recently, Make received a grant from DARPA to create "makerspaces" for teenagers. Everyone who had assumed that a culture built on openness was antithetical to the murkiness that surrounds the military world was bitterly disheartened. However, CM is not the anti-Make Magazine, it is simply an alternative, a forum for electronic DIY practice to discuss hacking, making, kludging, DIYing in a less sanitized, mass-market way.

In 2014, Hertz founded "The Studio for Critical Making" at [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]] as [[Canada Research Chair]] in [[Design]] and [[Media Arts]]. The facility "explores how humanities-based modes of critical inquiry – like the arts and ethics – can be directly applied to building more engaging product concepts and information technologies. The lab works to replace the traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed or usability with more complex cultural, social and human-oriented values. The end result is technology that is more culturally relevant, socially engaged and personalized." &lt;ref&gt;http://research.ecuad.ca/criticalmaking/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses of Critical Making ===
In 2012, [[John Maeda]] began using the term while at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD): first as a title for their strategic plan for 2012-2017 and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled "The Art of Critical Making: Rhode Island School of Design on Creative Practice" published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118517865.html &lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals who use the term critical making to orient their work include [[Amaranth Borsuk]] ([[University of Washington]]-Bothell), Jentery Sayers ([[University of Victoria]]), Roger Whitson ([[Washington State University]]), Kari Kraus ([[University of Maryland]]), Amy Papaelias ([[SUNY-New Paltz]]), and Jessica Barness ([[Kent State University]]).

== Concepts Related to Critical Making ==

=== DIY and Critical Making ===
Traditional DIY is criticized due to its costs and standards. DIY products are difficult to spread in lower-income areas where issues of cost and ease are more commonly cited (William, 276).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Colin C.|title=A lifestye choice?

I|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4/5|page=276|doi=10.1108/09590550410534613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, TET increases the technological standard of DIY,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kuznetsov, S. |author2= Paulos, E. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Rise of the expert amateur: DIY projects, communities, and cultures.|journal=In Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Extending Boundaries|year=2010|pages=295–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhance the modernity of it, and open up a more practical and advanced area for DIY projects to develop. It is not only a lifestyle choices but also a technological product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blikstein, P.|title=Gears of our childhood: constructionist toolkits, robotics, and physical computing, past and future|journal=In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children|year=2013|pages=173–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; "DIY activity is not for example seen as a coping practice used by those unable to afford to externalise the activity to formal firms and/or self-employed individuals. Instead, and reflecting the broader cultural turn in retail studies, their explanation for engagement in DIY is firmly grounded in human agency" (Williams, 273).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Colin C.|title=A lifestye choice? Evaluating the motives of do-it-yourself (DIY) consumers. I|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4/5|page=273|doi=10.1108/09590550410534613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speculative Design and Critical Making ===
According to DiSalvo and Lukens, "Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented. However this should not be mistaken as being fantasy-like sense, suggesting, that is "unreal" and therefore dismissible (DiSalvo and Lukens, 2009)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lukens, J. |author2= DiSalvo, C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Speculative Design and Technological Fluency|journal=International Journal of Learning|year=2011|volume=3|series=4|pages=23–40|doi=10.1162/ijlm_a_00080}}{{Dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines, including visionary or futurist forms of architecture, design fiction, and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style. More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures, speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture, technology, and the built environment (Lukens and DiSalvo, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;25). Practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation, one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long-term implications of technology. These practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate, such as fact and fiction, science and art, and commerce and academia. This provocation extends to questions about design itself.

=== [[3D printing|3D Printing]] and Critical Making ===
3D Printing allows for the relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects. There are two types of industrial manufacturing. The first is subtractive manufacturing, which involves shaping a material through a process of chipping / removing some of its substance (think whittling a figure out of wood). The second is additive manufacturing, which is created by adding material into a product. The basic steps of 3D printing are digital design: design the object you want to print using digital design software OR download a design from a website (like Thingiverse, for example), press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design. 3D printers use layerization to create objects. 3D printers use a variety of materials to create objects, including plastic, metal and nylon (Flemming, What is 3D printing?). The Makerbot, for example, uses polylactic acid (PLA), a substance derived from corn. The coiled PLA filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder, causing the PLA to melt. This melted material forms the model's layers, which is applied in approximately .02 - 1 millimeter layers. The model is built up until it is finished.

A '''cultural system''', is the interaction of different elements in [[culture]]. While a cultural system is very different from a [[social system]], sometimes both systems together are referred to as the [[sociocultural system]].

==Social theory==
A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.

===Action theory===
[[Talcott Parsons]], a major figure in sociology, who was the main originator of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons view, "Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels." In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term "functionalism" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

===System and social integration===
The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social [[structure and agency]]. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced [[Jürgen Habermas]]' discussion in the classic ''Legitimation Crises'', who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.

===Cultural and socio-cultural integration===
[[Margaret Archer]] (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work ''Culture and Agency'', argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and later by [[Mary Douglas]], is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by [[Antonio Gramsci]] through the theory of [[cultural hegemony]] through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)

Archer, a proponent of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture.  Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:
: "logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency&amp;nbsp;– that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory&amp;nbsp;– yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. " (2004:4)

Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

==Research==	
According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the "cultural studies" and "cultural indicators" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of "cultural systems integration." These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, "If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies." Constrained by Merton's [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

== Gameplay ==
{{See also|Ace Attorney#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in the Ace Attorney series}}
The game carries on the courtroom style gameplay of previous installments in the ''Ace Attorney'' series, including the fully 3D environments and character models previously featured in ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies]]''. Like previous titles, the game is divided between investigation, in which players explore areas to gather evidence and testimonies, and courtroom battles, in which players must find contradictions in witness testimonies to find the truth behind a case. Similarly to Takumi's previous game, ''[[Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'', the player sometimes have to cross-examine multiple witnesses at the same time.&lt;ref name="siliconera 2014-12-18"/&gt;

Trials in the game feature a jury, not just one judge; this also was the case in the fourth case of ''[[Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]]'', however, in ''Dai Gyakuten Saiban'' the jury directly influences the trial. The jurors are able to interrupt the trial at any time to enter their vote of either "guilty" or "not guilty" if they feel the defendant's guilt or innocence, respectively, as been conclusively demonstrated. If every juror has entered a vote of "guilty", then the defendant is given a guilty verdict. However, the player is able to present a closing argument after the verdict during which they interview the jurors, attempting to change their minds. If after the closing argument the player has persuaded at least a majority; four out of six, of the jurors to withdraw their votes of guilty, the court acknowledges the misalignment of the verdict, and the trial continues. If they fail, then the verdict stays as is and the trial is adjourned.
  
New to this game is Joint Reasoning, which takes place during investigations alongside Sherlock Holmes. In these segments, Holmes makes quick deductions about a witness, and it is up to the player to point out contradictions in his theories. This will occasionally require the player to inspect the witness from various angles, similar to how certain bits of evidence could be examined in previous installments, in order to find hidden clues that can help lead Holmes to the proper conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/09/10/great-ace-attorney-takes-place-japan-england/ |title=The Great Ace Attorney Takes Place In Japan And England |date=September 10, 2014 |author=Sato |work=Siliconera |accessdate=16 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222131243/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/09/10/great-ace-attorney-takes-place-japan-england/ |archive-date=February 22, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/09/18/great-ace-attorneys-collaborative-deduction-system-explained-tokyo-game-show/ |title=Learn All About The Great Ace Attorney’s Collaborative Deduction System |author=Kai, Cheng |date=September 18, 2014 |work=Siliconera |access-date=February 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150804065832/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/09/18/great-ace-attorneys-collaborative-deduction-system-explained-tokyo-game-show/ |archive-date=August 4, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
Taking place near the end of the 19th century (known in Japan as the [[Meiji Period]], in Britain as the [[Victorian era]]), ''Dai Gyakuten Saiban'' focuses on Ryūnosuke Naruhodō – an ancestor of [[Phoenix Wright (character)|Phoenix Wright]], the primary protagonist of the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series – who seeks to become a full-fledged defense attorney. Joined by his assistant, Susato Mikotoba, Ryūnosuke travels to England to further his studies, where he encounters world-famous detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] and works alongside him in solving mysterious cases.

===  Plot ===
The first chapter, '''The Adventure of the Great Departure''', takes place in Japan, and has Ryūnosuke get put on trial for the murder of a Japanese university teacher, Dr John H Watson. He is represented by Asōgi, while the prosecutor is Taketsuchi Auchi, the Meiji Period ancestor of recurring character Takefumi Auchi (Winston Payne in the English localizations). With help from Susato, Ryūnosuke and Asōgi prove that the real murderer is Jezail Brett, an English exchange student who had been studying under Watson at the university, though her motive is left a mystery and she is subsequently released back to England. Following the trial, Asōgi leaves Japan to complete his studies in Great Britain, but has Ryūnosuke travel with him as a stowaway.

In the second chapter, '''The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band''', Asōgi hides Ryūnosuke in his baggage and then in his room in order to bring him along to England for Asōgi's debut in the courts. However, while Ryūnosuke is asleep, Asōgi is found murdered within his cabin, and now exposed stowaway Ryūnosuke is once again blamed for the murder. Working with Susato and eccentric passenger Sherlock Holmes, Ryūnosuke discovers that the real killer is Nikomina Borschevitch, a world-famous Russian ballerina who fled Russia, and had unintentionally killed Asōgi by pushing and breaking his neck on his bed's wooden knob after fearfully assuming that he was going to turn her in to the captain (in truth he attempted to introduce her to her fellow stowaway Ryūnosuke as an act of trust and similar circumstances). After the incident is settled, Ryūnosuke persuades with Susato for him to take Asōgi's place as a representative lawyer in Britain, which she agrees to and begins to heavily tutor him on English Law for the remainder of the journey.

The third chapter, '''The Adventure of the Runaway Room''', has Ryūnosuke and Susato suddenly assigned to defend a philanthropist Cosney Megundal, who has been accused of murdering a bricklayer named "Thrice-Fired" Mortar Milverton within a moving carriage, shortly after they arrive in Britain. They go up against Barok van Zieks, a legendary British Prosecutor known as the "Death God of the Old Bailey" and are introduced to the British legal system, which uses a jury of 6 people to judge the verdict. During the trial, a smoke bomb is let off, forcing an evacuation of the courtroom. After court resumes, Ryūnosuke and Susato discover evidence proving that Mortar had been killed on the carriage roof, though Zieks claims that this evidence had been forged after the smoke bomb had gone off. He is unable to prove this, and Megundal is subsequently acquitted, though Ryūnosuke remains unsure of Megundal's innocence. Shortly after the trial, Megundal is murdered in a fire.

In the fourth, '''The Adventure of Clouded Kokoro''',  Ryūnosuke and Susato take on the defense of the soon to be famous Japanese novelist [[Natsume Sōseki]], who is currently in London studying English as an nervous exchange student, and has been charged with [[aggravated assault]] following a stabbing in the street. During the trial, Ryūnosuke proves that the stabbing was actually the result of a domestic disturbance between landlord John Garrideb and his wife Joan, who had thrown a knife at her husband, only for the knife to fall outside their window and unintentionally hit the victim with it. Sōseki is declared not guilty and explains that he is going to go back to Japan, no longer as nervous of the public as he was before. Sherlock invites Ryūnosuke and Susato to live with him and Iris at [[221B Baker Street]] and set up their law office in their attic.

In the fifth and final case, '''The Adventure of the Unspeakable Story''' the mystery of the third case is returned to, as a bigger game at hand is revealed through the murder of a pawnshop owner, Hutch. It turns of one of the jurors, a 
Telegraph station technician named Robert Crogley, was the son of Mortar Milverton and had the baliff set the fire that killed Megundal. After the case is solved, Susato heads back to Japan.

== Development ==
[[File:Ghost Trick event 4 - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|As with most entries in the series, the game was directed by [[Shu Takumi]].]]

''Dai Gyakuten Saiban'' was developed by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. It was directed by [[Shu Takumi]] and produced by Shintaro Kojima,&lt;ref name="Gemtasu 2014-04-22"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gematsu.com/2014/04/new-ace-attorney-3ds-set-meiji-era-japan |title=New Ace Attorney for 3DS set in Meiji era Japan |last=Romano |first=Sal |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=Gematsu |access-date=September 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112013618/http://gematsu.com/2014/04/new-ace-attorney-3ds-set-meiji-era-japan |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and features character designs and art direction by Kazuya Nuri&lt;ref name="ndream 256"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuri interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/game/content/?p=20564 |title=第三十五回　大逆転裁判 デザインの冒險！ |publisher=[[Capcom]] |access-date=July 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6aG3PLdjQ?url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/game/content/?p=20564&amp;redirect_stop=1 |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and music by Yasumasa Kitagawa and Hiromitsu Maeba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201504/24077366.html |script-title=ja:『大逆転裁判 -成歩堂龍ノ介の冒險-』サウンドトラックが7月15日に発売決定 |date=April 24, 2015 |website=[[Famitsu]] |language=Japanese |access-date=July 24, 2015 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709215141/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201504/24077366.html |archivedate=July 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development began in 2013, a few months after the Japanese release of Takumi's previous project, ''[[Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'', when he was asked to work on a new ''Ace Attorney'' game.&lt;ref name="takumi twitter 2014-04-24 A"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/takumi_gt/status/459310769624997888 |title=巧　舟 on Twitter |last=Takumi |first=Shu |authorlink=Shu Takumi |date=April 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |access-date=September 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724111913/https://twitter.com/takumi_gt/status/459310769624997888 |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, he considered having the game focus on civil trials,&lt;ref name="takumi interview"/&gt; but remembered a game idea he had come up with earlier:&lt;ref name="takumi twitter 2014-04-24 C"/&gt; around 2000, he had the idea of a mystery game in which a detective makes incorrect deductions, and where players have to correct the detective and lead him towards the truth.&lt;ref name="takumi interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/dai-gyakuten/miryoku/m06.html |script-title=ja:巧 舟 スペシャルインタビュー！ |publisher=[[Capcom]] |access-date=July 25, 2015 |language=Japanese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725025606/http://www.capcom.co.jp/dai-gyakuten/miryoku/m06.html |archive-date=July 25, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought it would be fun to combine the idea with ''Ace Attorney'', but did not expect Capcom to accept the idea.&lt;ref name="takumi twitter 2014-04-24 C"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/takumi_gt/status/459311125582983168 |title=巧　舟 on Twitter |last=Takumi |first=Shu |authorlink=Shu Takumi |date=April 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |access-date=September 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724112037/https://twitter.com/takumi_gt/status/459311125582983168 |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="takumi twitter 2014-04-24 D"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/takumi_gt/status/459311452927434752 |title=巧　舟 on Twitter |last=Takumi |first=Shu |authorlink=Shu Takumi |date=April 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |access-date=September 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724112155/https://twitter.com/takumi_gt/status/459311452927434752 |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takumi had also been wanting to make a Sherlock Holmes game for a long time; because of this, Holmes was part of the concept all the way from the start. According to Takumi, he had several reasons for wanting Holmes in the game: both due to the gameplay, and as a way to separate the game from the main ''Ace Attorney'' series, as Holmes is from a different time period than the one the main series games take place in. This led to Takumi thinking about how Japan was at that time, and lead to new possibilities for the game's mysteries.&lt;ref name="takumi interview"/&gt; Initially, Takumi had intended for the game to begin in London, thinking that it would be too much to create a Japanese court only for the prologue; this changed when Nuri said that he thought it should begin in Japan.&lt;ref name="ndream 256"/&gt;

Takumi found it challenging to write dialogue and using expressions appropriate for the way the Japanese language was during the Meiji period, as he had to avoid both too old-fashioned and too modern dialogue. As the Meiji period was a time when the lawyer profession was new in Japan, and when there was a lot of focus on becoming a part of "the new world" and becoming more Western, Takumi made sure to make the game reflect this.&lt;ref name="siliconera 2014-04-24"/&gt; As Takumi had to create a new world for the story to take place in, it took longer than expected to write the game's scenario.&lt;ref name="ndream 256"&gt;{{cite journal |title=大逆転裁判 |issue=256 |language=Japanese |journal=[[Nintendo Dream]] |publisher=Mainichi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist Ryūnosuke's character was based on how the main series protagonist [[Phoenix Wright (character)|Phoenix Wright]] would speak and act if he had lived during the Meiji period. When the development team wrote a list of ideas for names for the protagonist, "Ryūnosuke" was the first one to be suggested; it only took a few seconds for them to decide on it.&lt;ref name="siliconera created ancestor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/03/the-great-ace-attorney-makers-explain-how-they-created-phoenix-wrights-ancestor/ |title=The Great Ace Attorney Makers Explain How They Created Phoenix Wright’s Ancestor |author=Sato |date=June 3, 2015 |publisher=Siliconera |access-date=July 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724085344/http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/03/the-great-ace-attorney-makers-explain-how-they-created-phoenix-wrights-ancestor/ |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Susato is based on the same concept as that of previous ''Ace Attorney'' heroines: she was designed to be a "perfect partner" and fun to spend time with, as the heroines of the series always are by the main characters' side.&lt;ref name="takumi interview"/&gt; her name was decided by choosing [[kanji]] characters that Takumi found pretty.&lt;ref name="siliconera heroine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/10/the-great-ace-attorney-creator-talks-about-how-they-came-up-with-the-heroine/ |title=The Great Ace Attorney Creator Talks About How They Came Up With The Heroine |author=Sato |date=June 10, 2015 |publisher=Siliconera |access-date=July 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724090916/http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/10/the-great-ace-attorney-creator-talks-about-how-they-came-up-with-the-heroine/ |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team decided to change "Sherlock's Watson" from the original, as they thought it would be more interesting if Watson weren't another English gentleman.&lt;ref name="takumi interview"/&gt;

=== Visuals and music ===
Unlike previous ''Ace Attorney'' games, both characters and environments are fully made in 3D.&lt;ref name="Gematsu 2014-09-09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gematsu.com/2014/09/sherlock-holmes-joins-great-ace-attorney |title=Sherlock Holmes joins The Great Ace Attorney |last=Romano |first=Sal |date=September 9, 2014 |publisher=Gematsu |access-date=September 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622215210/http://gematsu.com/2014/09/sherlock-holmes-joins-great-ace-attorney |archive-date=June 22, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Takumi's earlier game ''[[Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective]]'', [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|spotlights]] light up characters while they dance; this was something that had not been done in previous ''Ace Attorney'' games.&lt;ref name="takumi interview"/&gt; [[Motion capture]] of the former [[Takarazuka Revue]] actress Shiotsuki Shuu was used for some animations; as the ''Ace Attorney'' series is known for its poses and animations, this was chosen as a way to make the animation more dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/19/a-look-at-how-the-great-ace-attorneys-animations-were-created/ |title=A Look At How The Great Ace Attorney’s Animations Were Created |author=Sato |date=June 19, 2015 |publisher=Siliconera |access-date=July 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620182137/http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/19/a-look-at-how-the-great-ace-attorneys-animations-were-created/ |archive-date=June 20, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuri designed the characters to make them look simple while also conveying a lot of information. He intended to make the graphics look like illustrations, and wanted to convey the feeling of the materials clothes and items from the Meiji period were made from. Characters were designed to be partially realistic, as realistic animations and facial expressions were needed for the game. Witnesses and jury members were however designed in a more stylized way, to ensure that players immediately recognize them when they see the characters sitting next to each other.&lt;ref name="nuri interview"/&gt;

Ryūnosuke was designed to have "the sharp look of a university student", which went without problems. It did, however, take a long time to design his haircut; Takumi wanted the haircut to be recognizable from Ryūnosuke's silhouette, but said that most people during the Meiji period had simple haircuts.&lt;ref name="siliconera created ancestor"/&gt; Nuri tried designing various haircuts from that time, and designed around 50 variations.&lt;ref name="nuri interview"/&gt; Susato was designed to be an elegant Japanese woman; because of the time period, it was decided that she was to wear a [[kimono]]. Takumi had several ideas for various items she could hold, but it was decided that it was best to keep her design simple,&lt;ref name="siliconera heroine"/&gt; as contrast to the English characters. Several different variations were made for Holmes' design, including "depressed", "cute", "adventurous", "dark", and "sleeping" variations; eventually, they used a variation on how Holmes traditionally is depicted, as contrast to his personality. Additionally, he was given a gun as contrast to Ryūnosuke's sword. Iris' design included gothic elements, as well as elements of a [[mad scientist]], and was created to look good when appearing together with Holmes. Asōgi's clothes were designed with influences from both Japanese and Western cultures. His headband, which flutters in the wind, was something Nuri really wanted in the game, and was something they were only able to do with 3D graphics.&lt;ref name="nuri interview"/&gt; Van Zieks was designed to give off a "dark aura",&lt;ref name="siliconera death god"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/12/the-great-ace-attorneys-rival-prosecutor-was-made-to-be-a-death-god/ |title=The Great Ace Attorney’s Rival Prosecutor Was Made To Be A "Death God" |author=Sato |date=June 12, 2015 |publisher=Siliconera |access-date=July 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615205020/http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/12/the-great-ace-attorneys-rival-prosecutor-was-made-to-be-a-death-god/ |archive-date=June 15, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; with elements of vampires, wolves, and fallen angels.&lt;ref name="nuri interview"/&gt;

When composing the game's music, Kitagawa used a mindset similar to that when composing for older games, trying to work within limitations to create strong music. He focused on creating catchy melodies, and went through a lot of trial and error. Takumi wanted the music to sound more "festive" than the electronic music used in earlier ''Ace Attorney'' games, so he asked Kitagawa to make use of a live orchestra, but with fewer instruments than in the previous game. He also wanted it to sound British, so Kitagawa ended up using sounds similar to [[chamber music]]. They did not think piano sounded right for the game, which led to difficulties in differentiating the instruments, as they only had string and wind instruments; because of this, they ended up introducing Spanish elements to the music. As a reference to how Holmes is known for playing the violin, they also tried using violins in the music.&lt;ref name="ndream 256"/&gt;

== Release ==
The game was released by Capcom for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on July 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gematsu.com/2015/03/the-great-ace-attorney-japanese-release-date-set |title=The Great Ace Attorney Japanese release date set |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |date=March 31, 2015 |publisher=Gematsu |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023043307/http://gematsu.com/2015/03/the-great-ace-attorney-japanese-release-date-set |archive-date=October 23, 2015 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made available in various different editions.

{{For|the pre-Roman people on the Iberian peninsula|Indigetes}}
{{Distinguish|indigitamenta}}
{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Georg Wissowa]]'s terminology, the '''''di indigetes''''' or '''''indigites''''' were [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]] not adopted from other religions, as distinguished from the ''[[Novensiles|di novensides]]''. Wissowa thus regarded the ''indigetes'' as "indigenous" gods, and the ''novensides'' as "newcomer gods". Ancient usage, however, does not treat the two terms as a dichotomy, nor maintain this clear-cut distinction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "From Bachofen to Cumont," in ''A.D. Momigliano: Studies on Modern Scholarship''  (University of California Press, 1994), p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Wissowa's interpretation is no longer widely accepted and the meaning remains uncertain.

In [[classical Latin]], the epithet ''Indiges'', singular in form, is applied to [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] ''(Sol Indiges)'' and to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] of [[Lavinium]], later identified with [[Aeneas]]. One theory holds that it means the "speaker within", and goes back to before the recognition of divine persons. Another, which the [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]] holds more likely, is that it means "[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invoked]]" in the sense of "pointing to", as in the related word ''[[indigitamenta]]''.

In [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan literature]], the ''di indigites'' are often associated with ''di patrii'' and appear in lists of local divinities (that is, divinities particular to a place).&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Vergil]], ''Georgics'' 1.498f.; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 15.861–867; Richard Gordon, "Roman Inscriptions 1995–2000," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 93 (2003), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Servius]] notes that [[Praeneste]] had its own ''indigetes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D7%3Acommline%3D678 7.678.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence pertaining to ''di indigites'' is rarely found outside Rome and Lavinium, but a fragmentary [[epigraphy|inscription]] from Aletrium (modern [[Alatri]], north of [[Province of Frosinone|Frosinone]]) records offerings to ''di Indicites'' including [[Fucinus]], a local lake-god; [[Summanus]], a god of nocturnal lightning; Fiscellus, otherwise unknown, but perhaps a local mountain god; and the Tempestates, weather deities. The inscription has been interpreted as a list of local or nature deities to whom [[transhumant]] shepherds should make propitiary offers.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gordon "Roman Inscriptions 1995–2000" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 93 (2003) pp. 266–267 and note 348; G. L. Gregori, L. Galli ''Donaria: le offerte agli dei'' Museo Civico di Alatri, Frosinone, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Wissowa listed 33 ''di indigetes'', including two collectives in the plural, the [[Lares]] of the estate and the [[Lemures]] of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Wacher, ''The Roman World'' (Routledge, 1990, originally published 1987), p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; Any list of ''indigetes'', however, is conjectural; Raimo Anttila points out that "we do not know the list of the ''di indigetes''."&lt;ref&gt;Raimo Antilla, ''Greek and Indo-European Etymology'' (John Benjamins, 2000), p. 180 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zScAS4HIGAC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22di+indigetes%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=66#v=onepage&amp;q=%22di%20indigetes%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship on the ''di indigetes''==
{{cleanup|section|date=September 2010}}

C. Koch, A. Grenier, H. J. Rose, [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], E. Vetter, K. Latte, G. Radke, R. Schilling and more recently R. Anttilla have made contributions to the enquiry into the meaning of the word ''Indiges'' and on the original nature of the ''di indigetes''.

Particularly complete is Carl Koch's analysis&lt;ref&gt;Carl Koch ''Gestirnverehrung im alten Italien. Sol Indiges und der Kreis der Di Indigetes'' in ''Frankfurter Studien zur Religion und Kultur der Antike'' Frankfurt am Mein III, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; which centres mainly on the question of ''Sol Indiges''.
Koch has argued that ''Sol Indiges'' is the god to which is devoted the ''Agonium'' of December 11 on the grounds of the fragment of the ''fasti'' discovered at Ostia in 1921 which reads ag]ON IND[igeti CIL XIV 4547 and of Johannes Lydus ''de Mensibus'' IV 155: ''...Agonalia daphneephorooi kai genarcheeei Heliooi...'': Agonalia for the laurel bearer and primaeval ancestor Sol, that Lydus compares to a similar custom in Athens terminating with laurel bearing. ''Sol Indiges'' had two festivals, the other one being on August 9 on the Quirinal. He remarks too that the festival of December 11 is in correspondence with the ''Matralia'' of June 11 dedicated to Mater Matuta, considered the goddess of dawn and, in the ritual, the aunt of the sun, son of the night. Koch was the first to advance the hypothesis of the Sol Indiges as the Forefather (Stammvater) of the Roman nation.

Albert Grenier has contributed a paper&lt;ref&gt;A. Grenier "Indigetes et Novensiles" in ''Boletim de Filologia''  Bd. 11 (1950) supplem. pp. 192–205.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounds the results obtained by Koch and pays more attention to the original nature of the di Indigetes. As Koch had already done he cites the formula of the oath of loyalty to M. Livius Drusus in 91 B.C. by a Latin chief preserved by Diodorus
Siculus&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus ''Bibliotheca Historica'' XXXVII 11&lt;/ref&gt; in which are mentioned, after Iuppiter Capitolinus, Vesta and Mars Pater, ''Helios genarchees'' and ''euergetin zooin te kai phytoon Geen'', 'the mother Earth which benefits animals and plants'. Grenier thinks ''Sol Indiges'' and the ''Good Mother Earth'', whom he interprets to be the ''Mater Matuta'' of the ''Matralia'',&lt;ref&gt;Grenier cites J. Vendryes ''Teutomatos'' in ''C.-R. Acad. Inscr.'' 1939 p. 466–480 to support this interpretation against that of ''Mater matuta'' as the goddess of dawn. The root of Matuta which has given ''matutinus''  morning time, would originally mean ''maturus'', ripe as favourable time or right time for birth, thence for extension would come its meaning of morning as the most favourable time of the day.&lt;/ref&gt; would be the ''di Indigetes'' of the ''devotio'' of Decius Mus. He goes on to analyse the other testimonies related to the cult of the ''di indigetes'' found in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]. The first is the inscription on the monument on the Numicius supposed to be dedicated to ''Aeneas Iuppiter Indiges'' which reads: "Of the Father God chthonios who rules the flow of the Numicius". Grenier remarks the inscription does not mention Aeneas and is in fact just a small sanctuary of the god of the river. In this same region Pliny (see above) mentions a ''Sol Indiges'' and Dionysius describes a monument called at his time ''Sanctuary of the Sun'', made up by two altars on an East–West line by a marsh: it was believed to have been erected by Aeneas as a token of thanksgiving for the miracle of the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Dion. Hal. I 55&lt;/ref&gt; On this evidence Grenier concludes that ''Sol Indiges'' is connected to Lavinium and to the cult of the ''Penates publici'' of Rome, this fact being supported by Varro: ''Lavinium ibi dii penates nostri''.&lt;ref&gt;Varro Lingua Latina V 144&lt;/ref&gt; This identification is further supported by the tradition that the new consuls upon entering office sacrificed on this ''Sanctuary of the sun'' to Iuppiter Indiges and by the fact that the formulae of the oaths never mention the ''di indigetes'' along with Iuppiter: e.g. the Table of Bantia reads: "Iuranto per Iovem deosque Penates".&lt;ref&gt;CIL I n. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Grenier concludes from such evidence that the ''Penates'' were included within the ''indigetes''.&lt;ref&gt;The fact that in imperial times the formulae of the oaths substituted the name of the ''princeps'' for the mention of the ''Penates'' points to the origin of the cult of the ''genius'' of the emperor in that of ''Penates publici''. Cf. G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique '' Paris 1974, part II, chapt. 3; It. tr. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman ''Penates publici'' were represented as two male youngsters similar to the Dioscures and identified with the gods brought by Aeneas from Troy to Latium.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus I 64 and 65&lt;/ref&gt; As the true identity of the Indigetes was secret to avoid exauguration&lt;ref&gt;Festus p. 94 L: "Indigetes, dii quorum nomina vulgari non licet". Servius ''Aen.'' II 351"...Romani celatum esse voluerunt in cuius dei tutela urbs Roma sit et iure pontificum cautum est ne suis nominibus dii romani appellarentur ne exaugurari possint".&lt;/ref&gt; Grenier considers a later development the identification with Aeneas and Romulus and thinks the original ''indigetes'' were naturalistic gods, forces like the sun, the earth and the waters which make the wheat and the children grow. Finally he concludes they should have been the ''turba deorum'' of the ''indigitamenta'' which in his view expressed the animistic nature of the most ancient Roman religion.

A relevant point in the discussion of the sources that Grenier has though overlooked is the fact that the inscription quoted in Greek by Dionysius (I 64 end),  ''Patros Theoy Chthonioy...'', must translate Latin ''Dei Patrii Indigetis''.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassos ''Roman Antiquities'' Loeb Classical Library I 64 n. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; For a correspondence see the Greek interpretation of [[Tages]] as ''Hermes Chthonios''.&lt;ref&gt;Iohannes Lydus ''De Ostentis'' 2–3; Earnest Cary ''Loeb Classical Library'' 1937–1950 Harvard U. P.: Dion. Hal. ''Roman Antiquities'' I 64 n. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar conclusions have been reached by [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]] in his book ''Roman Dynamism'' Oxford 1947, chapter III "Numen, Novensiles and Indigetes", p.&amp;nbsp;73–103, as Grenier acknowledges.

H. J. Rose has refused Koch's interpretation of the di Indigetes as the primordial ancestors (Stammvater) of the Roman nation on the grounds that the formula of Diodorus is not a Roman original but is framed along the Greek fashion and looks to reflect a Greek model.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose ''Harvard Theological Review'' 30 1937 p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Latte&lt;ref&gt;K. Latte ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1960 pp. 43–44 and 56.&lt;/ref&gt; has supported Carl Koch's thesis that the most ancient Roman religious concepts were based on the natural forces of the sun, moon and waters. He cites and quotes the invocations to the goddess of the Moon at the beginning of every month by the ''[[pontifex minor]]'', who repeated for five or seven times the invocation: "''Dies te quinque calo Iuno Covella''" or when the Nonae were on the seventh day: "''Septem dies te calo Iuno Covella''".&lt;ref&gt;Varro Lingua Latina VI 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The invocation to the god of the ''Tiber'' during the summer draught: "''Adesto Tiberine, cum tuis undis''". These invocations he supposes were justified by a faith in the magic power of words. ''Pater Indiges'' is attested by [[Solinus]] (II 15) as referred to Aeneas after his disappearance on the Numicius and Dionysius too makes reference to the Numicius. Latte thinks that it must be the same cult and the question is whether in augustan times the original Pater Indiges was transformed into ''Iuppiter Indiges''. Whereas Dionysius's text may imply the latter interpretation to be the right one Latte thinks the material is insufficient to reach a decision.

The other occurrence of ''Indiges'' in the singular is that of ''Sol Indiges'' of which two festivals are known as well as the location of his cult on the Quirinal (from the Fasti)&lt;ref&gt;CIL I (second ed.) p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; one of which is the ''Ag]on. Ind[igeti'' mentioned in the Fasti of Ostia and in Lydus ''De Mensibus'' IV 155. Latte argues that the date of this latter festival does not allow to be brought into any correspondence with the yearly course of the sun, but could perhaps be the day on which sowing should be completed, citing Columella,&lt;ref&gt;Columella ''De Re Rustica'' II 8, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; thus the sacrifice should refer to the power of the sun on vegetation.

Latte concludes that by putting all the above elements together it could be argued that ''Indiges'' might be traced to a representation in which man requests the god to ensure the safety of his sowing. As ''Numicus'' has its parallel with ''Tiber'' so ''Sol'' has its own one in the goddess of the Moon. The naive faith in the influence of celestial bodies has countless parallels even e.g. in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius V 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte goes on to say that besides these two there are only instances in the plural which were already not understood by the ancient in Varro's times.&lt;ref&gt;Serv. ''Aen.'' VII 678; XII 794; Schol. Bern. Verg. ''Georg.'' I 498; Fest. exc 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The poets of the augustan times had just a vague idea that the word was an archaism that entailed a strong ancient Roman taint in appealing to the gods, without any clear idea of its original meaning. Latte refuses Wissowa's position that it was a central concept in Roman theology, also on the grounds of its irrelevance in the Roman calendar which reflects the most ancient known religious historical representation. The inscription from Sora dating to 4 B. C. could be the issue of augustan restoration and not a proof of an original ''Iuppiter indiges''. Another inscription from Ardea mentions ''novem deivo''&lt;ref&gt;Vetter 364b; E. Vetter "Di Novensiles, di Indigetes" in ''Indogermanische Forschungen'' 1956 p. 1ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and the context clearly does not allow the interpretation of ''newly imported'', disproving Wissowa's assumptions.

Latte has also enquired into the etymology of the word ''indiges''. He recalls the attempt by Krestchmer&lt;ref&gt;P. Krestchmer ''Glotta'' '''31''', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; to explain it with ''digitus'' (finger) which meets difficulties because in Rome one did not use fingers in invoking the gods and in the common original exit of the ancient singular.&lt;ref&gt;Leumann ''Glotta'' '''36''', 1957, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient connection with ''ag-ye'', ''aio'' by Corssen is based on ''indigitare'' (frequentative as ''agitare'' for ''agere''). However more recent discussions have asked this interpretation into question as such formations are usually found only for monosyllabic verbal themes showing a vocalic shift with a preverbal, such as ''comes'', ''superstes'', ''trames'', which ''aio'' excludes; moreover they have in Latin an active meaning. Also the hypothesis of a retrograde formation from ''indigitare''  meets both linguistic and semantic difficulties: the construction with ''agere'' in the meaning of ''rendering oneself present'' implies an impossible formation from a consonantic shift and the semantics of ''agere'' to render oneself present is highly unlikely for ancient times.

Another relevant remark by Latte concerns the belief in the effecacy of the divine appellatives, which are sometimes the same for different gods such as ''Heries Iunonis'' and ''Heres Martea''.&lt;ref&gt;Festus p. 221 L; Ennius ''Annales'' 104: "Nerienem Mavortis et Herem".&lt;/ref&gt; The Iguvine Tables mention a ''ahtu iuvio'' and a ''ahtu marti'' interpreted as ''Actui Iovio'' and ''Actui Martio'' to which sacrifices are offered.&lt;ref&gt;T. I. IIa 10.11&lt;/ref&gt; Latte remarks that here the offer is made to the abstract concept of the virtue or power of the god and not to the god himself. Other gods had special entities representing their power as in Rome ''Salacia Neptuni'' and ''Lua Saturni''.

Latte finally refuses the interpretation ''indigetes divi'' for Greek ''daimones'' found in the translation by Macrobius&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Ad Somnium Scipionis'' I 9, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; of Hesiod ''Opera'' 121 considering it influenced by late time speculations. The connexion of the gentilician cult of the sun of the [[Aurelii]] with that of ''Sol Indiges'' is impossible to prove.

Most recently glottologist Raimo Anttilla has made renewed attempts into the enquiry of the original meaning of the word ''indiges'' in his book on protoindoeuropean root *ag.&lt;ref&gt;R. Anttilla ''Greek and Indoeuropean etymology in action: Protoindoeuropean *ag'' Amsterdam and New York 2000 p. 171 and 180–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

He thinks all the etymological and formal impasses mentioned by Latte could be overcome if one makes the basis of ''indiges'' instead of verb ''aio'' (I say) verb ''ago'' in the sense of to impel, to drive, in this case to drive from within (''*endo agentes''). The action of the gods would be that of driving man just as man drives cattle e.g. also in sacrifice (agonium, etymology already cited by Ovid in his ''Fasti'' I 319 ff).

Anttilla bases his analysis on the results of Latte, Radke,&lt;ref&gt;G. Radke ''Die Goetter Altitaliens'' Muenster 1965 pp. 25–35&lt;/ref&gt; Schilling and Ancellotti and Cerri.
&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling ''Rites, cultes et dieux de Rome'' Paris 1979 p.63; Ancellotti &amp; Cerri ''Le tavole di Gubbio e la civilta' umbra'' Perugia 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He agrees with Schilling's view that the concept underwent changes and its original meaning should be kept different from its later history. Anttilla starts considering the coincidence of ''Indiges'' with an ''Agonium'' on December 11 and its corresponce with the festival of ''Mater Matuta'' on June 11. He thinks there is sufficient evidence to say that we have to do with a solar cult centred on Lavinium connecting the sun with water and earth. ''Sol Indiges'' is ''Pater Indiges'', ''divus pater'' i.e. ''Iuppiter Indiges'', the highest divine power, the one which makes nature produce food. This impelling action seems close to ''Aja Ekapad'' and [[Savitr]] as variant terms for the sun in connexion with other natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Dumezil had already cited Savitr as a parallel to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] in ''La religion roamine archaique'' Paris 1974 part II chapt. 5; It. tr. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; A similar tint is in [[Indra]] as [[Samaja]] gathering booty, the warrior aspect of economy. It is noteworthy that AGON IND repeat the same root *ag. The Italic evidence for sacrificial and divine power under *ag is plentiful. Umbrian divinities of action, ''ahtu'', dative singular (from *ag-t-eu) are part of the sacrificial actions of Iuppiter and Mars, whereas with Cerfe, growth (genitive singular of *ker-s-o-) the action is assigned to the other gods, e.g. Cerfus Martius 'the principle of vegetative growth in the sphere of Mars'&lt;ref&gt;Ancellotti &amp; Cerri ''Le tavole di Gubbio e la civilta' umbra'' Perugia 1996 p. 188 and 192 ; Latte ''Roemische Religionsgechichte'' Muenchen 1960 p.44 and 56;&lt;/ref&gt; the equivalent of [[Ares]] [[Aphneius|Aphneios]] in Arcadia. The god of creation [[Brahman]] is called [[ajana]], i.e. driver, instigator. It is a general human religious concept that men drive animals and god drives men. Since ''Indiges'' as driver-in makes sense, from this would also stem the meaning of ''indigitare'', ''indigitamenta''. Carrying out a ritual action results in driving, here ''agere'' and ''agonalis''.

On the basis of this big picture Anttilla attempts to draw a more precise conclusion and overcome the remaining formal difficulties. He argues that holding to the old interpretation of ''indiges'' as 'the caller (forth)' and interpreting the uncertain Umbrian consonant-stem dative plural ''acetus'' 'to the callers forth' as Ancellotti and Cerri do is doubtful and the etymology would be better represented by an *ag- drive than by an *ag-ye say, as the supposed root *kei/*ki is a moving root too and not a calling root.&lt;ref&gt;On this point compare Dumezil's analysis of the etymology of goddess Ceres and of Cerus Manus, the ''good creator'' found in Paul's ''Festi epitome'' p. 249 L 2nd, perhaps an indigitation of Ianus, in ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris 1974, part II, chapt. 5; It. tr. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Radke has also proposed the possibility of *en-dhigh-et- grade 0 as in ''figulus'' (from IE stem DHEIG) as a nomen agentis menaing 'forming, shaping, generating from within', close to impelling.

To support his analysis Anttilla cites a medical term ''indigo/indigere'' meaning to drive bodily fluids, which is not attested in ancient texts. A hard tumor (scirosis) 'fit ex glutinoso et spisso humore quod confluendo ita membris indigitur ut insitus locis ubi considerit unum esse videatur':&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Niedermann 1944 p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; the tumor is formed by humours that run together to a certain location by pushing the limbs from the inside so as it looks one thing with the limb where they set. So tumors are pushed in as tubers and plants. Although the lexicographic evidence is flimsy Anttilla thinks it is important owing to the close relation between medicine and religion. ''Indiges, indigere'' would hint to something coming out and bringing forth an end result (pushing into a state). Drive in is at the same time come out. The richness of nature deities or their epithets (ahtu) brings about the beneficial result of life/food. The coordinator would be Iuppiter Indiges, the Impeller corresponding to ''Zeus Ageetoor'' at Sparta.

Finally Anttilla considers the worst formal difficulty left that of the suffix -et- and its vowel not rising in indigetes, as remarked by Radke p.&amp;nbsp;151. Similar formations are merges/mergitis sheaf, ales/alitis winged, mansues/mansuetis tame, seges/segetis cornfield, harvest, produce, two of which pertain to the growing and reaping domain; Anttilla thinks in archaic religious language peculiar forms are often preserved. ''Indigitare'' evoking gods would be to drive them in for our needs and ''Sol Indiges'' would be the force that drives all of nature, particularly food. Radke and Ancellotti e Cerri interpret the -t- form as a kind of active participle or agent noun and this would be the only possibility. Latte too gives as a background for ''indiges'' the general appeal to natural forces in Roman religion, e.g. the summoning of the Moon goddess and other instances.

=== Archeological finds ===
At Lavinium in 1958 was excavated an inscription dated to the 3rd century BC reading ''Lare Aineia'' and in 1971 a templet built over a princely [[cenotaph]] in the Oriental style of the 7th century BC{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} probably on the site of a ''[[heroon]]'' described by [[Dionysius Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius Halicarnassus]], I 64, 5; P. Sommella "Das Heroon des Aeneas und die Topographie des antiken Lavinium" in ''Gymnasium'' 81, 4 1974 pp.273 ff.; Y. Bonnefoy and W. Doniger ''Roman and European Mythology'' Chicago 1992 p.57: "This indicates the Lastin saga of Aeneas must have spread and developed between the 6th and 5th centuries probably around the sanctuaries of Lavinium and concomitant with the first Greek versions of the coming of Aeneas to Italy, Hellanicus in Dionysius of Hal. I 48".&lt;/ref&gt; This would support an ancient assimilation of Aeneas to ''Indiges Pater''.

'''Décollage''', in [[art]], is the opposite of [[collage]]; instead of an image being built up of all or parts of existing images, it is created by cutting, tearing away or otherwise removing, pieces of an original image.&lt;ref name="ArtLex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ See D-De] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, ArtLex Art Dictionary. Retrieved 2007-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The French word "décollage" translates into English literally as "take-off" or "to become unglued" or "to become unstuck". Examples of décollage include [[Surrealist techniques|etrécissements]] and [[cut-up technique]]. A similar technique is the ''lacerated poster'', a poster in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing to a greater or lesser degree the poster or posters underneath.

==Practitioners of décollage==
An important practitioner of décollage was [[Wolf Vostell]]. Wolf Vostell noticed the word "décollage" in [[Le Figaro]] on 6 September 1954, where it was used to describe the simultaneous take-off and crash of an aeroplane. He appropriated the term to signify an aesthetic philosophy, applied also to the creation of live performances, Vostell’s working concept of décollage, was the Dé-coll/age and begun in 1954, is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from [[Media (communication)|media]]. He also called his [[Happening]]s Dé-coll/age-Happening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturstiftung.de/publikationen/arsprototo/ausgaben/3-2013/mediale-wanderungen/ Wolf Vostell, Dé-coll/age-Happening]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Beuys Brock Vostell. Aktion Demonstration Partizipation 1949-1983.''. ZKM-Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie, Hatje Cantz, Karlsruhe, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-7757-3864-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatjecantz.de/beuys-brock-vostell-6226-0.html Beuys Brock Vostell]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most celebrated artists of the décollage technique in France, especially of the lacerated poster, are [[François Dufrene]], [[Jacques Villeglé]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Raymond Hains]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Straram, "La veuve blanche et noire un peu détournée" (Paris Sens &amp; Tonka, 2006), 21–22, 81–82; "Figures de la négation" ([[Saint-Etienne Métropole: Musée d'Art Moderne]], 2004), 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Hains used the lacerated poster as an artistic intervention that sought to critique the newly emerged advertising technique of large-scale advertisements. In effect his decollage destroys the [[advertisement]], but leaves its remnants on view for the public to contemplate. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously. These four artists were part of a larger group in the 1960s called [[Nouveau Réalisme]] (New realism), Paris' answer to the American [[Pop Art]] movement. This was a mostly Paris-based group (which included [[Yves Klein]] and [[Christo]] and was created with the help of critic [[Pierre Restany]]), although Rotella was Italian and moved back to Italy shortly after the group was formed. Some early practitioners sought to extract the defaced poster from its original context and to take it into areas of poetry, photography, or painting.

Lacerated posters are also closely related to [[Richard Genovese]]'s practice of excavations. Contemporary artists employing similar décollage techniques are [[Mark Bradford]], Michael Viviani and [[Brian Dettmer]], who employs a novel method of decollage by removing material from books, leaving behind select images and text to form sculptural collages. Also there is Fizz Fieldgrass, an English artist, who uses [[digital media|digitally]] enhanced photographic images, overlaid by duplication on either Japanese Conservation Grade or fine [[Paper Mulberry]], torn and rolled back to reveal other layers generating the three-dimensional image.

Décollage is now commonly used in the French language in regard to aviation (as when an aeroplane lifts off the ground). More recently the term has been used in space flight; the web page for [[ESA]] indicates its use equivalent to "We have lift-off!" at a [[NASA]] launch center.

==Déchirage==
Déchirage (from the French, déchirer: 'to tear') is an artistic style that distresses paper to create a three-dimensional patchwork. It is a form of décollage, taking the original image apart physically through incision, parting and peeling away. [[Romare Bearden]] (b. 1911 – d. 1988) the African American collage artist used déchirage as an important element of his [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;'Bearden as Abstract Expressionist' http://www.courses.vcu.edu/ENG-mam/bio3.htm Maalek Marshall, Virginia Commonwealth University webpages.&lt;/ref&gt; The first public display of "Photographic" Déchirage (the tearing of layers of digital photographs to create a distinctive three-dimensional image) was at the ''Art of Giving''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saatchionline.com/art/view/artist/162075/art/91318#comment-76575-91318 Sea-cloth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220105041/http://www.saatchiart.com/art/Collage-Sea-cloth/162075/91318/view|archivedate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibition at the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

It can be argued that the depliage is a form of décollage, as it is made by initially removing the staples from a staple-bound [[magazine]].

'''''Evan Almighty''''' is a 2007 American [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[disaster film|disaster]] [[comedy film]] and the [[sequel|stand-alone sequel]] and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' (2003). The film was directed by [[Tom Shadyac]], written by  [[Steve Oedekerk]], based on the characters created by [[Steve Koren]] and Mark O'Keefe from the original film, and starring [[Steve Carell]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Lauren Graham]] and [[John Goodman]].

Production of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of [[Noah's Ark]]. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive comedy film]] ever at the time; it was later overtaken by ''[[Men in Black 3]]''. In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.

The film grossed less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, and received generally negative reviews.&lt;ref name="RTintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evan_almighty/|title=Evan Almighty|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MetaCritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/evanalmighty?q=Evan%20Almighty|title=Evan Almighty|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evan Almighty'' was also notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] stressed that the animals' conditions were acceptable.

==Plot==
Newly elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], former local television news reporter Evan Baxter ([[Steve Carell]]) leaves his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]] and later moves to the fictional community of Prestige Crest, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to [[God in Christianity|God]] ([[Morgan Freeman]]) to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan ([[Lauren Graham]]), also prays that she, Evan and their three sons Dylan ([[Johnny Simmons]]), Jordan ([[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]]) and Ryan ([[Jimmy Bennett]]) will be closer together as a family. On his first day, Evan receives a letter from Congressman Chuck Long ([[John Goodman]]), who provides him with a prime office and the opportunity to join Long as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:

#Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name, and ancient tools and [[gopher wood]] are delivered there.
#Animals start follow Evan around even into Congress.
#He uncontrollably starts growing a beard that would never go away no matter how many times he shaves.
#The number 614 starts appearing throughout his daily routines.

Evan comes to realize that this number actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the [[Book of Genesis]], where God instructs [[Noah]] to build [[Noah's Ark|an ark]] in preparation for a coming flood. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan in various guises, assuring him a flood is coming and the only way Evan can save the world will be to save his community instead. Evan himself decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, though Joan sees this as a mid-life crisis.

Although Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his staffers Rita Daniels ([[Wanda Sykes]]), Marty Stringer ([[John Michael Higgins]]) and Eugene Tennanbaum ([[Jonah Hill]]), and the animals that follow him everywhere become very disruptive. God reappears and provides Evan a robe, though warns him the flood will come mid-day on September 22. When Evan dons the robe, he finds he is unable to wear any other clothes, the robe seemingly displacing anything else he wears. Outraged by Evan's slothful appearance, Long fires him and his name is removed from the Public Land Act bill. Evan suspects God had him fired to spend more time on the ark, and continues to do so, becoming a public spectacle and of ridicule. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him, although she encounters God in disguise as a waiter at a diner. After hearing her concern about Evan's mental state, God assures Joan that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to help Evan finish the ark to prepare for the flood.

As September 22 nears, many people have come out to support Evan's project, including the staffers he had. One shows Evan researches that he had found on Long, specifically that he had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam. The staffers suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. On September 22, with the ark complete, the police try to destroy the ark with a wrecking ball, as it violates land codes. As animals start to amass near the ark, and rain falls, Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing, destroying Prestige Crest. He warns the onlookers to either evacuate or get aboard the ark as he loads his entire family and the gathered animals aboard. The dam indeed breaks, destroying all the houses of Prestige Crest, but Evan's foresight saves all the lives there. The ark later floods the streets of [[Washington D.C.]] and comes to its final destination in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] during the controversial vote of the Public Land Act Bill, interrupting it. This results in Evan accusing Long's cost-cutting for the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill.

Long is being put under investigation for his profiteering and ethics, while all the animals are returned to their natural habitats. Evan is finally reinstated in Congress, all the changes forced on him by God no longer remaining. Evan re-encounters God during the hike, and expresses concern that he did not need to build the ark to show the problem with Long's dam, but God retorts that Evan's life is now perfect as he prayed for, being closer to his family and having changed the world for the better through his one [[random act of kindness|Act of Random Kindness]] (ARK). During the film's closing credits, God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience: "Thou shalt do the dance." This is later followed by a footage depicting the film's cast and crew members dancing to [[C+C Music Factory]]'s hit song "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]."

==Production==

===Screenplay===
The film's screenplay was originally titled ''The Passion of the Ark'' and was written by [[Bobby Florsheim]] and [[Josh Stolberg]].&lt;ref name="KillerMoviess"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |publisher=Killer Movies |title=Columbia Get "The Passion Of The Ark" |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp1AMoVu?url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004. The script was sold to [[Sony Pictures]] in a deal worth $2,500,000 plus a percentage of the profits, a record for a [[spec script]] from previously unproduced writers.&lt;ref name="DavePhil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cornerofthesky.com/dsp.htm |title=About Us - Dave Phillips |publisher=Corner of the Sky |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp1LWdp1?url=http://www.cornerofthesky.com/dsp.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Studios]] immediately made a deal to co-produce the script with [[Sony]] and have [[Steve Oedekerk]] rewrite it into the sequel to ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''. Steve Oedekerk had been involved with ''Bruce Almighty'' as an executive producer and co-writer of the screenplay (with [[Steve Koren]] and Mark O'Keefe, who wrote the story).  The studio later discarded the original ''The Passion of the Ark'' script completely, and Oedekerk fashioned a new script from scratch (only he received final credit on the finished film as screenwriter). Jim Carrey was asked to reprise his role as Bruce in the sequel and, when he declined, director Tom Shadyac convinced Steve Carell to accept the leading role.&lt;ref name="JoBlo3333"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sampson |first=Mike |url=http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=8433 |title=Carell back to Almighty |publisher=JoBlo |date=August 26, 2005 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202100600/http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=8433 |archivedate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadyac, reflecting on the first film, stated "[Carell] delivered some of the funniest stuff in the movie. We thought, 'Why not take that character and spin him off into a different film?'"&lt;ref name="UPEA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/3843/notes.pdf |format=PDF|title=Evan Almighty|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202140150/http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/3843/notes.pdf |archivedate = December 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Jim Carrey]] declined to reprise his role from the original ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''. Although Carrey did act in a [[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls|sequel to ''Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'']], he has said that he is "not a big fan of doing the same character twice."&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-06-22-carell-side_x.htm |title=Carell, Freeman are cut-ups on the 'Evan Almighty' set |work=[[USA Today]] |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp1yxQLA?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-06-22-carell-side_x.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the third time a sequel has been made to a film for which Carrey declined to reprise his role; the other being ''[[Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd|Dumb and Dumberer]]'' and ''[[Son of the Mask]]''.

===Budget===
The initial budget, at approximately $140 million, led ''Evan Almighty'' to become the most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million.&lt;ref name="LorMun"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorenza |last=Muñoz |title=Budget Overruns of Biblical Proportions |url=//www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-fi-evan9oct09,0,2164715.story?coll=cl-movies |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 9, 2006 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019065820/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-fi-evan9oct09%2C0%2C2164715.story?coll=cl-movies |archivedate=October 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million.&lt;ref name="NYTimesBO" /&gt; The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to [[Universal Studios]].&lt;ref name="LorMun" /&gt; Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] area.&lt;ref name="StarEx"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kitchin |first=Jessica |title="Evan Almighty" helping area businesses boom |url=http://www.starexponent.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=CSE/MGArticle/CSE_MGArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1137836450841 |publisher=Star Exponent.com |date=May 31, 2006 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp2I2Ea2?url=http://www2.starexponent.com/cse/news/local/article/evan_almighty_helping_area_businesses_boom/13581/ |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ark design and construction===
[[File:EvanAlmightyarkconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ark being prepared for filming a scene]]
Construction of the ark began in January 2006 and the scenes involving the ark were shot in a [[Crozet, Virginia]] subdivision called Old Trail.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt; The ark was designed to meet the actual measurements of the [[Noah's Ark|biblical ark]], measuring {{convert|450|ft|m|0}} long, {{convert|80|ft|m|0}} wide, and {{convert|51|ft|m|0}} high.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; The ark's layout was also based on pictures in several children's books that crew members had read in their childhoods.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt; When the characters were filmed during the day building the ark or were on location elsewhere, crew members would further construct the ark at night.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt; A concrete base was built to support the weight of the large ark; after filming was completed, the ark was taken down in a week, and the base in another week.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt;

In disassembling the set, everything that was salvageable from the ark was donated to [[Habitat for Humanity]]. "Leave no trace" was the slogan used by the director as part of the DVD's bonus features, "The Almighty Green Set".

===Costumes and filming locations===
[[File:Evan Almighty Ark.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The fully constructed ark is at the center of the image with a downcast sky. A large ramp on the left side of the image is leading up into the ark. In the foreground of the image is a paved street.|The Ark used for filming was located in [[Crozet, Virginia]].]]
[[File:Evanark.jpg|left|thumb|Evan and God sitting in the half-built Ark. Research was done to give Evan's costume an authentic, ancient look.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt; Some controversy focused on God being portrayed in human form.&lt;ref name="Malaysia" /&gt;]]
To create Evan's beard and long hair, three designers would take three hours each day adding individual hairs using prosthetic [[adhesive]] and making Carell wear custom wigs. The wigs consisted of both human and [[yak]] hair.&lt;ref name="USATodaybeard" /&gt; With his new look, Carell was sometimes nicknamed "Mountain Man", "[[Retrosexual]]", or "[[Theodore Kaczynski|Unabomber]]."&lt;ref name="USATodaybeard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-05-04-evan-almighty_x.htm|title=First look: Steve Carell lets his hair down for "Almighty"|date=May 4, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his costumes, designers spoke with [[textile]] experts, researched historical information on the clothing that was likely worn at the time of Noah, and used aged fibers for the clothing.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt;

Scenes for the film were filmed in various locations in [[Virginia]], including areas in and around [[Crozet, Virginia|Crozet]], [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], and [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], though some filming did take place at Universal Studios in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref name="Welcome to Huntsville"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael L. |last=Owens |url=http://www.newsvirginian.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WNV/MGArticle/WNV_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1137835569845 |title=Welcome to Huntsville |work=The News Virginian |date=April 25, 2006 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210015540/http://www.newsvirginian.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WNV%2FMGArticle%2FWNV_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1137835569845 |archivedate=February 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
For the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] used throughout the film, companies [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm &amp; Hues]] (R&amp;H) and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) developed different parts of the film. R&amp;H focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld1"&gt;{{cite news|last=McLean |first=Thomas J. |title=Evan Almighty: Choreographing CG Water of Biblical Proportions |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/ievan-almightyi-choreographing-cg-water-biblical-proportions |publisher=Animation World Network |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp2VBm3X?url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/ievan-almightyi-choreographing-cg-water-biblical-proportions |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where you were going to get a really long look at the water and what it was doing."&lt;ref name="VFXWorld1" /&gt; The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]''.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld1" /&gt; [[Lighting]] was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] stage, and the [[visual effects]] company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld1" /&gt;

[[File:Huntsville Festival of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Signage on a lamppost in downtown Waynesboro, Virginia for ''Evan Almighty'' filming.]]
Rhythm &amp; Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt; R&amp;H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt; In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&amp;H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months. Andy Arnett, the animation supervisor, declared that "The research was extensive. It took six or seven months to perfect the look and feel of the animals before we had the first shot out the door."&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt;

For the scene in Congressman Long's office, CGI was used the entire time for the fish that follow Evan around from the [[Aquarium|fish tank]]. [[Cafe FX]], the visual effects company hired for the scene, ordered ten different kinds of [[tropical fish]] from a local store and studied their movements to imitate them on screen using computer animation. Jeff Goldman, the visual effects supervisor, stated "Early in the sequence, we mimicked the actual behavior of the fish in our animation, but as the scene plays out, the fish are a counterpoint to Steve Carell's comedic timing."&lt;ref name="VFXW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Desowitz |first=Bill |title=CafeFX Swims with the Fish for Evan Almighty |url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=3631a5a1&amp;atype=news&amp;id=20334 |publisher=Animation World Network |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp2i8wZ9?url=http://www.awn.com/news/visual-effects/cafefx-swims-fish-evan-almighty |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
In late May during production, the media learned that director Tom Shadyac angrily complained to producers, saying "I'm not seeing any ads, and I don't know why. I'm not getting answers. People are giving me information that isn't true ... I'm only hearing about all the other summer movies, and nothing about mine."&lt;ref name="Cinem"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinberg |first=Scott |title="Evan Almighty" Director Clashes With Studio Over Advertising, Source Says |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/06/03/evan-almighty-director-clashes-with-studio-over-advertising-s/ |publisher=Cinematical |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp2mbomM?url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/06/03/evan-almighty-director-clashes-with-studio-over-advertising-s/ |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadyac also fired his marketing consultants that he had used for prior films due to his thoughts over the mishandling of the marketing. He later apologized for his outburst with producers, and claimed that it was as a result of his nervousness before the film's release.&lt;ref name="DeadH" /&gt;

==Environmental impact==
Director [[Tom Shadyac]] felt the film reflected environmental themes of how humans are stewards of God's creation. In keeping with the themes, ''Evan Almighty'' became NBC Universal's first film to offset the production's carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="ChristianPost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley |first=Jennifer |title="Evan Almighty" Makes Environmental Push through Biblical Story |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28059_'Evan_Almighty'_Makes_Environmental_Push_through_Biblical_Story.htm |work=The Christian Post |date=June 19, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp31rAhB?url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/-evan-almighty-makes-environmental-push-through-biblical-story/index.html |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Michael Bostick revealed how the emissions were offset:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We worked closely with The Conservation Fund to calculate our carbon emissions from what we used on the movie—whether from vehicles used or any of the construction equipment. Once our carbon emissions were calculated, we planted trees that will effectively zero out our climate-changing footprint left behind from the movie.&lt;ref name="UPEA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, but it would have been impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals.

===Proposed ban===
[[Malaysia]]'s Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) called for a ban on the film, claiming it is offensive to [[Islam]]. Secretary-General Maamor Osman claimed that the film was depicting the great flood as comedy and characterized God with the portrayal of a human, both of which are considered blasphemous in Islam. Similarly there was some public protest against ''Bruce Almighty'' being shown in theaters, but that movie was released on DVD and was also shown on television broadcasts. ''Evan Almighty'' was still released in Malaysia on August 23, 2007.&lt;ref name="Malaysia"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shari |first=Izatun |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/14/nation/18304636&amp;sec=nation |title=Watch movie first before calling for ban, says Rais |work=[[Malaysia Star]] |date=July 14, 2007 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp2Kxv4W?url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F7%2F14%2Fnation%2F18304636&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical release===
''Evan Almighty'' received generally negative reviews from critics and viewers. On review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 23%, based on 192 reviews, with the critical consensus reading, "Big on special effects but short on laughs, ''Evan Almighty'' underutilizes a star-studded cast that includes Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman."&lt;ref name="RTintro" /&gt; At the website [[Metacritic]], which utilizes a [[standard score|normalized]] rating system, the film earned a score of 37 out of 100, based on 33&amp;nbsp;critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MetaCritic" /&gt;

In his review of the film, [[Richard Roeper]] commended [[Jim Carrey]] for declining to reprise his role in "three of the worst sequels of all time", which included ''[[Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd]]'', ''[[Son of the Mask]]'' and ''Evan Almighty''. He continued: "''Evan Almighty'' is a paper-thin alleged comedy with a laugh drought of biblical proportions, and a condescendingly simplistic spiritual message."&lt;ref name="ChicagoSunT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roeper |first=Richard |url=//www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/437886,CST-FTR-evan22.article |title=Throw this god-awful sequel a life jacket |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627032314/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/437886%2CCST-FTR-evan22.article |archivedate=June 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54388">A '''Francophile''' ('''Gallophile''') is a person who has a strong affinity towards any or all of the [[French language]], [[French history]], [[French culture]] or [[French people]]. That affinity may include France itself or its [[History of France|history]], language, [[French cuisine|cuisine]], [[French literature|literature]], etc. The term "Francophile" can be contrasted with [[Francophobia|Francophobe]] (or Gallophobe), someone who dislikes all that is French.
[[File:Francophile restaurant.JPG|thumb|250px|Francophile restaurant in [[Münster]], Germany]]

Francophilia often arises in former [[French colony|French colonies]], where the [[elite]] spoke French and adopted many French habits. In other European countries such as [[Romania]] and [[Russia]], French culture has also long been popular among the [[upper class]].

Historically, Francophilia has been associated with supporters of the [[philosophy]] of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] during and after the [[French Revolution]], where [[democracy|democratic]] uprisings challenged the [[autocratic]] regimes of [[Europe]].

==Europe==

===Romania===
[[Romania]] has a long and deeply entrenched tradition of Francophilia beginning after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Revolutionary]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Crampton, "Eastern Europe in the twentieth century and after", Routledge, 1997 (p.108)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian Boia 2001, p.160"&gt;Lucian Boia, "History and myth in Romanian consciousness", Central European University Press, 2001, (p.160)&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt the most famous contemporary Romanian Francophile is [[Eugen Weber]] (1925–2007), a prodigious author and lecturer in both English and French on [[French history]]. In his book "My France: politics, culture, myth", he writes: "Social relations, manners, attitudes that others had to learn from books, I lived in my early years. Romanian francophilia, Romanian francophony.... Many Romanians, in my day, dreamed of France; not many got there".&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber,  "My France: politics, culture, myth", Harvard University Press, 1992. (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the efforts to build Romania into a modern nation-state, with a national language and common national heritage, in the 19th century, the Romanian language was deliberately reoriented to its Latin heritage by a steady import of French neologisms suited to contemporary civilization and culture. "For ordinary Romanians, keen on the idea of the Latin roots of their language, 'Romance' meant 'French.'"&lt;ref&gt;Iannis Goerlandt, "Literature for Europe?", Rodopi, 2009. (p.421)&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 39% of Romanian vocabulary consists of borrowings from French, with an estimated 20% of "everyday" Romanian vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia, "History and myth in Romanian consciousness", Central European University Press, 2001, (p.163)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boia writes: "Once launched on the road of Westernization, the Romanian elite threw itself into the arms of France, the great Latin sister in the West. When we speak of the Western model, what is to be understood is first and foremost the French model, which comes far ahead of the other Western reference points."&lt;ref name="Lucian Boia 2001, p.160"/&gt; He quotes no less than the leading Romanian politician [[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]], writing in 1907: "As the nations of Europe acquire their definitive borders and their social life becomes elaborated and crystallized within the precise limits of these borders, so their spiritual accomplishments will approach those of the French, and the immaterial substance of their souls will take on the luminous clarity, the smoothness and brilliance of the French mentality."&lt;ref name="Lucian Boia 2001, p.160"/&gt; [[Bucharest]] was rebuilt in the style of Paris in the 19th century, giving the city the nickname the "Paris of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other notable Romanian Francophiles include [[Georges Enesco]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Elie Wiesel]].

===Russia===
18th and 19th century Russian Francophilia is familiar to many from [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', and his characters from the Russian aristocracy converse in French and give themselves French names. At the time, the language of diplomacy and higher education across much of Europe was French. Russia, recently "modernized", or "Westernized", by the rule of sovereigns from [[Peter the Great]] to [[Catherine the Great]] was no exception. The Russian elite, in the early 18th century, were educated in the French tradition and made a conscious effort to imitate the manners of [[France]]. Their descendants, a generation or two later, were no longer "imitating" French customs but grew up with them, and the strong impact of the French culture on Russian upper and even middle classes was evident, on a smaller scale than in the 18th century, until the [[Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;Lurana Donnels O'Malley "The dramatic works of Catherine the Great: theatre and politics in eighteenth-century Russia", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006. (p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Portugal===
{{Main|Afrancesado}}
"Afrancesado" (lit. "turned-French") was the term used for [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] partisans of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, [[liberalism]] or the [[French Revolution]]. It also denoted supporters of the [[Peninsular War|French occupation of Iberia]] and of the [[First French Empire]].

===Germany===
In the 18th century, French was the language of German elites. A notable Francophile was King [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia or Frédéric as he preferred to call himself. Frederick spoke and wrote notably better French than he did German, and all of his books were written in French, a choice of language that was of considerable embarrassment to German nationalists in the 19th and 20th centuries when Frederick became the preeminent German national hero.&lt;ref&gt;Toews, John ''Becoming Historical Cultural Reformation and Public Memory in Early Nineteenth-Century Berlin'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2004 page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; One source noted: "Nor did Frederick have any time for German cultural chauvinism. As an ardent Francophile in matters literary and artistic, he took a low view of the German language, spoke it imperfectly himself, and once boasted that he had not read a book in German since his early youth. His preferences in music, art and architecture were overwhelmingly Italian and French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another German Francophile was King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], a.k.a. "Mad King Ludwig". Ludwig felt a great deal of affinity for King Louis XIV of France, the "Sun King" and liked to call himself the "Moon King" to suggest a parallel between himself and his hero. Ludwig loved to collect memorabilia relating to Louis and his [[Linderhof Palace]] was modeled after the Palace of Trianon.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Christoper ''The Swan King'', London: Penguin Books 1982 pages 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; An even more strikingly example of Ludwig's architectural Francophila was the Palace of [[Herrenchiemsee]], which was a copy of the Palace of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Christoper ''The Swan King'', London: Penguin Books 1982 page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
Francophilia or ''[[Rattachism]]'' is a marginal political ideology in some parts of Belgium. Rattachism would mean the incorporation of French speaking Belgium, [[Wallonia]] (and sometimes [[Brussels]]; more rarely of the entire Belgium) into [[France]]. This movement has existed since the [[Belgium|Belgian state]] came into existence in 1830.

The [[Manifesto for Walloon culture]] of 1983&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/manifesto-walloon-culture-1983 Manifesto for Walloon Culture (1983)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173010/http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/manifesto-walloon-culture-1983 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; relaunched in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/second-manifest-2003 Second Manifest (2003)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305210456/http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/second-manifest-2003 |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of discussions witnessed a will of [[emancipation]].

===Cyprus===
{{See also|Cyprus-France relations}}
The establishment of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Cyprus]], in 1192, was the beginning of intense French influence on the island for the next three centuries. That influence, which touched almost every aspect of life on the island, would endure even after the end of [[Lusignan]] domination. It survives as part of [[Cypriot culture]]. The [[Republic of Cyprus]] became an associate member of the [[Francophonie]] in 2006.

===Armenia===
{{See also|Armenia–France relations}}
The Armenians of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilicia]] welcomed the [[Franks|Frankish]], or [[French people|French]], [[Crusaders]] of the [[Middle Ages]] as fellow [[Christians]]. There was much exchange, and the last dynasty to rule Armenian [[Cilicia]], the [[Lusignan]]s  (who ruled [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]), was of French origin.

During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], many Armenian manuscripts were taken into the National Library of France. [[Armenia]] and Armenian characters are featured in the works of [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Rousseau]]. The first instance of [[Armenian studies]] began with the creation of an Armenian department in the [[School of Oriental languages]], at the initiative of [[Napoleon]].

An important figure of Armenian Francophilia was that of [[Stepan Vosganian]] (1825–1901). Arguably the first Armenian "intellectual" and literary critic, Vosganian "represents the prototype of a long line of Armenian intellectuals nurtured in and identified with European, and particularly French, culture". Educated in Paris, he was a champion of [[liberalism]] and the [[positivism|positivist]] philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]], and he took part in the French [[Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Hovannisian, "The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Foreign dominion to statehood : the fifteenth century to the twentieth century", Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. (p. 156)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French political classes were on the whole supportive of the [[Armenian national movement]]. The French–Armenian Agreement (1916) was a political and military accord to create the [[French Armenian Legion|Armenian Legion]] in the [[French Army]] to fight on the Allied side of [[World War I]], in return for promises of recognition of Armenian independence. The Armenian Legion engaged successfully in [[Anatolia]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during [[World War I]], particularly at the [[Battle of Arara]] and during the [[Franco-Turkish War]].

===Serbia===
[[File:Monument to France.jpg|thumb|Monument of gratitude to France for help in World War I in center of [[Belgrade]], [[Belgrade Fortress]]]]
The oldest documented possible contact between the two sides was the marriage of [[Stephen Uroš I of Serbia]] and [[Helen of Anjou]] in the 13th century.

The first important contacts of [[French people|French]] and [[Serbs]] came only in the 19th century, when the first French travel writers wrote about their travels to Serbia.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"&gt;[http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0025-8555/2009/0025-85550904536S.pdf Francusko-srpski odnosi u XIX i XX veku] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707070451/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0025-8555/2009/0025-85550904536S.pdf |date=July 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time [[Karađorđe Petrović]], the leader of the [[Serbian Revolution]], sent a letter to [[Napoleon]] expressing his admiration. On the other hand, in the [[French parliament]], [[Victor Hugo]] asked France to assist in protecting Serbia and the Serbian population from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] crimes. Diplomatic relations with France were established on 18 January 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/France/basic_e.html]
 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630163421/http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/France/basic_e.html |date=June 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid development of bilateral relations done that people in Serbia in "mighty France" seen great new friend that will protect them from the [[Ottomans]] and [[Habsburgs]].&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt; Relations between [[Serbia]] and France would go upwards until the [[First World War]], when the "common struggle" against a common enemy would reach its peak. Before the war, France would win sympathy of local population by building railways by opening of French schools and a consulate and a Bank. Several Serbian kings  were at universities in [[Paris]] as well as a large part of the future diplomats.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt; Serbs have built a sense of Francophilia because the activities moved them away from the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt; For Serbs until 1914, French have become major allies what were even a threat for traditional inclination towards Russia. The great humanitarian and military assistance that France sent to Serbia during First World War, assistance in the evacuation of children, civilians and military at the end, and the support of French newspaper headlines even today are deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of large number of Serbs.&lt;ref name="doiserbia.nb.rs"/&gt;

Notable Serbian Francophiles include [[Ilija Garašanin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313082434/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=5 |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sava Šumanović]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gk-srbije-vukovar.hr/spomenici.html Generalni Konzulat Republike Srbije] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105101/http://www.gk-srbije-vukovar.hr/spomenici.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The traditional Anglo-French antagonism has made Francophilia something of a rarity within the United Kingdom, but there have been exceptions.

====Various====

* [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu]] was an "enthusiastic Francophile" who employed Huguenot craftsmen to create the French style [[Boughton House]] in Northamptonshire, where French was the preferred language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* The classicist [[Edward Gibbon]] was fluent in French as he was spent part of his youth in Lausanne, was greatly influenced by the French Enlightenment and was so influenced by French culture that has often been described as being "bi-cultural".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes-Warrington, Marine ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The future war hero [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]] was a Francophile who violated the Foreign Enlistment Act by serving as an ambulance driver in the French Army during the Franco-German War of 1870-72.&lt;ref&gt;Luft, Eric "Kitchener, Herbert" from ''Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia'' edited by Sandy Standler, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002 page 466.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the resort city of Dieppe was regularly visited by "ardent Francophiles" like [[Arthur Symons]], [[Ernest Dowson]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]]  and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" by Andrew Radford and Victoria Reid from ''Franco-British Cultural Exchanges, 1880-1940: Channel Packets'' edited by Andrew Radford and Victoria Reid, London: Springer, 2012 page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Colonel [[T. E. Lawrence]], a.k.a. "Lawrence of Arabia" is often depicted as a Francophobe, but the French historian Maurice Larès wrote that far from being a Francophobe as he is usually depicted in France, Lawrence was really a Francophile.&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220-242"&gt;Larès, Maurice "T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?" pages 220-242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Larès wrote: "But we should note that a man rarely devotes much of his time and effort to the study of a language and of the literature of a people he hates, unless this is in order to work for its destruction (Eichmann's behavior may be an instance of this), which was clearly not Lawrence's case. Had Lawrence really disliked the French, would he, even for financial reasons, have translated French novels into English? The quality of his translation of ''Le Gigantesque''  (''[[The Forest Giant]]'') reveals not only his conscientiousness as an artist but also a knowledge of French that can scarcely have derived from unfriendly feelings".&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220-242"/&gt;

====Government &amp; military====

* General [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend]] was a Francophile who liked to be addressed as ""Alphonse" and whose "Frenchified" manners often annoyed his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Geoffrey ''Great Military Blunders'', Oxford: PastTimes, 2000 page 97&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomat Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert "Van" Vansittart]] was a passionate Francophile who worked as a successful playwright in Paris before entering the Foreign Office.&lt;ref name="Doerr, Paul page 137"&gt;Doerr, Paul ''British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998 page 137&lt;/ref&gt; Vansittart always explained his Francophilia and Germanophobia under the grounds that as young man living in Europe the French were always kind to him while the Germans were cruel.&lt;ref name="Doerr, Paul page 137"/&gt;
* The British Army officer and Conservative MP General Sir [[Edward Spears]] was a Francophile |who as a fluent French-speaker served as a liaison officer between the French and British armies in both world wars. Spears was also an opponent of appeasement who founded the Anglo-French Parliamentary Association to bring together like-minded members of the French National Assembly and the British Parliament.
* Sir [[Winston Churchill]] was a Francophile who often expressed his admiration for France though the French historian [[François Kersaudy]] noted that Churchill's attempts to speak French usually left the French very confused as to what he was trying to say as Churchill's French was atrocious.&lt;ref&gt;Kersaudy, François ''Churchill and de Gaulle'', Saddle Brook: Stratford Press, 1981 page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill often spoke of his love of the French, writing that Marshal Foch represented one aspect of France, "...the France, whose grace and culture, whose etiquette and ceremonial have bestowed its gifts around the world. There was the France of chivalry, the France of Versailles and above all, the France of Joan of Arc".&lt;ref name="Kersaudy, François page 26"&gt;Kersaudy, François ''Churchill and de Gaulle'', Saddle Brook: Stratford Press, 1981 page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Kersaudy called Churchill France's most "forceful and vocal champion" in interwar Britain, a time when many people saw the Treaty of Versailles as a vindictive, French-engineered treaty which was too harsh towards Germany, and accordingly Francophobia flourished among circles in Britain in favor of revising Versailles in favor of the ''Reich''.&lt;ref name="Kersaudy, François page 26"/&gt;
* It was frequently observed of Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]], the Francophile Foreign Secretary 1924-29 that he "loved France like a woman, for her defects and her qualities", an aspect of his personality that Chamberlain was often attacked for.&lt;ref&gt;Self, Robert ''The Austen Chamberlain Diary Letters: The Correspondence of Sir Austen Chamberlain with His Sisters Hilda and Ida, 1916-1937'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Conservative MP [[Duff Cooper|Alfred Duff Cooper]] was in the words of the historian P.H Bell such a "devoted Francophile" that his time as British ambassador to France that he often tried the patience of the Foreign Office by going well beyond his instructions to maintain good relations with France by trying to create an Anglo-French alliance that would dominate post-war Europe.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 72"&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bell also called Sir [[Anthony Eden]] a strong "Francophile" noted for his efforts as Foreign Secretary to reviving France as a great power during World War II.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 72"/&gt; The novelist [[Nancy Mitford]] was a great Francophile who lived in Paris from 1946 until her death in 1973, and from 1943 onwards she served as the long-time mistress of [[Gaston Palewski]], the right-hand man of General de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Writers====

* The writer [[Charles Dickens]] was a Francophile who often vacationed in France and in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French called the French "the first people in the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Soubigou, Gilles "Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries" pages 154-167 from ''The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe'' edited by Michael Hollington London: A&amp;C Black 2013 page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another British Francophile was the writer [[Rudyard Kipling]], who argued very strongly after World War I for an Anglo-French alliance to uphold the peace, calling Britain and France in 1920 the "twin fortresses of European civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, David ''The Long Recessional: The Imperial Life of Rudyard Kipling'', London: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2002 pages 300.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The writer [[Raymond Mortimer]] was such a Francophile that he broke down in tears when he heard France had signed an armistice with Nazi Germany on 21 June 1940, saying it was if half of England had just fallen into the sea.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 22"&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Francophile writer and historian [[Denis William Brogan]] wrote after hearing of the armistice of 1940 that he very much looked forward to the day when the "eternal France" which he loved would return.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 22"/&gt; The Francophile novelist [[Charles Langbridge Morgan]] dedicated his 1940 novel ''The Voyage'' to two French friends, writing "France is an ideal necessary for civilization and will live again when tyranny is spent".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The writer, diplomat and National Labour MP [[Harold Nicolson]] was a Francophile who when he visited France for the first time in five years in March 1945, he fell to kiss the earth upon landing in France.&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 66"&gt;Bell, P.H ''France and Britain, 1940-1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; When a Frenchman asked the prostrate Nicolson "''Monsieur a laissé tomber quelque-chose?''" ("Sir, have you dropped something?"), Nicolson replied "''Non, j'ai retrouvé quelque-chose''" (No, I have recovered something").&lt;ref name="Bell, P.H page 66"/&gt;

==Asia==

===Iran===
As with much of the Western world and the Middle East at the time, Francophilia was quite common in Iran in the 19th century, and even so more in the 20th century. In Iran, many key politicians and diplomats of the 20th century were French-educated or avid Francophiles. Among them [[Teymur Bakhtiar]], the founder of the Iranian intelligence agency, [[SAVAK]]; [[Amir-Abbas Hoveida]], [[Prime Minister of Iran]] from 1965 to 1977; [[Hassan Pakravan]], a diplomat and intelligence figure; [[Nader Jahanbani]], [[General]] under the last [[Shah]]; and Abdullah Entezam-Saltaneh, another famous diplomat to the West.

{{quote|And if there was one thing that characterized the Shah and the [[ancien regime]] of Hoveydas and Tabatabais, it was francophilia, French education, the French language. [[The Shah]] himself had attended [[Le Rosey]] in Switzerland. French lycees flourished in [[Teheran]]. The [[Shahbanou]] herself was part of the francophilia that in Iran was as notable a feature as it had been of pre-Revolutionary [[Russia]]. England was always, in Iranian eyes, the suspect, the enemy. England was the country of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. But France offered the "perfected civilisation" of [[Chamfort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheikyermami.com/fitzgerald-ayatollah-khomeini-and-fethulleh-gulen-how-islamic-revolutions-come-about/ "Fitzgerald: Ayatollah Khomeini And Fethulleh Gulen, (how Islamic revolutions come about)"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In a speech delivered in French in Paris during a state visit on 11 October 1961, the Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] spoke of his "special affinity for France, and the lofty place the French language has held in Iran's educational curriculum".&lt;ref name="Milani, Abbas page 278"&gt;Milani, Abbas ''The Shah', London: Macmillan, 2011 page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad Reza spoke of the long history of Franco-Iranian friendship "going back to the age of Philip le Bel, who was the recipient of the first letter from an Iranian king".&lt;ref name="Milani, Abbas page 278"/&gt; The Shah went on to praise France as the land where every Iranian owes a debt as "the first translation of our classics to your countrymen. Teaching Persian in Europe first began in Paris in the late 18th century. The first relics of our antiquity were discovered by French anthropologists".&lt;ref name="Milani, Abbas page 278"/&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
{{See also|Franco-Ottoman alliance|François Pouqueville}}
[[Orientalism]] first arose in [[Early Modern]] [[France]] with [[Guillaume Postel]] and the French Embassy to the court of the Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref&gt;Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina 2008 Orientalism in Early Modern France (p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when [[Mehmed IV]] sent the ambassador [[Müteferrika Süleyman Ağa]] to the court of [[Louis XIV]] in 1669, it caused a sensation that triggered the [[Turquerie]] fashion craze in France and then the rest of Western Europe, which lasted until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id==ZDljPtPJLbkC&amp;pg==PA8&amp;dq==ottoman+alliance+%22Louis+XIV%22&amp;as_brr==3&amp;ei==F63TSeqbOIyENPuMhYYJ&amp;hl==en#PPA8,M1 Göçek, p. 8]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziya Gökalp, Rober, "The Principles of Turkism", Brill Archive (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] granted [[France]] special privileges on account of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. French mercantilism was protected, French subjects were exempt from the taxes and tributes normally required of Christian residents of the Empire, no French subjects could be taken into Ottoman slavery and French subjects were granted full freedom of worship. Thus, France became the unofficial protector of all Catholics in the East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenianhouse.org/bliss/turkey/10-turkey-europe.html ArmenianHouse.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513184128/http://armenianhouse.org/bliss/turkey/10-turkey-europe.html |date=May 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial influence increased in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[French language]] and customs penetrated deep into the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] learned classes and aristocracy; French was the preferred second language, rich Ottomans sent their children to school and Universities in France and the Western "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]" was associated with French culture&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Panzac, "Histoire économique et sociale de l'Empire ottoman et de la Turquie (1326-1960): actes du sixième congrès international tenu à Aix-en-Provence du 1er au 4 juillet 1992", Peeters Publishers, 1995.

The [[French Revolution]] and its ideals of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" inspired many secular and progressive movements in [[Ottoman Turkey]], including the [[Young Turk]] movement that would go on to create the [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Niyazi Berkes]], Feroz Ahmad, The Development of Secularism in Turkey, Routledge, 1998. (Page lxxxiv)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon]]'s breaking of the age-old Franco-Ottoman alliance by conquering [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[Egypt]] also had an effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1852/10/11/87843198.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali the Great]], who became the Ottoman [[Vali (governor)|''vali'']] (governor) of Egypt in 1805 and ruled as a ''de facto'' independent ruler until his death in 1848 had been strongly impressed with the Napoleon's ''Armée d'Orient'', and imported French veterans of the Napoleonic wars to train his army.&lt;ref name="Russell, Mona page 205"&gt;Russell, Mona ''Egypt'', Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO 2013 page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was very much in the French sphere of influence politically, economically and culturally in the 19th century, and French was the preferred language of Egypt's elites right up to the 1952 revolution.&lt;ref name="Russell, Mona page 205"/&gt; At the court of the Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]] of Egypt, better known as Isma'il the Magnificent the languages used were French and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Elizabeth ''Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2013 page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting his Francophilia, the French-educated Isma'il emulated [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]] by tearing down much of [[Cairo]] to rebuild it in the style of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, André ''Cairo''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2000 pages 313-314&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, the architecture of [[Downtown Cairo]] closely resembles that of downtown Paris.

===Lebanon===
In Lebanon, Franophilia is very common among the Christian Maronites who have seen the 19th century viewed the French as their "guardian angels", their special protectors and friends in their struggles against the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Asher "Tell Us Our History': Charles Corm, Mount Lebanon and Lebanese Nationalism" pages 1-28 from ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 40, No. 3, May 2004 page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the French intervened to put a stop to the massacres of the Maronites by the Muslims and the Druze which were being permitted by the Ottoman authorities, earning them the lasting thanks of the Maronites. Starting in the 19th century, much of the Maronite elite was educated at Jesuit schools in France, making the Maronites one of the most ardently Francophile groups in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Kaufman pages 1-28"&gt;Kaufman, Asher "Tell Us Our History': Charles Corm, Mount Lebanon and Lebanese Nationalism" pages 1-28 from ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 40, No. 3, May 2004 page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese writer [[Charles Corm]] in a series of poems in French published after World War I portrayed the Lebanese as a "Phoenician" people whose Christianity and Francophilia made them part of the West and who had nothing to do either with the Arabs or Islam.&lt;ref name="Kaufman pages 1-28"/&gt;

===Japan===
Prince [[Saionji Kinmochi]], a ''genro'' (elder statesmen) was educated in France, where he received a law degree at the Sorbonne.&lt;ref&gt;Macilllan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House, 2007 page 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In words of the Canadian historian [[Margaret Macmillan]], Saionji "...loved the French, their culture and their liberal traditions. He even spoke French in his sleep. To the end of his life, he drank Vichy water and wore Houbigant cologne, which had to be imported specially for him".&lt;ref&gt;Macilllan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House, 2007 page 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Saionji was merely an extreme case of the Francophilia that characterized Meiji Japan. The Justice Minister, [[Etō Shimpei]] was an admirer of the French who modeled the legal and administrative systems together with the police force after that of France.&lt;ref name="Sim, Richard page 258"&gt;Sim, Richard ''French Policy Towards the Bakufu and Meiji Japan 1854-95''Psychology Press, 1998 page 258.&lt;/ref&gt; A French lawyer [[Gustave Boissonade]] was recruited to draft the Japanese legal code, which is why the Japanese legal code today very closely resembles the Code Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Richard ''French Policy Towards the Bakufu and Meiji Japan 1854-95''Psychology Press, 1998 pages 97 &amp; 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French lawyer, Prosper Gambet-Gross served as the special advisor to [[Kawaji Toshiyoshi]] who created a French-style police force for Japan.&lt;ref name="Sim, Richard page 258"/&gt; The Japanese educational system from 1872 onward was modeled after the French educational system and in the same year Japan was divided into prefectures as the French administrative system was considered by the Japanese to be the best in Europe.&lt;ref name="Sim, Richard page 258"/&gt; The Japanese received a French military mission in 1870 to train their army as the French Army was considered the best in the world. After France's defeat in the war of 1870-71, the Japanese sent the French military mission home, to be replaced by a German military mission as the German victory led the Japanese to the conclusion that the Germans were better soldiers.

The Japanese writer [[Kafū Nagai]] wrote after visiting France: &lt;blockquote&gt;"No matter how much I wanted to sing Western songs, they were all very difficult. Had I, born in Japan, no choice but to sing Japanese songs? Was there a Japanese song that expressed my present sentiment -- a traveler who had immersed himself in love and the arts in France but was now going back to the extreme end of the Orient where only death would follow monotonous life? . . . I felt totally forsaken. I belonged to a nation that had no music to express swelling emotions and agonized feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Central African Empire===
Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of the Army of the Central African Republic seized power in 1965 and ruled until he was deposed by French troops in 1979.

===Gabon===
[[Omar Bongo]], the long time dictator of [[Gabon]] from 1967 until his death in 2009 was described by ''The Economist'' in 2016 as "every inch the Francophile" who was very close to successive governments in Paris from the time he came to power until his death.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite web

===The Ivory Coast===
President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] of the Côte d'Ivoire was described as a "staunch Francophile" who maintained very close links with France, and successfully insisted that the French name for his country be used instead of the Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==North America==

===Canada===
{{main|French language in Canada}}
With the inception of [[Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the institution of [[French immersion]] in many schools following the [[Official Languages Act of 1969]], many [[English Canadian|Canadians of English heritage]] have developed a greater appreciation for the French culture that is a part of the [[Canadian identity]]. English and French are the two [[official languages of Canada]] and two of its founding languages.

===United States===
In America, there is great interest in French culture, including French food, art, philosophy, politics, as well as the French lifestyle in general. Historically, French style, particularly that of Paris, has long been considered the height of sophistication by Americans of all social classes.

====Historical====
[[France in the American Revolutionary War|French support of the American Revolution]] was probably a significant factor in shaping American's feelings towards France. Prior to that, the French had been seen as rivals for control of North America until their decisive defeat in the [[French and Indian War]]. With the elimination of France as a major colonial power in North America, the rivalry between American colonists and British interests became primary, and France's role switched to that of a counter to British power.

Pro-French sentiment was probably strengthened by the overthrow of the French monarchy and the creation of a "brother-republic" in France. Notwithstanding the turmoil of the [[French Revolution]], certain disputes between the two countries, and the renewal of British-American ties, generally good relations continued. During the Napoleonic era, the [[Louisiana Purchase]], and the entry of the United States into another [[War of 1812|war]] against Britain, concurrent with [[Napoleonic wars|Franco-British hostilities]], gave a certain sense of common cause.

Among the most famous early American Francophiles was [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Kaplan, "Jefferson and France: An Essay on Politics and Political Ideas", Yale University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Schuckel "The origins of Thomas Jefferson as a Francophile, 1784-1789", Butler University, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Even during the excesses of the [[Reign of Terror]], Jefferson refused to disavow the revolution because he was, as Jean Yarbrough wrote, "convinced that the fates of the two republics were indissolubly linked. To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, Jean M. Yarbrough, The essential Jefferson, Hackett Publishing, 2006. (p. xx)&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the continuing revolutions in the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], Jefferson predicted that "this ball of liberty, I believe most piously, is now so well in motion that it will roll round the globe, at least the enlightened part of it, for light &amp; liberty go together. it is our glory that we first put it into motion."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, Paul Leicester Ford, "The Writings of Thomas Jefferson: 1795-1801", G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1896. (p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson would often sign his letters "Affectionately adieu" and commented late in life "France, freed from that monster, Bonaparte, must again become the most agreeable country on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, Henry Augustine Washington "The writings of Thomas Jefferson", Taylor &amp; Maury, 1854. (p. 402)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 film ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' by [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]], recalls the connection. The "staunchly Francophile"&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Victor Rostow, "A breakfast for Bonaparte: U.S. national security interests from the Heights of Abraham to the nuclear age" DIANE Publishing, 1992. (p. 116)&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson and, by extension, his adherents or "[[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]]", were characterized by his political enemies, the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], as "decadent, ungodly and immoral Francophiles".&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Verhoeven, Beth Dolan Kautz, ''Revolutions &amp; Watersheds: Transatlantic Dialogues, 1775-1815'', Rodopi, 1999, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Franklin]], who spent seven years as the popular [[United States Ambassador to France]] was also a Francophile.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''The Age of Wonder: The Romantic Generation and the Discovery of the Beauty and Terror of Science'' (2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] Republican Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] spent his first three grades in a Parisian school and majored in Romance Languages and Literatures at [[Harvard]]. [[Henry Cabot Lodge Sr.]], his grandfather, was also a Francophile and befriended [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], the French Ambassador to the US.

====Various====
Many Americans have studied at art schools in France, including the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts academy in Paris]], the premier institution of its kind in the country. The students and graduated alumni have been deeply influential on American style, particularly during the 19th and the early 20th centuries.

Francophile sentiment in America was deeply influential on American public opinion and involvement in both [[World Wars]]. The Francophile filmmaker [[Preston Sturges]] always considered France his "second home" where he spent much of his childhood, was fluent in French and was greatly influenced by the films of his close friend [[René Clair]].&lt;ref&gt;Viviani, Christiana "Hail the Conquering Autuer: Preston Sturges in ''La Revue de cinéma''"  pages 280-292 from ''ReFocus: The Films of Preston Sturges'' edited by Jeff Jaeckle,Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015 pages 280-281&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of cuisine, [[Julia Child]] is probably the most famous of many Francophile-American chefs and of many American graduates of French cooking-schools.

====Actors====

Other notable francophiles include actor [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Blake Lively]],&lt;ref&gt;Minute Help Guides, "The Unofficial Blake Lively Biography" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalie Portman]], [[Molly Ringwald|Molly]] [[Molly Ringwald|Ringwald]], Steven Gabrielle and Robert Crawford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The director and actor [[Woody Allen]] is a Francophile whose films often made references to French cinema, philosophy and novels.&lt;ref&gt;Menegaldo, Gilles "Woody Allen and France"  from ''A Companion to Woody Allen'' pages 53-72edited by Peter J.

====Business====

The French-American Chamber of Commerce organization has worked to promote business ties between the two countries. A ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' interview has described the [[Beaujolais (wine)|Beaujolais]] [[Wine Festival]], the largest such festival in the US, as a major event for those interested in French culture to mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/lifetravel/stories/DN-mytown_0125gd.ART.State.Edition1.12e51.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130120071441/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/lifetravel/stories/DN-mytown_0125gd.ART.State.Edition1.12e51.html|deadurl=yes|title=Dallasnews.com - News for Dallas, Texas - The Dallas Morning News|date=20 January 2013|archivedate=20 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] liked to call himself the "Napoleon of the West", and during his rule, the Mexican Army wore uniforms that closely resembled the uniforms of Napoleon's ''Grande Armée''. Since the times of [[Porfirio Díaz]], the Mexican upper class has shown a strong admiration of French culture, language, architecture and customs.

===Haiti===
The Republic of [[Haiti]] was once the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] until a successful slave revolt drove the French out. Despite this history, the Haitian elite was traditionally very Francophile to the point that the Haitian writer [[Jean Price-Mars]] published a book in 1928 ''Ainsi Parla l'Oncle'' (So Spoke the Uncle) accusing the elite of ''bovarysme'', of intentionally neglecting and ignoring traditional Haitian folk culture as it had too many West African elements and was not French enough for the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Martin "Haiti" pages 551-556 from ''France And The Americas: Culture, Politics, And History'' edited by Bill Marshall &amp; Cristina Johnston Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005 page 555.&lt;/ref&gt; About 10% of Haiti's population speak French as their first language while the other 90% speak [[Haitian Creole|''Kréyol'']] (a mixture of French and various West African languages) that has often been mocked by the Francophile Haitian elite as a bastardized French.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, David ''From Dessalines to Duvalier: Race, Colour, and National Independence in Haiti'' New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1996 pages xxiv-xxv&lt;/ref&gt; In Haiti, the question of whatever one speaks French or ''Kréyol'' is racially charged as the elite tended to be mulattos while the masses are black.

=== Australia ===
Australian people are mostly leaning toward francophilia. Australia is tied to France through history: visit from [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]] and assistance during [[World War I]]. Australian also appreciate and look up to French culture and cuisine. Shops often try to make their name sound French&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escapetoparis.com/2010/12/no-escaping%E2%80%A6-australian-francophilia/&lt;/ref&gt; and a trip to Paris is a common prize in games or often pictured in advertisements.

'''Fresh''' is a British [[pop punk]] band formed in London in 2015 by Kathryn Woods (vocals/guitar), with George Phillips (bass) and Daniel Goldberg (drums) joining in 2016.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upset2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upsetmagazine.com/features/fresh-youre-not-punk-youre-just-lad-listens-hardcore/|last=Shutler|first=Ali|date=18 August 2017 |title=Fresh: "You’re not punk if you’re just some lad who listens to hardcore"|accessdate=1 March 2018|publisher=Upset Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Punktastic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punktastic.com/album-reviews/fresh-fresh/|last=Bhandari|first=Ashwin|date=27 August 2017 |title=Fresh – ‘Fresh’|accessdate=1 March 2018|publisher=Punktastic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current lineup is completed by Myles McCabe (guitar), who joined in 2017.

==History==
Fresh was started in London in 2015 by songwriter Kathryn Woods (vocals/guitar). George Phillips (bass) and Daniel Goldberg (drums) joined the live band in 2016, and would go on to play on its debut album.&lt;ref name="Upset2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Punktastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; The current lineup is completed by Myles McCabe (guitar), who joined in 2017.

After self-releasing two EPs in 2015 the band signed to [[Specialist Subject Records]] and released their self-titled debut album on 18 August 2017.&lt;ref name="Kerrang News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upset"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upsetmagazine.com/news/listen/fresh-announce-debut-album-brilliant-fuck-life/|last=Shutler|first=Ali|date=19 June 2017 |title=Fresh announce debut album with the brilliant ‘Fuck My Life’|accessdate=1 March 2018|publisher=Upset Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Upset2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; The album was recorded at The Ranch in Southampton.&lt;ref name="Upset"/&gt;

In July 2017 they were featured in [[Kerrang!]] who compared them to [[Modern Baseball]], [[Joyce Manor]], and [[Diet Cig]]. The article quotes Kathryn as saying, "Fresh started because I was a teenage girl who was bored of only seeing men playing in bands".&lt;ref name="Kerrang News"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=De Freitas |first=Ryan |date=22 July 2017 |title=Fresh For Fans Of: Joyce Manor, Modern Baseball, Diet Cig|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/kerrang-uk/20170722/281689729864961 |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |location=[[London]] |publisher=Wasted Talent Ltd |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 [[ABC News]] listed their debut album as one of their 50 best albums of that year.&lt;ref name="ABC News 50 best"/&gt;

[[Image:Produits régionaux - photo CPPR.jpg|thumb|200px|Fine food, the principal study of gastronomy]]
'''Gastronomy''' is the study of the relationship between [[food]] and [[culture]], the art of preparing and serving rich or delicate and appetizing food, the cooking styles of particular regions, and the science of good eating. &lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; One who is well versed in gastronomy is called a gastronome, while a gastronomist is one who unites theory and practice in the study of gastronomy. Practical gastronomy is associated with the practice and study of the preparation, production, and service of the various foods and beverages, from countries around the world. Theoretical gastronomy supports practical gastronomy. It is related with a system and process approach, focused on recipes, techniques and cookery books. Food gastronomy is connected with food and beverages and their genesis. Technical gastronomy underpins practical gastronomy, introducing a rigorous approach to evaluation of gastronomic topics.&lt;ref name="GillespieCousins2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cailein Gillespie|author2=John Cousins|title=European Gastronomy into the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G5cihKVlOIC|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-40493-1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crystal.kitchen/2011/05/13/what-the-hell-is-gastronomy-anyway/|title=What the Hell is Gastronomy, Anyway?|date=2011-05-13|work=adventures of an omnomnomnivore in NYC|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word "gastronomy" is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] γαστήρ, ''gastḗr'', "stomach", and νόμος, ''nómos'', "laws that govern", and therefore literally means "the art or law of regulating the stomach". The term is purposely all-encompassing: it subsumes all of [[cooking]] technique, [[nutrition]]al facts, [[food science]], and everything that has to do with palatability plus applications of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]] as human [[ingestion]] of foodstuffs goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entomological Gastronomy|last=Lilholt|first=Addison|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2015|isbn=1312792469|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Gastronomy involves discovering, tasting, experiencing, researching, understanding and writing about food preparation and the sensory qualities of [[human nutrition]] as a whole. It also studies how nutrition interfaces with the broader culture. Later on, the application of biological and chemical knowledge to cooking has become known as [[molecular gastronomy]], yet gastronomy covers a much broader, interdisciplinary ground.

[[File:Jean François Tourcaty, Carte Gastronomique de la France, 1809 Cornell CUL PJM 1033 01.jpg|thumbnail|This is the first example of a carte gastronomique, a map that summarizes a country by its products at the outset of the  "Cours Gastronomique" by Charles Louis Cadet de Gassicourt (1809).]]
The culinary term appears for the first time in a title in a poem by [[Joseph Berchoux]] in 1801 entitled "Gastronomie."&lt;ref name=Ory1996pp445-448&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ory|first1=Pascal|title=Realms of Memory: Tradition|date=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=445-448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal Ory, a French historian, defines gastronomy as the establishment of rules of eating and drinking, an "art of the table," and distinguishes it from good cooking (bonne cuisine) or fine cooking (haute cuisine). Ory traces the origins of gastronomy back to the French reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] when people took interest in developing rules to discriminate between good and bad style and extended their thinking to define good culinary taste. The lavish and sophisticated cuisine and practices of the French court became the culinary model for the French. Alexandre Grimod de La Reyniere wrote the first gastronomic work ''Almanach des gourmands (1803)'' elevating the status of food discourse to a disciplined level based on his views of French tradition and morals. Grimod aimed to reestablish order lost after the revolution and institute gastronomy as a serious subject in France. Grimod expanded gastronomic literature to the three forms of the genre: the guidebook, the gastronomic treatise, and the gourmet periodical. The invention of gastronomic literature coincided with important cultural transformations in France that increased the relevance of the subject. The end of nobility in France changed how people consumed food; fewer wealthy households employed cooks and the new bourgeoisie class wanted to assert their status by consuming elitist food. The emergence of the restaurant satisfied these social needs and provided good food available for popular consumption. The center of culinary excellence in France shifted from Versailles to Paris, a city with a competitive and innovative culinary culture. The culinary commentary of Grimod and other gastronomes influenced the tastes and expectations of consumers in an unprecedented manner as a third party to the consumer-chef interaction.&lt;ref name=Ory1996pp445-448/&gt;

The French origins of gastronomy explain the widespread use of French terminology in gastronomic literature. Gastronomic literature, Pascal Ory criticizes, is conceptually vague relying heavily on anecdotal evidence and using confusing, poorly defined terminology. Despite Ory’s criticism, gastronomy has grown from a marginalized subject in France to a serious and popular interest worldwide.&lt;ref name=Ory1996pp445-448/&gt;

The derivative ''[[gourmet]]'' has come into use since the publication of the book by [[Brillat-Savarin]], ''[[The Physiology of Taste]]''. According to Brillat-Savarin, "Gastronomy is the knowledge and understanding of all that relates to man as he eats. Its purpose is to ensure the conservation of men, using the best food possible."&lt;ref&gt;Montagné, Prosper. ''Larousse gastronomique: The New American Edition of the World's Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia''. Edited by Jennifer Harvey Lang. New York: Crown, 1988. Second English edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/gastronomic-meal-of-the-french-00437?RL=00437 Gastronomic Meal of the French - UNESCO]"Inscribed in 2010 (5.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings on gastronomy==
There have been many writings on gastronomy throughout the world that capture the thoughts and esthetics of a culture's cuisine during a period in their history. Some works continue to define or influence the contemporary gastronomic thought and cuisine of their respective cultures as listed below:
*''[[Apicius]]'': A 5th century collection of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] recipes by the gourmet [[Marcus Gavius Apicius]]. Contains instructions for preparing dishes enjoyed by the elite of the time.
*''[[Suiyuan shidan]]'' (隨園食單) : An 18th century manual on [[Qing dynasty]] [[Chinese Cuisine]] by the poet [[Yuan Mei]], which contains recipes from different social classes at the time along with two chapters on Chinese gastronomic and culinary theory.
*''[[The Physiology of Taste]]'': A 19th century book by lawyer and politician [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] that defined classic [[French cuisine]]. The work contains a large collection of flamboyant recipes from the time, but goes into the theory on preparation of French dishes and hospitality.

'''Gawai Dayak''' is an annual festival celebrated by the [[Dayak people]] in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] and [[West Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]] on 31 May and 1 June. It is a public holiday in [[Sarawak]] and is both a religious and a social occasion recognised since 1957.

Gawai Dayak was the concept of the radio producers Tan Kingsley and Owen Liang taken up by the Dayak community. The [[British Empire|British]] colonial government refused to recognise Dayak Day until 1962. They called it ''Sarawak Day'' for the inclusion of all Sarawakians as a national day, regardless of ethnic origin. 

On 1 June 1963, Datuk Michael Buma, a Betong native, hosted the celebrations of the first Gawai Dayak at his home at [[Siol Kandis]], [[Kuching]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/07/01/when-will-the-gawai-end/ ''When will the gawai end.''] The Borne Post website 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 1964, ''Sarawak Day'' was gazetted as a public holiday acknowledging the formation of the [[Federation of Malaysia]]. The holiday was first celebrated on 1 June 1965 and it became a symbol of unity, aspiration and hope for the Dayak community. It is an integral part of Dayak social life. It is a thanksgiving day marking a bountiful harvest and a time to plan for the new farming season or other endeavours ahead.

==Introduction==
''Gawai Dayak'' comes from ''Gawai'' meaning ''festival'' and ''[[Dayak people|Dayak]]'' a collective name for the indigenous peoples of [[Sarawak]], Indonesian [[Kalimantan]] and the interior of [[Borneo]]. The population estimate is two to four million people. The Dayaks, previously known as the ''[[Sea Dayak]]'' are mostly [[Iban people]]. Other ethnic groups such as the [[Bidayuh]] people ([[Land Dayak]] and [[Orang Ulu]]) are recognised. The Orang Ulu include the [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayans]], [[Kenyah]]s and [[Lun Bawang]]s. There are over 200 [[riverine]] and hill-dwelling ethnic subgroups in the region. Although these peoples have common traits, each have their own [[dialect]], customs, laws, territory and culture. Dayak languages are categorised as part of the [[Austronesian languages]]. The Dayaks embraced [[animism]] and [[paganism]] but in recent times, many have converted to Christianity.  

== Preparation ==
As the festival day approaches, everyone will be busy with general tidying up, grave visiting, paddy drying and milling, collecting and preparing food and final house decoration, where necessary. The mode of celebrations of Gawai Dayak vary from place to place and preparations begin early. 

===Food and drink===
When a longhouse agrees to host Gawai Dayak, they may need to plant extra [[rice|paddy]] and organise labour exchange ("bedurok"). Rice may be purchased from the towns if the festival is in a place where paddy farming is absent or insufficient. The traditional Dayak [[liquor]] is [[Rice wine]] called ''[[tuak]]''. It is brewed at least one month before the Gawai Dayak. The drink is brewed from the [[glutinous rice]] from a recent harvest mixed with home-made [[yeast]] called ciping. Traditionally, tuak was made with rice milk only but is now cut with sugar and water in a process called ''mandok''. A stronger alcoholic beverage made by the Ibans is "langkau" (called ''arak tonok" (''burnt spirit'') by the bidayuhs). This drink is made by [[distillation|distilling]] tuak over a fire. 

Traditional cake delicacies are prepared from glutinous rice flour mixed with sugar. The cakes include ''sarang semut'' (ant nest cake), ''cuwan'' (molded cake) and ''kuih sepit'' (twisted cake). The cakes can last well whilst kept inside a jar because they are deep-fried until hardened. ''Penganan iri'' (a discus-shaped cake) are made just prior to the festival day because they do not keep well. This is because the cake is lifted from the hot frying oil while not fully hardened.  The sugar used can be the brown nipah sugar or [[cane sugar]].

Before the Gawai eve, the longhouse residents may organise a hunting or fishing trip to gather  wild meats and fish. Both can be preserved with salt in a jar or smoked over a firewood platform above the hearth. Any wild animal parts like the horns, teeth and claws, and feathers are used to decorate and repair traditional costumes.

===Decoration of the longhouse===
The [[longhouse]] is cleaned, repaired and repainted by co-operation amongst its residents, (''gotong-royong'' in Malay). The longhouse is constructed as a unique place of living and worship. Its main post (''tiang pemun'') is the designated starting point of all the building materials ("pun ramu") and must remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;Anggat S. [https://gnmawar.wordpress.com/adat-iban/the-iban-longhouse-by-stephen-anggat/ ''The Iban Longhouse''] Gnmawar blog about Iban cultural heritage.&lt;/ref&gt; Timber and wooden materials for repairs are obtained from nearby reserve forests ("pulau galau, pulau ban") or purchased in towns. A "pantar" (long chair) may be built along the upper area of the ''ruai'' (gallery). The seat is raised and the ''tanju'' (verandah wall) is used as the back rest. Some old wooden longhouses ("rumah kayu") are renovated with concrete and bricks to make a terraced structure ("rumah batu").

The inside walls of the longhouse are decorated with "ukir" [[mural]]s portraying tree and wild animal [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. Men with decorating skills make split bamboo designs. Women decorate living room walls by hanging their handwoven ceremonial clothes called pua kumbu and other handycrafts. Orang Ulu are famous for their colourful paintings of the tree of life on their house walls and their house posts are elaborately carved.&lt;ref&gt;Anggat A. ''Basic Iban Design''.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly decorated shields are displayed near the family room door. Heirloom jars, brassware and old human skulls obtained during [[headhunting]] raids, if still kept, are cleaned and displayed. Deer horns may be secured on the longhouse posts in order to secure highly decorated swords and other household items.

===Gawai Dayak eve===
On Gawai Eve, people gather [[sago]], [[aping]], [[sawit]] or coconut palm shoots which are used for making soup. Vegetables such as wild miding fern, fiddlehead fern, bamboo shoots, [[tapioca]] leaves and Dayak round brinjals from nearby jungle, farms or gardens are also gathered. 

After the gathering of plants and vegetables early in the morning, the poultry is slaughtered.  Enough meat is cooked in mid-aged thin-walled bamboo logs to make a traditional dish called "pansoh" (or "lulun" in the Iban language). The meat is first mixed with traditional herbs like [[lemon grass]], [[ginger]], [[bungkang]] leaves and salt. Any remaining meat is preserved in salt and mixed with kepayang leaves and detoxined seeds. Animal heads are roasted over an open fire to be served hot with tuak. Wooden cooking implements are made from small tree logs.

Some [[glutinous rice]] is cooked in [[bamboo]] logs to soak up the bamboo aroma. Normal rice will be cooked in pots at the kitchen hearth. The addition of pandan leaves gives a special aroma. Smoke from the fire wood also gives a distinctive aroma. Some Dayaks, especially Orang Ulu, will wrap rice in long green leaves before steaming it inside a pot. Rice may also cooked using a gas stove or rice cooker. 

Highly decorated mats for guests to sit on are laid out on the longhouse gallery which runs the entire length of the building. The act is called beranyaike which marks the opening of the gawai. The Dayaks make various types of traditional hand-woven mats. There are reed mats woven with colourful designs, ''lampit'' rattan mats, ''bidai'' tree bark mats and ''peradani'' mats. The walls of most family rooms and galleries are decorated with traditional blankets such as the woven ''[[Pua Kumbu]]'' and the tied cloth (''kain kebat'') blankets which are made with unique Dayak designs. During the festival, women are keen to display their skills and hard work at mat-making and hand-weaving. Some traditional baskets are also seen.

===Traditional dress===
Men and women may wear "nigepan", the traditional costume, especially when guests are arriving. The traditional dress of men is a loincloth (sirat or cawat), animal skin coat (gagong), peacock and hornbill feathers (lelanjang) headware, chains over the neck (marik), silver armlets and anklelets along with a shield, sword and spear. Men are decorated with tribal tattoos (kalingai or pantang in Iban) which signify their life experience and journey. A frog design on the front of the man's neck and or tegulun designs on the backs of the hand indicate the wearer has chopped off a human head or killed a man in military combat. However, some designs are based on marine life which are meant for protection and rescue of the wearers when on the water. 

Women wear a hand-woven cloth (''kain betating'') worn around the waist, a rattan and brass ring high corset around the upper body, ''selampai'' (a long piece of scalp) worn over the shoulders, a woven bead chain over the neck and shoulders (''marik empang''), a decorated high-comb (''sugu tinggi'') over the hair lump (''sanggul''), a silver belt (''lampit''), armlet, anklet and orb fruit purse. In the past, it was customary for Dayak women to have the breasts bare as a sign of beauty. In Bidayuh Dayaks society, Dayung Boris are the maidens of the Gawai Festival.

==Offerings and sacrifices==
Celebrations begin on the evening of 31 May with a ceremony to cast away the spirit of greed (''Muai Antu Rua''). Two children or men, each dragging a winnowing basket (''chapan'') will pass each by family's room. Every family will throw some unwanted article into the basket. The unwanted articles will then be tossed to the ground from the end of the longhouse. 

At dusk, a ritual offering ceremony (''miring'' or ''bedara'') will take place at every family room, one after the other. Before the ceremony, ritual music called ''gendang rayah'' is performed. Old ceramic plates, ''tabak'' (big brass chalices) or containers made of split bamboo skins (''kelingkang'') are filled with food and drinks to be offered to the deities. 

The Iban Dayaks believe in seven deities (the people of hornbill's nest ie Orang Tansang Kenyalang) whose se names are ''Sengalang Burong'' (the god of war which is represented by the [[brahminy kite]] in this world); ''Biku Bunsu Petara'' (the great priest who is second in command), ''Menjaya Manang'' (the first shaman and god of medicine), ''Sempulang Gana with Semerugah'' (the god of agriculture and land), ''Selampadai'' (the god of creation and procreativity), ''Ini Inee/Andan'' (the god of justice) and ''Anda Mara'' (the god of fortune).&lt;ref&gt;Sandin B. ''Raja Durong''&lt;/ref&gt; Iban Dayaks also call upon the legendary and mythical people of Panggau Libau and Gelong, and some good helpful spirits or ghosts to attend the feast. The entire pantheon of gods is cordially invited to the gawai feast.

Offerings to the deities are placed at strategic locations ie the four corners of each family room for protection of souls,  in the kitchen, at the rice jar, in the gallery, the tanju and the farm. Other highly prized possessions such as precious old jars and modern items like rice milling engines, boat engines or a car may also be placed with offerings. Any ''pengaroh'' (charm) will be brought out for this ceremony to ensure its continuous effectiveness and to avoid madness afflicting the owner. Wallets are placed among the offerings to increase the ''tuah'' or fortune of the owners.

Each set of offerings usually contains specified odd numbers (ie 1, 3, 5, 7) of traditional items: the cigarette nipah leaves and tobacco, betel nut and sireh leaves, glutinous rice in a hand-woven leave container (''senupat''), rice cakes (''tumpi''), ''sungki'' (glutinous rice cooked in buwan leaves), glutinuos rice cooked in bamboo logs (''asi pulut lulun''), ''penganan iri'' (cakes of glutinous rice flour mixed with ''nipah'' sugar), ant nest cakes and moulded cakes, poprice (made from glutinous paddy grains heated in a wok or pot), hard-boiled chicken eggs and ''tuak'' rice wine poured over or contained in a small bamboo cup.

After all the offering sets are completed, the chief of the festival thanks the gods for a good harvest, and asks for guidance, blessings and long life as he waves a [[cockerel]] over the offerings (''bebiau''). The cockerel is sacrificed by slicing its neck. Its wing feathers are pulled out and brushed onto its bleeding neck after which each feather is placed as a sacrifice (''genselan'') onto each of the offering sets. The offerings are then placed at the designated locations.&lt;ref&gt; Arif T. [http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/article/celebrating%20borneo%60s%20harvest%20festivals.html ''Celebrating Borneo's Harvest Festivals.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817070611/http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/article/celebrating%20borneo%60s%20harvest%20festivals.html |date=17 August 2011 }} The Ministry of Tourism, Malaysia. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Dinner==
Once the offering ceremony is completed, the family sits down for dinner, the "makai di ruai" (meal at gallery) or makai rami" (festival meal) in the gallery of the longhouse. Each family member has contributed something. All the best traditional foods, delicacies and drinks that have been prepared are displayed. 

Just before midnight, a spirit-welcoming procession (''Ngalu Petara'') is performed several times up and down the gallery. A beauty pageant to choose the festival's queen and king ([[Kumang and Keling Gawai]]) is sometimes conducted. The winners are chosen for completeness of their traditional costumes and beauty. The chief and elders hold a "begeliga" to remind everybody to keep order, peace and harmony. Heavy fines (''ukom'') are imposed on those who break the customary "adat" and festive ground rules with fighting, quarrelling, drunkenness or vandalism. 

At midnight, a gong is rung to call the guests to attention. The longhouse chief (''tuai rumah'') or host will lead a toast to longevity (''Ai Pengayu'') and the new year with a short prayer (''sampi''). The festival greeting, "Gayu Guru, Gerai Nyamai, Senang Lantang Nguan Menua" is repeated to each other. Mistakes and quarrels are forgiven. Where a bard is available, he may be asked to recite a short chant called "timang ai pengayu" to bless the longevity water before the chief says the short prayer.

==After dinner==
[[File:YanAriefTarianNgajat.jpg|thumb|right|280px| A Dayak man performing the Tarian Ngajat (Ngajat Dance)]]
After dinner, celebrations are less formal. A tree of life (''ranyai'') is erected in the gallery as a backdrop to performances of the ''ngajat'' dance, sword dance (''bepencha'') or self-defence martial art (''bekuntau''). An important activity after dinner is the ''badigir'', a lining up of guests, perhaps according to their social rank. A woman sings while others in their costumes offer the men a bowl (''jalong'') of tuak and some ''tabas'' (delicacies). The winner is awarded a coconut symbolizing a trophy head skull. There may be several line-ups for groups of senior men, youth, and women. In another event, the young finish the tuak from a medium-sized jar (''kebok'') and in return they are requested to donate some money as a token of their appreciation. 

Another important activity is the singing of traditional poems. These include pantun, ramban, jawang, sanggai and pelandai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.usm.my/9122/1/LEKA_MAIN_PUISI_RAKYAT_IBAN_-_SATU_ANALISIS.pdf] Leka Main Puisi Rakyat Iban Satu analysis pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Honoured guests may be asked to break up a coconut to symbolise the actions of Sengalang Burong (the god of war) during the Iban timang incantation which is called "ngelanpang" (chopping off the head skull to present various kinds of beneficial seeds to humankind). Other activities include ([[blowgun|blowpipe]]) sumpit contests, mini sports and traditional games such as tuak drinking, arm-wrestling (bibat lengan), small log pulling (betarit lampong), rope pulling (tarit tali) and foot-banging (bapatis). Some engage in [[cockfighting]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan W. ''Bulu Manok Iban: Bujang Sugi and Rukun Sabong.''&lt;/ref&gt; Mini sports include football, ''sepak takraw'' (rattan kickball) and [[futsal]]. Other games are egg-rolling, plate passing according to the taboh music, running in gunny sacks and balloon blowing and karaoke and joget dance.

==Dances==
There are many variations of the traditional ngajat dance. The male and female dances consist of graceful and precise movements of the body, hands and feet with occasional shouts of a battle cry. Examples are the ''ngajat lesong'' (rice mortar dance) and the warrior dance for men. Women perform the ''ngajat pua kumbu'' (ritual cloth dance). The male dance shows strength and bravery and may imitate the movements of a hornbill which is regarded as the king of worldly birds. The ngajat dance is accompanied by a traditional band consisting of an ''engkerumong'' set (percussion), ''tawak'' (big gong), ''bebendai'' (small gong) and ''bedup'' (drum).  The Orang Ulu music is played using the ''sape''. Recordings of the tunes may be used instead of a band.

Bidayuh Dayak dances include the ''tolak bala'' (danger repealing), a dance performed before the harvest to ask for blessing and protection of the community; the ''totokng'' dance that is performed during the harvest festival to welcome the paddy soul and guests; the ''langi julang'' which is performed at the closing of the harvest festival to thank gods for bestowing good health and a rich harvest; and the eagle-warrior fight dance performed after the harvest season. Hands are held outstretched imitating the movements of the eagles as they flap their wings in flight. The eagle eventually falls unconscious so leaving the warrior as the winner. It is performed by men seeking a female partner.

==Ngabang==
[[File:Gawai.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tuak is widely consumed during Gawai.]]
On the first day of June, Dayak homes are opened to guests. This practice is called "ngabang". Open houses may also be organised by Dayak associations or non-government organisations. This will continue until the end of June where the gawai will be closed in a ''ngiling bidai'' (mat rolling up) ceremony. 

When guests arrive, tuak is offered and women line up in two rows on each side of the ladder "nyambut pengabang". The welcoming drink (''ai tiki'') is followed by the thirst-quenching drink (''ai aus''). Then, when the guests are seated, further rounds of [[rice wine|tuak]] as a washing drink (''ai basu''), profit drink (''ai untong'') and respect drink (''ai basa'') are given. This activity is called the watering of guests or "nyibur temuai". 

Speeches are made such as the ''jaku ansah'' (sharpening speech) which introduces the guest of honor. The guest of honor is received with a "miring" offering ceremony outside the longhouse. Upon approaching the longhouse ladder, the guest of honor is asked to ''open a fort'' ("muka kuta"). This is represented by the slashing of a bamboo fence with a sword and a poem. Then, at the foot of the longhouse ladder, an animal is speared (''mankan''). 

In ''ngalu pengabang'', guests led by ''ngajat'' dancers and followed by the band, process to their seats in the longhouse gallery. After that, a guest prayer (''biau pengabang'') is recited by a talented speaker like the headman or the ''lemambang'' bard while he sways holding a chicken over the heads of guests. Before the guests are offered foods, a special speech (called "muka kujuk" in Iban) to open the traditional cloth covering over food containers is recited. 

After eating, the families of the longhouse are visited by guests. A short longhouse may have ten to thirty family rooms while moderately long may have thirty to fifty family rooms. A very long longhouse may have fifty to one hundred family rooms. It is common for Dayaks to discuss their [[genealogy]] (''tusut in Iban''). In the activity called ''bantil'' (persuaded drinking), women offer drinks to men to help them overcome shyness. Men traditionally reject the first offers as a sign of respect to the host. Women sing a traditional poem called ''pantun'' while offering tuak. In the activity called ''uti'', a special guest is asked to open a coconut placed on a ceramic plate using a blunt knife without handling the coconut or breaking the plate. The coconut tells of someone's heart and fate: white flesh is good and black flesh is bad.

==Pregawai and Closing of Gawai Dayak==
In town areas, pre-gawai are held in May in advance of the  gawai proper before the city dwellers return to their respective villages.  

Gawai ends around the end of June. The closing ceremony is signified by symbolically rolling back a miring ceremony mat called a ''bidai'' by each family within the longhouse. It is known as ''Ngiling Bidai'' among Iban Dayaks.

==Associated celebrations==
Gawai Dayak celebrations may last for a month. It is during this time of year that many Dayak weddings (''Melah Pinang''&lt;ref&gt;Majang A. ''Melah Pinang''.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Gawai Lelabi'') take place. 

Most Iban will hold minor rites called ''bedara'' which can be ''bedara mata'' (an unripe offering) inside the family ''bilek'' room or ''bedara mansau'' (a ripe offering) at the family ruai gallery. ''Berunsur'' (cleansing) is performed at the family ''tanju'' (verandah). Rituals called ''gawa'' are the ''Sandau Ari'' (midday festival); ''Tresang Mansau'' (red bamboo pole); and ''Gawai Kalingkang''.&lt;ref&gt;Sandin B. and Sather C. ''Iban Adat and Augury''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ritual feasts of the [[Saribas]] and Skrang region include ''Gawai Bumai'' (agricultural festival); ''Gawai Batu'' (whetstone festival); ''Gawai Benih]]'' (a paddy seed festival);&lt;ref&gt;Gawai Batu by Benedict Sandin&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gawai Burong]]'' (a bird festival).&lt;ref&gt;Sandin B. ''Gawai Burong''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandin B. ''Gawai Antu''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grijih H. ''Gawai Antu, Iban Feast of the Departed''.&lt;/ref&gt; The bird festival is performed early in the period to avoid spoiling of rice wine by the spirit ''Indai Bilai'' during the festival for the dead. The ''Gawai Antu'' or ''Ngelumbong'' (festival of the dead) follows the Gawai Dayak. 

In the Baleh region, the Iban festivals include the ''Gawai Baintu-intu'' (wellness festival); ''Gawai Bumai'' (farming festival); ''Gawai Amat'' (proper festival to request divine supernatural assistance);&lt;ref&gt;Masing J. ''Timang Gawai Amat: A study of Timang Incantation of Iban Baleh''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gawai Ngelumbung'' (tomb building festival) and ''Gawai Mimpi'' (dream festival based on dream messages from the spirits). 

Fortune related festivals include ''Gawai Tuah'' (fortune festival); ''Gawai Ngiga Tuah'' (fortune seeking festival); ''Gawai Namaka Tuah'' (fortune welcoming festival); ''Gawai Tajau'' (jar festival);&lt;ref&gt;Enggu E. ''Pengap Gawai Tajau''&lt;/ref&gt; For any newly completed longhouses, a ''Gawai Mangkong Tiang'' (main house post hammering festival) is celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;Sandin B. ''Gawai Pangkong Tiang''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gawai Sakit'' (healing festival)&lt;ref&gt;Sandin B. ''Gawai Sakit oleh''.&lt;/ref&gt; takes place if the ''belian'' rituals ("sugi sakit" and "renong sakit") are unsuccessful. 

For most of these traditional festivals, sacred invocation and incantations called ''pengap'' or ''timang'' are performed through the night by a bard and his assistants. &lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.usm.my/9122/1/LEKA_MAIN_PUISI_RAKYAT_IBAN_-_SATU_ANALISIS.pdf ''Leka Main Puisi Rakyat Iban Satu analysis.''] pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Christian celebrations==
Christian Dayaks replace the traditional offering ceremony with a prayer session within the family room. The associated church service leadet is called ''tuai sembiang''.

'''Guy of Warwick''', or '''Gui de Warewic''', is a legendary English hero of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] popular in [[England]] and [[France]] from the 13th to 17th centuries. The story of Sir Guy is considered by scholars to be part of the [[Matter of England]].&lt;ref name=boundaries&gt;''Boundaries in medieval romance'', Neil Cartlidge, DS Brewer, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84384-155-X}}, 9781843841555. pp. 29-42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The core of the legend&lt;ref&gt;The fictive narratives of Guy were taken as history in chronicles of [[Thomas Rudborne]] and [[John Hardyng]] (Richmond 1996:ch 4.5), and Guy appears in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' along with [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Robin Hood]], and so is not simply a figure in fiction but a character of [[legend]].&lt;/ref&gt; is that Guy falls in love with the lady Felice ("Happiness"), who is of much higher [[Social stratification|social standing]]. In order to wed Felice he must prove his valour in [[Chivalry|chivalric adventures]] and become a knight; in order to do this he travels widely, battling fantastic monsters such as [[dragon]]s, [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], a [[Dun Cow]] and great [[boar]]s. He returns and weds Felice but soon, full of remorse for his violent past, he leaves on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]]; later he returns privately and lives out his long life as a [[hermit]] (according to local legend in a cave overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]], situated at [[Guys Cliffe]]).

In one recension, Guy, son of Siward or Seguard of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], by his prowess in foreign wars wins in marriage Felice (the Phyllis of the well-known ballad), daughter and heiress of Roalt, [[Earl of Warwick]]. Soon after his marriage he is seized with remorse for the violence of his past life, and, by way of penance, leaves his wife and fortune to make a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. After years of absence he returns in time to deliver Winchester for [[Athelstan of England]] from the invading northern kings, Anelaph (Anlaf or Olaf) and Gonelaph, by slaying in [[single combat]] their champion, the giant [[Colbrand (giant)|Colbrand]]. Winchester tradition fixes the duel at [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde Mead, before the Abbey]] near [[Winchester]]. Making his way to [[Warwick]], he becomes one of his wife's [[Beadsman|beadsmen]], and presently retires to a hermitage in [[Arden, Warwickshire|Arden]], only revealing his identity, like [[Roch|Saint Roch]], at the approach of death.

==Historical basis==
Velma Bourgeois Richmond&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, ''The Legend of Guy of Warwick.'' (New York and London: Garland) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; has traced the career of Guy of Warwick from the legends of [[soldier saint]]s to metrical romances composed for an aristocratic audience that widened in the sixteenth century to a popular audience that included Guy among the [[Nine Worthies]], passing into children's literature and local guidebooks, before dying out in the twentieth century. The kernel of the tradition evidently lies in the fight with Colbrand, which symbolically represents some kernel of historical fact. The religious side of the legend finds parallels in the stories of [[Eustace|St Eustachius]] and St Alexius, and makes it probable that the Guy-legend, as we have it, has passed through monastic hands. Tradition seems to be at fault in putting Guy's adventures anachronistically in the reign of [[Athelstan]]; the Anlaf of the story is probably [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]], who, with [[Sweyn I of Denmark]], harried the southern counties of England in 993 and pitched his winter quarters in Southampton; this means the King of England at the time was Æthelred ''Unready'' II. Winchester was saved, however, not by the valour of an English champion, but by the payment of money. This Olaf was not unnaturally confused with [[Olaf Cuaran|Anlaf Cuaran]] or [[Havelok the Dane]].

The Anglo-Norman warrior hero of ''Gui de Warewic'', marked Guy's first appearance in the early thirteenth century. Topographical allusions show the poem's composer to be more familiar with the area of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], near Oxford, than with Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911 suggested a historic connection through etymology: "The name Guy (perhaps a Norman form of Early English ''wig'', "war") may be fairly connected with the family of [[Wigod]], lord of Wallingford under Edward the Confessor."&lt;/ref&gt;

Guy was transformed in the fourteenth century with a spate of metrical romances written in [[Middle English]]. The versions which we possess are adaptations from the French, and are cast in the form of a ''roman''; the adventures open with a long recital of Guy's wars in [[Lombardy]], [[Germany]] and [[Constantinople]], embellished with fights with dragons and surprising feats of arms. The name ''Guy'' entered the Beauchamp family, [[earls of Warwick]], when William de Beauchamp IV inherited the title in 1269 through his mother's brother, named his heir "Guy" in 1298. A tower added to [[Warwick Castle]] in 1394 was named "Guy's Tower", and Guy of Warwick relics began to accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond 1996: 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Filicia", who belongs to the twelfth century, was perhaps the Norman poet's patroness, occurs in the pedigree of the Ardens, descended from Thurkill of Warwick and his son Siward. [[Guys Cliffe]], near Warwick, where in the fourteenth century [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], erected a chantry, with a statue of the hero, does not correspond with the site of the hermitage as described in the ''Godfreyson'' (see [[Havelok]]).

The narrative detail of the legend is obvious fiction, though it may have become vaguely connected with the family history of the Ardens and the Wallingford family, but it was accepted as authentic fact in the chronicle of [[Pierre de Langtoft]] (Peter of Langtoft) written at the end of the thirteenth century.

The adventures of Reynbrun, son of Guy, and his tutor Heraud of Arden, who had also educated Guy, have much in common with his father's history, and form an interpolation sometimes treated as a separate romance. A connection between Guy and [[Guido, count of Tours]] (flourished about 800) was made when [[Alcuin]]'s advice to the count, ''Liber ad Guidonem'', was transferred to the English hero in the ''[[Speculum Gy de Warewyke]]'' (c. 1327), edited for the [[Early English Text Society]] by Georgiana Lea Morrill Morrill, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;(Morrill) ''Speculum Gy de Warewyke'' Introduction, VIII "Concerning Guido, count of Tours", pp lxxxiiiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today [[Guy of Warwick's Sword]] can be seen at [[Warwick Castle]].

A French prose version was printed in Paris, 1525, and subsequently (see [[Gustave Brunet]], ''Manuel du libraire'', ''s.v.'' "Guy de Warvich"); the English metrical romance exists in four versions dating from the early fourteenth century; the text was edited by J. Zupitza (187.51876) for the Early English Texts Society from Cambridge University Library, Paper MS. Ff. 2, 38, and again (pts. 1883-1891, extra series, Nos. 42, 49, 59), from the [[Auchinleck manuscript]] and [[Caius College]] MS. A late mediaeval Irish prose version, copied in the 15th century, ''The Irish Lives of Guy of Warwick and Bevis of Hampton'' is in [[Trinity College Library]], Dublin (Ms H.2.7), and is largely based on the English originals (this, and its translation by [[Fred Norris Robinson|F.N. Robinson]], are available online from the CELT project&lt;ref&gt;Full text in [http://research.ucc.ie/celt/document/G306000 Irish] and [http://research.ucc.ie/celt/document/T306000 English]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The popularity of the legend is shown by the numerous versions in English: [[John Lydgate]] claimed that ''Guy of Warwick'', his English verse version composed between 1442 and 1468, was translated from the Latin chronicle of Giraldus Cornubiensis ([[floruit|fl.]] 1350); ''Guy of Warwick, a poem'' (written in 1617 and licensed, but not printed) by [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]], the manuscript of which (in the [[British Library]]) contains a sonnet by John Milton, father of the [[John Milton|poet]]; ''The Famous Historie of Guy, Earl of Warwick'' (c. 1607) by [[Samuel Rowlands]]; ''The Booke of the moste Victoryous Prince Guy of Warwicke'' (William Copland, London, n.d.); other editions by J. Cawood and C. Bates; [[chapbook]]s and [[ballad]]s of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; ''[[The Tragical History of Guy Earl of Warwick|The Tragical History, Admirable Achievements and Various Events of Guy Earl of Warwick]]'' (1661) which may possibly be identical with a play on the subject written by [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]] and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], and entered at [[Stationers' Hall]] on 15 January 1618/19; three verse fragments are printed by Hales and [[F. J. Furnivall]] in their edition of the Percy Folio MS. vol. ii.; an early French MS. is described by J. A. Herbert (''An Early MS. of Gui de Warwick'', London, 1905). In the Valencian book "[[Tirant lo Blanch]]" appears a character based on Guy Whose name is "Guillem de Varoic"

'''Hanuman Prasad Poddar'''  (1892–1971) was an [[India]]n freedom fighter, litterateur, magazine editor and philanthropist. He was also one of trustee of gita press by Ghanshyam Jalan and Jay Dayal ji Goeyendka-Sethji . His work in fostering pride among the people regarding India's glorious history and philosophic tradition earned him praise from [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. The Government of India issued a postage stamp in his memory in 1992.

==Early life==
Hanuman Prasad Poddar was born in Shillong. He spent a considerable time in [[Ratangarh, Churu|Ratangarh]] in the [[Shekhawati]] region of [[Rajasthan]] into a [[Marwari people|Marwadi]] trading family belonging to the mercantile [[Agarwal]] caste. Born into a prosperous family of traditional outlook and culture, he received a rich traditional education and imbibed the culture, traditions and outlook of old India. His father was particularly keen that he should learn English, because the family had begun trading in Kolkata and knowledge of English was a necessary skill for making a success there.

==Youth==
While he was still a teenager, Poddar was married to a girl from his own community and background, chosen by his parents. Around the same time, he began attending his father's office as an apprentice. He had the opportunity to travel over most of northern India by rail and bullock cart to advance his family's trading business. Once he had gained requisite experience and showed some ability, his father put him in charge of the Kolkata office, as had been the plan for him from an early age. Poddar, who was now in his 20s, made a success of this assignment and the family trading business flourished. Kolkata in those days was still the first city of the British Raj and the place where new ideas and awareness first made their appearance. At this time, four factors came together to produce a major impact on Poddar's mind and personality. These were: his exposure to wider India; exposure to cosmopolitan Kolkata, which in those days drew people from all over India; exposure to the British, whose authority and arrogance was nowhere as evident as in that metropolis; and perhaps most importantly, the pride and knowledge of Indian culture which had come to him from his traditional background. These four factors united to bring about within him an awareness of the pitiful state of India, and the need to instill pride in Indians of their culture and value system, so that they could deal with the world on their own terms.

During these years, his wife remained with his parents in Ratangarh, while Poddar lived in Kolkata in a community hostel with other young Marwadi men who were also working in trade. This arrangement was standard and typical of the Kolkata Marwadi ethos of that day. It was in this milieu that Poddar came into contact with some [[Bengali people|Bengali]] young men of a revolutionary bent. In those days, Bengal was the cradle of armed struggle against British rule, and Kolkata was still the first city of India. the hostel in which Poddar lived began to be used as a safe house by certain revolutionary youth. Poddar had little knowledge and no involvement in these activities. Nevertheless, when the police finally raided the hostel, he and every other young man living there was tarred with the same brush as the revolutionaries. Although he was not accused in court of having committed any violent act, the British authorities jailed him for several months, pending trial, merely for having been in contact with the nationalist revolutionaries. This term in jail, for no actual offence, proved to be a turning point in Poddar's life. Although his family's business was flourishing, Poddar lost interest in pursuing trade. Instead, his inclination turned towards nationalism.

In 1918 he shifted to Bombay now Mumbai and over the period of time developed very close relationship with Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya &amp; other leaders involved in the freedom struggle. https://radhababaofgorakhpur.wordpress.com/bio/shri-bhaiji/

==Publishing career==
After being released from the jail he started publishing and editing ‘Kalyaan’ to reach the spiritual glory and high value oriented heroic deeds of heroes of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata to the each Indian to feel them spiritually free and proud of their achievements in the past as a source of inspiration to fight for the freedom of India.

He dedicated his life to make available great epics like the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Puranas]] and the [[Upanishads]] translated in Hindi to the common people at affordable prices.

He started  publishing and editing ‘[[Kalyaan]]’ monthly Magazine from 1927 in [[Hindi]] with a view to ‘the betterment of life and the well- being of all’ This Magazine is basically dedicated to spirituality and gives wider exposure to the various aspects of Hindu religion. ‘Kalyan’ has published special issues on all Puranas, Upanishads and on many more subjects related to Hindu culture and religion. This magazine still continues to be in publication with approximately 2,50,000 subscribers.

He also published and edited ‘Kalyaan – Kalpataru’ in English from 1934 and the book continues to be in publication

Lovingly called as  Bhaijee, he was a multifaceted  personality. As an editor of the religious magazine 'Kalyan', he is known for his untiring efforts to propagate and disseminate [[Hindu]] religion across the world.

He wrote many books on spiritual and value–oriented subjects in Hindi and English. His translation of some Upanishads and Puranas in Hindi and English show his command over both languages. In these translations, he has taken care of the communicability of the language to the common people without causing any compromise with their poetic and philosophical heights and depths.

'''Hebe''' is a fictional deity appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], a child of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] and [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]], the wife of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], and the cup-bearer of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]]. She first appeared in ''Ka-Zar'' #1 (August 1970), written by [[Allyn Brodsky]] and [[Frank Springer]], and is based on the [[Hebe (mythology)|mythological character of the same name]].

==Publication history==
Hebe first appeared in ''Ka-Zar'' #1, and appeared very sparsely over the subsequent four decades.  She made a notable appearance in ''Incredible Hulk: Hercules Unleashed'' (October 1996).  She then appeared in ''Hulk vs. Hercules: When Titans Collide'' #1 (June 2008), and became a recurring character in the second year of ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' beginning in issue #127.

==Fictional character biography==
The third child of Zeus and Hera (her brothers are [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]), she is the Goddess of Youth and the cup-bearer of the gods, responsible for brewing [[ambrosia]]. She was married to the newly-divine Hercules as a peace offering between Hercules and her mother Hera, and for a time the two of them had a happy relationship. However, Hercules grew dissatisfied with life on Olympus, and returned to the mortal world  in search of adventure. He also began having affairs, which left Hebe distraught as Hera told her that the failure of her marriage was her fault.&lt;ref name="assault"&gt;''Assault on New Olympus Prologue'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the destruction of Olympus at the hands of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], Hebe serves her mother Hera as a secretary at the Olympus Group.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hercules #123''&lt;/ref&gt;  She later arranges for [[Norman Osborn]] and his [[Dark Avengers]] to arrive on the site of a battle between Hera and Hercules' group, believing that her ultimate duty was still to him.  When Hera discovered her betrayal, she blasted Hebe with her thunderbolt, sending her hurtling out of the Olympus Group tower to the ground. Relatively unharmed, she fled the scene in search of Hercules, but could not find him.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hercules'' #128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

She is later discovered by [[Aunt May]] living with a group of homeless people in [[Central Park]], and is convinced to take her followers to a shelter at which May works. May quickly befriends Hebe, whose ambrosia mixture makes the shelter a huge success. May sets her up on a blind date with her nephew [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], which is interrupted by an angry Hercules.  Hebe tearfully confronts him his abandoning her, and Hercules admits that it was never her that drove him away, but his desire for adventure, as he cannot be happy as a god away from the world. Hebe says that she loves him for that, and the two depart on better terms, with Spider-Man, to confront Hera's evil scheme.&lt;ref name="assault" /&gt; Hebe's joy of reunion with her former husband was quickly dashed away when Hercules apparently sacrificed himself to save Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hercules'' #141&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Amadeus Cho]] takes over the Olympus Group she becomes his assistant, and is ecstatic to learn that Hercules is not in the Underworld. [[Agamemnon (comics)|Vali Halfling]] reveals that Hebe's ambrosia is one of the four elements needed to ascend to the power-level of the Skyfathers.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroic Age: Prince of Power'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Hebe is one of the few deities to survive Amatsu-Mikaboshi's destruction of the Council of God-Heads. She and Hercules reunite in Hawaii, and despite her protests for Hercules not to agree for [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]] and Pele to re-make him as a true All-Father, Hercules consents and ascends to the full power and prestige of Skyfather.&lt;ref&gt;''Chaos War'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
An Olympian goddess, Hebe is immortal (and eternally young), with enhanced durability.

'''Iperú Tourist Information and Assistance''', or simply '''Iperú''' (with lower-case ''p'')&lt;ref name="La Republica 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.larepublica.pe/node/162365/comentario |title=Turistas disponen de servicio telefónico Iperú para denuncias e informes |date=16 August 2008 |work=Diario La República |language=Spanish |accessdate=10 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66mrbYPVG?url=http://www.larepublica.pe/node/162365/comentario |archivedate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|ipeˈɾu}}) is the [[Perú]] tourism office provided since 1994 by the [[Peruvian government]] through the Commission for the Promotion of Exports and Tourism of Perú ({{lang-es|Comisión de Promoción de las Exportaciones y el Turismo del Perú}}, Promperú) and the National Institute for Defense of Competition and Protection of Intellectual Property (''{{lang|es|Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y de la Protección de la Propiedad Intellectual}}'', INDECOPI), to provide domestic and foreign travelers with objective and impartial information as well as support services. The organization's logo is the international tourist information symbol, a lower-case white "i" inside a blue circle, followed by "perú".

The Iperú headquarters are in [[Lima]], and there are multilingual offices throughout the country.

During 2007, Iperú handled 287,492 cases, including requests for information and for assistance or both, all over Peru.&lt;ref name="La Republica 2008" /&gt;

==Functions==
Iperú has three core purposes:

* To provide visitor information.
* To advise tourists on relevant paperwork and procedures required by public and private institutions.
* To contribute to the resolution of complaints from tourists against operators of tourist services.

Iperú provides free information and services for various sorts of travelers to and within Peru &amp;ndash; including tourists, businesspeople and academics &amp;ndash; before, during, and even after their trip. The organization has a comprehensive database of registered tourism services in the country, as well as information about places, attractions, routes, and travel times. Iperú also provides assistance in cases of problems arises during a trip or if tourist services are not provided as hired. Iperú is responsible for handling claims submitted by tourists against the suppliers of tourism services, with mediating and conciliatory (but not punitive) powers to resolve them.

==History==
A cooperation agreement on 24 June 1994 between Promperú and INDECOPI established the '''Tourist Protection Service''' (''{{lang|es|Servicio de Protección al Turista}}'', SPT). Through this agreement, INDECOPI gave to the new bureau the functions of the earlier '''Consumer Protection Commission''' (''{{lang|es|Comisión de Protección al Consumidor}}'', CPC) in cases against tourism companies.

In 2001, noting the need for objective tourist information to visitors in order to prevent adverse incidents and improve the services provided by SPT, it was decided to add the '''Tourist Information Service''' (''{{lang|es|Servicio de Información Turística}}'', SIT).

Merging the functions of both services{{when|date=April 2012}} gave rise to Iperú Tourist Information and Assistance.

==Accessibility==
The Iperú headquarters are in [[Lima]], and there are operations in 12 [[Regions of Peru|Peruvian regions]], with 30 local offices {{as of|2009|1|lc=y}}, which are usually named with the city in which they are located (e.g., the Iperú office in [[Iquitos]], ([[Peruvian Amazon]]), is Iperú Iquitos). Despite being a governmental organization, is accessible in person, by phone and by e-mail 24 hours a day, every day of the week and year. Operators of Iperú typically speak [[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]], and some are fluent in other languages.  Local offices can typically handle 5 or more languages with staff on hand at any given time, and provide published materials in Spanish, English, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

In popular locales, Iperú installs kiosks of tourist information on events or places with large influx of visitors and foreign nationals, such as the celebration of the [[Inti Raymi]] in [[Cusco]] and the Patronal Feast of Saint John in Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon.

===List of offices===
Iperú operates 14 offices around the country, in [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]], [[Ancash Region|Ancash]], [[Arequipa]], [[Ayacucho]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Cusco]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]], [[La Libertad Region|La Libertad]], [[Lima]], [[Loreto Region|Loreto]], [[Piura]], [[Puno]], [[Tacna]] and [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peru.travel/en/iperu-offices-of-tourist-information-and-assistance-ip4-2-mapaazul |title=Offices Nationwide |publisher=Iperú |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Odisha, old [[sari]]s are stacked on each other and hand-stitched to make a thin piece of [[cushion]]. This is normally used above a bed cushion or instead of a cushion.&lt;ref name="General"&gt;{{cite book|author=India. Office of the Registrar General|title=Census of India, 1961: Orissa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgUfAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Manager of Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kantha [[sari]]s" are traditionally worn by women in [[Bengal]] region of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/one-stitch-at-a-time/article6445032.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantha stitching is also used to make simple quilts, commonly known as [[Nakshi Kantha]]. Women in Bengal typically use old saris and cloth and layer them with kantha stitching to make a light blanket, throw, or bedspread, especially for children. Kantha is very popular with tourists visiting the [[Bengal]] region of the Indian subcontinent.

Kantha is a form of embroidery often practised by rural women. The traditional form of Kantha embroidery was done with soft dhotis and saris, with a simple running stitch along the edges. Depending on the use of the finished product they were known as ''Lepkantha'' or ''Sujni Kantha''.

The embroidered cloth has many uses including shawls, covers for mirrors, boxes, and pillows. In some cases, the entire cloth is covered with running stitches, employing beautiful motifs of flowers, animals birds and geometrical shapes, as well as themes from everyday activities. The stitching on the cloth gives it a slightly wrinkled, wavy effect. Contemporary Kantha is applied to a wider range of garments such as sarees, dupatta, shirts for men and women, bedding and other furnishing fabrics, mostly using cotton and silk.

'''Lag BaOmer''' ({{lang-he-n|לַ״ג בָּעוֹמֶר}}), also '''Lag B'Omer''', is a [[Judaism|Jewish]] holiday celebrated on the 33rd day of the [[Counting of the Omer]], which occurs on the 18th day of the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew month]] of [[Iyar]].

This day marks the ''[[Yom Hillula|hillula]]'' (celebration, interpreted by some as anniversary of death) of Rabbi [[Simeon bar Yochai|Shimon bar Yochai]], a [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] sage and leading disciple of [[Rabbi Akiva]] in the 2nd century, and the day on which he revealed the deepest secrets of [[kabbalah]] in the form of the ''[[Zohar]]'' (Book of Splendor), a landmark text of [[Jewish mysticism]]. This association has spawned several well-known customs and practices on Lag BaOmer, including the lighting of [[bonfire]]s, pilgrimages to the tomb of [[Simeon bar Yochai|Bar Yochai]] in the northern Israeli town of [[Meron, Israel|Meron]], and various customs at the tomb itself.&lt;ref&gt;The association of Lag BaOmer with the death of rabbi Shimon bar Yochai may be based on a printer's error. See {{cite web|last1=Brodt|first1=Eliezer|title=A Printing Mistake and the Mysterious Origins of Rashbi’s Yahrzeit|url=http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/05/printing-mistake-and-mysterious-origins.html|website=seforim.blogspot.com|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Lag Ba'Omer bonfire Tel Aviv Israel.jpg|175px|thumb|Children watch Lag BaOmer bonfire in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel.]]
{{Main|Counting of the Omer}}

Lag BaOmer is Hebrew for "33rd [day] in the [[Counting of the Omer|Omer]]". (The [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letter]] ל ([[lamedh|lamed]]) or "L" has the numerical value of 30 and ג ([[gimel|gimmel]]) or "G" has the numerical value of 3. A vowel sound is conventionally added for pronunciation purposes.)

Some Jews call this holiday Lag '''La'''Omer, which means "33rd [day] ''of'' the Omer", as opposed to Lag '''Ba'''Omer, "33rd [day] ''in'' the Omer". Lag '''Ba'''Omer is the traditional method of counting by some [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Jews; Lag '''La'''Omer is the count used by [[Sephardi Jews]]. Lag '''La'''Omer is also the name used by [[Yosef Karo]], who was a Sepharadi, in his ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (''Orach Chaim'' 493:2, and cf. 489:1 where '''Ba'''Omer is inserted by a [[glossator]]).&lt;ref name=ohr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/63/Q2/|title=Count D'Omer |publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach International]] |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The form Lag '''B&amp;#39;'''Omer ["33rd day of ''an'' Omer"] is also sometimes used, though it is not grammatically correct in this setting.) The [[Chabad|Lubavitcher]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], writes in his ''[[Likkutei Sichos]]'' that a deeper reason for the term Lag '''Ba'''Omer is that the Hebrew words ''Lag BaOmer'' (ל״ג בעמר, spelled without the "[[Vav (letter)|vav]]"), have the same ''gematria'' as ''Moshe'' (משה, Moses). He writes that Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]], whose [[yahrzeit]] is traditionally observed on this day, was mystically a spark of the soul of [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Rabbi Tzvi (1985). ''Bein Pesach L'Shavuos'' (Hebrew). Chapter 17: Lag BaOmer, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="speaking"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:WnlBzF-0qXIJ:www.thehalacha.com/attach/Volume3/Issue16.pdf+chai+rotel |title=Lag BaOmer |last=Lebovits |first=Moishe Dovid |volume=3 |issue=16 |page=6 |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |publisher=Halachically Speaking }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:קבר רשב"י.jpg|thumb|250px|Entrance to the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son, Rabbi [[Eleazar b. Simeon|Eleazar]].]]
The origins of Lag BaOmer as a minor festival are unclear. The date is mentioned explicitly for the first time in the 12th century by Avraham ben Nathan in the Sefer Hamanhig (106).   The [[Talmud]]ist [[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] in his gloss to ''[[Nashim|Yevamot]]'' 62b cites the Talmudic passage which states that during the time of Rabbi Akiva, 24,000 of his students died from a divinely-sent plague during the counting of the Omer. The Talmud goes on to say that this was because they did not show proper respect to one another. Meiri named Lag BaOmer as the day when, "according to a tradition of the [[geonim]]", the "plague" ended.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15098.html|title=Omer|first=David M. |last=Feldman |year=2008|accessdate=April 28, 2013|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 students, he was left with only five students, among them Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The latter went on to become the greatest teacher of Torah in his generation, and is purported to have authored the ''Zohar'', a landmark text of Jewish mysticism. The ''Zohar'' calls the day of Bar Yochai's death a ''hillula''.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt; Rabbi [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Chaim Vital]], the main disciple of Rabbi Isaac Luria and author of ''[[Kabbalah: Primary texts#Etz Hayim and the Eight Gates|Etz Chaim]]'', was the first to name Lag BaOmer as the date of Bar Yochai's ''hillula''.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt; According to the ''Zohar'' (III, 287b–296b), on the day of Bar Yochai's death, he revealed the deepest secrets of the Kabbalah.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380745/jewish/Rashbis-Passing.htm|title=Rashbi's Passing|first=Moshe|last=Miller|publisher=chabad.org|year=2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lag BaOmer therefore became a day of celebration of the great light (i.e., wisdom) that Bar Yochai brought into the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbiorlofsky.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=13|title=The Fire Within: Some thoughts on Lag B'Omer|first=Rabbi Dovid|last=Orlofsky|publisher=Moshe Yehuda Institute|year=2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630044858/http://www.rabbiorlofsky.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=13|archivedate=June 30, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nachman Krochmal]], a 19th-century Jewish theologian, among others, suggests that the deaths of Rabbi Akiva's students was a veiled reference to the defeat of "Akiva's soldiers" by the Romans, and that Lag BaOmer was the day on which Bar Kokhba enjoyed a brief victory.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;
 
During the Middle Ages, Lag BaOmer became a special holiday for rabbinical students and was called "Scholar's Day."  It was customary to rejoice on this day through outdoor sports.&lt;ref name="peter"/&gt;

===Kabbalistic significance===
Lag BaOmer has another significance based on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] custom of assigning a [[Sefirah]] to each day and week of the Omer count. The first week corresponds to ''Chesed'', the second week to ''Gevurah'', etc., and similarly, the first day of each week corresponds to ''Chesed'', the second day to ''Gevurah'', etc. Thus, the 33rd day, which is the fifth day of the fifth week, corresponds to ''Hod she-be-Hod'' (Splendor within [the week of] Splendor). As such, Lag BaOmer represents the level of spiritual manifestation or Hod that would precede the more physical manifestation of the 49th day (''Malkhut she-be-Malkhut'', Kingship within [the week of] Kingship), which immediately precedes the holiday of Shavuot.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Customs and practices==
[[File:GraveOfRabbiSimeonBarYochaiOnLagBOmer.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Meron, Israel|Meron]] on Lag BaOmer.]]
While the Counting of the Omer is a semi-mourning period, all restrictions of mourning are lifted on this 33rd day of the Omer. As a result, weddings, parties, listening to music, and haircuts are commonly scheduled to coincide with this day among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Families go on picnics and outings. Children go out to the fields with their teachers with bows and rubber-tipped arrows. {{lang|he-Latn|[[Tachanun]]}}, the prayer for special Divine mercy on one's behalf is not said, because when God is showing one a "smiling face," so to speak, as He does especially on the holidays, there is no need to ask for special mercy.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The Sephardi custom is to continue mourning practices through the 33rd day of the Omer and celebrate on the 34th day of the Omer, or ''{{lang|he-Latn|LaD BaOmer}}'' ({{lang|he|ל״ד בעומר}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Orach Chayim]] 493:2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondbt.com/2012/05/09/mournings-end-understanding-sefira-and-lag-bomer |title=Mourning's End&amp;nbsp;– Understanding Sefira and Lag B’Omer |last=Travis |first=Rabbi Daniel Yaakov |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |publisher=Beyond BT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501164650/http://www.beyondbt.com/2012/05/09/mournings-end-understanding-sefira-and-lag-bomer/ |archivedate=May 1, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonfires===
[[File:WoodCollectingForLagBomer.JPG|175px|left|thumb|Israeli boys collect wood for a Lag BaOmer bonfire.]]
[[File:WoodforLagBaomerSorotzkin1.jpg|thumbnail|left|A wood pile awaiting Lag Baomer celebration.]]
[[File:WoodforLagBaomerSorotzkin2.jpg|thumbnail|left|Another wood pile along the wadi near [[Rechov Sorotzkin]] street in Jerusalem.]]

The most well-known custom of {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} is the lighting of [[bonfire]]s throughout Israel and worldwide wherever religious Jews can be found. In [[Meron, Israel#Tomb of Shimon Bar Yochai|Meron]], the burial place of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son, Rabbi [[Eleazar b. Simeon|Eleazar]], hundreds of thousands of Jews gather throughout the night and day to celebrate with bonfires, torches, song and feasting. This was a specific request by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai of his students. Some say that as bar Yochai gave spiritual light to the world with the revelation of the Zohar, bonfires are lit to symbolize the impact of his teachings.  As his passing left such a "light" behind, many candles and/or bonfires are lit.&lt;ref name="silber"/&gt;

The ''{{lang|he-Latn|Bnei Yissaschar}}'' cites another reason for the lighting of bonfires. On the day of his death, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said, "Now it is my desire to reveal secrets...  The day will not go to its place like any other, for this entire day stands within my domain..."  Daylight was miraculously extended until Rabbi Shimon had completed his final teaching and died. This symbolized that all light is subservient to spiritual light, and particularly to the primeval light contained within the mystical teachings of the Torah. As such, the custom of lighting fires symbolizes this revelation of powerful light.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

At the tomb of Rabbi Shimon, the honor of lighting the main bonfire traditionally goes to the Rebbes of the [[Boyan (Hasidic dynasty)|Boyaner dynasty]]. This privilege was purchased by Rabbi [[Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (first Sadigura rebbe)|Avrohom Yaakov Friedman]], the first [[Sadigura (Hasidic dynasty)|Sadigura]] Rebbe, from the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] guardians of Meron and [[Safed]]. The Sadigura Rebbe bequeathed this honor to his eldest son, Rabbi [[Yitzchok Friedman]], the first Boyaner Rebbe, and his progeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rossoff |first=Dovid |script-title=he:קדושים אשר בארץ: קברי צדיקים בירושלים ובני ברק |trans-title=The Holy Ones in the Earth: Graves of Tzaddikim in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak |language=Hebrew |year=2005 |pages=315–316|publisher=Machon Otzar HaTorah |location=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''{{lang|he-Latn|hadlakah}}'' (lighting) is attended by hundreds of thousands of people annually; in 2001, the crowd was estimated at 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The House of Rizhin: Chassidus and the Rizhiner Dynasty |last=Brayer |first=Rabbi Menachem |year=2003 |publisher=[[ArtScroll|Mesorah Publications]] |isbn=1-57819-794-5|page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Rabbi [[Levi Yitzchak Horowitz]], the second [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)|Bostoner]] Rebbe, reinstated a century-old tradition among Bostoner [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] to light a bonfire near the grave of [[Rabbi Akiva]] in [[Tiberias]] on {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} night. The tradition had been abandoned due to murderous attacks on participants in the isolated location. After the bonfire, the Rebbe delivered a {{lang|he-Latn|[[dvar Torah]]}}, gave blessings, and distributed {{lang|he-Latn|[[tish (Hasidic celebration)|shirayim]]}}. Later that same night, the Rebbe cut the hair of three-year-old boys for their [[Upsherin]].&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Y. F. and Morgenstern, Ashira (November 24, 2010).

In Britain bonfires are lit; the London Fire Brigade reported in 2018 that it had responded to several bonfires throughout the night, one of which caused an explosion that injured several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-43985271 |title=Ten hurt in Stamford Hill Jewish festival explosion|website=BBC News|date=3 May 2018  |author= |accessdate= 3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, Rabbi [[Aaron Teitelbaum]] of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] group, who was based in the US, said to his students that it was not customary outside of Israel to make bonfires, and he discouraged the students in his yeshiva from lighting bonfires on {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htlLLDSxV0A|title=Satmar Kiryas Joel Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum Speech Against Lag BaOmer|year=1995|accessdate=May 15, 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000 his father, Rabbi [[Moses Teitelbaum]], the then-Grand Rabbi of Satmar, instructed his son to make a large bonfire in the Satmar enclave of [[Kiryas Joel, New York]], US on the night of {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}.&lt;ref name=matzav&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/50000-expected-at-lag-baomer-celebration-tonight-in-kiryas-yoel|title=50,000 Expected at Lag Ba'omer Celebration Tonight in Kiryas Yoel|first=Noam|last=Amdurski|publisher=matzav.com|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Lag BaOmer bonfire in Kiryas Joel drew an estimated 50,000 participants.&lt;ref name=matzav/&gt;

For [[Zionism|Zionists]] (see section below), the bonfires are said to represent the signal fires that the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba rebels]] lit on the mountaintops to relay messages,&lt;ref name="Knesset Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lag BaOmer|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/lag_baomer_eng.htm|publisher=[[Knesset|The Knesset]]|year=2010|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or are in remembrance of the Bar Kochba revolt against the Romans, who had forbidden the kindling of fires that signalled the start of Jewish holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/english/lior/omer/omer.htm |title=Lag Ba'Omer |date=May 27, 2005 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |publisher=Jerusalem Municipality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601095514/http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/english/lior/omer/omer.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chai rotel====
Another custom at the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is the giving of ''{{lang|he-Latn|chai rotel}}'' ({{lang-he|ח״י רוטל}}). The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''chai'' has the {{lang|he-Latn|[[gematria]]}} (numerical equivalent) of 18. ''{{lang|he-Latn|Rotel}}'' is a liquid measure of about 3 liters. Thus, 18 rotels equals 54 liters or about 13 gallons. It is popularly believed that if one donates or offers 18 rotels of liquid refreshment (grape juice, wine, soda or even water) to those attending the celebrations at bar Yochai's tomb on {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}, then the giver will be granted miraculous salvation.&lt;ref name="speaking"/&gt;

According to ''{{lang|he-Latn|Taamei HaMinhagim}}'', many childless couples found success with this ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[segula (Kabbalah)|segula]]}}'' (propitious practice). This practice was also endorsed by Rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham|Ovadia miBartenura]]&lt;ref name=expected&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/over-500000-expected-in-meron-for-lag-baomer-5769 |title=Over 500,000 Expected in Meron for Lag Ba'omer, 5769 |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=matzav.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Shelah HaKadosh.&lt;ref name=rotel&gt;{{cite web|title=Chai Rotel Segulah|url=http://yeshuosrashbi.com/chai-rotel/|work=YeshuosRashbi.com|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobover]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Ben Zion Halberstam]], sent a letter from Poland to his Hasidim in Israel asking them to donate ''{{lang|he-Latn|chai rotel}}'' in Meron on this holy day on behalf of a couple that did not have children.&lt;ref name=rotel/&gt; Several local organizations solicit donations of ''{{lang|he-Latn|chai rotel}}'' and hand out the drinks on the donor's behalf in Meron on {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}. Nine months after {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}, the Ohel Rashbi organization even invites couples who prayed at the tomb and had a child to come back to Meron to celebrate the births.&lt;ref name=expected/&gt;

===First haircut for children===
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - First Haircut.jpg|175px|right|thumb|A rabbi performs the traditional first haircut on a 3-year-old boy in Meron on Lag Baomer 1970.]]
It is customary at the Meron celebrations, dating from the time of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], that three-year-old boys be given their first haircuts (''{{lang|yi-Latn|[[upsherin]]}}''), while their parents distribute wine and sweets. Similar ''{{lang|yi-Latn|upsherin}}'' celebrations are simultaneously held in Jerusalem at the grave of [[Simeon the Just|Shimon Hatzaddik]] for Jerusalemites who cannot travel to Meron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishmag.com/10mag/israel/israel.htm |title=Meron on Lag B'Omer |last=Rossoff |first=Dovid |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=The Jewish Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bows and arrows===
Historically, children across Israel used to go out and play with bows and arrows, reflecting the [[Midrash]]ic statement that the rainbow (the sign of God's promise to never again destroy the earth with a flood; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:11–13) was not seen during Bar Yochai's lifetime, as his merit protected the world.&lt;ref name="silber"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/679431/jewish/Traditions-and-Customs.htm|title=Lag BaOmer Traditions and Customs|last=Silberberg |first=Naftali |publisher=chabad.org|year=2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/omer/5755/vol1no22.html|title=Lag B'Omer|first=Rabbi Yehudah |last=Prero|year=2007|accessdate=April 28, 2013|publisher=torah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} is a holiday for children and the various youth movements. It is also marked in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as a week of the {{lang|he-Latn|Gadna}} program (youth brigades) which were established on {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} in 1941 and which bear the emblem of a bow and arrow.&lt;ref name="Knesset Website"/&gt;

===Weddings===
{{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} is a popular day for weddings among Ashkenazi Jews (Sephardi Jews hold weddings on {{lang|he-Latn|Lad BaOmer}}, the 34th day of the Omer). For those who do not conduct celebrations between {{lang|he-Latn|Pesach}} and {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}, the date often marks the first opportunity for a wedding in the spring or early summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishweddingnetwork.com/lag-bomer-a-day-for-weddings |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126213439/http://www.jewishweddingnetwork.com/lag-bomer-a-day-for-weddings |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |title=Lag B'Omer: A day for weddings |year=2009 |publisher=Jewish Wedding Network |accessdate=December 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parades===
[[File:Rabbi Schneerson - Lag BaOmer parade.jpg|right|thumb|175px|A {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} parade in front of {{lang|he-Latn|[[Chabad]]}} headquarters at [[770 Eastern Parkway]], [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1987.]]
The [[Chabad|Lubavitcher]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], encouraged {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}} [[parade]]s to be held in Jewish communities around the world as a demonstration of Jewish unity and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/892761/jewish/Parades-in-Central-Israel-Draw-1000-Children.htm |title=Parades in Central Israel Draw 1,000 Children |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chabad sponsors parades as well as rallies, bonfires and barbecues for thousands of participants around the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/1195696/jewish/Excitement-Builds-for-Lag-BOmer.htm |title=From South Africa to Finland, Excitement Builds for Unity Parades |last=Grodnitzky |first=Reuvena Leah |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songs===
Several traditional songs are associated with the holiday; these are sung around bonfires, at weddings, and at ''{{lang|yi-Latn|[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tishen]]}}'' held by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s on {{lang|he-Latn|Lag BaOmer}}. The popular song "''{{lang|he-Latn|[[Bar Yochai (song)|Bar Yochai]]}}''" was composed by Rabbi Shimon Labi ({{circa|1490}}–{{ca.|1584}}), a 16th-century kabbalist, in honor of Shimon Bar Yochai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1kRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=bar+yochai+song|title=The early acharonim: biographical sketches of the prominent early rabbinic sages and leaders from the fifteenth-seventeenth centuries|first=Hersh|last=Goldwurm|publisher=[[ArtScroll|Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]]|year=1989|page=93|isbn=0899064884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1SUPBHhN58C&amp;pg=PA137|title=Galatians and First-Century Ethical Theory|first=Peggy A. |last=Vining|publisher=ProQuest |year=2008|isbn=0549956115|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs include "''{{lang|he-Latn|Ve'Amartem Koh LeChai}}''", a poem arranged as an alphabetical [[acrostic]], and "''{{lang|he-Latn|Amar Rabbi Akiva}}''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leh26AnUhcYC&amp;pg=PA104|title=Chassidic ecstasy in music|first=Shmuel|last=Barzilai|authorlink=Shmuel Barzilai|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3631584520|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tish===
Most Hasidic Rebbes conduct a ''{{lang|yi-Latn|[[tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]}}'' on Lag BaOmer, in addition to or instead of a bonfire.  A full meal is usually served, and candles are lit. It is traditional to sing "''{{lang|he-Latn|Bar Yochai}}''", "''{{lang|he-Latn|Ve'Amartem Koh Lechai}}''", and "''{{lang|he-Latn|Amar Rabbi Akiva}}''".  In [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], "''{{lang|he-Latn|Tzama Lecha Nafshi}}''" is sung at the ''{{lang|yi-Latn|tish}}'' in addition to the other songs.  Teachings of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, both from the Talmud and the Zohar, are generally expounded upon by Rebbes at their ''{{lang|yi-Latn|tishen}}''.  In some Hasidic courts, the Rebbe may shoot a toy bow and arrow during the ''{{lang|yi-Latn|tish}}'', and three-year-old boys may be brought to have a lock of hair cut by the Rebbe as part of their [[upsherin|first haircut]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Zionism==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5719 First grade classroom.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A first-grade classroom in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1973 with holiday displays; the Lag BaOmer display showing Bar Kokhba is on the left.]]
In modern Israel, early Zionists redefined Lag BaOmer from a rabbinic-oriented celebration to a commemoration of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the [[Roman Empire]] (132–136 CE). According to work published by Yael Zerubavel of [[Rutgers University]], a number of Lag BaOmer traditions were reinterpreted by Zionist ideologues to focus on the victory of the Bar Kokhba rebels rather than their ultimate defeat at [[Betar (ancient)|Betar]] three years later. The plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 disciples was explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day when the plague ended was explained as the day of [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s victory. By the late 1940s, Israeli textbooks for schoolchildren painted Bar Kokhba as the hero while Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Akiva stood on the sidelines, cheering him on. This interpretation lent itself to singing and dancing around bonfires by night to celebrate Bar Kokhba's victory, and playing with bows and arrows by day to remember the actions of Bar Kokhba's rebel forces.&lt;ref name="peter"&gt;Zerubavel, Yael. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1TA-Fg4wBnUC&amp;pg=PA283 "Bar Kokhba's Image in Modern Israeli Culture"], in ''The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered: New perspectives on the Second Jewish Revolt against Rome'', Peter Schäfer, ed. Mohr Siebeck, 2003, pp. 282–286. {{ISBN|3-16-148076-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation of the holiday reinforced the Zionist reading of Jewish history and underscored their efforts to establish an independent Jewish state. As Benjamin Lau writes in ''[[Haaretz]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is how Lag Ba'omer became a part of the Israeli-Zionist psyche during the first years of Zionism and Israel. A clear distinction became evident between Jews and Israelis ''(sic)'' in the way the day was celebrated: The religious Jews lit torches in Rashbi's [Shimon bar Yochai's] honor and sang songs about him, while young Israelis, sitting around an alternative bonfire, sang about a hero "whom the entire nation loved" and focused on the image of a powerful hero who galloped on a lion in his charges against the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/portion-of-the-week-the-fires-of-lag-ba-omer-1.219662|title=Portion of the Week / The fires of Lag Ba'omer |first=Benjamin |last=Lau|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=16 April 2013|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern Israel, Lag BaOmer is "a symbol for the fighting Jewish spirit". The [[Palmach]] division of the [[Haganah]] was established on Lag BaOmer 1941, and the government order creating the Israel Defense Forces was issued on Lag BaOmer 1948.&lt;ref name="Ynet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3540212,00.html |title=Lag B'Omer |date=May 13, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |work=[[Ynetnews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2004, the Israeli government designated Lag BaOmer as the day for saluting the IDF reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2007/Cabinet+Communique+6-May-2007.htm |title=Cabinet Communique |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language proficiency''' or '''linguistic proficiency''' is the ability of an individual to speak or perform in a [[language]]. As theories among pedagogues as to what constitutes proficiency go,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408094300/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions |date=April 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little consistency as to how different organizations classify it. Additionally, [[fluency]] and [[language]] [[Linguistic competence|competence]] are generally recognized as being related, but separate controversial subjects. In predominant frameworks in the [[United States]], proficient speakers demonstrate both accuracy and fluency, and use a variety of discourse strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429203232/http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf |date=April 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, native speakers of a language can be [[wikt:fluent|fluent]] without being considered proficient. Native-level fluency is estimated to be between 20,000 and 40,000 words, but basic conversational fluency might require only as little as 3,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109160341/http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency |date=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
===ACTFL===
The [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]] (ACTFL) distinguishes between proficiency and performance. In part, ACTFL's definition of proficiency is derived from mandates issued by the U.S. government, declaring that a [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] student is one who comes from a non-English background and "who has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language and whose difficulties may deny such an individual the opportunity to learn successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society".

ACTFL views "performance" as being the combined effect of all three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational.

==Proficiency frameworks==
Note that test scores may not correlate reliably, as different understandings of proficiency lead to different types of assessment:
*FSI Test ([[Foreign Service Institute]]) Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.edu/staff/globeg/ilrhome.shtml |title=ILR Scale |publisher=Utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(deprecated)''
*[[ILR scale|Interagency Language Roundtable]]  Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; ''(evolved from FSI)''
*[[Language Proficiency Index]]
*[[ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines]] ACTFL recognises ten different levels of proficiency: "novice", "intermediate", "advanced", and "superior", of which the first three are each subdivided into "low", "mid", and "high".
*[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] CEFR recognises six levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.

'''''Lethal Enforcers''''' (リーサルエンフォーサーズ ''Rīsaru Enfōsāzu'') is a 1992 [[light gun shooter|shooting game]] released for the [[arcade game|arcades]] by [[Konami]]. The in-game graphics consist entirely of digitized photographs. This caused controversy as it allowed players to shoot photorealistic representations of enemies.

Home versions were released for the [[Super NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] and [[Sega CD]] during the following year and include a [[revolver]]-shaped [[light gun]] known as the [[Konami Justifier]].

''Lethal Enforcers'' was followed by ''[[Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters]]''. Both games would later be released in the two-in-one compilation ''Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II'' (''Lethal Enforcers Deluxe Pack'' in Japan) for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].

Years later, Konami released the ''[[Police 911]]'' series as a Japan-themed sequel to the original plot. This was also followed by the arcade game ''Seigi No Hero'', which was localized and renamed as ''[[Lethal Enforcers 3]]'' for Western audiences.

==Plot==
Set in [[Chicago, Illinois]], United States, the player takes control of a police officer named Don Marshall, who has one day decided to go to the donut shop for a break. While sipping the last drop of coffee, he gets a call from the police department. They said that a major crime organization has invaded town, and they need his help. He is one of the two survivors of the elite group of officers. The rest have ended up in the hospital or killed. Once the call ended, he decided to check out the bank. From that point on, he is going to experience the toughest job that he would have during his years in the police force. He has been assigned and agrees to help stop a growing crime wave that puts the city's security in serious jeopardy, along with a helper (a second player can join in).

==Gameplay==
Initially armed with a standard-issue [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686|service revolver]], the player can acquire upgraded weapons during the course of play: a [[.357 Magnum]], a [[semi-automatic pistol]], a [[combat shotgun]], an [[assault rifle]], a [[submachine gun]], or a [[grenade launcher]]. The submachine gun and grenade launcher can only be used once while other weapons can be reloaded like the basic service revolver. When the player loses a life, his/her weapon reverts to the basic service revolver. When the player loses all lives, the game will be over unless he/she chooses to continue.

''Lethal Enforcers'' has six stages (including the Training Stage): "The Bank Robbery", "Chinatown Assault", "Hijacking", "The Drug Dealers", and "Chemical Plant Sabotage". During each stage, the player must shoot the armed robbers without harming any innocent civilians or fellow policemen. One shot is enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a boss must be killed in order to complete the stage. A dip switch setting in the arcade version allows operators to let players progress through the stages in a linear fashion ("arcade mode") or select individual stages ("street mode").

Enemies always wear sunglasses, ski masks or gas masks, while fellow police officers and innocent bystanders are always barefaced. The boss character, however, sometimes will have his face exposed; however, this battle is fought where there are no innocents present.

There are different ranks that the player can attain based on performance. The ranks are: Patrolman, Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, and Commander. When the game begins, the player's rank is Patrolman, and after each stage the player is promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents.

If any innocents are killed, the player either maintains his or her rank or gets demoted, although the ranks do not go below Patrolman.

==Ports==
Home versions were released for the [[Super NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] and [[Sega CD]]. The home versions make use of a revolver-shaped [[light gun]] known as the [[Konami Justifier]], which came packaged with the game. A standard controller can be also used in lieu of the light gun in these versions. A second-player Justifier light gun, pink in color, was available only by mail order from Konami. The CD version features higher quality [[CD-DA]] music, sampled from the arcade original. The game is also featured alongside ''[[Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters|Lethal Enforcers II]]'' in the two-in-one compilation titled: ''Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II'' (''Lethal Enforcers Deluxe Pack'' in Japan), developed by Konami Chicago and released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in [[1997 in video gaming|1997]]. A [[Sega Saturn]] version of the compilation was also announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Richard|last=Leadbetter|title=1997 Starts with a Bang!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=16 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=February 1997|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Coming Soon|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cancelled.

The Super NES version features traditional [[Nintendo]] [[censorship]]; no blood is shown when a player or criminal dies. Instead, the screen will flash light green or light blue to indicate that a player lost a life. Also, "Chinatown Assault" is renamed "Downtown Assault."

==Regional differences==
The Japanese arcade version of Lethal Enforcers contain several differences from the US and European arcade versions. These differences include the "how to reload" animation (the US and European versions show a woman shooting outside of the cabinet's screen to reload in-game, while the Japanese version shows the default revolver and how to reload it), and an additional enemy taunt, "Die, pigs!", which was removed from the US and European versions.

''[[GamePro]]'' gave rave reviews for the Sega CD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Sega CD ProReview: Lethal Enforcers|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=62|publisher=IDG|date=November 1993|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Genesis ProReview: Lethal Enforcers|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=63|publisher=IDG|date=December 1993|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SNES versions; for the SNES version, they cited the accuracy of the Konami Justifier, the realistic graphics, and the "appropriately hyper music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Lethal Enforcers|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=68|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1994|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' scored the SNES version 24 out of 40 (6 out of 10 average). Though they noted that the port was technically impressive, they felt the brutal violence was toned down to the point where the spirit of the game was lost.&lt;ref name=egm&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Lethal Enforcers|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=57|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=April 1994|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II'' compilation received mediocre reviews, with critics saying that while the conversion is arcade perfect, the gameplay is simplistic and the graphics are highly static compared to contemporaries like ''[[Time Crisis (video game)|Time Crisis]]''.&lt;ref name=EGM97&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Review Crew: Lethal Enforcers 1 &amp; 2 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=97 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1997|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=PlayStation ProReview: Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=107|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1997|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Hsu of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', which gave the compilation a 4.875 out of 10, commented that while the ''Lethal Enforcers'' games were very good, they were both too aged to stand up against other 1997 releases and not classic enough to make a credible retro compilation.&lt;ref name=EGM97/&gt;

''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the game at number 35 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time and number 6 in their Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, [[Maverick Magazines]], November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
''Lethal Enforcers'' was one of the video games involved in the [[1993 Congressional hearings on video games|video game violence controversy of the early 1990s]] and at the time it was not sold in toy stores. Along with ''[[Night Trap]]'', the Genesis version was one of the first video games to be rated MA-17 by Sega's [[Videogame Rating Council]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Toys 'R' Us Stops Selling a Violent Video Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/nyregion/toys-r-us-stops-selling-a-violent-video-game.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|last=Redburn|first=Tom |date=December 17, 1993|accessdate=June 18, 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A level in Konami's shooter ''[[Jikkyō Oshaberi Parodius]]'' is modeled after ''Lethal Enforcers'' and has the player character avoiding moving crosshairs. Both the blue and pink Konami Justifiers appear at the bottom of the screen during the stage.

The [[We Are Scientists]] album ''[[Brain Thrust Mastery]]'' contains a song entitled "Lethal Enforcer" in reference to the game. The album contains many video game related titles such as "Altered Beast," "Ghouls" (from "Ghouls 'n Ghosts") and "Gauntlet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2008/05/08/laist_interview_143.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515020254/http://laist.com/2008/05/08/laist_interview_143.php|archivedate=2008-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Legendary Entertainment]] confirmed at the July 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]] that it had acquired the rights to [[Mothra]], [[Rodan]], and [[King Ghidorah]] from Toho and revealed concept footage with the closing title cards reading "Conflict: inevitable. Let them fight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1880162/godzilla-2-confirmed-mothra-rodan-ghidorah/ |title=Holy Mothra: Gareth Edwards Reveals 'Godzilla 2' Monsters At Comic-Con |last=Wickman|first=Kase|publisher=MTV |date=July 26, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Legendary announced that the film ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' would not be developed with [[Universal Studios]]. Instead, it would be developed with [[Warner Bros.]], which sparked media speculation that Godzilla and [[King Kong]] would appear in a film together.&lt;ref name="KingKongOnMove"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/king-kong-godzilla-legendary-monster-movie-warner-bros-1201521004/ |title=King Kong On Move To Warner Bros, Presaging Godzilla Monster Matchup|last=Fleming Jr. |first=Mike|work=Deadline|date=September 10, 2015|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-gorilla-warfare-s-universal-823715 |title=Hollywood Gorilla Warfare: It’s Universal vs. Legendary Over ‘Kong: Skull Island’ (and Who Says "Thank You") |first=Kim |last=Masters |date=September 16, 2015 |accessdate=September 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Legendary announced plans to unite Godzilla and King Kong in a film titled ''[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]'', set for a 2020 release date. Legendary plans to create a shared cinematic franchise "centered around Monarch" (the secret government agency which debuted in 2014's ''Godzilla'') and that "brings together Godzilla and Legendary’s King Kong in an ecosystem of other [[Kaiju|giant super-species]], both classic and new".&lt;ref name="ann"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.legendary.com/legendary-and-warner-bros-pictures-announce-cinematic-franchise-uniting-godzilla-king-kong-and-other-iconic-giant-monsters/|title= Legendary and Warner Bros.

{{main|Godzilla (2014 film)}}
The film reimagines Godzilla's origins in contemporary times and is set 15 years after a nuclear meltdown in Japan which subsequently awakens two giant parasitic creatures, known as "[[MUTO]]s". As the MUTOs ravage the countryside in order to reproduce, they awaken a larger ancient alpha predator, known as "[[Godzilla]]", whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. The film introduces Godzilla, the MUTOs, and the Monarch organization to the MonsterVerse.

In 2004, director Yoshimitsu Banno acquired permission from [[Toho]] to produce a short IMAX ''Godzilla'' film which was in development for several years until the project was eventually turned over to Legendary Pictures.&lt;ref name="rogers reboot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/godzilla-reboot-legendary-pictures-rothc-79514/|title= 'Godzilla' Will Return To His Roots In Legendary Pictures Reboot|last=Corneth|first=Roth|work=Screen Rant|date=September 22, 2010|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Legendary announced to have acquired the rights to Godzilla for a feature film reboot.&lt;ref name="variety-report"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=https://variety.com/2010/film/markets-festivals/godzilla-stomps-back-to-screen-1118017027/|title='Godzilla' stomps back to screen |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]] was announced as the director for the film.&lt;ref name="stomps"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kit |first=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/monsters-director-stomps-godzilla-68246|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Monsters' Director Stomps to 'Godzilla' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was co-produced with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

'''Niente''' ({{IPA-it|ˈnjɛnte}}), also called '''quasi niente''' {{IPA-it|ˈkwaːzi ˈnjɛnte|}}, is a [[dynamics (music)|musical dynamic]] often used at the end of a piece to direct the performer to fade the music away to little more than a bare whisper, normally gradually with a [[Dynamics (music)#Gradual changes|diminuendo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Encyclopedia of Music'', p. 379. {{ISBN|0-907486-50-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''al niente'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Helen (2009). ''Young People's Guide to Classical Music'', p.32. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781574671810}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often written as "[[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|25px]]{{serif|'''''n'''''}}" or "[[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|25px]]{{serif|'''''ø'''''}}".
It is also used to direct the performer to fade into a note without any articulation at the beginning of the note, known as '''dal niente''' (from nothing): "{{serif|'''''n'''''}}[[File:Music-crescendo.svg|25px]]".

Niente is distinct from a [[musical rest|rest]] "in that [during niente] the musician is engaged in making sound but so softly that the sound can not be heard."&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Joyce Ann (2010). ''Silence: Everyday Living and Praying'', p.63n8. Liturgy Training Publications. {{ISBN|9781568549026}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer Polity Interaction''' is a concept in [[archaeological theory]] developed by [[Colin Renfrew]] and [[John F. Cherry|John Cherry]], to explain change in society and [[material culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew: ''Introduction: Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change.'' In: Colin Renfrew, John F. Cherry (Hrsg.) ''Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-11222-2}}, S. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-Polity Interaction models see the primary driver of change as the relationships and contacts between societies of relatively equal standing. According to the model set out by Renfrew,&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew: ''Introduction: Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change.'' In: Colin Renfrew, John F. Cherry (Hrsg.) ''Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-11222-2}}, S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; it encompasses three main sorts of interaction:

# Competition, including [[warfare]] and [[competitive consumption|competitive emulation]]
# 'Symbolic entrainment', where societies borrow symbolic systems wholesale from their neighbours, such as numerical systems, social structures and religious beliefs, because these fill a currently empty niche in their society.
# 'Transmission of innovation', where technology spreads by trade, gift-giving, and other forms of exchange.

'''Post-socialist art''' (or post-communist art) is a term used in analysis of art arriving from post-socialist (post-communist) countries taken as different in their nature from Western, [[Postmodern art]].

Crucial for such art is that:
# Because of having no market of art such art was Modernist in a sense of being non-commercial (Groys, 2004), but also;
# Having no market of art authorship was weakened authorship allowed working under pseudonyms, anonymously or even collectively (Peraica, 2006); and finally;
# Such art was necessary referring to the inner history of art, as commonly to Russian Avantgard [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[El Lissitzky]]

Socialist art started opening to Western markets already in the eighties, introducing Slovenian collective [[IRWIN]], Belgrade Malevich (aka Goran Djordjevic) and other artists [[Peter Weibel]] named Retro-avantgard. In the second wave of nineties it was followed by a weakened political versions which were massively funded (Most of such art was financed by [[George Soros]], similarly to [[Socialist realism]] which Lead thinkers as Miško Šuvaković to name such art [[Soros Realism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9644">'''Rescue archaeology''', sometimes called '''preventive archaeology''', '''salvage archaeology''', '''commercial archaeology''', '''contract archaeology''', or '''compliance archaeology''', is state-sanctioned, for-profit [[archaeology|archaeological]] survey and excavation carried out in advance of [[construction]] or other [[land development]]. These conditions could include, but are not limited to, [[highway]] projects, major construction, the flood plain of a proposed [[dam]], or even before the onset of [[war]]. Unlike traditional survey and excavation, rescue archaeology must be undertaken at speed.  Rescue archaeology is included in the broader categories that are [[cultural resource management]] (CRM) and [[cultural heritage management]] (CHM).

==Background==
Rescue archaeology occurs on sites about to be destroyed but, on occasion, may include [[in situ]] preservation of any finds or protective measures taken to preserve an unexcavated site beneath a building. Urban areas with many overlaid years of habitation are often candidates for rescue archaeology.
 
The focus of early work was to set up organisations to undertake rescue excavations shortly before an area was disturbed by [[construction equipment]].  Archaeologists relied on the goodwill of the developer to provide the opportunity to record remains.  In more recent use, an archaeological survey may be required by planning process or building law, as with [[PPG 16]] or PPS5 in the [[United Kingdom]] and NPPG5 in [[Scotland]].  Common conditions required by planning authorities are [[archaeological field survey]], [[watching brief]]s, [[shovel test pit]]s, [[trial trenching]], and [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].  Guidance and standards of practice in the [[UK]] are largely monitored through the [[Institute for Archaeologists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeologists.net/ Institute for Archaeologists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contract or commercial archaeology services have sprung up to meet the needs of developers and to comply with local laws and planning regulations.  In the United Kingdom, over 3000 archaeologists are employed in commercial archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landward.eu/2011/02/job-losses-in-archaeology-october-2010-and-january-2011.html Job Losses in UK archaeology&lt;/ref&gt;  

For many years, the emphasis was on archaeological evidence in the ground. However, with increased interest in [[industrial archaeology]], rescue archaeology needs to commence by recording extant remains of buildings i.e. prior to demolition.

==Terminology==
The term, and indeed the practice of, rescue archaeology is largely restricted to [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[East Asia]], especially the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Korea|Korea]], and [[Japan]]. Many European countries, such as, e.g., [[Germany]], practice virtually no rescue excavation (though there is extensive [[research archaeology]]). The many rescue archaeology projects in the [[Middle East]] are generally termed salvage archaeology.

In North America, commercial archeology sometimes refers to the study of structures and [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] created in connection with popular commercial activity, such as [[diner]]s, [[motel]]s, [[gasoline station]]s, and signs.  Special focus is given to commerce and transportation, the effects of market economy and the use of space, and the development of roadside businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sca-roadside.org Society for Commercial Archeology&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a profession==
Whereas the organizations that take on rescue archaeology contracts are stable entities, the archaeologists who perform the actual field work are, in the main, an army of mobile workers. They work in all types of weather and terrain covering tasks such as [[Archaeological site|conservation]], [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], artifact curation, [[field survey]] often in difficult conditions (such as dense woodland), and typically working to tight deadlines. Given that the outputs of much of the work that is undertaken in advance of development work is not published in peer reviewed journals, the people that perform the actual research are often anonymous and unrecognized.

"[[Shovelbum]]" is a play on one of the more polite names which professional archaeologists call each other when they enter the field of rescue archaeology and move from excavation to excavation. As much archaeology is now developer-led, the fieldworkers must move to where the work is when one contract is complete, much like ski-bums following the good snow fall. For professional field archaeologists the Shovelbum phase of a career is now considered a rite of passage. It is during this time that any field archaeologist worth their salt learns the ropes.

[[File:RidersOfJudgment.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])]]
'''''Riders of Judgment''''' is the fifth book chronologically in [[Frederick Manfred]]'s ''[[The Buckskin Man Tales]]'', which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes [[Wyoming]]'s [[Johnson County War]], based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's ''The War on Powder River'',&lt;ref name="HHS01" /&gt; which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel.

The novel was the source for the made-for-television film ''The Johnson County War,'' starring Tom Berenger. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler. Manfred changes the names of the county and the nearby towns.

'''Screeno''' (a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of "screen bingo") was a form of [[bingo (US)|bingo]] played in [[United States|American]] [[movie theater]]s during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.  To bolster attendance on slow weeknights, the neighborhood movie houses would feature the game in which [[audience]] members would have a chance to win cash prizes.  The story is that many a theater was saved from [[bankruptcy]] by the advent of Screeno (sometimes spelled in capitals: SCREENO). The game was played between the two main movie features.  

A number dial and a giant spinning needle were projected onto the movie screen. Patrons were provided with toothpicks to punch out the winning numbers on their cards.  Apparently, on most nights patrons paid a modest fee for their cards, but one night a week was designated as “Bank Night” in which the audience would get free Screeno cards with their [[Ticket (admission)|movie tickets]].  A 1937 [[Romantic comedy|romantic-comedic]]-[[Musical film|musical]] movie entitled “Thrill of a Lifetime” featured a song called “Keno, Screeno and You.”

{{Network Science}}
A '''social network ''' is a [[social structure]] made up of a set of [[social]] actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] ties, and other [[Social relation|social interaction]]s between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley | author-link1= Stanley Wasserman|last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |year=1994 |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |isbn=9780521387071 |chapter=Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages=1–27 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of these structures uses [[social network analysis]] to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field which emerged from [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and [[graph theory]]. [[Georg Simmel]] authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=W.

Together with other [[complex network]]s, it forms part of the nascent field of [[network science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=323 |number=5916 |pages=892–895 |doi=10.1126/science.1165821 |pmid=19213908 |title=Network Analysis in the Social Sciences |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Borgatti |first2=Ajay |last2=Mehra |first3=Daniel J. |last3=Brass |first4=Giuseppe |last4=Labianca|bibcode=2009Sci...323..892B |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World |first1=David |last1=Easley |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |chapter=Overview |pages=1–20 |isbn=978-0-521-19533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|left|Evolution graph of a social network: [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási model]].]]

The social network is a [[Scientific theory|theoretical]] [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] useful in the [[social sciences]] to study relationships between individuals, [[social groups|groups]], [[formal organizations|organizations]], or even entire [[society|societies]] ([[social unit]]s, see [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]]). The term is used to describe a [[social structure]] determined by such [[social interactions|interactions]]. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.  An [[axiom]] of the social network approach to understanding [[social interaction]] is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that [[Agency (sociology)|individual agency]] is often ignored&lt;ref name="jscott"&gt;Scott, John P. (2000). ''Social Network Analysis: A Handbook'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not be the case in practice (see [[agent-based model]]ing). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, [[Network science|network analytics]] are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

==History==
In the late 1890s, both [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of [[social group]]s. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag. (Translated, 1957 by Charles Price Loomis as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile (1893). ''De la division du travail social: étude sur l'organisation des sociétés supérieures'', Paris: F. Alcan. (Translated, 1964, by Lewis A. Coser as ''The Division of Labor in Society'', New York: Free Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]], writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg (1908). ''Soziologie'', Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moreno Sociogram 2nd Grade.png|thumb|Moreno's sociogram of a 2nd grade class]]
Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently.&lt;ref name=jscott /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical overview of the development of social network analysis, see: {{cite book|authors=Carrington, Peter J. &amp; Scott, John|chapter=Introduction|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis| publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the diagram in {{cite book|author=Scott, John|title=Social Network Analysis: A Handbook|publisher=Sage|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7619-6339-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww3_bKcz6kgC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], in the 1930s, [[Jacob L. Moreno]] began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see [[sociometry]]). In [[anthropology]], the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] work of [[Bronislaw Malinowski]],&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw (1913). ''The Family Among the Australian Aborigines: A Sociological Study''.

F. Nadel]] codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, S. F. 1957. ''The Theory of Social Structure''. London: Cohen and West.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], the early (1930s) work of [[Talcott Parsons]] set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). ''The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott (1951). ''The Social System''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist [[Peter Blau]] provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on [[social exchange theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1956). ''Bureaucracy in Modern Society''. New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1960). "A Theory of Social Integration". ''The American Journal of Sociology'', (65)6: 545–556, (May).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1964). ''Exchange and Power in Social Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were [[Charles Tilly]], who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and [[Stanley Milgram]], who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html |title=The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman |author=Bernie Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Granovetter]]&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Introduction for the French Reader | url = | journal = Sociologica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Wellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (1988). "Structural analysis: From method and metaphor to theory and substance". Pp. 19-61 in B. Wellman and S. D. Berkowitz (eds.) ''Social Structures: A Network Approach'', Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the former students of White who elaborated and championed the analysis of social networks.&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Nicholas.

"Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance". pp. 19–61 in ''Social Structures: A Network Approach'', edited by Barry Wellman and S. D. Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as [[Duncan J. Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Peter Bearman]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[James H. Fowler]], and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as "digital traces" regarding face-to-face networks.

==Levels of analysis==
[[File:Network self-organization stages.png|thumb|right|Self-organization of a network, based on Nagler, Levina, &amp; Timme, (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagler, Jan, Anna Levina and Marc Timme|year=2011|title=Impact of single links in competitive percolation|journal=Nature Physics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=265–270|doi=10.1038/nphys1860|arxiv=1103.0922|bibcode=2011NatPh...7..265N}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Social Network Diagram (large).svg|right|thumb|Centrality]]
In general, social networks are [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[emergence|emergent]], and [[social complexity|complex]], such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási and Duncan J. Watts (2006). ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks'' (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry | year = 2008 | title = Review: The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 221–222 | doi=10.1177/009430610803700308}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Stanley Wasserman; Katherine|title=Social network analysis : methods and applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521382694|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of, for example, all [[interpersonal relationships]] in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much [[Information theory|information]] as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"&gt;Kadushin, C. (2012). ''Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Granovetter, M.|title= Network sampling: Some first steps| year=1976 |pages=1287–1303 |volume=81| issue=6 |journal= American Journal of Sociology | doi=10.1086/226224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]] are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which networks may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-level]], and [[Macrosociology|macro-level]].

===Micro level===
At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, [[Snowball sampling|snowballing]] as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.

'''Dyadic level''': A [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on [[Structural functionalism|structure]] of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), [[social equality]], and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].

'''Triadic level''': Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a [[Triadic relation|triad]]. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as [[Independence number|balance]] and [[Vertex-transitive graph|transitivity]], as well as [[social equality]] and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt; In the [[balance theory]] of [[Fritz Heider]] the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous [[love triangle]] is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of [[signed graph]]s.

'''Actor level''': The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an "actor" or "ego". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, [[centrality]], [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] and roles such as [[isolates|isolates, liaisons]], and [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]].&lt;ref name="Jone11"/&gt; Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of [[psychology]] or [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[ethnographic]] [[kinship]] analysis or other [[genealogy|genealogical]] studies of relationships between individuals.

'''Subset level''': [[Subset]] levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] and reachability, [[cliques]], [[Cohesion (social policy)|cohesive]] subgroups, or other [[Group action (sociology)|group actions]] or [[Group behaviour|behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title="Graph Theoretical Approaches to Social Network Analysis". in Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications (Robert A. Meyers, ed.) | publisher=Springer | author=de Nooy, Wouter |year=2012 | pages=2864–2877 | isbn=978-1-4614-1800-9|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1800-9_176| chapter=Social Network Analysis, Graph Theoretical Approaches to }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meso level===
In general, meso-level theories begin with a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedström | first1 = Peter | last2 = Sandell | first2 = Rickard | last3 = Stern | first3 = Charlotta | year = 2000 | title = Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements: The Case of the Swedish Social Democratic Party | url = http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 145–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social Red.jpg|thumb|right|Social network diagram, meso-level]]

'''Organizations''': Formal [[organizations]] are [[social group]]s that distribute tasks for a collective [[goal]].&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riketta | first1 = M. | last2 = Nienber | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Multiple identities and work motivation: The role of perceived compatibility between nested organizational units | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = S61–77 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[Informal organization|informal]] relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures.&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"/&gt;  Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirado|first=Hirokazu|last2=Christakis|first2=Nicholas A|title=Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments|journal=Nature|volume=545|issue=7654|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature22332|pmid=28516927|pmc=5912653|bibcode=2017Natur.545..370S|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomly distributed networks''': [[Exponential random graph models]] of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and [[Transitive set|transitivity]], and at the node-level, [[homophily]] and [[Attribute-value system|attribute]]-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about [[Dependency graph|dependencies]] among network ties. [[Parameter]]s are given in terms of the prevalence of small [[Induced subgraph|subgraph]] configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cranmer | first1 = Skyler J. | last2 = Desmarais | first2 = Bruce A. | year = 2011 | title = Inferential Network Analysis with Exponential Random Graph Models | url = | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi=10.1093/pan/mpq037| citeseerx = 10.1.1.623.751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|right|Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the "hubs" (shaded) in the scale-free diagram (on the right).]]

'''Scale-free networks''': A [[scale-free network]] is a [[complex network|network]] whose [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]], at least [[asymptotic]]ally. In [[network theory]] a scale-free ideal network is a [[random network]] with a [[degree distribution]] that unravels the size distribution of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreira, André A., Demétrius R. Paula, Raimundo N. Costa Filho, José S. Andrade, Jr. |title=Competitive cluster growth in complex networks |year=2006 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065101 |pmid=16906890 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=065101 |arxiv=cond-mat/0603272 |bibcode=2006PhRvE..73f5101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] with a [[Maximum degree|degree]] that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called "hubs", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the [[clustering coefficient]] distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life''. New York: Plum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási]] model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.

===Macro level===
Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]].

[[File:Diagram of a social network.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram: section of a large-scale social network]]

'''Large-scale networks''': [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|Large-scale network]] is a term somewhat synonymous with "macro-level" as used, primarily, in [[social science|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] sciences, in [[economics]]. Originally, the term was used extensively in the [[computer sciences]] (see [[Network mapping#Large-scale mapping project|large-scale network mapping]]).

'''Complex networks''': Most larger social networks display features of [[social complexity]], which involves substantial non-trivial features of [[network topology]], with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, [[complexity science]], [[dynamical system]] and [[chaos theory]]), as do [[biological]], and [[Computer network|technological networks]]. Such [[complex network]] features include a heavy tail in the [[degree distribution]], a high [[clustering coefficient]], [[assortativity]] or disassortativity among vertices, [[community structure]] (see [[stochastic block model]]), and [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]]. In the case of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency-directed]] networks these features also include [[Reciprocity in network|reciprocity]], triad significance profile (TSP, see [[network motif]]), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as [[lattice graph|lattices]] and [[random graph]]s, do not show these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strogatz, Steven H.|year=2001|title=Exploring complex networks|journal=Nature|volume=410|pages=268–276|doi=10.1038/35065725|pmid=11258382|issue=6825|bibcode=2001Natur.410..268S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical links==

===Imported theories===
Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are [[Graph theory]], [[Balance theory]], [[Social comparison theory]], and more recently, the [[Social identity approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kilduff, M., Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous theories===
Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are [[role theory|Structural Role Theory]] and Heterophily Theory.

The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural holes==
In the context of networks, [[social capital]] exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes and Good Ideas|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2004|doi=10.1086/421787|volume=110|issue=2|pages=349–399|citeseerx=10.1.1.388.2251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; Thus, a network that bridges [[structural holes]] will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt;

Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer [[Information theory|information]] benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; For example, in [[Business networking|business network]]s, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of [[Interpersonal ties|weak ties]], which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.

==Research clusters==

===Communication===
[[Communication Studies]] are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[information science]], [[biology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] as well as [[rhetoric]], [[literary studies]], and [[semiotics]]. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.

===Community===
In J.A. Barnes' day, a "[[community]]" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended "online" communities developed through [[telecommunications]] devices and [[social network services]]. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using [[network science]] methods. [[Community development]] studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.

===Complex networks===
[[Complex networks]] require methods specific to modelling and interpreting [[social complexity]] and [[complex adaptive system]]s, including techniques of [[dynamic network analysis]].
Mechanisms such as [[Dual-phase evolution#social networks|Dual-phase evolution]] explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.

===Criminal networks===
In [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]], much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papachristos |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=74–128 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.855304 |url=http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094725/http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.

===Diffusion of innovations===
[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of ideas and innovations]] studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one [[culture]] and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become "early adopters" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.

===Demography===
In [[demography]], the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.

===Economic sociology===
The field of [[sociology]] focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, [[economic sociology]] considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social "markets". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005). "The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134991 19(1): 33–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into [[health care analytics]], not only in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies but also in models of [[Health Communication|patient communication]] and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and [[health care systems|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). ''Social Networks and Health''. Boston, MA: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ecology===
[[Human ecology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], and natural [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.) (2010). [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/view.php?sf=48 "Special Issue: Social network analysis in natural resource governance"]. ''Ecology and Society'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernstson, Henrich (2010). "Reading list: Using social network analysis (SNA) in social-ecological studies". [http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/11/03/reading-list-using-social-network-analysis-sna-in-social-ecological-studies/ ''Resilience Science'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and linguistics===
Studies of [[language]] and [[linguistics]], particularly [[evolutionary linguistics]], focus on the development of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic forms]] and transfer of changes, [[Phonology|sounds]] or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in [[language shift]], as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.

===Literary networks===
In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Romo | first2 = F. P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 305–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senekal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senekal | first1 = B. A. | year = 2012 | title = Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA) | url = | journal = LitNet Akademies | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of [[Even-Zohar]], can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using [[Computer graphics (computer science)|visualization]] from SNA.

===Organizational studies===
Research studies of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[informal organization]] [[Social relation|relationships]], [[organizational communication]], [[economics]], [[economic sociology]], and other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfers]]. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many [[Interlocking directorate|informal connections]] that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Podolny | first1 = J.

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is a form of [[Capital (economics)|economic]] and [[cultural capital]] in which social networks are central, [[Stock and flow|transactions]] are marked by [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[cooperation]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Agent (economics)|agents]] produce [[goods and services]] not mainly for themselves, but for a [[common good]].

Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of [[social relation]]s and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastián|first=Valenzuela|author2=Namsu Park |author3=Kerk F. Kee |title=Is There Social Capital in a Social Network Site? Facebook Use and College Students' Life Satisfaction, Trust, and Participation|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2009|volume=14|issue=4|pages=875–901|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Connectivity in America: Changes in Adult Friendship Network Size from 2002 to 2007 |author1=Wang, Hua  |author2=Barry Wellman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=American Behavioral Scientist | year=2010 | volume=53 | issue=8 | pages=1148–1169 | doi=10.1177/0002764209356247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.&lt;ref name="GaudeulGiannetti2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaudeul|first1=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The role of reciprocation in social network formation, with an application to LiveJournal|journal=Social Networks|volume=35|issue=3|year=2013|pages=317–330|issn=03788733|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2013.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network position and benefits===
In many [[Formal organizations|organizations]], members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a "broker" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill]], writes, "it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John|title=Principles of Political Economy|year=1909|publisher=William J Ashley|location=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.

A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Heidi|author2=Eccles, Robert |title=Eden McCallum: A Network Based Consulting Firm|journal=Harvard Business School Review|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.

There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" of such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). "When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of [http://iniciarsesionentrar.com/facebook/ Social] Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms". ''Administrative Science Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.

===Social media===
{{main article|Social media}}
[[Computer network]]s combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Effects|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118783764|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0170}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A relationship over a computerized [[social networking service]] can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a [[computer mediated communication]] context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of [[electronic commerce]], information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the "real" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Studying Online Social Networks | author=Garton, Laura, [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], and [[Barry Wellman]] | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=23 June 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 |pages = 0| doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.

In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of [[social media]] has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Wei | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Liu | first3 = Huan | last4 = Carley | first4 = Kathleen M. | year = 2016 | title = Exploring Characteristics of Suspended Users and Network Stability on Twitter | url = | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4634">In [[structural anthropology]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], a French [[anthropologist]], makes the claim that "myth is language". Through approaching [[mythology]] as language, Lévi-Strauss suggests that it can be approached the same way as language can be approached by the same structuralist methods used to address language. Thus, Lévi-Strauss offers a '''structuralist theory of mythology''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus Gabriel]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], ''Mythology, Madness, and Laughter: Subjectivity in German Idealism'', Continuum, 2009, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; he clarifies, "Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps rolling."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Lévi-Strauss breaks down his argument into three main parts. Meaning is not isolated within the specific fundamental parts of the myth, but rather within the composition of these parts. Although myth and language are of similar categories, language functions differently in myth. Finally, language in myth exhibits more complex functions than in any other linguistic expression. From these suggestions, he draws the conclusion that myth can be broken down into constituent units, and these units are different from the constituents of language. Finally, unlike the constituents of language, the constituents of a myth, which he labels “mythemes,” function as "bundles of relations."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is a break from the “symbolists”, such as [[Carl Jung]], who dedicate themselves to find meaning solely within the constituents rather than their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Hanéff, ''Claude Lévi-Strauss, p. 160''&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Lévi-Strauss uses the example of the Oedipus myth and breaks it down to its component parts:

Reading it in sequence from left to right, top to bottom, the myth is categorized sequentially and by similarities. Through analyzing the commonalities between the “mythemes” of the [[Oedipus]] story, understandings can be wrought from its categories. 

Thus, a structural approach towards myths is to address all of these constituents. Furthermore, a structural approach should account for all versions of a myth, as all versions are relevant to the function of the myth as a whole. This leads to what Lévi-Strauss calls a spiral growth of the myth which is continuous while the structure itself is not. The growth of the myth only ends when the 
“intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted.”&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; 

== From mythology to literary criticism ==

Myths are primarily acknowledged as oral traditions, while literature is in the form of written text. Still, anthropologists and [[literary critics]] would both acknowledge the links between myths and relatively more contemporary literature. Therefore, many literary critics take the same Lévi-Straussian structuralist, as it is coined, approach to literature. This approach is, again, similar to [[Symbolist]] critics’ approach to literature. There is a search for the lowest constituent of the story. But as with the myth, Lévi-Straussian structuralism then analyzes the relations between these constituent parts in order to compare even greater relations between versions of stories as well as among stories themselves.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Boon, ''From Symbolism to Structuralism. p. 6-12.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, Lévi-Strauss suggests that the structural approach and mental processes dedicated towards analyzing the myth are similar in nature to those in science. This connection between myth and science is further elaborated in his books, “Myth and Meaning” and "The Savage Mind". He suggests that the foundation of structuralism is based upon an innate understanding of the scientific process, which seeks to break down complex phenomena into its component parts and then analyze the relations between them. The structuralist approach to myth is precisely the same method, and as a method this can be readily applied to literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Meaning p.5-14''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Texture gradient''' is the [[distortion]] in size which closer objects have compared to objects farther away. It also involves groups of objects appearing denser as they move farther away. Also could be explained by noticing a certain amount of [[Complexity|detail]] depending on how close something is, giving a sense of [[depth perception]].
There are three main forms of texture gradient: [[density]], [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], and [[distortion (optics)|distortion]] of [[wikt:texture|texture]] elements.

Texture gradient is carefully used in the painting ''[[Paris Street, Rainy Day]]'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.hanover.edu/krantz/art/texture.html "Vision and Art: Texture Gradient"], John H. Krantz, Ph.D., [[Hanover College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Texture gradient was used in a study of child psychology in 1976&lt;ref&gt;Degelman, D., &amp; Rosinski, R. R., [http://www.vanguard.edu/Psychology/PsychAbstractInfluenceoffemalebodyimagesin/PsychAbstractTexturegradientregistrationand/tabid/1088/Default.aspx "Texture gradient registration and the development of slant perception"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617195323/http://www.vanguard.edu/Psychology/PsychAbstractInfluenceoffemalebodyimagesin/PsychAbstractTexturegradientregistrationand/tabid/1088/Default.aspx |date=2010-06-17 }}, ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 21, pp339-348. Retrieved 2010-2-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and studied by Sidney Weinstein in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Weinstein, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1419453 ''The Perception of Depth in the Absence of Texture-Gradient''], Vol. 70, No. 4 (Dec., 1957), pp. 611-615, University of Illinois Press. Retrieved 2010-2-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a paper about the texture gradient equation, [[wavelet]]s, and shape from texture was released by [[Maureen Clerc]] and [[Stéphane Mallat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink1 = Maureen Clerc | first1 = Maureen | last1 = Clerc | authorlink2 = Stéphane Mallat | first2 = Stéphane | last2 = Mallat | citeseerx = 10.1.1.7.2677 | title = The Texture Gradient Equation for Recovering Shape from Texture | journal = [[IEEE]] Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BibleandItsInfluence.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''''The Bible and Its Influence''''' is a [[textbook]] first published in 2005 to facilitate teaching about the [[Bible]] in American [[Public school (government funded)|public high schools]]. Its publishers, the Bible Literacy Project, say the textbook allows schools to study the Bible academically while fully respecting the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]. It is designed for teaching either a semester course or a full-year course on the literary and historical influence of the Bible.

The development took over five years, at a cost of $2 million,&lt;ref name="APSept2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/interfaith-coalition-unveils-a-public-school-bible-course-designed-to/article_6f26a4a6-3abf-5773-a0ad-384fc1253edd.html |title=Interfaith coalition unveils a public school Bible course designed to avoid disputes |author=Richard N. Ostling |publisher=Associated Press"}}&lt;/ref&gt; with contributions from 40 [[evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Protestant]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Jewish]] and [[secularism|secular]] experts and scholars. 

==Use in public schools==
As of September 2010, the Bible Literacy Project reports that the textbook has been adopted by 470 schools in 43 states, with more than 100 schools in Texas teaching Bible literacy courses.&lt;ref name="blp-schools"&gt;[http://www.bibleliteracy.org/site/News/PressRelease20100915/index.htm Bible Literacy Project press release announcing 470 schools using the course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920080333/http://www.bibleliteracy.org/Site/News/PressRelease20100915/index.htm |date=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2007, ''The Bible and Its Influence'' was designated by the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as an approved textbook statewide.&lt;ref name="blp-alabama"&gt;[http://bibleliteracy.org/Site/news/bibl_news071016AlabamaApproval.htm Bible Literacy Project press release announcing Alabama's adoption of the text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406034803/http://www.bibleliteracy.org/site/News/bibl_news071016AlabamaApproval.htm |date=2008-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This designation allows schools throughout the state to purchase the curriculum with state funds.

==Media commentary==
''The Bible and Its Influence'' has received extensive press coverage. The cover story of ''[[TIME]]'' on April 2, 2007,  described the rising trend in Bible courses in public schools nationwide. ''TIME'' senior religion editor David Van Biema stated, "Public school Bible electives should have a strong accompanying textbook on the model of ''The Bible and Its Influence'', but one that is willing to deal a bit more bluntly with the historical warts."&lt;ref name="vanbiema"&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1601845-1,00.html |title=The Case for Teaching the Bible |author=David Van Biema |publisher=TIME |date=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, ''The Bible and Its Influence'' was also featured in ''[[Education Week]]'' and on [[NBC]]'s [[Today (NBC program)|''Today'' show]]. The [[New York State School Boards Association]]'s ''On Board'' magazine also had favorable coverage of ''The Bible and Its Influence'', calling it "a remarkable textbook" in a July 31, 2006, review.&lt;ref name="blp-ny"&gt;[http://bibleliteracy.org/Site/news/bibl_newsNYSchoolBoard060731.htm Full text of review as provided by Bible Literacy Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405161015/http://www.bibleliteracy.org/Site/News/bibl_newsNYSchoolBoard060731.htm |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==
Co-author Charles Stetson is a Christian Evangelical educational political activist.  Stetson serves as chairman of the "Bible Literacy Project", an organization which strives to introduce Christian beliefs into the American public school system. Stetson was also one of the founding members of the [[National Organization for Marriage]], a group dedicated to blocking the legalization of same-sex marriage in the US. Stetson was also long affiliated with [[Charles Colson]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L.

'''''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''''' is a 1988 American film adaptation of the [[The Unbearable Lightness of Being|novel of the same name]] by [[Milan Kundera]], published in 1984.&lt;ref name="RTom"&gt;
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 2008, webpage: [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unbearable_lightness_of_being/ RTom-Unbearable].&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Philip Kaufman]] and screenwriter [[Jean-Claude Carrière]] portray the effect on [[Czechoslovak]] artistic and intellectual life during the 1968 [[Prague Spring]] of socialist liberalization preceding the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-led [[Warsaw Pact]] that ushered in a period of communist repression. It portrays the moral, political, and psycho-sexual consequences for three [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] friends: a surgeon, and two female artists with whom he has a sexual relationship.

==Plot==
Tomas, a successful brain surgeon in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Communist Czechoslovakia]], is pursuing an affair with Sabina, an equally care-free artist in [[Prague]]. Dr Tomas takes a trip to a spa town for a specialized surgery. There, he meets dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs.

Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but feels affection for Sabina. Nevertheless, Tomas marries Tereza, in a simple ceremony with both perpetually laughing, followed by her double standard distress about Tomas' promiscuity. Although she considers leaving Tomas, she becomes more attached to Tomas when the [[Soviet Army]] invades Czechoslovakia. Amidst the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West. Facing the stultifying reality that replaced the [[Prague Spring]], Tomas, Sabina and Tereza flee Czechoslovakia for Switzerland: first Sabina, then the hesitant Tomas and Tereza.

In [[Geneva]], Sabina encounters Franz, a married university professor: they begin a love affair. After some time, he decides to abandon his wife and family for her. After hearing the declaration, Sabina abandons Franz, feeling he would emotionally weigh her down. Meanwhile, Tereza and Tomas attempt to adapt to Switzerland, whose people Tereza finds inhospitable. When she discovers that Tomas continues womanizing, she leaves him and returns to Czechoslovakia. Upset by her leaving, Tomas follows Tereza to Czechoslovakia, where his passport is confiscated, trapping him in-country: nevertheless, his return elates Tereza. They are re-united.

In Prague, Tomas has resumed his brain surgeon position, but his having written a scathing article criticizing the Soviet-backed Czech régime before the invasion, in which he berated them for claiming ignorance of Soviet political [[purges]] but seeming unremorseful, and noting that [[Oedipus Rex]] plucked out his eyes upon understanding his crime, but the autocratic figures had not, has rendered him a political dissident and has jeopardized his re-employment. The régime demands his signature to a letter repudiating the article, claiming that Tomas' article fueled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment. Tomas refuses and is presumably [[black list|black-listed]] from practising medicine. Tomas is apparently a window washer, and is recognized by the daughter of a high-ranking official, aware of her family connection, brazenly does his trademark "take off your clothes" line that is successful in examining a "pain in her back".

As a waitress, Tereza meets an engineer who propositions her. Aware of Tomas's infidelity, she encounters a one-time and passionless sexual liaison with the engineer. Remorseful, she fears the engineer might have been a secret agent for the régime, who might denounce her and Tomas. She contemplates suicide at a canal bank; by chance, Tomas passes by Tereza and woos her back.

Stressed by insubstantial city life, Tereza convinces Tomas to leave Prague for the country: they go to a village where an old patient of Tomas's welcomes them. In the village, they live an idyllic life, far from the political intrigues of Prague. In contrast, Sabina has gone to the US, where she continues her detached [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle. Later, Sabina is shocked by the letter telling of the fate of Tereza and Tomas in a fatal traffic accident while returning after drinking in a tavern.

==Production==
The film was an American production with American director, Philip Kaufman, but it features a largely European cast, including [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] (British), [[Juliette Binoche]] (French), [[Lena Olin]], [[Erland Josephson]] and [[Stellan Skarsgård]] (Swedish), [[Pavel Landovský]] (Czech) and [[Derek de Lint]] (Dutch). It was filmed in France as opposed to the plot setting: in the scenes depicting the Soviet invasion, archival footage is combined with new material shot in [[Lyon]]. The scene in which Tomas is seduced by a woman while cleaning windows was shot in the then unrestored [[Hôtel de Beauvais]] in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]] of Paris (now the Administrative Appeal Court).

==Adaptation==
Kundera served as an active consultant during the making of the film. Kundera wrote the poem that Tomas whispers into Tereza's ear as she is falling asleep specifically for the film.&lt;ref name="DStar"&gt;
  "Condemned by fate, persecuted by politics",
  ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'', 2008-08-30, webpage:
  [http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=52391 DStar-52391].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a note to the Czech edition of the book, Kundera remarks that the movie had very little to do with the spirit either of the novel or the characters in it.&lt;ref&gt;"Nesnesitelná lehkost bytí", "Poznámka Autora", p.&amp;nbsp;341, dated 2006 France, published by Atlantis.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same note Kundera goes on to say that after this experience he no longer allows any adaptations of his work. Many critics have focused on how much of the book was successfully captured, or could be captured, on film: however, some commentators, such as Cattrysse Patrick, have argued that the film must be viewed in a different light, with the book as only one source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patrick|first=Cattrysse|title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being: Film Adaptation Seen From a Different Perspective|journal=Literature/Film Quarterly|date=1 January 1997|url=https://www.academia.edu/279971/1997_The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being_Film_Adaptation_Seen_From_a_Different_Perspective|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film garnered high praise from critics.{{fact|date=September 2018}} [[Jean-Claude Carrière]] and [[Philip Kaufman]] were nominated at the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].{{fact|date=September 2018}} The film was listed 87th by the [[American Film Institute]] in its 2002 list [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
A digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD by [[The Criterion Collection]] in November 1999. The release includes audio commentary by director Philip Kaufman, co-writer Jean-Claude Carrière, editor Walter Murch and actress Lena Olin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/600-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being|publisher=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released on DVD by [[Warner Home Video]] as a 2-disc special edition on February 28, 2006.

==Soundtrack==
The film makes use of music by [[Leoš Janáček]] and also [[Marta Kubišová]] singing "[[Hey Jude]]" in [[Czech language|Czech]].

'''''Titanfall 2''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]], developed by [[Respawn Entertainment]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. A sequel to 2014's ''[[Titanfall]]'', the game was released worldwide on October 28, 2016 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. In ''Titanfall 2'', players control Titans, [[mecha]]-style exoskeletons and their pilots, who are agile and equipped with a variety of skills ranging from wall-running to [[cloaking]]. Set in a [[science fiction]] universe, the single-player campaign follows the story of Jack Cooper, a [[rifleman]] from Frontier Militia, who bonds with his Titan BT-7274 after an accident. Together, they embark on a quest to stop the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) from launching a [[superweapon]].

The game's development began in mid-2014, and the title had a two-year development cycle. The decision to add a single-player campaign to the game came about because the team wanted to expand the game's player base. They came up with different ideas and prototypes, and integrated them to form a single coherent campaign. ''[[Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet]]'' and [[buddy cop film]]s, as well as the video game ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' inspired the game's campaign and narrative. The team also overhauled the progression system and made subtle changes to the multiplayer to make the game fairer to players. [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Source (engine)|Source]] engine powers the game. [[Stephen Barton]] returned to compose the game's music.

Upon release, the game received critical acclaim. The single-player campaign was praised for its design and execution, and the multiplayer modes for building on the foundation of the original game. Despite the positive reception, ''Titanfall 2'' underperformed commercially, with most attributing its underwhelming performance to it going on sale in a crowded release window, being placed between the release of ''[[Battlefield 1]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]''. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades including [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] and Best Shooter awards, by several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Respawn continued to support the game after its release, providing several updates and free [[downloadable content]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Titanfall 2 gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|256px|In this gameplay screenshot, the player attaches the player  character to a Titan using a [[grappling hook]].]]
Similar to its predecessor, ''Titanfall 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]] game where players can control both a pilot and their Titans—mecha-style exoskeletons. The pilot has an large variety of abilities that enhance their efficiency during combat. These include [[cloaking device|cloaking]], [[Grappling hook|grappling]], and [[parkour]]—such as double-jumping and wall-running—with the aid of a [[jetpack|jump kit]].&lt;ref name="PolyPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/11/12439628/titanfall-2-single-player-campaign-revealed|title=Titanfall 2: First single-player campaign details|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 11, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812003524/http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/11/12439628/titanfall-2-single-player-campaign-revealed|archivedate=August 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements can be [[combo (gaming)|chained]] together  to travel between locations quickly.&lt;ref name="samediff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/titanfall_2/b/playstation4/archive/2016/06/20/whats-the-same-whats-different-in-titanfall-2-multiplayer.aspx|title=What's the Same, What's Different in Titanfall 2 Multiplayer|first=Matt|last=Bertz|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=June 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623073011/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/titanfall_2/b/playstation4/archive/2016/06/20/whats-the-same-whats-different-in-titanfall-2-multiplayer.aspx|archivedate=June 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/titanfall-2/|title=Titanfall 2's grappling hook is unreal (hands-on)|first=Sean|last=Hollister|work=[[CNet]]|date=June 12, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817080321/http://www.cnet.com/news/titanfall-2/|archivedate=August 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game introduces several new gameplay mechanics. These include: a movement system that allows players to [[Sliding (motion)|slide]] on the ground, the pulse blade (which is a [[throwing knife]] that reveals the location of any nearby enemy), the holo-pilot, (a holographic pilot that mimics players' action to confuse enemies), and a [[grappling hook]], which can be used to slingshot players to a building or an enemy it attaches to. The pilots have a large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, such as [[shotgun]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[pistol]]s and [[grenades]] to fight their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/best-titanfall-2-guns/|title=The best guns in Titanfall 2|first=James|last=Busby|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=January 16, 2017|accessdate=May 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525003852/http://www.pcgamer.com/best-titanfall-2-guns/|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At close range, players can execute their opponents from behind with a [[Melee (gaming)|melee attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2016/06/20/heres-four-minutes-of-titanfall-2-gameplay/|title=Here's four minutes of Titanfall 2 gameplay|first=Sherif|last=Saed|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820025323/http://www.vg247.com/2016/06/20/heres-four-minutes-of-titanfall-2-gameplay/|archivedate=August 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titans are significantly less mobile than the pilots, but they have stronger firearms and armor. Replacing the three classes featured in the first ''Titanfall'', seven Titans are introduced—Ion, Scorch, Northstar, Ronin, Tone, Legion, and Monarch. Ion uses a directed-energy arsenal. Scorch engages in combat using area-denial incendiary weaponry, Northstar excels in long-range precision attacks and setting traps, and is the only Titan with the ability to hover. Ronin specializes in close quarters combat, using a shotgun and a sword. Tone focuses on mid-range combat with its target locking weapons. Legion uses a minigun designed for defense and controlling combat zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/titanfall-2-every-single-titan-and-what-they-do/2900-959/4/|title=Titanfall 2: Every Single Titan and What They Do|first=Matt|last=Espineli|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=May 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055348/https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/titanfall-2-every-single-titan-and-what-they-do/2900-959/4/|archivedate=October 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Monarch—added post-release via downloadable content (DLC)—is a Vanguard-class chassis that can steal power from other Titans to power up its own defensive shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/monarch-s-reign-brings-another-titan-and-map-to-titanfall-2-today-438862.phtml|title=Monarch's Reign brings another Titan and map to Titanfall 2 today|first=Jordan|last=Devore|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=May 30, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Titans have their own move sets which are different from those of the pilots—for instance, they can dodge quickly to evade attacks.&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt;

===Single-player===
Unlike its predecessor, ''Titanfall 2'' has a single-player story campaign with gameplay split between commanding the Titan and controlling the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/12/11913270/titanfall-2-interview-e3-2016|title=Titanfall 2 Brings Personality To Its Messive Mechs, And A Story For The Fans|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 12, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812183825/http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/12/11913270/titanfall-2-interview-e3-2016|archivedate=August 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a linear story, but levels offer players multiple paths to explore.&lt;ref name="GSpotPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-single-player-campaign-revealed-shows-/1100-6442525/|title=Titanfall 2 Single-Player Campaign Revealed, Shows New Details|first=Mike|last=Mahardy|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 12, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813210215/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-single-player-campaign-revealed-shows-/1100-6442525/|archivedate=August 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most parts of the game the Titan BT-7274 accompanies players.

===Multiplayer===

It fills faster when the player kills an opponent, inflicts damage on enemies, or completes certain objectives.&lt;ref name="mashable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ignpre"/&gt; When a certain percentage of the meter is filled, the player can summon a Titan, which descends from the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/20/titanfall-hands-on-preview-and-interview-its-very-different-to-anything-weve-done-in-the-past-5956319/|title=Titanfall 2 hands-on preview and interview – 'It's very different to anything we've done in the past'|work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817060711/http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/20/titanfall-hands-on-preview-and-interview-its-very-different-to-anything-weve-done-in-the-past-5956319/|archivedate=August 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Titan can crush opponents if it lands on one when summoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/13/e3-2016-titanfall-2-our-first-multiplayer-hands-on-is-fire|title=E3 2016: Titanfall 2: Our First Multiplayer Hand-On Is On Fire|first=Ryan|last=McCaffery|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 12, 2016|accessdate=May 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901205208/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/13/e3-2016-titanfall-2-our-first-multiplayer-hands-on-is-fire|archivedate=September 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Titan meter is filled completely while in a Titan, the Titan can use their core ability, which inflicts a lot more damage than typical attacks.&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt; Pilot players can steal a Titan battery, causing damage to it.

Players earn "merits" based on their performance in a multiplayer match whether their team wins or loses. Merits are [[experience (gaming)|experience points]] through participating in the match or getting access to unlocks. Players need to accumulate merits to level up, which unlocks additional weapons, abilities and more. There are also other ways to earn merits, like surviving the evacuation phase when the players' team loses a match. Players can also earn Credits, a form of currency used to buy weapons, boosts, Titans, or abilities before they are unlocked. These can be earned by gaining merits and completing challenges.&lt;ref name="mashable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/10/31/titanfall-2-pvp-multiplayer-tips-tricks-guide/#hCm.GjG_i8qw|title=10 'Titanfall 2' tips for those who struggle with multiplayer|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|work=[[Mashable]]|date=November 1, 2016|accessdate=May 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609092909/http://mashable.com/2016/10/31/titanfall-2-pvp-multiplayer-tips-tricks-guide/#hCm.GjG_i8qw|archivedate=June 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's customization options have expanded significantly compared to ''Titanfall''.

They are tactical abilities that enhance the players' combat efficiency. Each boost has its own specific access requirement. Ticks, which are explosive mines that track enemies, for example, require 65% of the Titan meter filled. Amped Weapons, where players inflict more damage with their firearms, need 80%.

''Titanfall 2'' features several of multiplayer modes at launch. These modes include:&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt;
* '''Amped Hardpoint''': In this mode, teams receive points if they can hold control points for an extensive period. The team that accumulates more points wins.
* '''Bounty Hunt''': Players are rewarded with money if they kill enemies, opponents or [[artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled grunts. Players need to return to specific points to deposit the money. Players can also steal opponents' money by killing them. The team that has the highest score wins.
* '''Pilot vs. Pilot''': A standard [[team deathmatch]] mode but players cannot summon any Titan.
* '''Capture the Flag''': Players are tasked to [[capture the flag]] of an enemy and bring it to their team's base, while preventing opponents from stealing the player's flag. 
* '''Attrition''': A standard team deathmatch mode in which players can summon Titans. Points are rewarded to a player's team when they kill a human-controlled enemy or an AI-controlled grunt. When a team earns enough points, the game transitions into another phase. The losing team needs to reach the evacuation zone and escape, while the winning team needs to eliminate all opponents.
* '''Skirmish''': This mode is like Attrition, but there is no AI-controlled grunt and the score needed for phase transitioning is lower.
* '''Last Titan Standing''': A standard team deathmatch mode, but players cannot eject from their titan.
* '''Free for All''': Players are tasked to kill each other in this mode. All other players will be marked as their opponents.
* '''Coliseum''': This is a one-versus-one multiplayer mode where the player is tasked to eliminate the other player. Players can gain access to this mode through Coliseum tickets. These are earned by playing other multiplayer modes, buying them with credits or receiving them in gifts granted when the player levels up a faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/titanfall-2-has-a-1v1-me-bro-mode-brought-to-you-by-mtn-dew-and-doritos/|title=Titanfall 2 has a "1v1 me bro" mode brought to you by Mtn Dew and Doritos|first=Connor|last=Sheriden|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=September 22, 2016|accessdate=May 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507122343/http://www.gamesradar.com/titanfall-2-has-a-1v1-me-bro-mode-brought-to-you-by-mtn-dew-and-doritos/|archivedate=May 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The game's conflict takes place in "The Frontier", a region of star systems far removed from the "Core Systems" where Earth is located. The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and the Frontier Militia battle for control of the Frontier. The IMC seeks to exploit the Frontier's rich resources regardless of the consequences for planetary environments and civilian populations, while the Militia fight to expel the IMC and gain the Frontier's independence. In the wake of the [[Titanfall#Plot|Battle of Demeter]], the Militia is on the offensive, battling for resources and control of the Frontier planets. Though weakened by the lack of reinforcements from the core systems because of the destruction of the refueling facility by James MacAllan, IMC is still a dominant fighting force attempting to drive the Militia out and put down any resistance to their control of the Frontier.

In the singleplayer campaign the player assumes control of Jack Cooper, a rifleman from the Frontier Militia, sent to the alien planet of Typhon who must join his former squadmate's Titan—named BT-7274—to fight local alien creatures and human enemies from the IMC.&lt;ref name="EuroGPre" /&gt;

===Plot===
Jack Cooper is a rifleman in the Militia. He aspires to become a Titan Pilot for the Militia and is receiving off-the-books training from Captain Tai Lastimosa to prepare for his candidacy. The two are part of a Militia force which attacks the IMC-held planet of Typhon. In the initial battle, the Apex Predators, a group of mercenaries contracted to the IMC and led by Blisk, mortally wound Lastimosa and incapacitate his Vanguard-class Titan, BT-7274. Lastimosa transfers control of BT to Cooper. BT explains that Cooper has also inherited Lastimosa's mission, Special Operation 217: to rendezvous with Major Anderson and assist in the completion of their original assignment. Anderson's last known position is at an IMC laboratory. BT and Cooper are forced to detour through a manufacturing plant where they are ambushed and separated. Cooper fights through the factory alone until he is trapped in a combat simulation being run by the mercenary Ash, who is using captured Militia soldiers as test subjects to test the potency of IMC machine units. Cooper escapes, and after being reunited with BT, defeats Ash.

BT and Cooper continue to the IMC laboratory only to find it destroyed, and corpses artificially aged due to time-travel distortion. Anderson is present, though also deceased from a time-travel mishap. Cooper learns Anderson was gathering intelligence on a new IMC device, the "Fold Weapon", which utilizes time-displacement technology to destroy entire planets. The planet Harmony, which is the home planet of Lastimosa and houses the Militia headquarters, will be the first target. Fortunately for the Militia, the Fold Weapon is dependent upon a power source known as the Ark. Cooper and BT hijack an IMC communications array and broadcast a signal to the Militia fleet. The transmission contained sensor data on the Ark's electromagnetic signature so that the Militia could find and seize it.

After receiving the transmission, Militia's military unit, the Marauder Corps, leads an assault against the IMC-held installation where the Ark is being kept. Arriving too late to prevent it from being loaded onto an IMC transport, the Militia give chase in hijacked IMC ships. The mercenary Viper nearly kills BT and Cooper by throwing them off their transport, but freelance pilot Barker rescues them by catching them with his dropship. Cooper regroups with a friendly mercenary group called the Six Four, and the Pilots secure the IMC ship nearest to the Draconis, the transport carrying the Ark. Barker drops off BT and Cooper. They face off with Viper who falls out of the sky after a short skirmish. BT and Cooper attempt to board the Draconis but are again interrupted by Viper. BT loses an arm in the battle, but Cooper kills Viper by shooting his exposed body after his Titan's hatch is blown off.

Cooper and BT successfully board the Draconis holding the Ark, and they secure it before the ship crashes. BT becomes incapacitated from damage sustained in his fight with Viper, and the duo are captured by Blisk and his second-in-command, Slone. BT surrenders the Ark to save Cooper but is destroyed by Slone for trying to help Cooper escape. However, BT gives Cooper his data core before he dies, and Cooper uses it to revive BT by installing it in a Vanguard chassis provided by Briggs after he escapes captivity. Reunited, Cooper and BT fight their way to the base where the Fold Weapon is being prepared for use against Harmony. They kill Slone, earning Blisk's respect; Blisk spares Cooper because the IMC never included killing him in their contract and he does not work for free. He offers Cooper a place in the Apex Predators before departing. BT and Cooper then launch themselves into the Fold Weapon's superstructure where the Ark has already been installed. BT hurls Cooper free before sacrificing himself by killing himself, destroying the Ark and the Fold Weapon and the planet Complex.

The game ends with a monologue by Cooper, talking about having his status as a pilot affirmed and being inducted into the Marauder Corps, as well as reminiscing over his experiences with BT. The Titan neural link to Cooper's helmet flashes with the message "Jack?" encoded in binary.

==Development==
[[Respawn Entertainment]], founded by [[Vince Zampella]], and a team of ninety people developed the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development/divide-and-conquer-the-next-step-for-respawn|title=Divide and conquer: the next step for Respawn|first=Matthew|last=Jarvis|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624084253/https://www.mcvuk.com/development/divide-and-conquer-the-next-step-for-respawn|archivedate=June 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Titanfall]]''{{'}}s original director, Steve Fukuda, producer Drew McCoy, and composer [[Stephen Barton]] returned for the sequel.

===Single-player===
''Titanfall'' had a low engagement with players post-release, despite huge initial sales. Fukuda believed the dwindling size of the community was due mainly to the game's lack of a single-player campaign.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; Zampella confirmed the introduction of a single-player campaign was intended to expand the player base,&lt;ref name="RollingStoneInt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/interviews/qa-titanfall-2-creator-on-what-makes-a-great-shooter-w450709|title=Q&amp;A: 'Titanfall 2' Creator on What Makes a Great Shooter and Launching Against 'Call of Duty'|first=Chris|last=Suellentrop|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024852/https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/interviews/qa-titanfall-2-creator-on-what-makes-a-great-shooter-w450709|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McCoy believed this could make the overall package more complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/18/12533412/titanfall-2-single-player-demo-gamescom-2016|title=Titanfall 2's 'unexpected single-player' needs time to win over players|first=Allegra|last=Frank|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 18, 2016|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025200/https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/18/12533412/titanfall-2-single-player-demo-gamescom-2016|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's vision for the campaign was to make it different from other [[first-person shooter]]s, especially ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; This proved to be a challenge since many of them had worked at [[Infinity Ward]], the developer of ''Call of Duty'', before joining Respawn and had become accustomed to making a campaign in that style. According to McCoy, the team initially tried putting all the mechanics from the first ''Titanfall'' into the campaign, but it did not work out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/19/titanfall-2-gamescom-2016/|title=Crafting a story for 'Titanfall 2'|first=Nick|last=Summers|work=[[Engadget]]|date=August 19, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025336/https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/19/titanfall-2-gamescom-2016/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the team decided to host many [[game jam]]s in the studio, where team members were free to create new designs and experiment with technology with few constraints other than adhering to ''Titanfall''{{'}}s existing mechanics. The team was tasked not to follow traditional shooter campaign's design conventions. Team members were free to build prototypes for it, which would then be integrated to form a coherent campaign. These prototypes were internally referred to as "action blocks". They allowed the team to introduce "ideas after ideas" in the full game since these blocks were often independent of each other and had unique gameplay features. For instance, players would be time traveling in one level and assaulting Titans in the next. These blocks enabled the team to discover new ideas and work out the structure of the overall campaign. Internally it was called "211" as every level consisted of two parts involving pilot combat, one part involving pilot movement and puzzle solving, and one part involving Titan combat.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-titanfall-2-how-building-blocks-buddy-robots-and-half-life-led-to-one-of-the-freshest-fps-in-years/|title=The making of Titanfall 2: How building blocks, buddy robots, and Half-Life led to one of the freshest FPS in years|first=Alex|last=Wiltshire|date=October 13, 2017|accessdate=April 25, 2018|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025013/https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-titanfall-2-how-building-blocks-buddy-robots-and-half-life-led-to-one-of-the-freshest-fps-in-years/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AH-64D Apache Longbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Military technologies such as the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]] helicopter inspired the look of BT-7274.]]
The "action blocks" approach meant ''Titanfall 2''{{'}}s gameplay was designed before the story. The team intended making the game similar to the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series, where a mystery takes center stage in the story, hooking players to continue exploring it and completing the campaign. ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' also influenced the game's design.&lt;ref name="RollingStoneInt"/&gt; One of the major components of the campaign is the interactions between Cooper and his Titan BT-7274.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; Fukuda described it as a "buddy" story, inspired by [[buddy cop film]]s like ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' or ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', as well as [[anime]] ''[[Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/04/19/respawn-finally-talks-about-the-obvious-mecha-anime-influences-in-titanfall-2/#3a5e99d42596|title=Respawn Finally Talks About The Obvious Mecha Anime Influences In 'Titanfall 2'|first=Ollie|last=Barder|work=[[Forbes]]|date=April 19, 2017|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025641/https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/04/19/respawn-finally-talks-about-the-obvious-mecha-anime-influences-in-titanfall-2/#3a5e99d42596|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "BT" stood for "Buddy Titan", a name the team hated, but Fukuda insisted on using. To increase the chemistry between the duo, the two characters have opposite personalities: Jack is enthusiastic, while BT is robotic and calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/titanfall-2-making-of-and-insight-news-red-bull-games|title=Titanfall 2’s Campaign is a Sci-Fi Buddy Cop Romp|first=Ben|last=Salter|work=[[Red Bull]]|date=September 14, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper was difficult for the team to write since his personality may not align with players' choices or vision for the character.&lt;ref name="TelegraphInterview"/&gt; While the team intentionally avoided making BT similar to characters like [[Optimus Prime]] or cute robots like [[Wall-E]], they found BT's personality difficult to write, as they had to find a balance between making it "a lovable partner and a 20-foot-tall war machine". Early drafts of BT's scripts were deemed too "bossy", and five writers took five months to rework them. To make BT more human, the team designed a large emotive eye, so players would know where the titan is looking, and a small pair of robotic arms that allow it to interact with other characters in a more natural way. The front of BT is filled with colored paints which inform players of the Titan's head movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13256052/titanfall-2-bt-mech-design-interview-respawn-entertainment|title=How The Team Behind Titanfall 2 Built A Titan You'll Actually Care About|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[The Verge]]|date=October 16, 2018|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024811/https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13256052/titanfall-2-bt-mech-design-interview-respawn-entertainment|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team added a design choice that let players communicate with BT enabling players to bond with the Titan without using any [[cutscene]].&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; This also provided players with more insights into the game's world,&lt;ref name="RollingStoneInt"/&gt; though some staff questioned the decision since ''Half-Life''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s protagonist is silenced. To make players feel that Cooper and BT are separate entities even when they are controlling the Titan, the team included several small graphical hints to remind them that BT will still continue to talk to the player character.&lt;ref name="TelegraphInterview"/&gt; [[Akira Kurosawa]] films and [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sam Elliott]]'s cowboy roles inspired animator Shawn Lee Wilson creation of BT's unique physical appearance and expression. The [[Apache helicopter]] and other military technologies also inspired BT's design. Wilson provided motion capture for the Titan.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt;

While designing the game's single-player, one of the team's goals was to keep the energy present in ''Titanfall''{{'}}s multiplayer mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-single-player-campaign-revealed-shows-/1100-6442525/|title=Titanfall 2 Single-Player Campaign Revealed, Shows New Details|first=Mike|last=Mahardy|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 11, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829074259/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-single-player-campaign-revealed-shows-/1100-6442525/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team wanted to make the campaign more creative instead of simply having robots in it. Both the unique traits of pilots and Titans had to be used and expanded upon. Therefore, the team decided to create both intricate environments for pilots' transversal and large open space for titan combat, instead of making it a [[linear gameplay|corridor shooter]]. According to gameplay designer Mohammed Alavi, this gave players greater control and freedom over the character's movement.&lt;ref name="TelegraphInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/titanfall-2-single-player-interview---you-are-going-to-be-doing/|title=Titanfall 2 interview - 'You are going to be doing things in our single-player that you have never done before'|first=Dan|last=Silver|work=[[The Telegraph (magazine)|The Telegraph]]|date=September 1, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429030108/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/titanfall-2-single-player-interview---you-are-going-to-be-doing/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team focused a great deal on [[platform game|platforming]] designed to further expand the use of the pilot movement sets. Many team members created action blocks dedicated to platforming, including ideas such as having players solve puzzles to find a new surface to wall-run on, and Titan being able to throw the pilot, so they could travel over long distances. The concept of Titan throwing pilots was ultimately discarded from the gameplay and became part of a cinematic cutscene because the team had trouble implementing it due to its lack of interactivity.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; The game also features a variety of puzzles inspired by ''[[BioShock]]'' and ''Half-Life'', where players maintain "a certain level of speed" while solving puzzles.&lt;ref name="biggest challenge yet"/&gt; There are also puzzles which change the game's pace and require players to stop to think of a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/11/13243948/titanfall-2-single-player-adventure-video|title=Titanfall 2’s campaign makes time for slow moments|first=Samit|last=Sarker|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025202/https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/11/13243948/titanfall-2-single-player-adventure-video|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''{{'}}s [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and the documentary series ''[[Life After People]]'' inspired the most acclaimed level, "Effect and Cause", initially an action block created by designer Jake Keating involving time travel. He had the idea before the development of ''Titanfall''. He experimented with it with one of ''Titanfall''{{'}}s multiplayer maps. The action block was warmly welcomed by the entire development team, with some feeling that it had the potential to be the main feature through the entire game rather than being confined to one level. However, Keating insisted on limiting its use to one level so that the mechanic would not become boring for players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/av3a7b/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-best-mission-in-titanfall-2|title=A Behind-The-Scenes Look at the Best Mission in ‘Titanfall 2’|first=Patrick|last=Klepek|work=Waypoint|date=November 29, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025118/https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/av3a7b/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-best-mission-in-titanfall-2|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make the level, the team created two building [[computer model]]s with one on top of the other. As the player switches timelines, they are teleported from one building to the other. Fukuda added it was the landmark level the team was looking for and it did not need demanding technology. However, the added level created more work for the team since the two buildings, each with different features and characteristics, needed to be built twice.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt;

The game's single-player starts with simple missions before gradually introducing players to more complicated situations which demand more skills and precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/10/27/titanfall-2-gradually-eases-players-into-grunt-combat/|title=Titanfall 2 gradually eases players into Grunt combat|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=October 27, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024439/https://venturebeat.com/2016/10/27/titanfall-2-gradually-eases-players-into-grunt-combat/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game story also supplements this, as Cooper transforms from a normal Frontier grunt to a skillful pilot at the end.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; The campaign was created as a stepping stone for inexperienced players by providing a more "relaxing" environment that teaches players' the basic gameplay mechanics, training them before they join multiplayer matches.&lt;ref name="can't get anywhere else"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/titanfall-2-interview---we-think-were-offering-something-that-pe/|title=Titanfall 2 interview - "We are offering something that people are not going to get anywhere else"|first=Tom|last=Hoggins|work=[[The Telegraph (magazine)|The Telegraph]]|date=October 24, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429104801/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/titanfall-2-interview---we-think-were-offering-something-that-pe/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer===
The team evaluated ''Titanfall'' and listened to both feedback and analytical research from gaming journalists and identified two major concerns: there was not enough content for players, and at times the game became too chaotic. The team slowed down the gameplay pace of ''Titanfall 2''{{'}}s multiplayer so that players could actively make decisions relying less on [[reflex]]. The team also improved the game's map design by introducing more verticality to each map. Fukuda described it as the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[swiss cheese effect]]. The team also employed the strategy of "window pane", where each map has three obvious paths: left, middle and right. This helped make each map's environments more predictable to players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/96446/titanfall-2-game-director-on-a-slower-paced-multiplayer|title=Titanfall 2 game director on a slower-paced multiplayer|first=Ozzie|last=Mejia|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025428/http://www.shacknews.com/article/96446/titanfall-2-game-director-on-a-slower-paced-multiplayer|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Titanfall2'' features a brighter color pattern and environment  compared to both the first game and other military shooters,&lt;ref name="biggest challenge yet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/int-en/titanfall-2-interview-red-bull-games|title=Titanfall 2’s biggest challenge yet|first=Benjamin|last=Kratsch|work=Red Bull|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the team aimed for graphical quality that is "postcard-worthy".&lt;ref name="vg247interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2016/09/06/titanfall-2-interview-respawn-talks-the-challenges-of-creating-a-campaign/|title=Titanfall 2 Interview: Respawn talks the challenges of creating a campaign|first=Alex|last=Donaldson|work=[[VG 247]]|date=September 6, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429030228/https://www.vg247.com/2016/09/06/titanfall-2-interview-respawn-talks-the-challenges-of-creating-a-campaign/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a greater variety of environments featured in the multiplayer maps, ranging from industrial centers to outdoor maps with more foliage.&lt;ref name="engine improvement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/06/14/e3-2016-respawn-talks-content-variety-reworked-engine-in-titanfall-2/212196/|title=E3 2016: Respawn Talks Content Variety, Reworked Engine in Titanfall 2|first=Kevin|last=Dunsmore|work=[[Hardcore Gamer]]|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429091721/https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/06/14/e3-2016-respawn-talks-content-variety-reworked-engine-in-titanfall-2/212196/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also various revisions to the game's multiplayer mode. McCoy described these changes as "subtle" as the team focused more on adding slight modifications to existing mechanics. The Titans were redesigned so that players can "tell at a glance everything that [they] need to know" and stay prepared for each combat encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/titanfall-2-interview-on-mechs-modes-and-the-new-campaign/|title=Titanfall 2 interview: on mechs, modes and the new campaign|first=Samuel|last=Roberts|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024927/https://www.pcgamer.com/titanfall-2-interview-on-mechs-modes-and-the-new-campaign/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled players to have a clearer picture of the combat situations and facilitated learning from each defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-23-respawn-talks-titanfall-2-and-that-call-of-duty-remaster|title=Respawn talks Titanfall 2 and that Call of Duty remaster|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025305/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-23-respawn-talks-titanfall-2-and-that-call-of-duty-remaster|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also introduced cosmetic changes to the pilots and the six Titan class giving them distinct visual characteristics so that players can easily identify an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/12/11913270/titanfall-2-interview-e3-2016|title=Titanfall 2 Brings Personality To Its Massive Mech, And A Story For Fans|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 12, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829073642/https://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/12/11913270/titanfall-2-interview-e3-2016|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team attempted to add more depth to the gameplay by introducing more Titans, gadgets and pilot abilities, allowing players to play in accordance with their own playstyle.

===Technology===
The game used a heavily modified version of [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Source (engine)|Source]] as its [[video game engine|game engine]]. Many improvements were made to the engine's aspects such as [[physically based rendering]], a texture streaming system developed in house, [[high dynamic range]] and [[depth of field]]. The team also made changes to the audio, such as introducing [[Occlusion effect|sound occlusion]] and [[reverberation]].&lt;ref name="engine improvement"/&gt; According to John Haggerty, senior software engineer, the team broke part of the engine's code for level progression and saves when they were making the first game. The programming team found it a huge challenge to fix and reinstate these codes to accommodate the sequel's single-player campaign. The team also developed a scripting system from scratch, allowing designers to quickly assemble action blocks.&lt;ref name="EdgeTheMakingOf"/&gt; The game's [[artificial intelligence]] was significantly enhanced, with new movesets and behaviors for pilots and titans in both single-player and multiplayer modes.&lt;ref name="VBInt"/&gt; As ''Titanfall 2'' was the first game Respawn developed for the [[PlayStation 4]], the engineering team spent a lot of time and effort to get it running on the platform.&lt;ref name="engine improvement"/&gt; A [[virtual reality]] version of the game was prototyped but never went into full production because, according to Joe Emslie, the player would "vomit all over their controller."&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;

Combat [[animation]] can be interrupted by players' movement, which gives them more direct control instead of needing to wait for the animation to end.&lt;ref name="RollingStoneInt"/&gt; Most ''Titanfall''{{'}}s pilots' movesets returned in ''Titanfall 2'' but with some slight modifications. For instance, players no longer fall off as they are wall running near the tops of walls. Before players begin to wall run, the game's [[camera]] also tilts slightly so that players can anticipate the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/293282/Designer_Interview_Getting_Titanfalls_controls_just_right.php|title=Designer Interview: Getting Titanfall's controls just right|first=Alex|last=Wiltshire|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=April 25, 2018|work=[[Gamasutra]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429091849/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/293282/Designer_Interview_Getting_Titanfalls_controls_just_right.php|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The game's plot received positive reviews. Nic Rowen of ''[[Destructoid]]'' found it had an unsurprising and "by the number" sci-fi plot. He was disappointed by the campaign's five-hour length and noted that the emotional core of the story lacked development.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''[[']]s Javy Gwaltney compared the plot to a "buddy comedy" remarking positively that BT is a relatable character.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Peter Paras of [[Game Revolution]] praised the interesting story, despite feeling the nine-chapter story is basic. He also liked BT's personality, calling it a "straight-laced 'I take what you say literally' thinking machine". He noted the interactions with the Titan successfully added more context to the game's world and setting.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Jon Denton of [[Eurogamer]] praised BT's character, saying its lines were skillfully written.&lt;ref name="EuroGRev"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Mike Mahardy felt the story was poorly written and that it ended abruptly.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; Arthur Gies of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the narrative was subpar, with mediocre voice acting, "corny names" for characters, and insufficient context for players to truly remember the story.&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt;

''Titanfall 2''{{'s}} gameplay received critical acclaim. Rowen described it as "frantic and exhilarating", saying the fluidity of gameplay further enhanced the quality of the single-player campaign.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Gwaltney shared similar thoughts, saying that no matter how players chose to approach a mission, combat or stealth, it was satisfying. Furthermore, he found controlling the Titan an interesting experience that resembles ''[[MechWarrior]]'' and ''[[Star Fox]]''.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Mahardy also felt that player movement controls remained "invigorating". He liked the Titan combat more for often presenting "David versus Goliath" scenarios. Mahardy and described the game as a "thinking man"{{'}}s shooter, adding it required players to think tactically instead of simply having good reflexes.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; David Houghton of [[GamesRadar]] praised the game's controls and movement options for turning many seemingly gameplay obstacles and barriers into opportunities for players to manipulate.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Chris Thursten of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the game's variety of weapons and their sounds and the "brilliant" freedom of movement.&lt;ref name="PCGRev"/&gt;

Rowen praised the level design, which he found one of the game's "real stars". He was impressed by the variety of settings and set pieces featured in each level and praised the design for having tricky environments for transversal encouraging free movements. He singled out "Effect and Cause" as one of the game's most imaginative levels, comparing it favorably with ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]''.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Paras remarked that two of the game's chapters were extremely impressive, and that they "[re-examine] level design in most action games". Thursten also enjoyed these levels but added that not all of them share this level of creativity. He wished some of the novel concepts introduced "stuck around longer" during his playtime.&lt;ref name="PCGRev"/&gt; Gwaltney liked the flexibility of the game's campaign, which provides players plenty of freedom to handle combat encounters. He also appreciated the inclusion of the game's puzzles, which requires players to "think outside the box".&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Both Paras and Houghton liked the levels for incorporating elements of Pilot and Titan gameplay. Paras said it added variety to the package,&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; and Houghton felt it improved the game's pacing, making it very "exhilarating" to play.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Mahardy admired the pacing, attributing its success to the fact that players can switch BT's loadouts to handle various combat situations, presenting a different dynamic from multiplayer.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; Brandin Tyrrel of [[IGN]] admired the game's sense of scale and map design, where each level stage felt large but at the same time linear enough to direct players' progression.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;

The game's multiplayer was also acclaimed. Rowen described it as "more than solid" and praised the more complex and extended progression system for rectifying ''Titanfall''{{'}}s lack of long-term appeal. While Titan's customization became more limited, he felt this was a necessary change to make the Titan combat deeper and more rewarding. He noted there were many "smart" gameplay adjustments and design changes that emphasize players' skills, but he was disappointed there were not enough modes featuring AI opponents.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Gwaltney, however, felt there were no significant changes to the multiplayer, but there were sufficient subtle design adjustments making it more refined and improved than its predecessor. He still found the progression system lacking in substance. He appreciated the new gadgets, which make the game more tactical. He commented positively on the game modes' structure, which prompts all types of players to engage in teamwork.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Paras criticized the multiplayer for being unforgiving, though he enjoyed some of the game modes, like Bounty Hunt.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Mahardy praised the six new Titans types for being easy to learn and difficult to master. As the six Titan types have distinct controls and attack schemes, Mahardy noted that combat resembles that of a [[fighting game]] and [[multiplayer online battle arena]]s games.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; Tyrrel praised the overhauled rodeo mechanic, which promoted teamwork, and Boosts, which make the game more balanced.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; Gies described some of the design changes as "odd" and "difficult to understand", including the rodeo mechanic which he found mostly useless. In addition, he criticized the maps for being too confined, and not fitting with the game's fast gameplay.&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt;

Critics generally had a positive reception to the overall package. Rowen admired the game for being an imaginative and creative shooter, one that no other competitor in the market can achieve.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Gwaltney described the game as a "must-play" that unlike most other shooters offered a complete package with both a fully-fledged single-player campaign and a refined multiplayer.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Paras felt that ''Titanfall 2'' successfully delivered on the promises made by the first game.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Tyrrel also shared similar opinions, calling the game a rare and exceptional title that improved on every aspect of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; Houghton called the game the year's surprise, describing it as one of the most "creative and rewarding FPS in recent memory".&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Thursten worried that ''Titanfall 2'' would suffer from a short lifespan like its predecessor due to the same poor release timing. He noted the single-player campaign was the game's true highlight.&lt;ref name="PCGRev"/&gt; Denton strongly recommended the game and gave it the highest possible rating, but he shared the same concern as Thursten.&lt;ref name="EuroGRev"/&gt;

The game received "generally positive reviews" upon release according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]], with the PlayStation 4 version attaining the highest score of 89 out of 100.&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] selected it as their [[game of the year]], while ''PC Gamer'' chose it as their shooter of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-2016/3/|title=GamesRadar+'s Game of the Year 2016|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=December 30, 2016|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025231/https://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-2016/3/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/shooter-of-the-year-2016-titanfall-2/|title=Best Shooter 2016: Titanfall 2|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=December 25, 2018|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024949/https://www.pcgamer.com/shooter-of-the-year-2016-titanfall-2/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
Electronic Arts expected the game to sell approximately nine to ten million units in its first year of release.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/titanfall_2/news/titanfall_2_to_sell_9-10_million_units_battlefield_1_15_million_says_ea.html|title=Titanfall 2 to sell 9-10 million units, Battlefield 1 15 million, says EA|first=James|last=Orry|work=VideoGamer.com|date=August 3, 2016|accessdate=August 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807232604/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/titanfall_2/news/titanfall_2_to_sell_9-10_million_units_battlefield_1_15_million_says_ea.html|archivedate=August 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, financial analysts predicted the game's sales would be substantially disappointing due to EA's decision to release the game in late October, a period between the launch of EA's own ''[[Battlefield 1]]'', and Activision's ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]''. Despite that, EA expressed no concern about the release window, as they felt that the player base of ''Battlefield 1'' and ''Titanfall 2'' would not overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-sales-will-be-substantially-disappoint/1100-6444884/|title=Titanfall 2 Sales Will Be "Substantially Disappointing," Analyst Says|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=November 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031214937/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-sales-will-be-substantially-disappoint/1100-6444884/|archivedate=October 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was the fourth best-selling retail game in the UK in its week of release, behind ''Battlefield 1'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition]]'', and ''[[FIFA 17]]''. Its first-week sales only reached a quarter of the launch-week sales of ''Titanfall'' despite ''Titanfall 2'' being a multi-platform release. Digital sales of the game were also down, only reaching a quarter of its predecessor's sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/titanfall-2-tanks-on-uk-physical-sales-charts-despite-multiplatform-release/|title=Titanfall 2 tanks on UK physical sales charts, despite multiplatform release|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=November 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103102531/http://www.pcgamer.com/titanfall-2-tanks-on-uk-physical-sales-charts-despite-multiplatform-release/|archivedate=November 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[NPD Group]], the game was the ninth best-selling game in October 2016 and the fifth best-selling game in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/15/november-2016-npd-pokemon-sun-and-moon-have-biggest-debut-in-franchise-history/|title=November 2016 NPD: Pokémon has its biggest debut in franchise history|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=December 15, 2016|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025240/https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/15/november-2016-npd-pokemon-sun-and-moon-have-biggest-debut-in-franchise-history/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their earnings call for the third quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, EA stated that the game's sales fell below expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/31/ea-titanfall-2-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/|title=EA: Titanfall 2 didn’t meet sales expectations|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=January 31, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025437/https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/31/ea-titanfall-2-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, EA CEO Blake Jorgensen went on to say the company was pleased with the positive reviews the game received and expected it to have strong sales into the next fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ERTS/4818588412x0x926062/D62107D7-CCA4-49A5-8D8D-87D0AFAE7A7E/EA_Transcript_Q317.pdf "Q3 2017 Electronic Arts Inc Earnings Call on January 31, 2017."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731145948/http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ERTS/4818588412x0x926062/D62107D7-CCA4-49A5-8D8D-87D0AFAE7A7E/EA_Transcript_Q317.pdf |date=July 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zampella, ''Titanfall 2'' sold well and was successful, but it could have sold better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-should-have-sold-better-dev-says/1100-6452273/|title=Titanfall 2 Should Have Sold Better, Dev Says|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 3, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429091743/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-2-should-have-sold-better-dev-says/1100-6452273/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, financial firm [[Morgan Stanley]] estimated that the game had sold 4 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/23/morgan-stanley-raises-battlefield-1-sales-estimate-to-15-million/|title=Morgan Stanley raises Battlefield 1 sales estimate to 15 million|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429025526/https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/23/morgan-stanley-raises-battlefield-1-sales-estimate-to-15-million/|archivedate=April 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{The Works of Aristotle}}

The '''''Topics''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Τοπικά}}; {{lang-la|Topica}}) is the name given to one of [[Aristotle]]'s six works on [[logic]] collectively known as the ''[[Organon]]'': {{Corpus Aristotelicum table |position=centered |key=omit |logic}}

The Topics constitutes Aristotle's treatise on the art of [[dialectic]]—the invention and discovery of arguments in which the propositions rest upon ''commonly held opinions'' or [[endoxa]] ({{lang|grc|ἔνδοξα}} in [[Greek language|Greek]]).&lt;ref&gt;These "commonly held opinions" are not merely popular notions held by the man-on-the-street about any and all subjects; rather, the dialectical &amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;delta;&amp;omicron;&amp;xi;&amp;alpha; are commonplaces of reason upon which those who conscientiously dispute (all men, most men, the wise, most of the wise, or the best known among the wise) agree in principle -- ''i.e.'' that which is "enshrined" (to borrow a cognate religious term) in opinion or belief among those who engage in disputation.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Topoi'' ({{lang|el|τόποι}}) are "places" from which such arguments can be discovered or invented.

==What is a "topic"?==
In his treatise on the Topics, Aristotle does not explicitly define a ''topos'', though it is "at least primarily a strategy for argument not infrequently justified or explained by a principle."&lt;ref&gt;"Dialectic and Aristotle's Topics". Stump, Eleonore. ''Boethius's De topicis differentiis''. Cornell University Press. Ithaca and London, 1978. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; He characterises it in the ''[[Rhetoric]]''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle refers to rhetoric as "the counterpart to dialectic" in the introduction to his [[Rhetoric]] (1354a ''et seq''), noting that both alike are arts of persuasion. Both deal, not with a specific genus or subject, but with the broadly applicable principles of things that come within the ken of all people. Rhetoric is distinguished from dialectic in that the former employs not only syllogism (i.e. enthymeme), but additionally makes use of the character of the speaker and the emotions of the audience to perform its persuasive task.&lt;/ref&gt; thus: "I call the same thing ''element'' and ''topos''; for an element or a topos is a heading under which many [[enthymeme]]s fall."&lt;ref&gt;Rhet. 1403a18-19&lt;/ref&gt;  By ''element'', he means a general form under which enthymemes of the same type can be included.  Thus, the ''topos'' is a general argument source, from which the individual arguments are instances and is a sort of template from which many individual arguments can be constructed.  The word {{lang|el|τόπος}} (''tópos'', literally "place, location") is also related to the ancient [[method of loci|memory method of "loci"]], by which things to be remembered are recollected by mentally connecting them with successive real or imagined places.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'' as houses along a street one knows by heart&lt;/ref&gt;

==How topics relate to Aristotle's theory of the syllogism==
Though the ''Topics'', as a whole, does not deal directly with the "forms of [[syllogism]]",&lt;ref&gt;These are discussed elsewhere, as in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; clearly Aristotle contemplates the use of topics as places from which ''dialectical syllogisms'' (i.e. ''arguments'' from the commonly held {{lang|grc|[[endoxa|ἔνδοξα]]}}, ''éndoxa'') may be derived. This is evidenced by the fact that the introduction to the ''Topics'' contains and relies upon his definition of reasoning ({{lang|el|συλλογισμός}}, ''syllogismós''): ''a verbal expression'' ({{lang|el|λόγος}}, ''lógos'') ''in which, certain things having been laid down, other things necessarily follow from these.''.&lt;ref&gt;Topics 100a25-27&lt;/ref&gt; Dialectical reasoning is thereafter divided by Aristotle into [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] parts. The ''endoxa'' themselves are sometimes, but not always, set out in a propositional form, i.e. an express major or minor proposition, from which the complete syllogism may be constructed. Often, such propositional construction is left as a task to the practitioner of the dialectic art; in these instances Aristotle gives only the general strategy for argument, leaving the "provision of propositions" to the ingenuity of the disputant.

==Division of the text==
Book I of the ''Topics'' is introductory, laying down a number of preliminary principles upon which dialectical argumentation proceeds. After defining ''dialectical'' reasoning (syllogism) and distinguishing it from ''demonstrative'', ''contentious'', and (one might say) ''"pseudo-scientific"''&lt;ref&gt;For Aristotle, "demonstrative" arguments ({{lang|grc|ἀποδείξεις}}, ''apodeíxeis'') are those that comprise science, and analyze a particular genus or subject matter by means of propositions or axioms that admit of no further syllogistic proof. "Contentious" arguments are those that proceed from propositions that only ''seem'' to be {{lang|grc|ἔνδοξα}} ''éndoxa'', or that only ''seem to reason'' from such propositions. "Pseudo-scientific" arguments are those based upon faulty models—such as a geometer's argument from a falsely drawn diagram.&lt;/ref&gt; syllogism, Aristotle notes the utility of the art of dialectic, then sets out four bases (accident, property, genus, definition) from which invention of such reasoning proceeds. He next elucidates various senses of "sameness", as bearing directly upon the usual character of such arguments. ''Dialectical propositions'' and ''dialectical problems'' are characterized. Then, the {{lang|grc|ὄργανα}} (''órgana'') or ''means'' by which arguments may be obtained are described, in a four-fold summary, as:
# the provision of propositions
# discovery of the number of senses of a term
# the discovery of differences
# the investigation of similarities
Methods and rationale for attaining each of these ends are briefly illustrated and explained.

Book II is devoted to an explication of topics relating to arguments where an "[[accident (philosophy)|accident]]" (i.e. non-essential attribute, or an attribute that ''may'' or ''may not'' belong) is predicated of a subject.

Book III concerns commonplaces from which things can be discussed with respect to whether they are "better" or "worse".

Book IV deals with "genus"—how it is discovered and what are the sources of argument for and against attribution of a genus.

Book V discusses the base of "property"&amp;mdash;that which is attributable ''only'' to a particular subject and is not an ''essential'' attribute. Property is subdivided into ''essential''&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean that it expresses an attribute comprising an essential element of the subject, but rather that it is a characteristic that is predicated solely of that subject and that it is an ''effect'' of the essential nature of the subject&lt;/ref&gt; and ''permanent'', versus ''relative'' and ''temporary''.

Book VI describes "definition" and the numerous means that may be used to attack and defend a definition.

Book VII is a short recapitulation of "definition" and "sameness", and compares the various difficulties involved in forming arguments, both ''pro'' and ''con'', about the other bases of dialectical disputation.

Book VIII (the final book) is a lengthy survey containing suggestions, hints, and some tricks about the technique of organizing and delivering one or the other side of verbal disputation.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Topics'' contemplates an adversarial system of question and answer, in which one party attempts to elicit from another, through yes-or-no questions, the conclusion he wishes to prove.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Topics'' as related to the treatise on sophistical refutations==
The ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' is viewed by some&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'' Forster, E. S. in Aristotle. ''Topica''. [[Loeb Classical Library]] Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989. p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; as an appendix to the Topics, inasmuch as its final section&lt;ref&gt;183a38-184b9&lt;/ref&gt; appears to form an epilogue  to both treatises.

'''''Two Years' Vacation''''' ({{lang-fr|Deux ans de vacances}}) is an adventure novel by [[Jules Verne]], published in [[1888 in literature|1888]]. The story tells of the fortunes of a group of schoolboys stranded on a deserted island in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], and of their struggles to overcome adversity. In his preface to the book, Verne explains that his goals were to create a [[Robinson Crusoe]]-like environment for children, and to show the world what the intelligence and bravery of a child was capable of when put to the test.

==Plot summary==
[[Image:'Two Years' Vacation' by Léon Benett 39.jpg|thumb|Map of "Chairman Island"]]

The story takes place in March, 1860 and opens with a group of schoolboys aged between eight and fourteen on board a 100-ton [[schooner]] called the ''Sleuth'' moored at [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and preparing to set off on a six-week vacation. With the exception of the oldest boy Gordon, an American, and Briant and Jack, two French brothers, all the boys are British.

While the schooner's crew are ashore, the moorings are cast off under unknown circumstances and the ship drifts to sea, where it is caught by a storm. Twenty-two days later, the boys find themselves cast upon the shore of an uncharted island, which they name "Chairman Island." They go on many adventures and even catch wild animals while trying to survive. They remain there for the next two years until a passing ship sinks in the close vicinity of the island. The ship had been taken over by [[mutiny|mutineer]]s, intent on trafficking slaves. With the aid of two of the surviving members of the original crew, the boys are able to defeat the mutineers and make their escape from the island, which they find out is close to the Chilean coast ([[Hanover Island|Hanover-Island]] located at 50°56’ S, 74°47’ W).

== Publication ==
As with most of Verne's works, it was serialised (in twenty-four parts between January and December 1888) in the "[[Voyages Extraordinaires|Extraordinary Journeys]]" section of the French ''Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation'' by Parisian publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel|Hetzel]]. It was also published in book form in two volumes in June and early November of that year. An illustrated double volume with a colour map and a preface by Verne was released in late November.

=== Translations and adaptations===
* An English translation of the book was serialised in 36 installments in the ''[[Boy's Own Paper]]'' between 1888 and 1889.
* In 1889 a two-volume [[English language|English-language]] book titled ''A Two Year's Vacation'' was published by Munro in the United States. Later the same year, a single-volume abridged edition in the United Kingdom was released by Sampson Low under the title of ''Adrift in the Pacific''.
* In 1890, from February 22 through March 14, the ''Boston Daily Globe'' newspaper serialized ''Adrift in the Pacific; the Strange Adventures of a Schoolboy Crew''.
*In 1964 Turkish Film maker Yilmaz Atadeniz produced this movie titled as Iki Sene Mektep Tatili."
* In 1965 the I. O. Evens version of the Sampson Low translation was published in England (ARCO) and the U.S. (Associated Publishers) in two volumes: ''Adrift in the Pacific'' and ''Second Year Ashore''.

* In 1967 Czech filmmaker [[Karel Zeman]] made a live-action/animated film adaptation under the title ''Ukradená vzducholod'' ("The Stolen Airship", released worldwide&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062412/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt#akas&lt;/ref&gt; as ''[[Two Years' Vacation (film)|Two Years' Vacation]]''), loosely based on Jules Verne's novels ''Two Years' Vacation'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.
* In 1969 an Australian film produced, directed and written by [[Mende Brown]] entitled ''[[Strange Holiday (1970 film)|Strange Holiday]]'' credited Jules Verne for the story.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065040/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1974 four-part T.V. series ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Deux ans de vacances (1974)|fr|3=Deux ans de vacances (mini-série)|lt=Deux ans de vacances}}'' was produced in a cooperation of French, Belgian, Swiss, West-German and Romanian television.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071076/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt#akas&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1982 a Japanese studio [[Toei Animation]] made an anime adaptation under the title of ''Adrift in the Pacific'' ({{lang-ja|十五少年漂流記}}).
* In 1987 a made-for-TV animation was produced by the Japanese studio [[Nippon Animation]] under the title of ''The Story of Fifteen Boys'' ({{lang-ja|十五少年漂流記}}).
* The book became  the story for different anime series like [[Ginga Hyōryū Vifam]], [[Jura Tripper|Kyōryū Bōkenki Jura Tripper]], [[Infinite Ryvius]], and [[Mujin Wakusei Survive]].

== In popular culture ==
''Deux ans de vacances'' is the first book Shiori Shiomiya reads from the shelves of the school library during a flashback to her childhood in the [[anime]] ''[[The World God Only Knows]]''.

The struggles for survival and dominance amongst the boys were to be echoed in [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', written some 66 years later.

The [[Khan Academy]] has been successful in teaching mathematics using notes written using [[Yahoo!]]'s doodle pad with a voiceover by [[Salman Khan (educator)]].
