During his first semester at Calvin, Plantinga was awarded a scholarship to attend [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Self-profile", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the fall of 1950, Plantinga spent two semesters at Harvard. In 1951, during Harvard's spring recess, Plantinga attended a few philosophy classes at Calvin College, and was so impressed with Calvin philosophy professor [[William Harry Jellema]] that he returned in 1951 to study philosophy under him.&lt;ref&gt;"Self-profile", pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Plantinga began his graduate studies at the [[University of Michigan]] where he studied under [[William Alston]], [[William Frankena]], and Richard Cartwright, among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Self-profile", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1955, he transferred to [[Yale University]] where he received his Ph.D. in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"Self-profile", pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching career===
[[File:Alvin Plantinga.jpg|thumb|right|Plantinga at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 2004]]
Plantinga began his career as an instructor in the philosophy department at Yale in 1957, and then in 1958 he became a professor of philosophy at [[Wayne State University]] during its heyday as a major center for analytic philosophy. In 1963, he accepted a teaching job at Calvin College, where he replaced the retiring Jellema.&lt;ref&gt;"Self-profile", p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent the next 19 years at Calvin before moving to the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1982. He retired from the University of Notre Dame in 2010 and returned to Calvin College, where he serves as the first holder of the William Harry Jellema Chair in Philosophy. He has trained many prominent philosophers working in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]] including [[Michael Bergmann (philosopher)|Michael Bergmann]] at Purdue and [[Michael Rea]] at Notre Dame, and [[Trenton Merricks]] working at [[University of Virginia]].

===Awards and honors===
Plantinga served as president of the [[American Philosophical Association]], Western Division, 1981–82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanphilosophy.net/dmap/apa_presidents.htm|title=APA Presidents|accessdate=April 7, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082515/http://americanphilosophy.net/dmap/apa_presidents.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as President of the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]] 1983–86.&lt;ref name="Baker2007profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nnp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/plantinga.html|title=NNP, The Casino News Network|website=nnp.org|accessdate=December 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704080424/http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/plantinga.html|archive-date=July 4, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
Plantinga has argued that some people can know that [[God]] exists as a [[basic belief]], requiring no argument. He developed this argument in two different fashions: firstly, in ''God and Other Minds'' (1967), by drawing an equivalence between the [[teleological argument]] and the common sense view that people have of [[Problem of other minds|other minds]] existing by analogy with their own minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Felder | first1 = D.

Plantinga has also argued that there is no logical inconsistency between the [[problem of evil|existence of evil]] and the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, wholly good God.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Philip L. "Plantinga, Alvin" in Honderich, Ted (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of evil===
{{Main|Plantinga's free will defense}}

Plantinga proposed a "free will defense" in a volume edited by [[Max Black]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will Defense", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; which attempts to refute the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]], the argument that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God.&lt;ref name="BeebeIEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument (in a truncated form) states that "It is possible that God, even being omnipotent, could not create a world with free creatures who never choose evil. Furthermore, it is possible that God, even being omnibenevolent, would desire to create a world which contains evil if moral goodness requires free moral creatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meister|2009|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the argument's handling of [[natural evil]] has been more heavily disputed, and its presupposition of a libertarianist, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will has been seen as problematic as well.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the argument also "conflicts with important theistic doctrines",{{clarify|date=August 2017}} including the notion of [[heaven]] and the idea that God has free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-log/#H10|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. L. Mackie]] sees Plantinga's free-will defense as incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Mackie]] wrote: "[H]ow could there be logically contingent states of affairs, ''prior to the creation and existence of any created beings with free will'', which an omnipotent god would have to accept and put up with? This suggestion is simply incoherent. Indeed, by bringing in the notion of individual essences which determine—presumably non-causally—how Curly Smith, Satan, and the rest of us would choose freely or would act in each hypothetical situation, Plantinga has not rescued the free will defence but made its weaknesses all too clear". Mackie 1982, p. 174.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's well-received book ''God, Freedom and Evil'', written in 1974, gave his response to what he saw as the incomplete and uncritical view of theism's criticism of [[theodicy]]. Plantinga's contribution stated that when the issue of a comprehensive doctrine of freedom is added to the discussion of the goodness of God and the omnipotence of God then it is not possible to exclude the presence of evil in the world after introducing freedom into the discussion. Plantinga's own summary occurs in his discussion titled "Could God Have Created a World Containing Moral Good but No Moral Evil", where he states his conclusion that, "... the price for creating a world in which they produce moral good is creating one in which they also produce moral evil."&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom and Evil'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed epistemology===
{{Main|Reformed epistemology}}

[[File:AlvinPlantinga.JPG|thumb|left|Plantinga giving a lecture on science and religion in 2009]]
Plantinga's contributions to epistemology include an argument which he dubs "Reformed epistemology". According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and due to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called "proper functionalism", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm|Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour|BonJour]], [[William Alston|Alston]], [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Plantinga argues specifically that the theories of what he calls "warrant"-what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a property of a person holding a belief while warrant is a property of a belief)—put forth by these epistemologists have systematically failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second book, ''[[Warrant and Proper Function]]'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.&lt;ref&gt;
Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's "proper function" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's "belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers" are functioning properly—"working the way it ought to work".&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a "design plan", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: "it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans",&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties—is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics—in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;WPF, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.&lt;ref&gt;
Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as "naturalistic", including the "functional generalization" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 199-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the "A/C" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the "Extended A/C" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that specifically Christian theological beliefs including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation etc. Under this model, Christians are justified in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

James Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga's ''Warrant'' trilogy, and specifically of his ''Warranted Christian Belief'', is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so "the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beilby|first1=James|editor1-last=Baker|editor1-first=Deane-Peter|title=Alvin Plantinga|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-67143-4|pages=125–165|chapter=Plantinga's Model of Warranted Christian Belief}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.

===Modal ontological argument===
[[File:AlvinPlantinga.JPG|thumb|Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's ontological arguments and proposed a variation of his own.]]
Plantinga has expressed a [[Ontological argument#Alvin Plantinga|modal logic version of the ontological argument]] in which he uses [[modal logic]] to develop, in a more rigorous and formal way, [[Norman Malcolm]]'s and [[Charles Hartshorne]]'s modal [[Anselm's argument|ontological arguments]].

Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, and offered an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ | title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=April 11, 2010 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2010-04-28|quote=Like any Christian (and indeed any theist), I believe that the world has been created by God, and hence "intelligently designed"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the necessary existence of the greatest possible being, it follows that there is a being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in ''some'' worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.&lt;ref name="Plantinga, Sennett 1998"&gt; {{cite book | title=The analytic theist: an Alvin Plantinga reader | publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing | year=1998  | isbn=978-0-8028-4229-9 | last1=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga | editor-first=James F | editor-last=Sennett | pp=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to resolve this problem, Plantinga differentiated between "greatness" and "excellence". A being's excellence in a particular world depends only on its properties in that world; a being's greatness depends on its properties in all worlds. Therefore, the greatest possible being must have maximal excellence in every possible world. Plantinga then restated Malcolm's argument, using the concept of "maximal greatness". He argued that it is possible for a being with maximal greatness to exist, so a being with maximal greatness exists in a possible world. If this is the case, then a being with maximal greatness exists in every world, and therefore in this world.&lt;ref name="Plantinga, Sennett 1998" /&gt;

The conclusion relies on a form of [[axiom S5|modal axiom S5]], which states that if something is possibly true, then its possibility is necessary (it is possibly true in all worlds). Plantinga's version of S5 suggests that "To say that p is possibly necessarily true is to say that, with regard to one world, it is true at all worlds; but in that case it is true at all worlds, and so it is simply necessary."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veGCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=%22possibly+necessarily+true%22+then+it+is+necessarily+true+plantinga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WNcAVLXSHfLT7Abm8IGoAw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22possibly%20necessarily%20true%22%20then%20it%20is%20necessarily%20true%20plantinga&amp;f=false Marenbon, M., ''Medieval Philosophy: An Historical and Philosophical Introduction'', Routledge, 2006, p. 128.]&lt;/ref&gt; A version of his argument is as follows:&lt;ref name="oppy"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ontological Arguments |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=8 February 1996|work=substantive revision 15 July 2011 |author=Oppy, Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# A being has ''maximal excellence'' in a given possible world ''W'' if and only if it is omnipotent, omniscient and wholly good in ''W''; and
# A being has ''maximal greatness'' if it has maximal excellence in every possible world.
# It is possible that there is a being that has maximal greatness. (Premise)
# Therefore, possibly, it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly good being exists.
# Therefore, (by axiom S5) it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.
# Therefore, an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.

Plantinga argued that, although the first premise is not rationally established, it is not contrary to reason. [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting that the existence of anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Philosophy of religion: an anthology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | author=Martin, Michael | year=2003 | pages=282–293 | isbn=978-0-631-21471-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Christian apologist, [[William Lane Craig]], characterizes Plantinga's argument in a slightly different way:
# It is possible that a maximally great being exists.
# If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world.
# If a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world.
# If a maximally great being exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world.
# If a maximally great being exists in the actual world, then a maximally great being exists.
# Therefore, a maximally great being exists.
According to Craig, premises (2)–(5) are relatively uncontroversial among philosophers, but "the epistemic entertainability of premise (1) (or its denial) does not guarantee its metaphysical possibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Reasonable faith | publisher=Crossway | author=Craig, William Lane | year=2008 |page=185 | isbn=978-1-4335-0115-9|quote=Premises (2)–(5) of this argument are relatively uncontroversial. Most philosophers would agree that if God's existence is even possible, then he must exist. ... the epistemic entertainability of premise (1) (or its denial) does not guarantee its metaphysical possibility.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Richard M. Gale argued that premise three, the "possibility premise", [[begs the question]]. He stated that one only has the epistemic right to accept the premise if one understands the nested [[modal operator]]s, and that if one understands them within the system S5—without which the argument fails—then one understands that "possibly necessarily" is in essence the same as "necessarily".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=On the Nature and Existence of God | first=Richard | last=Gale | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-521-45723-8 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the premise begs the question because the conclusion is embedded within it.
On S5 systems in general, James Garson writes that "the words ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’, have many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/logic-modal Garson, James, ''Modal Logic'', The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Summer 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===
{{Main|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}
In Plantinga's [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], he argues that if evolution is true, it undermines [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. His basic argument is that if evolution and naturalism are both true, human cognitive faculties evolved to produce beliefs that have survival value (maximizing one's success at the four F's: "feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproducing"), not necessarily to produce beliefs that are true. Thus, since human cognitive faculties are tuned to survival rather than truth in the naturalism-evolution model, there is reason to doubt the veracity of the products of those same faculties, including naturalism and evolution themselves. On the other hand, if God created man "[[image of God|in his image]]" by way of an evolutionary process (or any other means), then Plantinga argues our faculties would probably be reliable.

The argument does not assume any necessary correlation (or uncorrelation) between true beliefs and survival. Making the contrary assumption—that there is in fact a relatively strong correlation between truth and survival—if human belief-forming apparatus evolved giving a survival advantage, then it ought to yield truth since true beliefs confer a survival advantage. Plantinga counters that, while there may be overlap between true beliefs and beliefs that contribute to survival, the two kinds of beliefs are not the same, and he gives the following example with a man named Paul:

{{bquote|Perhaps Paul very much ''likes'' the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him. This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief... Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it... Clearly there are any number of belief-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin ''Warrant and Proper Function'', (New York: Oxford University Press), 1993. pp. 225–226 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-507864-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The argument has received favorable notice from [[Thomas Nagel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/09/27/philosopher-defends-religion/|title=A Philosopher Defends Religion|first=Thomas|last=Nagel|date=27 September 2012|publisher=|via=www.nybooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Lane Craig]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/plantingas-evolutionary-argument-against-naturalism |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804113752/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/plantingas-evolutionary-argument-against-naturalism |archive-date=2017-08-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but has also been criticized as seriously flawed, for example by [[Elliott Sober]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=N2h_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT305&amp;lpg=PT305&amp;dq=Although+the+argument+has+been+criticized+by+some+philosophers,+like+Elliott+Sober&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3gXG5dwzeg&amp;sig=ZMTWav7g2qzvfnXI942buv4SZ5w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-0NK_mN7YAhVKTLwKHX-6CYYQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Although%20the%20argument%20has%20been%20criticized%20by%20some%20philosophers,%20like%20Elliott%20Sober&amp;f=false|title=Twentieth-Century Philosophy of Religion: The History of Western Philosophy of Religion|last=Oppy|first=Graham|last2=Trakakis|first2=N.

===View on naturalism and evolution===
Even though Alvin Plantinga believes that God could have used Darwinian processes to create the world, he stands firm against philosophical [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He said in an interview on the [[relationship between science and religion]] that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion and science share more common ground than you might think, though science can't prove, it presupposes that there has been a past for example, science does not cover the whole of the knowledge enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/29/145108456/exploring-the-real-conflict-science-vs-naturalism|title=Exploring The Real 'Conflict': Science Vs.

&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the editor, Plantinga made the following response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Like any Christian (and indeed any theist), I believe that the world has been created by God, and hence "intelligently designed". The hallmark of intelligent design, however, is the claim that this can be shown scientifically; I'm dubious about that.

...As far as I can see, God certainly could have used Darwinian processes to create the living world and direct it as he wanted to go; hence evolution as such does not imply that there is no direction in the history of life. What does have that implication is not evolutionary theory itself, but ''unguided'' evolution, the idea that neither God nor any other person has taken a hand in guiding, directing or orchestrating the course of evolution. But the scientific theory of evolution, sensibly enough, says nothing one way or the other about divine guidance. It doesn't say that evolution is divinely guided; it also doesn't say that it isn't. Like almost any theist, I reject unguided evolution; but the contemporary scientific theory of evolution just as such—apart from philosophical or theological add-ons—doesn't say that evolution is unguided. Like science in general, it makes no pronouncements on the existence or activity of God.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Apophantic''' ({{lang-el|ἀποφαντικός}}, "declaratory", from ἀποφαίνειν ''apophainein'', "to show, to make known") is a term [[Aristotle]] coined to mean a specific type of declaratory statement that can determine the truth or falsity of a [[logical proposition]] or phenomenon. It was adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] as part of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defines it as "the logic of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, [http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm5.html "One Dimensional Man: Part II, Chapter 5"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence "All [[penguins]] are [[birds]]," and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence "All [[bachelors]] are unhappy." In the first proposition, the subject is ''penguins'' and the predicate is ''birds'', and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should [[Logical truth|necessarily]] be put. In the second proposition, the subject is ''bachelors'' and the predicate is ''unhappy''.  This is a subjective, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies "All penguins are birds" as more truthful than "All bachelors are unhappy." One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted.

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that apophantic judgements are the most reliable means of obtaining truth, as they do not rely upon subjective comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.

The concept appears in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition as ''jâzim'', or 'truth-apt'.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/arabic-islamic-language/ "Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10577">In [[science studies]], '''boundary-work''' comprises instances in which boundaries, demarcations, or other divisions between fields of knowledge are created, advocated, attacked, or reinforced. Academic scholarship on boundary-work{{which|date=August 2013}} has emphasized that such delineations often have high stakes involved for the participants, and carries with it the implication that such boundaries are flexible and [[social construction|socially constructed]].

== Thomas F. Gieryn ==
The original use of the term "boundary-work" for these sorts of issues has been attributed to [[Thomas F. Gieryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gieryn|first1=Thomas F.|title=Cultural Boundaries of Science|date=1999|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-29262-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sociology|sociologist]], who initially used it to discuss the [[problem of demarcation]], the philosophical difficulty of coming up with a rigorous delineation between what is "science" and what is "[[non-science]]".&lt;ref&gt;In 1999 Gieryn (1999a, p.5) stated that the “boundary” concept he introduced in his 1983 paper had been suggested by a presentation by [[Steve Woolgar]] to a meeting of the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]] in November 1981. He attributed the mature development of his ideas to the influences of (in order of publication) Geertz (1973), Serres, (1982), Geertz (1983), Gilbert and Mulkay (1984), Shapin and Schaffer (1985), Yearley (1988), Holmquest (1990), Reichert (1992), Abbot (1995), Silber (1995), McOmber (1996), Taylor (1996), Kerr, Cunningham-Burley, and Amos (1997), and Wolfe (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gieryn defined boundary-work as the "attribution of selected characteristics to [an] institution of science (i.e., to its practitioners, methods, stock of knowledge, values and work organization) for purposes of constructing a social boundary that distinguishes some intellectual activities as [outside that boundary]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gieryn|first1=Thomas|title=Boundary-work and the demarcation of science from non-science: Strains and interests in professional ideologies of scientists|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1983|volume=48|issue=6|pages=781–795|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~sskiles/boundaries/Gieryn%201983.pdf|doi=10.2307/2095325|jstor=2095325}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophy of science|Philosophers]] and [[sociology of science|sociologists of science]], such as [[Karl Popper]] and [[Robert K. Merton]], long struggled to come up with a criterion which would distinguish science as unique from other knowledge-generating activities, but never were able to come up with one that was stable, transhistorical, or worked reliably.

Gieryn's 1983 paper on boundary-work and demarcation emphasized that the very discussions of demarcation between science and non-science were "ideological"; that there were strong stakes for scientists to erect such boundaries both in arguing for their own [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and the need for [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Gieryn looked specifically at instances of boundary-work in 19th-century Britain, in which scientists attempted to characterize the [[relationship between religion and science]] as one of sharp distinction,&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, Gieryn, T.F., "John Tyndall's Double Boundary-Work: Science, Religion, and Mechanics in Victorian England", pp.37-64 in Gieryn, T.F., ''Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line'', University of Chicago Press, (Chicago), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and also looked at instances in which scientists attempted to argue that science and politics and/or ideology were inherently separate as well. Many other works{{which|date=August 2013}} by sociologists and historians have since looked at boundary-work in many other situations, usually focusing on the [[rhetoric]] of scientists (or their opponents) and their interpersonal and intersocial interactions.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Studies in boundary-work have also focused on how individual scientific disciplines are created.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Yeates (2013, esp. pp.93-101, and 309-349) for an account of the extended boundary-work performed by [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] in relation to the creation of the domain of hypnotism.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] on the "scientific field", many have looked at ways in which certain "objects" are able to bridge the erected boundaries because they satisfy the needs of multiple social groups ([[boundary object]]s).

==Examples==
An example of such boundary-work can be found in the study of science and literature. One instance of these studies is [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book [[Literature and Science]] (see also Edward M. Jennings's (Ed.)1970 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OtFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 Science and Literature: New Lenses for Criticism]'', [[Anchor Books]] and Harry Raphael Garvin and James M. Heath's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PUlhiPtQxJgC Science and Literature]'', [[Bucknell University Press]])

Another example of boundary-work occurred when individual scientists and scientific institutions published statements responding to the allegations of scientific fraud during the "Climategate" episode ([http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09505431.2015.1041902 Ramírez-i-Ollé, 2015]).

'''Buddhism in Japan''' has been practiced since its official introduction in 552 CE according to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowring, Richard John |title=The religious traditions of Japan, 500–1600 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages=16–17 |isbn=0-521-85119-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Baekje]], [[Korea]], by Buddhist monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowring, Richard John |title=The religious traditions of Japan, 500–1600 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages=15–17 |isbn=0-521-85119-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sources of Japanese tradition"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dykstra, Yoshiko Kurata |author2=De Bary, William Theodore |title=Sources of Japanese tradition |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=100 |isbn=0-231-12138-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] has had a major influence on the development of Japanese society and remains an influential aspect of the culture to this day.&lt;ref name="Asia Society"&gt;Asia Society [http://asiasociety.org/countries/religions-philosophies/buddhism-japan Buddhism in Japan], accessed July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, Japan's most popular schools of Buddhism are [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]], [[Shingon Buddhism]] and [[Zen]]. As of 2008, [[religion in Japan#Demographics|approximately 34%]] of the Japanese identify as Buddhists and the number has been growing since the 1980s, in terms of membership in organized religion. However, in terms of practice, 75% practice some form of Buddhism (compared with 90% practicing [[Shinto]], thus most Japanese practice both religions to some extent ([[Shinbutsu-shūgō]])).&lt;ref&gt;[Japan, Destination Detectives, Jen Green, Capstone Classroom, 2006, p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of the Japanese have a [[Butsudan]] (Buddhist shrine) in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[Japanese Saints: Mormons in the Land of the Rising Sun, John Patrick Hoffmann, Lexington Books, 2007 p. 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Japanese Buddhism==
===Arrival of Buddhism in China along the Silk Road===
{{main article|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
The arrival of [[Buddhism]] in [[China]] is ultimately a consequence of the first contacts between [[China]] and Central Asia, where Buddhism had spread from the Indian subcontinent. These contacts occurred with the opening of the [[Silk Road]] in the 2nd century BCE, following the travels of [[Zhang Qian]] between 138 and 126 BCE. These contacts culminated with the official introduction of Buddhism in China in 67 CE. Historians generally agree that by the middle of the 1st century, the religion had penetrated to areas north of the [[Huai River]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20100314x2.html Buddhism's arrival, Shinto's endurance]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 14, 2010, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kofun period (250 to 538)===
[[File:Kamakura Budda Daibutsu front 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Daibutsu]], [[Kamakura]].]]
According to the ''[[Book of Liang]]'', which was written in 635, five [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] from [[Gandhara]] traveled to Japan in 467. At the time, they referred to Japan as [[Fusang]] ({{cjkv|c=扶桑|r=Fusō}}), the name of a mythological country to the extreme east beyond the sea:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leland | first=Charles G. |title=Fusang Or the Discovery of America by Chinese Buddhist Priests in the Fifth Century |publisher=iblioBazaar, LLC |location= |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-1-110-85078-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Fusang is located to the east of China, 20,000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' (1,500 kilometers) east of the state of ''Da Han'' [大漢, "China"] (itself east of the state of ''Wa'' in modern Kansai region, Japan). (...) In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of [[Emperor Ming of Liu Song|Da Ming]] of the Song Dynasty (467), five monks from Kipin [Kabul region of Gandhara] travelled by ship to Fusang. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a result the customs of Fusang changed.

===Asuka Period (538 to 710) and Nara Period (710–794)===
[[File:Yakushiji Nara11s5bs4200.jpg|thumb|200px|Pagoda of [[Yakushi-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (730)]]
{{main article|Nanto Rokushū}}
Although there are records of Buddhist monks from China coming to Japan before the Asuka Period, the "official" introduction of Buddhism to Japan is dated to 552 in ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowring, Richard John |title=The religious traditions of Japan, 500–1600 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages=16–17 |isbn=0-521-85119-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when King [[Seong of Baekje]] (聖明王, now western Korea) sent a mission to the [[Emperor Kinmei]] that included Buddhist monks or [[bhikkhuni|nuns]] together with an image of Buddha and a number of [[sutra]]s to introduce Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Sources of Japanese tradition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowring, Richard John |title=The religious traditions of Japan, 500–1600 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages=15–17 |isbn=0-521-85119-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful [[Soga clan]] played a key role in the early spread of Buddhism in the country. Initial uptake of the new faith was slow, and Buddhism only started to spread some years later when [[Empress Suiko]] openly encouraged the acceptance of Buddhism among all Japanese people.

According to legend, in Japan in 552, there was an attempt to destroy a tooth relic, one of the first of Buddha’s to arrive in the country; it was hit by a hammer into an anvil; the hammer and anvil were destroyed but the tooth was not.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Strong|first=John S.|authorlink=John S. Strong|title=Relics of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&amp;pg=PA133|year=2007|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe|isbn=978-81-208-3139-1}}, page 192&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 593, Soga no Umako ordered relics of Buddha deposited inside the foundation stone under the pillar of a pagoda at [[Asuka-dera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aston, W. G. |title=Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |location=New York |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-1-60520-146-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 607, in order to obtain copies of sutras, an imperial envoy was dispatched to [[Sui dynasty|Sui China]]. As time progressed and the number of Buddhist clergy increased, the offices of ''Sōjō'' (archbishop) and ''Sōzu'' (bishop) were created. By 627, there were 46 Buddhist temples, 816 Buddhist priests, and 569 Buddhist nuns in Japan.

====Six sects====
The initial period saw the six great Chinese schools, called {{nihongo|Nanto Rokushū|南都六宗|lit. the Six Nara Sects}} in Japanese were introduced to the [[Japanese archipelago]]:
# ''[[Risshū (Buddhism)|Ritsu]]'' ([[Vinaya]]-focused [[Nikaya Buddhism]])
# ''Jōjitsu'' ([[Tattvasiddhi]], a sect of Nikaya Buddhism)
# ''[[Kusha-shū]]'' ([[Abhidharma]]-focused Nikaya Buddhism)
# ''Sanronshū'' ([[East Asian Mādhyamaka]])
# ''Hossō'' ([[East Asian Yogācāra]])
# ''[[Kegon]]'' ([[Huayan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Powers| first = John| title = Japanese Buddhism| encyclopedia = A Concise Encyclopedia of Buddhism| volume = 1| pages = 103–107| publisher = Oneworld Publications| location = Oxford| year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These schools were centered around the ancient capitals of [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], where great temples such as the [[Asuka-dera]] and [[Tōdai-ji]] were erected respectively. These were not exclusive schools, and temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of the schools. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as "study groups". The Buddhism of these periods, known as the [[Asuka period]] and [[Nara period]] – was not a practical religion, being more the domain of learned priests whose official function was to pray for the peace and prosperity of the state and imperial house. This kind of Buddhism had little to offer to the illiterate and uneducated masses and led to the growth of "people’s priests" who were not ordained and had no formal Buddhist training. Their practice was a combination of Buddhist and [[Taoism|Daoist]] elements and the incorporation of [[shamanism|shamanistic]] features of indigenous practices. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism towards the sophisticated academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital.

====Tangmi====
The Late Nara period saw the introduction of [[Tangmi]] ([[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]], Japanese ''mikkyō'') to Japan from China by [[Kūkai]] and [[Saichō]], who founded [[Shingon Buddhism]] and the [[Tendai]] school, respectively.

===Heian Period (794 to 1185)===
[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Byōdō-in]] (Pure Land sect), located in [[Uji, Kyoto]]]]
During the Heian period the capital was shifted from Nara to Kyoto. Monasteries became centers of powers, even establishing armies of [[Sōhei]], warrior-monks.{{sfn|Snelling|187|p=178}}

Shinto and Buddhism became the dominant religions, maintaining a balance until the Meiji-restoration.{{sfn|Snelling|187|p=178}}

===Kamakura Period (1185–1333)===
The [[Kamakura period]] was a period of crisis in which the control of the country moved from the imperial aristocracy to the [[samurai]]. In 1185 the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at [[Kamakura]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=181}}

This period saw the introduction of the two schools that had perhaps the greatest impact on the country: the schools of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], promulgated by evangelists such as [[Genshin]] and articulated by monks such as [[Hōnen]], which emphasize salvation through faith in [[Amitābha]] and remain the largest Buddhist sect in Japan (and throughout Asia); and [[Zen]], promulgated by monks such as [[Eisai]] and [[Dōgen]], which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation, which were equally rapidly adopted by the upper classes and had a profound impact on the [[culture of Japan]].

Additionally, it was during the Kamakura period that the influential monk [[Nichiren]] began teaching devotion to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''. Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Cantwell and Hiroko Kawanami, "Buddhism." Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third Edition. Edited by Linda Woodhead, Christopher Partridge, and Hiroko Kawanami. Routledge, 2016, Location 2254 in Kindle Cloud reader edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muromachi Period (or Ashikaga) (1336–1573)===
[[File:Kinkaku-ji.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Kinkaku-ji]], the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, [[Shōkoku-ji]] sect of the Rinzai school, located in [[Kyoto]]. It was built in [[Muromachi period]].]]
{{See also|Higashiyama period}}
In the [[Muromachi period]], Zen, particularly the [[Rinzai school]], obtained the help of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] and the [[Emperor of Japan]], and accomplished considerable development.

===Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1573–1600) and Edo Period (or Tokugawa)(1600–1868)===
After the [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] period of war, Japan was re-united in the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. This decreased the power of Buddhism, which had become a strong political and military force in Japan. Neo-Confucianism and Shinto gained influence at the expense of Buddhism, which came under strict state control.&lt;ref name="Buddhanet"&gt;Japan Buddhist Federation, Buddhanet [http://www.buddhanet.net/nippon/nippon_partI.html "A Brief History of Buddhism in Japan", accessed 30/4/2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan closed itself off to the rest of the world. The only traders to be allowed were Dutchmen admitted to the island of [[Dejima]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987}}

New doctrines and methods were not to be introduced, nor were new temples and schools. The only exception was the [[Ōbaku]] lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the [[Edo period]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the [[Linji school]], the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people]], his teachings were seen as a separate school. The Ōbaku school was named after [[Mount Huangbo]] ({{cjkv|c=黄檗山|p=Huángbò shān|r=Ōbaku san}}), which had been Ingen's home in China. Also notable during the period was the publication of an exceptionally high quality reprint of the Ming-era ''[[Tripiṭaka]]'' by [[Tetsugen Doko]], a renowned master of the Ōbaku school.&lt;ref name="Buddhanet"/&gt;

===Meiji Restoration (1868–1912)===
With the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the new government adopted a strong anti-Buddhist attitude, and [[Haibutsu kishaku|a movement to eradicate Buddhism]] and bring Shinto to ascendancy arose throughout the country due to the strong connections of Buddhism to the Shōguns.

During the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), after a coup in 1868, Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism.  Shinto became the state religion. Within the Buddhist establishment the Western world was seen as a threat as well as a challenge to stand up to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McMahan|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Victoria, Brian Daizen 2006"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Victoria|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist institutions had a simple choice: adapt or perish. Rinzai and Soto Zen chose to adapt, trying to modernize Zen in accord with Western insights, while simultaneously maintaining a Japanese identity. Other schools, and Buddhism in general, simply saw their influence wane.
The edict of April 1872 ended the status of the Buddhist precepts as state law and allowed monks to marry and to eat meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaffe |first1=Richard |title=Meiji Religious Policy, Soto Zen and the Clerical Marriage Problem |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |date=1998 |volume=24 |issue=1-2 |page=46 |url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2645 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119103916/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2645 |archivedate=November 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "codification of a secularized lifestyle for the monk coupled with the revival of the emperor system and development of State Shinto were fundamental in desacralizing Buddhism and pushing it to the margins of society".&lt;ref&gt;Yoshiharu Tomatsu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927065314/http://www.inebnetwork.org/thinksangha/tsangha/tomatsusec.html The Secularization of Japanese Buddhism]: "The Priest as Profane Practitioner of the Sacred". Presented at the American Academy of Religion, Philadelphia, U.S.A., November 16, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese Imperialism (1931–1945)===
{{See also|Buddhism and violence|Criticism of Buddhism#War and violence|Ahimsa#Buddhism|Noble Eightfold Path}}
Japanese identity was being articulated in [[Nihonjinron]], the "Japanese uniqueness theory". A broad range of subjects was taken as typical of Japanese culture. [[D. T. Suzuki]] contributed to the Nihonjinron by taking Zen as the distinctive token of Asian spirituality, showing its unique character in the Japanese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nichirenism]] was one particular expression of Japanese Buddhist nationalism.

During [[World War II]], almost all Buddhists temples strongly supported Japan's militarization.&lt;ref&gt;Gier, Nicholas, F.

In contrast, a few individuals such as Ichikawa Haku,&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Christopher (2009).

Post World War II, there was a high demand for Buddhist priests who glorified fallen soldiers, and gave funerals and posthumous names, causing a strong revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Onishi|first=Norimitsu|title=In Japan, Buddhism May Be Dying Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/world/asia/14japan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} However, due to [[secularization]] and the growth of [[materialism]], Buddhism and religion in general continued to decline.{{Request quotation|date=October 2013}}

===Post-war (1945–present)===
Japan has seen a growth in post war movements of lay believers of Buddhism{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and a decline in traditional Buddhism in the 20th century, with roughly 100 Buddhist organizations disappearing every year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131113103338/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/world/asia/14japan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp; In Japan, Buddhism, long the religion of funerals, may itself be dying out] by [[Norimitsu Onishi]], ''[[International Herald Tribune]], 14 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications|title=Japan Statistical Yearbook 2014|year=2013|publisher=Nihon Tōkei Kyōkai|location=Tōkyō|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/data/nenkan/index2.htm|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008 [[religion in Japan#Demographics|approximately 34%]] of the Japanese identify as "Buddhists" and the number has been growing since the 1980s, as Buddhists were 27% in 1984.

Still, around 90% of Japanese funerals are conducted according to Buddhist rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traditionscustoms.com/death-rites/japanese-funeral|title=Japanese funeral|work=traditionscustoms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1963 Tamamuro Taijo coined the term ''Funeral Buddhism'' that came to be used to describe traditional Buddhism in Japan as the religion engaged in funerary rites and removed from the spiritual needs of people".&lt;ref&gt;Nika Efanova (2013), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131016085339/http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/14904/35435/1/BA_Thesis_Nika_Efanova.pdf Funeral Buddhism: A Religion in Crisis], B.A. Thesis, University of Iceland, School of Humanities, Japanese Language and Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the ritualistic practice of traditional Buddhism, a revived modern form of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] led by lay believers [[Soka Gakkai]] "...grew rapidly in the chaos of post war Japan&lt;ref name="American Cultures p. 61"/&gt; from about 3000 members in 1951 to over 8 million members" in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/soka-gakkai.htm|title=A Sect's Political Rise Creates Uneasiness in Japan|work=kenyon.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has established schools, colleges and a university, as well as cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soka.ac.jp/en/index.html|title=SOKA UNIVERSITY - Discover your potential 自分力の発見|work=soka.ac.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study about the reason for the growth in lay believers and increased engagement in society attributes the cause to [[Nichiren]] teachings of 'social responsibility':  "In the tradition of Nichiren Buddhism, however, we find the [[Lotus Sutra]] linked to a view of social responsibility that is distinctive".&lt;ref&gt;When Disobedience is Filial, Dr. J.

==Japanese Buddhist schools==
["East Asian Buddhism is very diverse in its teachings and monastic practices, and Japanese Buddhism, in particular, represents almost every strand of Buddhist teachings and practices. However, in comparison to Chinese or Korean Buddhist schools that are generally more united and less sectarian in their groupings, Buddhist denominations in Japan have developed into independent sects with autonomous organizations that have differing emphases on the doctrine and separate lay followings." (Authors: Kawananami, Partridg, and Woodhead  page 82.)]In the post-Meiji, pre-WWII period, there were officially 13 schools and 56 branches ([[:ja:十三宗五十六派]]) of traditional Buddhism (i.e., those not established in modern times). The official schools included three from the Nara period, two from the Heian period (Tendai and Shingon), four Pure Land schools, three Zen schools (Rinzai, Sōtō and Ōbaku), and Nichiren. During the war, this was halved to 28 branches, but the law enforcing this was repealed following the end of the war, allowing former branches to return. Further, since then, many groups have split off from existing branches.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===The Six Nara Schools===
{{main article|Nanto Rokushū}}

====Jōjitsu====
625: Introduced into Japan.
The {{Nihongo|[[Tattvasiddhi]] school|成實宗|Jōjitsu-shū}}{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=547}} (formerly known as the *''Sātyasiddhi'') is considered to be an offshoot of the [[Bahuśrutīya]], an Indian [[Sautrāntika]] school of [[Nikaya Buddhism]]; however, the ''Tattvasiddhi''{{'}}s position was also close to that of the [[Sthavira nikāya]]. They were distinguished by a rejection of [[abhidharma]] as not being the words of the Buddha. It was introduced to Japan as [[Buddhism in Japan#J.C5.8Djitsu|Jōjitsu]] in 625 by the monk Ekwan of [[Goryeo]]. In Japan, it was classified as one of the three approaches of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]] instead of a separate lineage.{{sfn|Takakusu|2002|p=76}} {{nihongo|East Asian Mādhyamaka|三論宗|Sanron-shū}} was one of the {{nihongo|[[Buddhism in Japan#The Six Nara Schools|six Nara sects]]|南都六宗|Nanto Rokushū}}.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=547}}

[[File:NaraTempleTiles.JPG|thumb|Temple tiles from the [[Nara period]], 7th century, [[Tokyo National Museum]].]]

====Hossō====
654: [[Dōshō]] introduces {{nihongo|East Asian Yogācāra|法相宗|Hossō}}. Yogācāra is based on an early Indian philosophy by masters such as [[Vasubandhu]]. Practices of this lineage are also known as "consciousness-only" since they teach that all phenomena are phenomena of the mind. The East Asian Yogācāra school of Buddhism was founded by [[Xuanzang]] (玄奘, Jp. ''Genjō'') in China c. 630 and introduced to Japan in 654 by Dōshō, who had travelled to China to study under him.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin&gt;Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter, Zen Buddhism : a History: Japan, p5. World Wisdom, Inc, September 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The {{nihongo|''[[Cheng Weishi Lun|Discourse on the Theory of Consciousness-Only]]''|成唯識論|Jōyuishiki-ron}} is an important text for the Hossō school.

====Sanron====
This school was transmitted to Japan in the 7th century.
Literally: ''Three-Discourse School''; a [[Madhyamaka]] school which developed in China based on two discourses by [[Nagarjuna]] and one by [[Aryadeva]]. Madhyamaka is one of the two most important [[Mahayana]] philosophies, and reemphasizes the original Buddhist teachings that phenomena are neither truly existent or absolutely non-existent, but are characterized by impermanence and insubstantiality.

====Kegon====
[[File:Todaiji18s3200.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Tōdai-ji]], the head temple of the Kegon school]]
736: [[Bodhisena]] introduces the Kegon (Huayan or Avataṃsaka) school to Japan. The Kegon school was founded by {{nihongo|[[Dushun]]|杜順|Dojun}} c. 600 and was introduced to Japan by the Indian monk [[Bodhisena]] in 736. The ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' (''Kegon-kyō'' 華厳経) is the central text for the Kegon school. The ''[[Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki]]'' is an early Japanese annotation of this sūtra.

====Risshū====
753: [[Jianzhen]]  ({{zh|c=鑑真}}) introduces the [[Risshū (Buddhism)|Risshū]] (Ritsu or [[vinaya]] school) to Japan.
Founded by [[Daoxuan]] (道宣, Jp. ''Dosen''), China, c. 650 &lt;br /&gt;
First Introduction to Japan: Jianzhen, 753. The Ritsu school specialized in the Vinaya (the monastic rules in the Tripitaka). They used the Dharmagupta version of the vinaya which is known in Japanese as ''Shibunritsu'' (四分律)

====Kusha-shū====
The {{nihongo|Kusha-shū|{{linktext|倶|舎|宗}}}} was one of the six schools of Buddhism introduced to Japan during the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=574}} Along with the {{nihongo|[[Tattvasiddhi]] school| |Jōjitsu-shū}} and the [[Risshū (Buddhism)|Risshū]], it is a school of [[Nikaya Buddhism]], which is sometimes derisively known to [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] as "the [[Hinayana]]".

A [[Sarvastivada]] school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325472/Kusha|title=Kusha|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kusha-shū focussed on [[abhidharma]] analysis based on the {{nihongo|"Commentary on the ''[[Abhidharmakośakārikā|Abhidharmakośabhaṣya]]''"|倶舎論}} by the fourth-century [[Gandhara]]n philosopher [[Vasubandhu]]. The school takes its name from that authoritative text.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=574}}

===Esoteric Schools===
====Tendai====
807: [[Saichō]] introduces the [[Tendai]] ([[Tiantai]]) school to Japan.
Known as [[Tiantai]] (天台) in China, the Tendai school was founded by [[Zhiyi]] (智顗, Jp ''Chigi'') in China, c. 550. In 804 [[Saichō]] (最澄) traveled to China to study at the Tiantai teachings, at Mount Tiantai. However, before his return he also studied, and was initiated into, the practice of the Vajrayana, with emphasis on the Mahavairocana Sutra. The primary text of Tiantai is Lotus Sutra (''Hokke-kyō'' 法華経), but when Saichō established his school in Japan he incorporated the study and practice of Vajrayana as well. Although the studies of the Lotus Sutra and Mahayana Nirvana Sutra where also very vital to the schools as well.  These schools developed in the Middle Ages and where influenced by the Tientai, Chinese schools of the sixth century.

====Shingon Buddhism====
816: [[Kūkai]] founds {{Nihongo|[[Shingon Buddhism]]|真言宗|Shingon-shū}}. One of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan today and one of the few surviving [[Vajrayana]] lineages in East Asia, it originally spread from India to China through traveling monks such as [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]]. Known in Chinese as the [[Tangmi]], these esoteric teachings would flourish in Japan under the auspices of a [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] named {{nihongo|[[Kūkai]]|空海}}, who traveled to [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] in 804 as part of the same expedition as Saichō. In the capital he studied Tangmi and [[Sanskrit]] and received initiation from [[Huiguo]]. On returning to Japan, Kūkai eventually managed to establish Shingon as a school in its own right. Kūkai received two lineages of teaching—one based on the {{nihongo|''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''|大日経|Dainichikyō}} and the other based on the {{nihongo|''[[Vajrasekhara Sutra]]''|金剛頂経|Kongōchōkyō}}.

The word "Shingon" is the [[Kan-on|Japanese pronunciation of]] ''Zhēnyán'' "True Words",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zhēnyán|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3424503431/zhenyan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit word "[[mantra]]".&lt;ref name="Kiyota 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiyota |first=Minoru |title=Shingon Mikkyō's Twofold Maṇḍala: Paradoxes and Integration |journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |year=1987 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=91–92 |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8710/2617 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125214858/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8710/2617 |archivedate=January 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's Nichiren Buddhism is represented by traditional-oriented schools such as [[Honmon Butsuryū-shū]], [[Nichiren-shū]] and [[Nichiren Shōshū]] and more recent movements like the [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Risshō Kōsei Kai]], [[Reiyūkai]] and [[Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga]].

==Cultural influence==
Japanese culture maintained an uneasy relation to Buddhist culture. While the Chinese culture was admired, Buddhism was also regarded as a strange influence.

===Societal influence===
During the Kamakura (1185–1333) and Muromachi (1336–1573) Buddhism, or the Buddhist institutions, had a great influence on Japanese society. Buddhist institutions were used by the shogunate to control the country. During the Edo (1600–1868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the Meiji-restoration (1868–1912).{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the [[Danka system|Danka]] or ''terauke'' system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (''terauke''), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control.

===Artistic influence===
[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God.&lt;br/&gt;
Left: Greek wind god from [[Hadda, Afghanistan]], second century.&lt;br /&gt;
Middle: wind god from [[Kizil Caves]], [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century.&lt;br /&gt;
Right: Japanese wind god [[Fūjin]], 17th century.]]
In Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the [[Asuka period]] (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].

Buddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: "Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)}}

====Deities====
[[File:Heracles-Shukongoshin.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution from the Greek god [[Heracles]] to the Japanese god Shukongōshin. From left to right:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Heracles (Louvre Museum).&lt;br /&gt;
2) Heracles on coin of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]].&lt;br /&gt;
3) [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, depicted as Heracles in the Greco-Buddhist art of [[Gandhara]].&lt;br /&gt;
4) [[Nio|Shukongōshin]], manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of Buddhist temples in Japan.]]
Various other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking being that of the Japanese wind god [[Fūjin]]. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or "wind bag" in the same general attitude.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|&gt;Katusmi Tanabe: "The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)}} The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

Another Buddhist deity, Shukongōshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the [[Silk Road]]. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: "The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]])." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)}}

====Artistic motifs====
[[File:NaraVines&amp;Grapes.JPG|thumb|200px|Vine and grape scrolls from Nara, 7th century.]]
The artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].}}

===Temples===
{{main article|List of National Treasures of Japan (temples)}}
[[Soga no Umako]] built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as [[Asuka-dera]] for [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early [[Shinto shrine]]s, early [[Buddhist temple]]s were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early [[Heian period]] (9th–10th century) saw an evolution of style based on the [[mikkyō]] sects Tendai and [[Shingon Buddhism]]. The [[Daibutsuyō]] style and the [[Zenshūyō]] style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.

==Buddhist holidays==

===Obon (お盆)===
Although its date and practices vary region to region, the [[Bon Festival]] is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities. It is believed that the spirits of the dead return to earth for three days and visit the family shrines or graves. It is customary to clean the graves and to hold [[family reunion]]s.

'''''Catuṣkoṭi''''' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Devanagari]]: चतुष्कोटि, {{bo|t=མུ་བཞི|w=mu bzhi}}) is a logical argument(s) of a 'suite of four discrete functions' or 'an indivisible quaternity' that has multiple applications and has been important in the [[Dharmic traditions]] of [[Indian logic]], the [[Buddhist logic|Buddhist logico-epistemological traditions]], particularly those of the [[Madhyamaka]] school, and in the skeptical Greek philosophy of [[Pyrrhonism]].

In particular, the catuṣkoṭi is a "four-cornered" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, ''P'':
# ''P''; that is, being.
# not&amp;nbsp;''P''; that is, not being.
# ''P'' and not&amp;nbsp;''P''; that is, being and not being.
# not (''P'' or not&amp;nbsp;''P''); that is, neither being nor not being.

These four statements hold the following properties: (1) each alternative is mutually exclusive (that is, one of, but no more than one of, the four statements is true) and (2) that all the alternatives are together exhaustive (that is, at least one of them must necessarily be true).{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1967}} This system of logic not only provides a novel method of classifying propositions into logical alternatives, but also because it does so in such a manner that the alternatives are not dependent on the number of truth-values assumed in the system of logic.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1967}}

'''P''' stands for any proposition and '''Not-P''' stands for the diametrical opposite or the contradiction of '''P''' (in a relationship of contradistinction); '''P''' and '''Not-P''' constitute a complementary bifurcation of mutual exclusivity, collectively constituting an exhaustive set of positions for any given (or determined) propositional array. A propositional array is signified in the model by numerals, traditionally though, propositional arrays were designated 'foot' (Sanskrit: pāda), a lexical item which holds the [[semantic field]]: 'line', 'one quartile of śloka'; where '[[śloka]]' (Sanskrit) holds the semantic field:  'verse', 'stanza'.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, Sujit (1999).

The eight arrays or octaves of the iconographic [[Dharmacakra]] represent [[View (Buddhism)|drishti]] or traditional views that [[Shakyamuni]] countered. These eight arrays may be [[Plot (graphics)|plotted]] as [[coordinates]] on a multidimensional field which may be rendered as a [[sphere]], a [[mandala]], a multidimensional shunya or zero where shunyata denotes zero-ness. The eight arrays are in a [[:wikt:concordance|concordant]] relationship where they each constitute a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] to the sphere. The coordinates are [[equidistant]] from the [[epicentre]] of shunya where the array of the positive configuration (or hemisphere) and the array of the negative configuration (or hemisphere) constitute two polar [[radii]] or diametrical complements, a [[diameter]] in sum. These are the 'eight limits' (Wylie: mtha' brgyad; Sanskrit: aṣṭānta) of 'openness' (Sanskrit: śūnyatā),&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), &amp; translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991).

# P is true    ``1 P is not true or Not P is true 
# Not P is true  ``2.  Not (Not P) is true i.e. P is true 
# Both P and Not P are true i.e. the universal set `` 3 Neither P nor not P are true i.e. it is a null set 
# Neither P nor not P are true it is a null set `` 4. Not (neither p nor not P are true ) = both P and not P are true which is the universal set/ Thus, we can see that there are only 4 alternatives available and the negative alternatives are mere rewritten alternatives. 
In other words, it makes no difference whether you are working with positive configuration or negative configuration.

More over, if you replace p with not P, then the positive configuration set for not P will be the same as negative configuration of P.

==Exegesis==
Puhakka (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;134-145) charts the stylized reification process of a human [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]], the spell of reality,&lt;ref&gt;'Reality' in this context is not the [[Dharmakaya]], but [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], a common cultural meme within [[Dharmic Traditions]]. Refer: [[Reality in Buddhism]].&lt;/ref&gt; a spell dispelled by the Catuṣkoṭi: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are typically not aware of ourselves as taking something (P) as real. Rather, its reality "takes us," or already has us in its spell as soon as we become aware of its identity (P). Furthermore, it's impossible to take something (P) to be real without, at least momentarily, ignoring or denying that which it is not (not-P). Thus the act of taking something as real necessarily involves some degree of unconsciousness or lack of awareness. This is true even in the simple act of perception when we see a figure that we become aware of as "something." As the German gestalt psychologists demonstrated, for each figure perceived, there is a background of which we remain relatively unaware. We can extend this to texts or spoken communications. For every text we understand there is a context we are not fully cognizant of. Thus, with every figure noticed or reality affirmed, there is, inevitably, unawareness. Is this how a spell works? It takes us unawares.&lt;ref&gt;Puhakka, Kaisa (2003). 'Awakening from the Spell of Reality: Lessons from Nāgārjuna' within: Segall, Seth Robert (2003). ''Encountering Buddhism: Western Psychology and Buddhist Teachings''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-5736-2}}.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
The Catuṣkoṭi in Western Discourse has often been glossed [[Tetralemma]], which is the nomenclature for the Greek form. Both of the variations have similarities but also differences and the traditions were mutually iterating.

==Antecedents and pervasion==
Antecedents of the Catuṣkoṭi have been charted to grammatical structures in the [[Vedas]]. The [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].129) contains [[ontological]] speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of ''[[Tetralemma|catuskoti]]'': "A", "not A", "A and not A", and "not A and not not A".&lt;ref&gt;[[Subhash Kak|S. Kak]] (2004). ''The Architecture of Knowledge''. CSC, Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyrrhonism===
[[Thomas McEvilley|McEvilley]] (2002: p.&amp;nbsp;495) maps an interesting case for mutual iteration and pervasion between [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Madhyamika]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An extraordinary similarity, that has long been noticed, between Pyrrhonism and Mādhyamika is the formula known in connection with Buddhism as the fourfold negation (''catuṣkoṭi'') and which in Pyrrhonic form might be called the fourfold indeterminacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 }}, p.495&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Pyrrhonism the fourfold indeterminacy is used as a maxim for practice. This maxim is also related to the shorter, "nothing more" (ou mallon) maxim used by [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leucippus/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gorgias===
[[Gorgias]] (c 487-376 &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;), the author of a lost work: ''On Nature or the Non-Existent.'' This book was lost but was paraphrased by [[Sextus Empiricus]] in ''Against the Professors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/gorgias/ |title= |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=iep.utm.edu |publisher=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book Gorgias lays out a trilemma similar to the Catuṣkoṭi:

# Nothing exists
# Even if existence exists, it cannot be known
# Even if it could be known, it cannot be communicated.

===Syādvāda===
[[Jainism]] has a sevenfold logical architecture, the [[Syādvāda]], which is a formulation to convey the insight of [[Anekantavada]].

===Brahmajala Sutta: The Supreme Net (What the Teaching Is Not)===
[[Śākyamuni]], as remembered by [[Ananda|Ānanda]] and codified in the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]'' 2.27, when expounding the sixteenth wrong view, or the fourth wrong view of the [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta|'Eel-Wrigglers' (Pali: amarā-vikheppikā)]], the non-committal equivocators who adhered to [[Ajñana]], the sceptical philosophy, though the grammatical structure is identical to the Catuṣkoṭi (and there are numerous other analogues of this fourfold grammatical structure within this Sutta), the intentionality of the architecture employed by Nagarjuna is not evident, as rendered into English by [[Maurice Walshe|Walshe]] (1987, 1995: p.&amp;nbsp;81):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'What is the fourth way? Here, an ascetic or Brahmin is dull and stupid. Because of his dullness and stupidity, when he is questioned he resorts to evasive statements and wriggles like an eel: "If you ask me whether there is another world. But I don't say so. And I don't say otherwise. And I don't say it is not, and I don't not say it is not." "Is there no other world?..." "Is there both another world and no other world?..."Is there neither another world nor no other world?..." "Are there spontaneously-born beings?..." "Are there not...?" "Both...? "Neither...?" "Does the Tathagata exist after death? Does he not exist after death? Does he both exist and not exist after death? Does he neither exist nor not exist after death?..." "If I thought so, I would say so...I don't say so...I don't say it is not." This is the fourth case.'&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, Maurice (1987, 1995).

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;294)&lt;ref name="orientalia.org"/&gt; states that "Schayers criticisms of Stcherbatsky are incisive and just." Murti (1955)&lt;ref&gt;Murti, T. R. V., 1955. ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism''. George Allen and Unwin, London. 2nd edition: 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; makes no mention of the logical contribution of Schayer. According to Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;294),&lt;ref name="orientalia.org"/&gt; Murti furthered the work of Stcherbatsky amongst others, and brought what Robinson terms "the metaphysical phase of investigation" to its apogee though qualifies this with: "Murti has a lot to say about 'dialectic,' but practically nothing to say about formal logic." Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;294)&lt;ref name="orientalia.org"/&gt; opines that [[Hajime Nakamura|Nakamura]] (1954),&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1954). "Kukao no kigo-ronrigaku-teki ketsumei, (English: 'Some Clarifications of the Concept of Voidness from the Standpoint of Symbolic Logic')" ''Indogaku-bukkyogaku Kenkyu'', No. 5, Sept., 1954, pp. 219-231.&lt;/ref&gt; developed Schayer's methodology and defended and progressed its application.

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;293) opines that the 'metaphysical approach' evident foremost in Murti (1955) was not founded in a firm understanding of the 'logical structure of the system', i.e. catuskoti, for example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several fundamental limitations of the metaphysical approach are now apparent. It has tried to find comprehensive answers without knowing the answers to the more restricted questions involved - such questions as those of the epistemological and logical structure of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Richard H.

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;296) conveys his focus and states his methodology, clearly identifying the limitations in scope of this particular publication, which he testifies is principally built upon, though divergent from, the work of Nakamura:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nagarjuna==
The Catuṣkoṭi was employed particularly by [[Nagarjuna]] who developed it and engaged it as a 'learning, investigative, meditative'&lt;ref&gt;Rendering of the [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Three prajnas]].&lt;/ref&gt; portal to realize the 'openness' (Sanskrit: [[Śūnyatā]]), of Shakyamuni's [[Second Turning]] of the [[Dharmacakra]], as categorized by the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra]]''.

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;294), building on the foundations of [[Walter Liebenthal|Liebenthal]] (1948)&lt;ref&gt;Liebenthal, Walter (1948). ''The Book of Chao''. Peking: Gatholic University Press of Peking, 1948, p.3O.&lt;/ref&gt; to whom he gives credit, states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What Nagarjuna wishes to prove is the irrationality of Existence, or the falsehood of reasoning which is built upon the logical principle that A equals A.... Because two answers, assertion and denial, are always possible to a given question, his arguments contain two refutations, one denying the presence, one the absence of the probandum. '''This double refutation is called the Middle Path.''' [''emphasis evident in Robinson'']&lt;ref name="Robinson, Richard H. 1957 p.294"&gt;Robinson, Richard H. (1957).

==Catuṣkoṭi post-Nagarjuna==
The Catuṣkoṭi, following Nagarjuna, has had a profound impact upon the development of [[Buddhist logic]] and its [[dialectic]]al refinement of Tibetan Buddhism.

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;294) qualifies the import of Nagarjuna's work (which includes Nagarjuna's application of the Catuskoti) due to the embedded noise in the scholarly lineage: "Certainly some of Nagarjuna's ancient opponents were just as confused as his modern interpreters...".&lt;ref name="Robinson, Richard H. 1957 p.294"/&gt; This noise may also have co-arisen with Nagarjuna, following the work of [[K. N. Jayatilleke|Jayatilleke]] (1967).

==Catuṣkoṭi paradox: a simple complex==
Wayman (1977) proffers that the Catuṣkoṭi may be employed in different ways and often these are not clearly stated in discussion nor the tradition. Wayman (1977) holds that the Catuṣkoṭi may be applied in suite, that is all are applicable to a given topic forming a [[paradox]]ical matrix; or they may be applied like trains running on tracks (or employing another metaphor, four [[mercury switch]]es where only certain functions or switches are employed at particular times). This difference in particular establishes a distinction with the Greek tradition of the Tetralemma. Also, predicate logic has been applied to the Dharmic Tradition, and though this in some quarters has established interesting correlates and extension of the logico-mathematical traditions of the Greeks, it has also obscured the logico-grammatical traditions of the Dharmic Traditions of Catuṣkoṭi within modern English discourse.{{Original research inline|date=August 2014}}

==Four Extremes==
The 'Four Extremes' ({{bo|t=མཐའ་བཞི|w=mtha' bzhi}}; Sanskrit: caturanta; Devanagari: चतुरन्त) &lt;ref name="Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe 1991 p.129"&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), &amp; translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991). ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History''. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-199-8}}, p.129 Enumerations.&lt;/ref&gt; is a particular application of the Catuṣkoṭi:
*Being (Wylie: yod)
*Non-being (Wylie: med)
*Both being and non-being (Wylie: yod-med)
*Neither being and non-being (Wylie: yod-med min)&lt;ref name="Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe 1991 p.129"/&gt;

[[Heinrich Dumoulin|Dumoulin]] ''et al.'' (1988, 2005: pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44), in the initially groundbreaking work on [[Zen]] which is now for the most part dated due to progress in scholarship (though still useful as the premier English work of comprehensive overview), model a particular formulation of the Catuṣkoṭi that approaches the Caturanta engaging the Buddhist technical term '[[dharmas]]' and attribute the model to [[Nagarjuna]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we focus on the doctrinal agreement that exists between the Wisdom Sūtras&lt;ref&gt;'Wisdom Sūtras' is a gloss of ''[[Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the tracts of the Mādhyamika we note that both schools characteristically practice a didactic negation. By setting up a series of self-contradictory oppositions, Nāgārjuna disproves all conceivable statements, which can be reduced to these four:
:All things (''dharmas'') exist: affirmation of being, negation of nonbeing
:All things (''dharmas'') do not exist: affirmation of nonbeing, negation of being
:All things (''dharmas'') both exist and do not exist: both affirmation and negation
:All things (''dharmas'') neither exist nor do not exist: neither affirmation nor negation
With the aid of these four alternatives (''catuṣkoṭika'': affirmation, negation, double affirmation, double negation), Nāgārjuna rejects all firm standpoints and traces a middle path between being and nonbeing. Most likely the eight negations, arranged in couplets in Chinese, can be traced back to Nāgārjuna: neither destruction nor production, neither annihilation nor permanence, neither unity nor difference, neither coming nor going.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Dumoulin|Dumoulin, Heinrich]] (author); Heisig, James W. (translator); Knitter, Paul (translator); with introduction by McCrae, John (1988, 2005). ''Zen Buddhism: A History; Volume 1 India and China''.  Bloomington, Indiana, USA: [[World Wisdom]], Inc. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}, pp.43-44&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Alternate Four Limits/Four Extremes===
A Mantrayana enumeration of the Four Limits or the Four Extremes  within the Buddhadharma is also common. These four 'limits' are evident in the earliest sutras of the Theravadin of the First Turning, through the Second Turning philosophy of Nagarjuna and his disciples and commentators and also evident in the Third Turning as evidenced in the presentation of Padmasambhava. Padmasambhava in his 'Secret Instruction in a Garland of Vision' {{bo|w=man ngag lta ba'i phreng ba|t=མན་ངག་ལྟ་བའི་ཕྲེང་བ}} lists them as follows with the English rendering following [[Keith Dowman|Dowman]] (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, Keith (2003, revised).

*the [[:wikt:མུར་ཐུག་པ|'Nihilist' or 'Murthugpas']] {{bo|w=mur thug pa|t=མུར་ཐུག་པ}}: holds that there is no causality or causal relationship between events and dharmas. They are of the view that everything is adventitiously arisen due to chance and events and that dharmas dissipate and vanish into the void. Death is the ultimate cessation and there is no continuity between lives; and
*the [[:wikt:མུ་སྟེགས་པ|Eternalist' or 'Mutegpas']] {{bo|w=mu stegs pa|t=མུ་སྟེགས་པ}}: holds to the view of an eternal, unchanging '[[atman (Buddhism)|atman]]', where atman is often rendered as 'soul' in English. There is considerable diversity of the mechanics of causality with proponents of this view. Some perceive the atman as having a cause but not effect, an effect but no cause, or indeed a complex causality or causal relationship.

Each one of these extreme views, limits and binds the open, unbounded spaciousness of the natural mind.

===Lexicon: technical language and terminology===
Within English Buddhist logico-epistemological discourse, there is and has been historically, much obstruction to an understanding of the Caturanta (as the Catuṣkoṭi) due to inherent negligence in terminology not being clearly defined from the outset. That said, acquisition of terminology must be engaged and actualized though the [[sadhana]] of the '[[Wisdom in Buddhism#Three prajnas or mula prajñā|mūla prajñā]]', as definitions are slippery and challenging to pinpoint that hold for all contexts. Language usage in Buddhist logic is not intuitive but technical and must be learnt, acquired through the ''[[Pāramitā|perfection]]'' and ''[[The Five Powers|power]]'' of 'diligence' (Sanskrit: [[vīrya]]). The following quotations are cited to provide insight (''[[in lieu]]'' of technical definitions) into the understanding of the technical Buddhist terms 'existence', 'nature', 'being', 'entity' and 'svabhava' which are all mutually qualifying.

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;297) renders ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' 21.14, thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He who posits an entity becomes entangled in eternalism and annihilism,&lt;br /&gt;
since that entity has to be either permanent or impermanent."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Richard H. (1957). 'Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System'. ''Philosophy East &amp; West''. Volume 6, no. 4 (October 1957). University of Hawaii Press. Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127175124/http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |archivedate=2004-11-27 |df= }} (accessed: Saturday March 21, 2009), p.297&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;300) in discussing the Buddhist logic of [[Nagarjuna]], frames a view of '[[svabhava]]':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Svabhava is by defini[t]ion the subject of contradictory ascriptions. If it exists, it must belong to an existent entity, which means that it must be conditioned, dependent on other entities, and possessed of causes. But a svabhava is by definition unconditioned, not dependent on other entities, and not caused. Thus the existence of a svabhava is impossible. [''NB: typographical errors repaired''] &lt;ref name="Robinson, Richard H. 1957 p.300"&gt;Robinson, Richard H. (1957). 'Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System'. ''Philosophy East &amp; West''. Volume 6, no. 4 (October 1957). University of Hawaii Press. Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127175124/http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |archivedate=2004-11-27 |df= }} (accessed: Saturday March 21, 2009), p.300&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Nature" (a gloss of [[prakrti]] which in this context equals svabhava) does not entail an alter-entity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term "nature" (prakrti equals svabhava) has no complement..."If (anythings) existence is due to its nature, its non-existence will not occur, since the alter-entity (complement) of a nature never occurs." (''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'', 15.8)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is, a nature is the class of properties attributed to a class of terms Since they are necessarily present throughout the range of the subject or class of subjects, cases of their absence do not occur.&lt;ref name="Robinson, Richard H. 1957 p.300"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Y Karunadasa]] (1999, 2000: p.&amp;nbsp;1) holds that [[Early Buddhism]] and early Buddhist discourse "often refer to the mutual opposition between two views": 
*'permanence' or 'eternalism' (Pali: ''[[sassatavada]]'') also sometimes referred to as 'the belief in being' (Pali: ''bhava-ditti''); and
*'annihilation' or '[[nihilism]]' (Pali: ''ucchadevada'') also sometimes referred to as 'the belief in non-being' (Pali: ''vibhava-ditti'').&lt;ref name="Karunadasa, Y. 1999"&gt;[[Y Karunadasa]] (1999, 2000). "The Buddhist Critique of Sassatavada and Ucchedavada: The Key to a proper Understanding of the Origin and the Doctrines of early Buddhism." from: [[Y Karunadasa]] (1999, 2000). ''The Middle Way'', UK, vol. 74 &amp; 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Shakyamuni relates in a 'thread' (Sanskrit: ''[[sūtra]]'') of discourse to Kaccānagotta in the ''[[Kaccānagotta Sutta]]'', rendered into English by Myanmar Piṭaka Association Editorial Committee (1993: p.&amp;nbsp;35):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For the most part, Kaccāna, sentient beings depend on two kinds of belief - belief that 'there is' (things exist) and belief that 'there is not' (things do not exist).&lt;ref&gt;Myanmar Piṭaka Association Editorial Committee (1993). ''Nidāna Saṃyutta: Group of Related Discourses on Causal Factors from Nidānavagga Saṃyutta: Division Containing Groups of Discourses on Causal Factors''. Shakti Nagar, Delhi, India: Sri Satguru Publications. {{ISBN|81-7030-367-2}}. p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Y Karunadasa]] (1999, 2000: p.&amp;nbsp;1) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...it is within the framework of the Buddhist critique of ''sassatavada'' and ''ucchadavada'' that the Buddhist doctrines seem to assume their significance. For it is through the demolition of these two world-views that Buddhism seeks to construct its own world-view. The conclusion is that it was as a critical response to the mutual opposition between these two views that Buddhism emerged as a new faith amidst many other faiths.&lt;ref name="Karunadasa, Y. 1999"/&gt;

'''Christopher Ingebreth Fynsk''' (born August 30, 1952) is an American philosopher. He is Professor and Dean of the Division of Philosophy, Art, and Critical Thought at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], [[Switzerland]] and Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://egs.edu/faculty/christopher-fynsk |title=Christopher Fynsk at EGS |website=European Graduate School |access-date=2017-03-18 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6p3UjFeYH?url=http://egs.edu/faculty/christopher-fynsk |archive-date=2017-03-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/sll/people/profiles/c.fynsk |title=Christopher Fynsk at ABDN |website=University of Aberdeen |access-date=2017-03-18 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6p3UP7ioO?url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/sll/people/profiles/c.fynsk |archive-date=2017-03-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for his work relating the political and literary aspects of [[continental philosophy]]. Fynsk's work is closely involved with that of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Walter Benjamin]] and several contemporary artists, including [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and Salvatore Puglia.

==Career==
Fynsk received his doctorate from the Department of Romance Studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1981, following a Diplôme d’Etudes Avancées in [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of Strasbourg]]. His supervisor at Johns Hopkins was [[René Girard]], while at Strasbourg he worked with [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]. Fynsk taught at the latter university from 1985 to 1987, and at [[Binghamton University]] from 1981 to 2004. Since 2003 he teaches at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], [[Switzerland]]. In 2004 he moved to the [[University of Aberdeen]] to join the faculty of the School of Language and Literature, and form the Centre for Modern Thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17053">In cultural and social studies, configurations are patterns of [[behaviour]], movement (→[[movement culture]]) and [[thinking]], which research observes when analysing different [[cultures]] and/ or historical changes. The term “configurations” is mostly used by comparative [[anthropological]] studies and by [[cultural history]]. '''Configurational analysis''' became a special method by the Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] during the 1970s and later by [[body culture studies]] in Denmark.
	
'''Configurational analysis''' is marked by its distance towards the [[history of ideas]] and [[intention]]s, which are conceived as mainstreams in historical studies. Configurations of human behaviour and movement have attracted special attention in the framework of phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) and particularly in [[materialist]] phenomenology.

== Configurations in earlier cultural studies ==

Configurations in different cultures were studied since early twentieth century.

[[Ruth Benedict]] (1934) contributed to the anthropology of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] by using the term of “configurations” as a translation of German “[[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]] [[:de:Gestalt]]”. Configuration denoted a whole of social attitudes, practices and beliefs and was nearly identical with “[[culture]]”. It was used for comparison – between the [[Hopi]] Indians and the Indians of the prairies, between Japanese and Western culture – and in a perspective of [[cultural relativism]]: Each culture has configurations of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth 1934: ''Patterns of Culture.'' Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) used the term ”diagram” to describe an order of conceived reality both in scientific and in literary understanding. This was his key to a "materialist [[psychoanalysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston 1938: ''La psychanalyse du feu;'' English 1964: ''Psychoanalysis of fire.'' Boston: Beacon&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelard’s approach became later a source of inspiration for [[Michel Foucault]].

[[Norbert Elias]] (1939, 1970) described certain patterns of relations between human beings as ''figuration [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/figuration]'' – in English: ”configuration” – becoming visible in play of cards, dance and football. He described these configurations as ''das sich wandelnde Muster, das die Spieler miteinander bilden'' (the changing pattern, which players form with each other), ''Spannungsgefüge'' (relations of suspense), ''Interdependenz der Spieler'' (interdependence of players), and ''das fluktuierende Spannungsgleichgewicht, das Hin und Her einer Machtbalance'' (the fluctuating balance of suspense, the to-and-fro of a balance of power).&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert 1939: ''Über den Prozess der Zivilisation. Soziogenetische und psychogenetische Untersuchungen.'' Frankfort/ Main Suhrkamp; English 1982: ''The Civilizing Process.'' Oxford Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This became a key to his sociology of [[civilization]].

[[Michel Foucault]] (1966) used the term ''la configuration'' in historical studies of philosophy, in order to characterize “the order of the things”, patterns of knowledge changing in [[epistemological]] disruptions. The configurations of savoir changed, according to Foucault, in following historical steps:&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel 1966: ''Les mots et les choses.'' Paris: Gallimard; English 1970: ''The Order of Things. An Archeology of the Human Sciences.'' New York: Pantheon&lt;/ref&gt;

: The age of [[Renaissance]] focused on the chains of similarities, going from sign to sign. [[Cervantes]] shaped an ironical picture of this configuration by the phantasmas of [[Don Quixote]].

: The 18th century constructed the tableau as an universal grammar. On this base, [[Linné]] constructed the genealogical trees of plants and animals as a tableau of life. An ironical picture of this configuration was given by [[Laurence Sterne]] in his [[Tristram Shandy]].

: The 19th century discovered [[progress (history)|progress]] and [[evolution]] – in [[life science]] as [[natural history]], in economy as [[Manufacturing|production]], and in language as [[linguistic history]]. On the background of these modern configurations, which took their form around 1800, individual [[subjectivity]] was constructed, as well as the dynamic of industrial life developed.

There are indicators that these configurations may disappear or transform again in a [[post-modern]] age.

== Configurations in historical behaviour studies ==

Configurational analysis (in German ''Konfigurationsanalyse'') became a particular methodological approach in the framework of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]], as they were developed at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970s by the historians August Nitschke and [[Henning Eichberg]]. Nitschke analyzed ''raum-zeitliche Muster'' (patterns of space and time) and ''Körperanordnungen'' (orders of the body) as “configurations” when comparing patterns of [[art]] and patterns of [[social behavior]]. Configurations were similarities, analogies and changing patterns of figures in a given space.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog; id. 1975 (ed.): ''Verhaltenswandel in der industriellen Revolution.'' Stuttgart: Kohlhammer&lt;/ref&gt;

This analytical approach was comparable to concepts, which in recent time have challenged historiography: [[mentality]] ([[Georges Duby]]), affect control ([[Norbert Elias]]) (→[[Affect control theory]]), perception ([[Lucien Febvre]]), structural thinking ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]), needs ([[David McClelland]]), and interaction ([[George Herbert Mead]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1981: ''Historische Verhaltensforschung.'' Stuttgart: Ulmer&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurational approach contrasted deliberately with the mainstream of [[historiography]] explaining history by the aims of its actors ([[pragmatism]]), as an expression of [[weltanschauung]] ([[psychology]] and [[history of ideas]]) or by interests (in [[social history]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad-Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog&lt;/ref&gt;

The configurational analysis was especially applied to [[comparative]] and historical studies of [[sport]] and [[dance]] as indicators of [[social change]]. The [[comparative]] analysis of [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], [[ball games]], [[equestrianism]], [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], and [[dance]] showed some common configurations as: the functional parceling of space, a new dynamic of “progress” and speed, the modern taste of [[suspense]], the principle of [[competition]], and the production of result tables. The configurations of [[movement culture]] prefigured the patterns of [[productivity]] orientation, which characterized the [[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Eichberg, Henning 1978: ''Leistung, Spannung Geschwindigkeit. Sport und Tanz im gesellschaftlichen Wandel des 18./19. Jahrhunderts.'' Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta&lt;/ref&gt;

The applied concept of “configuration” was here different from "system" (→[[cultural system]]) (being more static and systematic, and related to the negative term of the non-systematic), from “style” (being more [[aesthetic]] and having undertones of taste, [[subjectivity]] and stylization), and from “[[structure]]” (having undertones of “the functional”, as a heritage from [[structural functionalism]] in sociology). In contrast to these terms, configuration denotes a more dynamic pattern in change.

Configurations as patterns of behaviour, movement and thinking reflect man's perception of [[reality]]. They give an epochal pattern of [[perception]] which concurrently defines a framework for action.  But in no way they describe the whole reality of an epoch. Furthermore, their power to explain individual actions is limited. The epochal "reality" is no straitjacket which does not allow freedom of action. Nevertheless, in each epoch there are typical ways to act or to behave, to move or to think. They correspond with the way people perceive reality. Acting or thinking in this way may be right or wrong – it is typical anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August (1962): ''Heilige in dieser Welt. Persönliche Autorität und politische Wirksamkeit''. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer; Kalckhoff, Andreas (1982): "Historische Verhaltensforschung: Ethnologie unserer Vergangenheit. Die Konfiguration eines Aufstandes im 10. Jahrhundert", in Gehlen, Rolf &amp; Wolf, Bernd (eds.): ''Werner Müller zu seinem 75.Geburtstag, Unter dem Pflaster liegt der Strand 11''. Berlin: Karin Kramer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configurations in body culture studies ==

Studies of [[Human body|body]] culture, which spread in Denmark during the 1980s, developed the configurational analysis further, revealing inner tensions and contradictions of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Knut 2001 (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences; Eichberg, Henning 1998: ''Body Cultures.'' London: Routledge; id. - 2001: “Thinking contradictions. Towards a methodology of configurational analysis, or: How to reconstruct the societal signification of movement culture and sport.” In: Knut Dietrich (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences, 10-32; id. 2010: ''Bodily Democracy.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurative approach was applied to the analysis and especially to comparison of different fields of activities: popular [[festivity]], [[fitness culture]] (→[[physical fitness]]), sportive and non-sportive [[ball games]], sport [[racing]] and [[parcour]], different [[outdoor activities]], and different [[health]] cultures. Configurational analysis focused on bodily movement in time and space, on the energy of movement, on interpersonal relations, and on the objectification of movement. Above this basis, analysis included the superstructure of [[institutions]] and [[idea]]s (→[[Base and superstructure]]), which organize and reflect collective actions and interests.

: ''Time of bodily movement'' is marked, among others, by contradictions between acceleration and slowness – between living rhythm and mechanical pace – between linear-abstract and irreversible time – between cyclical, progressing and situational time. Historical change saw for instance the transformation from the noble [[exercises]] of the eighteenth century with their circulating and formally measured patterns to modern [[gymnastics]] and [[sports]] with their patterns of speed, acceleration, and flow, which characterized industrial behaviour more generally.

: ''Space of bodily movement'' is characterized by contradictions between the straight line and the [[labyrinth]] – between connection and parcellation of spaces – between geometrical and directed space – between space, place and intermediary space. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]’s study of the [[panopticon]] as a specific modern way of organising the space of movement and bodily visibility around 1800 showed the societal depth of this analysis.

: ''Energy of bodily movement'' consists of a multiplicity of different atmospheres, radiations, moods and modes of attunement. Modern suspension ([[suspense]], tension, thrill, excitement – in German ''Spannung''') emerged in eighteenth and nineteenth century’s [[boxing]] and [[ball games]] at the same time as it appeared in [[detective novels]]. This coincidence was illustrative for the configurational change towards [[industrial society]]. Social energy was also illustrated by the study of [[laughter]] in the tradition of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]’s analysis of [[Renaissance]] society.

: ''[[Interpersonal relations]]'' in bodily movement tell about power and [[gender]] – about winners and losers – about you- and we-relations in motion. The study of sports has especially been enriched by the attention to gender unbalances in body culture.

: ''[[Objectification]] of bodily movement'' is especially characteristic for modern body cultures. Bodily movement is reified in a tension between process and result – between [[social production]], reproduction and a-productive encounters in bodily activity – between producing data or pictures by movement. The production of records by modern sports has been a central point for understanding modern industrial behaviour.

: Above these basic body-cultural processes, body culture shows patterns of organizational and institutional character as well as the meanings and ideas, which are ascribed to bodily practices. Mainstream studies of sport often over-emphasize these ''superstructures'' (→[[Base and superstructure]]), while the configurational analysis of body culture gives priority to the focus on bodily practice, in the framework of a [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

== Further configurational approaches ==

Configurational analysis can be compared with other contemporary approaches in cultural and social studies.

: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1966/67, 1979) launched the concept of ”[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]” to describe patterns of action, of bodily practice and presentation, of taste and aesthetic form (comparable to the [[Gothic style]] of Medieval  cathedrals). Like configuration, habitus was illustrative for a certain homology, which could be found inside a given social formation or class and as distinction between different [[social classes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre 1966/67: "Champs intellectuel et projet créateur." In: ''Temps modernes'', 22, 865-906; id. 1979: ''La distinction.'' Paris: Minuit. – English 1984: ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Peter Sloterdijk]] (1998/99) developed a cultural ”morphology”, which described the [[psychosocial]] geometry of people’s living space and inhabitations, their world and their understanding of God. Micro- and macrospheres were related to each other by characteristic configurations.&lt;ref&gt;Sloterdijk, Peter 1998/2004: ''Sphären. Plurale Sphärologie.'' Vols.1-3, Frankfurt/Main: Suhrkamp&lt;/ref&gt;

In any of these approaches, “configuration” made it possible to compare concrete human practice – i.e. “material” bodily phenomena – with larger spheres of [[society]] and [[culture]].

'''Daiyuzenji''' is a [[Rinzai]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] temple located on the north side of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States.

Daiyuzenji began in 1982 as the Illinois ''betsuin'' (branch temple) of [[Daihonzan Chozen-ji]], a Rinzai headquarters temple founded in 1979 in Honolulu, Hawaii by [[Omori Sogen]] Roshi (1904-1994), a successor in the [[Tenryu-ji]] line of Rinzai Zen.  [[Fumio Toyoda]], a lay Zen master and martial art teacher who had emigrated to Chicago from Japan in 1974, was the driving force behind the founding and administration of the betsuin.  Tenshin Tanouye Roshi and Dogen Hosokawa Roshi, two of Omori Roshi's successors who taught at Chozen-ji, traveled to Chicago beginning in the early 1980s to lead [[sesshin]] there.  

Eventually the Chicago betsuin developed a cadre of senior students, including several ordained priests.  In 2005 it was designated a fully independent temple by Hosokawa Roshi, named ''Sokeizan Daiyuzenji'' (曹渓山大雄禅寺).  So'zan Miller Roshi, one of Hosokawa Roshi's dharma heirs, was appointed the first Daiyuzenji ''shike'' (abbot).

Daiyuzenji teachers are also involved with the establishment of [[Korinji]], a new Rinzai Zen Buddhist ''sodo'' ([[monastery]]) in the [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]] area.  Groundbreaking for this occurred in June, 2009.  Daiyuzenji and Korinji together anchor a network of associated Zen practice groups called the [[Rinzai Zen Community]] (RZC).

[[Image:Descartes Discours de la Methode.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Discourse on Method'']]
'''''Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences''''' ({{lang-fr|Discours de la Méthode Pour bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la vérité dans les sciences}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[autobiographical]] treatise published by [[René Descartes]] in 1637. It is best known as the source of the famous [[quotation]] ''"Je pense, donc je suis"'' (English: "[[I think, therefore I am]]", or "I am thinking, therefore I exist"),&lt;ref&gt;Garber, Daniel (1998, 2003): ''Descartes, René; The Cogito Argument'' In E. Craig (Ed.), [http://rep.tandf.test.semantico.net/article/DA026SECT5 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. London: Routledge. Retrieved 2017-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; which occurs in Part IV of the work. The similar [[Latin]] statement, ''[[Cogito, ergo sum]]'', is found in ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644).

''Discourse on the Method'' is one of the most influential works in the history of modern philosophy, and important to the development of natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip J.; Hersh, Reuben (1986). ''Descartes' Dream: The World According to Mathematics''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Descartes tackles the problem of [[skepticism]], which had previously been studied by [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Al-Ghazali]]&lt;ref name=Najm&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Place and Function of Doubt in the Philosophies of Descartes and Al-Ghazali|first=Sami M.|last=Najm|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=16|issue=3–4|date=July–October 1966|pages=133–141|doi=10.2307/1397536|publisher=Philosophy East and West, Vol. 16, No. 3/4|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=1397536}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel de Montaigne]]. Descartes modified it to account for a truth he found to be [[incontrovertible evidence|incontrovertible]]. Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions.

The book was originally published in [[Leiden]], in the Netherlands. Later, it was translated into Latin and published in 1656 in [[Amsterdam]]. The book was intended as an introduction to three works: ''[[Dioptrique]]'', ''Météores'' and ''Géométrie''. ''[[La Géométrie]]'' contains Descartes's initial concepts that later developed into the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. The text was written and published in French rather than the language in which philosophical and scientific texts were most frequently written and published in at the time, namely, Latin. Most of Descartes' other works were written in Latin.

Together with ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', ''Principles of Philosophy'' and ''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]'', it forms the base of the [[epistemology]] known as [[Cartesianism]].

==Organization==

The book is divided into six parts, described in the author's preface as

# Various considerations touching the Sciences
# The principal rules of the Method which the Author has discovered
# Certain of the rules of Morals which he has deduced from this Method
# The reasonings by which he establishes the existence of God and of the Human Soul
# The order of the Physical questions which he has investigated, and, in particular, the explication of the motion of the heart and of some other difficulties pertaining to Medicine, as also the difference between the soul of man and that of the brutes
# What the Author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in the investigation of Nature than has yet been made, with the reasons that have induced him to write

=== Part I: Various scientific considerations ===

Descartes begins by allowing himself some wit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Library Walk 28.JPG|thumb|right|"...the reading of good books is like a conversation with the best men of past centuries–" ([[apocrypha|apocryphal]] quote)]]

A similar observation can be found in Hobbes: ''"But this proveth rather that men are in that point equal, than unequal. For there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share"'',&lt;ref&gt;http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXIII  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528165112/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXIII |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=November 2017}} but also in Montaigne, whose formulation indicates that it was a common place at the time: ''"Tis commonly said that the justest portion Nature has given us of her favors is that of sense; for there is no one who is not contented with his share."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/1747#Montaigne_0963-06_212|title=Essays of Montaigne, vol. 6 - Online Library of Liberty|work=libertyfund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/1747#Montaigne_0963-06_213|title=Essays of Montaigne, vol. 6 - Online Library of Liberty|work=libertyfund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes continues with a warning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Descartes |first=Rene |others=Laurence J. Lafleur (trans)|title=Discourse on Method and Meditations |year=1960 |publisher=The Liberal Arts Press |location=New York |isbn=0-672-60278-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Descartes describes his disappointment with his education: ''"as soon as I had finished the entire course of study... I found myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I had advanced no farther... than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance."'' He notes his special delight with mathematics, and contrasts its strong foundations to ''"the disquisitions of the ancient moralists [which are] towering and magnificent palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud"''.

=== Part II: Principal rules of the Method ===

Descartes was in Germany, attracted thither by the [[Thirty Years' War|wars]] in that country, and describes his intent by a "building metaphor". He observes that buildings, cities or nations that have been planned by a single hand are more elegant and commodious than those that have grown organically. He resolves not to build on old foundations, or to lean upon principles which, he had taken on faith in his youth. Descartes seeks to ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of his powers; he presents four precepts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of [[Methodic Doubt|doubt]].''

''The second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate solution.''

''The third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little and little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more complex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects which in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and sequence.''

''And the last, in every case to make [[enumerations]] so complete, and reviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=René |translator-first=John|translator-last= Veitch |title=A Discourse on Method: Meditations and Principles|date=2004|origyear=1637|publisher=Orion Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=9780460874113|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Part III: Morals and Maxims of conducting the Method ===

Descartes uses the analogy of rebuilding a house from secure foundations, and extends the analogy to the idea of needing a temporary abode while his own house is being rebuilt. The following three maxims were adopted by Descartes so that he could effectively function in the "real world" while experimenting with his method of radical doubt. They formed a rudimentary belief system from which to act before he developed a new system based on the truths he discovered using his method:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# ''The first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering firmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated from my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter according to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from extremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general consent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living.''
# ''Be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was able.''
# ''Endeavor always to conquer myself rather than fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and in general, accustom  myself to the persuasion that, except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we have done our best in things external to us, our ill-success cannot possibly be failure on our part.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Part IV: Proof of God and the Soul===
Applying the method to itself, [[Descartes]] challenges his own reasoning and [[reason]] itself. But Descartes believes three things are not susceptible to doubt and the three support each other to form a stable foundation for the method. He cannot doubt that something has to be there to do the doubting (I think, therefore I am). The method of doubt cannot doubt reason as it is based on reason itself. By reason there exists a God, and God is the guarantor that reason is not misguided. Descartes supplies three different proofs for the existence of God, including what is now referred to as the [[Ontological argument|ontological proof of the existence of God]].

=== Part V: Physics, the heart, and the soul of man and animals ===


Here he describes how in other writings he discusses the idea of laws of nature, of the sun and stars, the idea of the moon being the cause of ebb and flow, on gravitation, and going on to discuss light and fire.

Describing his work on light, he states that he

&lt;blockquote&gt;''expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun and the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His work on such physico-mechanical laws is, however, projected into a "new world." A theoretical place God created "somewhere in the imaginary spaces [with] matter sufficient to compose . . . [a "new world" in which He] . . . agitate[d] variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned, and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature, and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established." He does this "to express my judgment regarding . . . [his subjects] with greater freedom, without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned." Descartes goes on to say that he "was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was to be." Despite this admission, it seems that Descartes' project for understanding the world was that of re-creating creation—a cosmological project which aimed, through Descartes' particular brand of experimental method, to show not merely the possibility of such a system, but to suggest that this way of looking at the world—one with (as Descartes saw it) no assumptions about God or nature—provided the only basis upon which he could see knowledge progressing (as he states in Book II). Thus, in Descartes' work, we can see some of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology in evidence—the project of examing the historical construction of the universe through a set of quantitative laws describing interactions which would allow the ordered present to be constructed from a chaotic past.

He goes on to the motion of the blood in the heart and arteries, endorsing the findings of "a physician of England" about the circulation of blood, referring to [[William Harvey]] and his work ''De motu cordis'' in a marginal note.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f55.image Discours de la méthode], Leyde 1637, p. 51. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BnF Gallica]]&lt;/ref&gt; But then he disagrees strongly about the function of the heart as a pump, ascribing the motive power of the circulation to heat rather than muscular contraction.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Fye: ''Profiles in Cardiology – René Descartes'', [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.4960260112/pdf Clin. Cardiol. 26, 49–51 (2003)], Pdf 58,2 kB.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes that these motions seem to be totally independent of what we think, and concludes that our bodies are separate from our [[soul]]s.

He does not seem to distinguish between [[mind]], [[spirit]] and soul, which are identified as our faculty for rational thinking. Hence the term [[Cogito ergo sum|"I think, therefore I am."]]  All three of these words (particularly "mind" and "soul") can be identified by the single French term "âme."

=== Part VI: Prerequisites for advancing the investigation of Nature ===
Descartes begins by noting, without directly referring to it, the recent trial of Galileo for heresy and the condemnation of heliocentrism; he explains that for these reasons he has been slow to publish.&lt;ref&gt;Three years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing all these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to put it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom I greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less influential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a certain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by another individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only that, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression to it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found in which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care I have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had not the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one. This has been sufficient to make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the reasons by which I had been induced to take this resolution were very strong, yet my inclination, which has always been hostile to writing books, enabled me immediately to discover other considerations sufficient to excuse me for not undertaking the task.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become always more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at the commencement, it is better to make use only of what is spontaneously presented to our senses.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''First, I have essayed to find in general the principles, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secure on these foundation stones, Descartes shows the practical application of "the Method" in Mathematics and the Science.

==Influencing future science==

The most important influence, however, was the first precept, which states, in Descartes words, "never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such." This method of pro-foundational skepticism is considered to be the start of modern [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/ Descartes' Life and Works]'' by Kurt Smith, ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.

* "The most widely shared thing in the world is good sense, for everyone thinks he is so well provided with it that even those who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else do not usually desire to have more good sense than they have...." (part I, AT p. 1 sq.)
* "I know how very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves; and also how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when given in our favor." (part I, AT p. 3)
* "...I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages, and likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their histories and fables. For to hold converse with those of other ages and to travel, are almost the same thing." (part I, AT p. 6)

(part I, AT p. 8)
* "...I entirely abandoned the study of letters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world...." (part I, AT p. 9)

{{italic title}}
'''''Dominum et vivificantem''''' (Latin: ''The Lord and Giver of Life'') is the fifth [[encyclical]] written by [[Pope John Paul II]]. The encyclical was [[promulgated]] on 18 May 1986. It is a theological examination of the role of the [[Holy Spirit]] as it pertains to the modern world and the church and the use of spiritual [[Prayer_in_the_Catholic_Church|prayer]] to renew one's spiritual life. 

In 1986, Pope John Paul II was already anticipating the new millennium, with its new challenges, as well as the new [[Grace_in_Christianity|graces]] the Holy Spirit would bestow upon the [[Catholic Church|Church]] as she celebrated the [[Great Jubilee]] beginning the third millennium of [[Christianity]]. Wishing to prepare the Church for these things by giving the people of God an increased awareness and knowledge of the Holy Spirit, he issued the encyclical  on May 18, the Solemnity of [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;Convincing the World:St. John Paul's Encyclical on the Holy Spirit, https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otc.cfm?id=1317, 2015 [retrieved 2018.04.04]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spirituality sidebar|experience}}
'''Ego death''' is a "complete loss of subjective self-identity".{{sfn|Johnson|Richards|Griffiths|2008}} The term is used in various intertwined contexts, with related meanings. In [[Jungian psychology]], the synonymous term '''psychic death''' is used, which refers to a fundamental transformation of the psyche.{{sfn|Ventegodt|Merrick|2003|p=1021}} In death and rebirth mythology, ego death is a phase of '''self-surrender and transition''',{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}}{{sfn|Plotkin|2010|p=467, note 1}}{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}} as described by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his research on the mythology of the [[Monomyth|Hero's Journey]].{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} It is a recurrent theme in world mythology and is also used as a metaphor in some strands of contemporary western thinking.{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}}

In descriptions of [[psychedelic experiences]], the term is used synonymously with '''ego-loss'''{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=14}}{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=58}}{{sfn|Johnson|Richards|Griffiths|2008}}{{sfn|Dickins|2014|p=374}} to refer to (temporary) loss of one's sense of self due to the use of [[psychedelics]].{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}}{{sfn|Harrison|2010}}{{sfn|Johnson|Richards|Griffiths|2008}} The term was used as such by [[Timothy Leary]] et al.{{sfn|Johnson|Richards|Griffiths|2008}} to describe the death of the ego{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=12}} in the first phase of an [[LSD]] trip, in which a "complete transcendence" of the [[True self and false self|self]]{{refn|group=note|name="def_ego-loss"}} and the "[[Character mask|game]]"{{refn|group=note|name="def_game"}} occurs.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}} The concept is also used in contemporary [[spirituality]] and in the [[Nonduality|modern understanding of eastern religions]] to describe a permanent loss of "attachment to a separate sense of self"&lt;ref group=web name="WIE" /&gt; and self-centeredness.{{sfn|White|2012|p=7}} This conception is an influential part of [[Eckhart Tolle|Eckhart Tolle's]] teachings, where Ego is presented as an accumulation of thoughts and emotions, continuously identified with, which creates the idea and feeling of being a separate entity, and only by disidentifying one's consciousness from it can one truly be free from suffering (in the Buddhist meaning).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Now|last=Tolle|first=Eckhart|publisher=1997 (Namaste Publishing) 1999 (New World Library)|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57731-152-2|location=San Francisco Bay|pages=236|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''Ego death'' and the related term "ego loss" have been defined in the context of [[mysticism]] by the religious studies scholar Daniel Mekur as "an imageless experience in which there is no sense of personal identity. It is the experience that remains possible in a state of extremely deep trance when the ego-functions of reality-testing, sense-perception, memory, reason, fantasy and self-representation are repressed [...] Muslim Sufis call it ''[[Fana (Sufism)|fana]]'' (annihilation),{{refn|group=note|name="fana"|See also [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/201463/fana Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Fana''], and [http://networkologies.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/fana-sufisms-notion-of-self-annihilation-or-why-nirvana-is-samsara-in-mahayana-buddhism/ Christopher Vitale, '']}} and medieval Jewish kabbalists termed it "the kiss of death".{{sfn|Merkur|2007|p=66}}

Carter Phipps equates Enlightenment and ego death, which he defines as "the renunciation, rejection and, ultimately, the death of the need to hold on to a separate, self-centered existence.{{sfn|Phipps|2001}}{{refn|group=note|Cited in Rindfleisch 2007{{sfn|Rindfleisch|2007|p=66}} and White 2012,{{sfn|White|2012|p=7}} and in "Nondual Highlights Issue #1694 Saturday, January 31, 2004": "[E]go death [is] the final destruction of our attachment to a separate sense of self."&lt;ref group=web name="WIE" /&gt;}}

In Jungian psychology, Ventegodt and Merrick define ego death as "a fundamental transformation of the psyche. Such a shift in personality has been labeled an "ego death" in Buddhism or a psychic death by Jung.{{sfn|Ventegodt|Merrick|2003|p=2021}}

In comparative mythology, Ego death is the second phase of Joseph Campbell's description of [[Monomyth|The Hero's Journey]],{{sfn|Plotkin|2010|p=467, note 1}}{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} which includes a phase of separation, transition, and incorporation.{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}} The second phase is a phase of self-surrender and ego-death, where-after the hero returns to enrich the world with his discoveries.{{sfn|Plotkin|2010|p=467, note 1}}{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}}

In psychedelic culture, Leary, Metzer &amp; Alpert (1964) define ego death, or ego loss as they call it, as part of the (symbolic) experience of death in which the old ego must die before one can be spiritually reborn.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}} They define Ego loss as "... complete transcendence − beyond words, beyond space−time, beyond self. There are no visions, no sense of self, no thoughts. There are only pure awareness and ecstatic freedom". {{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}} {{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=58-59}}

Several psychologists working on psychedelics have defined ego-death. Alnaes (1964) defines ego-death as "[L]oss of ego-feeling.".{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}} Stanislav Grof (1988) defines it as "a sense of total annihilation [...] This experience of ''ego death'' seems to entail an instant merciless destruction of all previous reference points in the life of the individual [...] [E]go death means an irreversible end to one's philosophical identification with what [[Alan Watts]] called ''skin-encapsulated ego''.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=30}} The psychologist John Harrison (2010) defines "[T]emporary ego death [as the] loss of the separate self[,] or, in the affirmative, [...] a deep and profound merging with the transcendent other.{{sfn|Harrison|2010}} Johnson, Richards &amp; Griffiths (2008), paraphrasing Leary ''et al.'' and Grof:
define ego death as "temporarily experienc[ing] a complete loss of subjective self-identity.{{sfn|Johnson|Richards|Griffiths|2008}}

==Conceptual development==
The concept of "ego death" developed along a number of intertwined strands of thought, especially romantic movements{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=211}} and subcultures,{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=212}} [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=72-73, 78}} anthropological research on [[Rite of passage|rites de passage]]{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1748-1749}} and [[shamanism]]{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=212}} Joseph Campbell's [[comparative mythology]],{{sfn|Plotkin|2010|p=467, note 1}}{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} [[Jungian psychology]],{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=226}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic scene]] of the 1960s,{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=219-221}} and [[transpersonal psychology]].{{sfn|Grof|1988}}

===Western mysticism===
According to Merkur,

{{quote|The conceptualisation of [[Mysticism|mystical union]] as the soul's death, and its replacement by God's consciousness, has been a standard Roman Catholic trope since St. [[Teresa of Ávila]]; the motif traces back through [[Marguerite Porete]], in the 13th century, to the ''[[Fana (Sufism)|fana]]'',{{refn|group=note|name="fana"}} "annihilation", of the Islamic Sufis.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=225}}}}

===Jungian psychology===
According to Ventegodt and Merrick, the Jungian term "psychic death" is a synonym for "ego death":

{{quote|In order to radically improve global quality of life, it seems necessary to have a fundamental transformation of the psyche. Such a shift in personality has been labeled an "ego death" in Buddhism or a psychic death by Jung, because it implies a shift back to the existential position of the natural self, i.e., living the true purpose of life. The problem of healing and improving the global quality of life seems strongly connected to the unpleasantness of the ego-death experience.{{sfn|Ventegodt|Merrick|2003|p=2021}}}}

Ventegodt and Merrick refer to Jung's publications ''[[Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious|The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious]]'', first published 1933, and ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]]'', first published in 1944.{{sfn|Ventegodt|Merrick|2003|p=2021}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also being used by [[Poul Bjerre]], in his 1929 publication ''Död och Förnyelse'', "Death and Renewal.}}

In Jungian psychology, a unification of archetypal opposites has to be reached, during a process of conscious suffering, in which consciousness "dies" and resurrects. Jung called this process "the transcendent function",{{refn|group=note|See [http://frithluton.com/articles/transcendent-function/ Frith Luton, ''Transcendent Function''], and {{citation | last =Miller | first =Jeffrey C. | year =2012 | title =The Transcendent Function Jung's Model of Psychological Growth through Dialogue with the Unconscious | publisher =SUNY | url =http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60876.pdf}} }} which leads to a [[Self in Jungian psychology|"more inclusive and synthetic consciousness"]].{{sfn|Dourley|2008|p=106}}

Jung used analogies with [[alchemy]] to describe the [[individuation]] process, and the [[Transference|transference-processes]] which occur during therapy.{{sfn|Fordham|1990}}

According to Leeming et al., from a religious point of view psychic death is related to [[John of the Cross|St. John of the Cross]]' ''Ascent of Mt. Carmel'' and ''Dark Night of the Soul''.{{sfn|Leeming|Madden|Marlan|2009|p=40}}

===Mythology – ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces''===
{{See also|Dying-and-rising god|Descent to the underworld}}
[[File:Heroesjourney.svg|thumb|right|The Hero's Journey]]
In 1949, Joseph Campbell published ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', a study on the [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]] of the [[Monomyth|Hero's Journey]].{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} It describes a common theme found in many cultures worldwide,{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} and is also described in many contemporary theories on personal transformation.{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}} In traditional cultures it describes the "wilderness passage",{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} the transition from adolescence into adulthood.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1748-1749}} It typically includes a phase of separation, transition, and incorporation.{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}} The second phase is a phase of self-surrender and ego-death, whereafter the hero returns to enrich the world with their discoveries.{{sfn|Plotkin|2010|p=467, note 1}}{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Atkinson|1995|p=31}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1749}} Campbell describes the basic theme as follows:

{{quote|A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.{{sfn|Campbell|1949|p=23}}}}

This journey is based on the archetype of death and rebirth,{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}} in which the [[True self and false self|"false self"]] is surrendered and the [[True self and false self|"true self"]] emerges.{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}} A well known example is Dante's [[Divine Comedy|Divina Comedia]], in which the hero descends into the underworld.{{sfn|Rosen|1998|p=228}}

===Psychedelics===
{{See also|Shamanism|Neo-shamanism|Beat Generation}}{{Main|The Psychedelic Experience|Bardo}}

Concepts and ideas from mysticism and bohemianism were inherited by the [[Beat Generation]].{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=211}} When [[Aldous Huxley]] helped popularize the use of psychedelics, starting with ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', published in 1954, {{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} Huxley also promoted a set of analogies with eastern religions, as described in ''[[The Perennial Philosophy (book)|The Perennial Philosophy]].'' This book helped inspire the 1960s belief in a revolution in western consciousness {{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} and included the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' was one of the sources.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} Similarly, [[Alan Watts]], in his opening statement on mystical experiences in ''This Is It,'' draws parallels with [[Richard Bucke]]'s [[Cosmic Consciousness]], describing the "central core" of the experience as

{{quote|... the conviction, or insight, that the immediate ''now'', whatever its nature, is the goal and fulfillment of all living.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=213}}}}

This interest in mysticism helped shape the emerging research and popular conversation around psychedelics in the 1960s.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=213-218}} In 1964 [[William S. Burroughs]] drew a distinction between "sedative" and "conscious-expanding" drugs.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=218}} In the 1940s and 1950s the use of [[LSD]] was restricted to military and psychiatric researchers. One of those researchers was [[Timothy Leary]], a clinical psychologist who first encountered psychedelic drugs while on vacation in 1960,{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=220}} and started to research the effects of psilocybin in 1961.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} He sought advice from Aldous Huxley, who advised him to propagate psychedelic drugs among society's elites, including artists and intellectuals.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=220}} On insistence of Allen Ginsberg, Leary, together with his younger colleague Richard Alpert ([[Ram Dass]]) also made LSD available to students.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=220}} In 1962 Leary was fired, and Harvard's psychedelic research program was shut down.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=220}} In 1962 Leary founded the ''Castalia Foundation'',{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=220}} and in 1963 he and his colleagues founded the journal ''The Psychedelic Review''.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=221}}

Following Huxley's advice, Leary wrote a manual for LSD-usage.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=221}} ''The Psychedelic Experience'', published in 1964, is a guide for [[LSD|LSD-trips]], written by [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Richard Alpert]], loosely based on Yvan-Wentz's translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} Aldous Huxley introduced the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' to Timothy Leary.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} According to Leary, Metzer and Alpert, the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' is 
{{quote|... a key to the innermost recesses of the human mind, and a guide for initiates, and for those who are seeking the spiritual path of liberation.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=11}}}}

They construed the effect of LSD as a "stripping away" of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'', and the stages of psychological "death" and "rebirth" which Leary had identified during his research.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218-219}} 
According to Leary, Metzer and Alpert it is....

{{quote|... one of the oldest and most universal practices for the initiate to go through the experience of death before he can be spiritually reborn. Symbolically he must die to his past, and to his old ego, before he can take his place in the new spiritual life into which he has been initiated.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=12}}}}

Also in 1964 Randolf Alnaes published "Therapeutic applications of the change in consciousness produced by psycholytica (LSD, Psilocybin, etc.)."{{sfn|Alnaes|1964}}{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}} Alnaes notes that patients may become involved in existential problems as a consequence of the LSD experience. Psycholytic drugs may facilitate insight. With a short psychological treatment, patients may benefit from changes brought about by the effects of the experience.{{sfn|Alnaes|1964}}

One of the LSD-experiences may be the death crisis. Alnaes discernes three stages in this kind of experience:{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}} 
# Psychosomatic symptoms lead up to the "loss of ego feeling (ego death)";{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}}
# A sense of separation of the observing subject from the body. The body is beheld to undergo death or an associated event;
# "Rebirth", the return to normal, conscious mentation, "characteristically involving a tremendous sense of relief, which is cathartic in nature and may lead to insight".{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}}

==Leary's description of "Ego-death"==
In ''The Psychedelic Experience'', three stages are discerned:
# Chikhai Bardo: ego loss, a "complete transcendence" of the self{{refn|group=note|name="def_ego-loss"|Leary et al.: "The first period (Chikhai Bardo) is that of complete transcendence − beyond words, beyond space−time, beyond self. There are no visions, no sense of self, no thoughts. There are only pure awareness and ecstatic freedom from all game (and biological) involvements."{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}}}} and game;{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}}{{refn|group=note|name="def_game"|Leary et al.: ""Games" are behavioral sequences defined by roles, rules, rituals, goals, strategies, values, language, characteristic space−time locations and characteristic patterns of movement.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}}}}
# Chonyid Bardo: The Period of Hallucinations;{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=20}}
# Sidpa Bardo: the return to routine game reality and the self.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=5}}

Each Bardo is described in the first part of ''The Psychedelic Experience''. In the second part, instructions are given which can be read to the "voyager". The instructions for the ''First Bardo'' state:

{{poemquote|O (name of voyager)
The time has come for you to seek new levels of reality.
Your ego and the (name) game are about to cease.
You are about to be set face to face with the Clear Light
You are about to experience it in its reality.
In the ego−free state, wherein all things are like the void and cloudless sky,
And the naked spotless intellect is like a transparent vacuum;
At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state.
O (name of voyager),
That which is called ego−death is coming to you.
Remember:
This is now the hour of death and rebirth;
Take advantage of this temporary death to obtain the perfect state −
Enlightenment.
[...]{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=49}}}}

==Scientific Research==
===Stanislav Grof===
Stanislav Grof has researched the effects of psychedelic substances,{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=xi}} which can also be induced by nonpharmacological means.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=xiii-xiv}} Grof has developed a "cartography of the psyche" based on his clinical work with psychedelics,{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=xvi}} which describe the "basic types of experience that become available to an average person" when using psychedelics or "various powerful non-pharmacological experiential techniques".{{sfn|grof|1988|p=xvi}}

According to Grof, traditional psychiatry, psychology and psychotherapy use a model of the human personality that is limited to biography and the individual consciousness, as described by Freud.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=1}} This model is inadequate to describe the experiences which result from the use of psychedelics and the use of "powerful techniques", which activate and mobilize "deep unconscious and superconscious levels of the human psyche".{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=1}} These levels include:{{sfn|Grof|1988}}
* The Sensory Barrier and the Recollective-Biographical Barrier
* The Perinatal Matrices:
** BPM I: The Amniotic Universe. Maternal womb; symbiotic unity of the fetus with the maternal organism; lack of boundaries and obstructions;
** BPM II: Cosmic Engulfment and No Exit. Onset of labor; alteration of blissful connection with the mother and its pristine universe;
** BPM III: The Death-Rebirth Struggle. Movement through the birth channel and struggle for survival;
** BPM IV: The Death-Rebirth Experience. Birth and release.
* The Transpersonal Dimensions of the Psyche

Ego death appears in the fourth Perinatal Matrix.{{sfn|Grof|1988}} This matrix is related to the stage of delivery, the actual birth of the child.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=29}} The build up of tension, pain and anxiety is suddenly released.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=29}} The symbolic counterpart is the ''Death-Rebirth Experience'', in which the individual may have a strong feeling of impending catastrophe, and may be desperately struggling to stop this process.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=30}} The transition from BPM III to BPM IV may involve a sense of total annihilation:{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=30}}

{{quote|This experience of ''ego death'' seems to entail an instant merciless destruction of all previous reference points in the life of the individual.{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=30}}}}

According to Grof what dies in this process is "a basically paranoid attitude toward the world which reflects the negative experience of the subject during childbirth and later".{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=30}} When experienced in its final and most complete form,

{{quote|...ego death means an irreversible end to one's philosophical identification with what [[Alan Watts]] called ''skin-encapsulated ego''."{{sfn|Grof|1988|p=30}}}}

===Recent research===
Recent research also mentions that ego loss is sometimes experienced by those under the influence of [[psychedelic drugs]].{{sfn|Lyvers|Meester|2012}}

The Ego-Dissolution Inventory is a validated self-report questionnaire that allows for the measurement of transient ego-dissolution experiences occasioned by psychedelic drugs. {{sfn|Nour|2016}}

==View of Spiritual Traditions==
Following the interest in psychedelics and spirituality, the term "ego death" has been used to describe the eastern notion of "enlightenment" (''[[bodhi]]'') or ''[[moksha]]''.

===Buddhism===

Zen practice is said to lead to ego-death.{{sfn|Safran|2012}} Ego-death is also called "great death", in contrast to the physical "small death".{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|2010}} According to Jin Y. Park, the ego death that Buddhism encourages makes an end to the "usually-unconsciousness-and-automated quest" to understand the sense-of-self as a thing, instead of as a process.{{sfn|Park|2006|p=78}} According to Park, meditation is learning how to die by learning to "forget" the sense of self:{{sfn|Park|2006|p=78}}

{{quote|Enlightenment occurs when the usually automatized reflexivity of consciousness ceases, which is experienced as a letting-go and falling into the [[Sunyata|void]] and being wiped out of existence [...] [W]hen consciousness stops trying to catch its own tail, I become nothing, and discover that I am everything.{{sfn|Park|2006|p=78-79}}}}

According to Welwood, "egolessness" is a common experience. Egolessness appears "in the gaps and spaces between thoughts, which usually go unnoticed".{{sfn|Welwood|2014}} Existential anxiety arises when one realizes that the feeling of "I" is nothing more than a perception. According to Welwood, only egoless awareness allows us to face and accept death in all forms.{{sfn|Welwood|2014}}

David Loy also mentions the fear of death,{{sfn|Loy|2000}} and the need to undergo ego-death to realize our true nature.{{sfn|Loy|2000|p=22}}{{sfn|Loy|2003|p=4}} According to Loy, our fear of egolessness may even be stronger than our fear of death.{{sfn|Loy|2000}}

"Egolessness" is not the same as ''[[anatta]]'', non-self. ''Anatta'' means not to take the constituents of the person as a permanent entity:

{{quote|the Buddha, almost ad nauseam, spoke against wrong identification with the Five Aggregates, or the same, wrong identification with the psychophysical believing it is our self. These aggregates of form, feeling, thought, inclination, and sensory consciousness, he went on to say, were illusory; they belonged to Mara the Evil One; they were impermanent and painful.  And for these reasons, the aggregates cannot be our self. &lt;ref group=web name="Zennist"&gt;[http://zennist.typepad.com/zenfiles/2010/01/the-murkiness-of-egolessness.html Zennist (January 12, 2010), ''The murkiness of egolessness'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bernadette Roberts===

[[Bernadette Roberts]] makes a distinction between "no ego" and "no self".{{sfn|Shore|2004}}{{sfn|Roberts|2004}} According to Roberts, the falling away of the ego is not the same as the falling away of the self.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p=49}} "No ego" comes prior to the unitive state; with the falling away of the unitive state comes "no self".{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p=49-50}} "Ego" is defined by Roberts as

{{quote|... the immature self or consciousness prior to the falling away of its self-center and the revelation of a divine center.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p=52}}}}

Roberts defines "self" as

{{quote|... the totality of consciousness, the entire human dimension of knowing, feeling and experiencing from the consciousness and unconsciousness to the unitive, transcendental or God-consciousness.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p=52}}}}

Ultimately, all experiences on which these definitions are based are wiped out or dissolved.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p=52}} Jeff Shore further explains that "no self" means "the permanent ceasing, the falling away once and for all, of the entire mechanism of reflective self-consciousness".{{sfn|Shore|2004|p=xi}}

According to Roberts, both the Buddha and Christ embody the falling away of self, and the state of "no self". The falling away is represented by the Buddha prior to his enlightenment, starving himself by ascetic practices, and by the dying Jesus on the cross; the state of "no self" is represented by the enlightened Buddha with his serenity, and by the resurrected Christ.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p=52}}

==Integration after Ego-death experiences==
===Psychedelics===
According to Nick Bromell, ego death is a tempering though frightening experience, which may lead to a reconciliation with the insight that there is no real self.{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=79}}

According to Grof, death crises may occur over a series of psychedelic sessions until they cease to lead to panic. A conscious effort not to panic may lead to a "pseudohallucinatory sense of transcending physical death".{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}} According to Merkur,

{{quote|Repeated experience of the death crisis and its confrontation with the idea of physical death leads finally to an acceptance of personal mortality, without further illusions. The death crisis is then greeted with equanimity.{{sfn|Merkur|1998|p=60}}}}

===Vedanta and Zen===
Both the Vedanta and the Zen-Buddhist tradition warn that insight into the emptiness of the self, or so-called "enlightenment experiences", are not sufficient; further practice is necessary.

Jacobs warns that Advaita Vedanta practice takes years of committed practice to sever the "occlusion"{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=84}} of the so-called "[[Vāsanā|vasanas]], [[Sanskara (philosophy)|samskaras]], [[Kosha|bodily sheaths]] and [[vritti]]s", and the "granthi{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/durga/heartknot_durga.htm The Knot of the Heart]}} or knot forming identification between [[Brahman|Self]] and mind".{{sfn|Jacobs|2004|p=85}}

Zen Buddhist training does not end with [[kenshō]], or insight into one's [[Buddha nature|true nature]]. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=54, 140}} According to Hakuin, the main aim of [[Dharma transmission#Further practice|"post-satori practice"]]{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxv-xxvii}}{{sfn|Hisamatsu|2002|p=22}} (''gogo no shugyo''{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}} or ''kojo'', "going beyond"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=144}}) is to cultivate the [[Bodhicitta|"Mind of Enlightenment"]].{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}} According to [[Yamada Koun]], "if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho".{{sfn|MacInnes|2007|p=75}}

===Dark Night and depersonalisation===
{{See also|Depersonalisation}}
Shinzen Young, an American Buddhist teacher, has pointed at the difficulty integrating the experience of no self. He calls this "the Dark Night", or

{{quote|... "falling into the Pit of the Void." It entails an authentic and irreversible insight into Emptiness and No Self.  What makes it problematic is that the person interprets it as a bad trip. Instead of being empowering and fulfilling, the way Buddhist literature claims it will be, it turns into the opposite. In a sense, it's Enlightenment's Evil Twin.&lt;ref group=web name="Shinzen"/&gt;}}

Willoughby Britton is conducting research on such phenomena which may occur during meditation, in a research program called "The Dark Night of the Soul".&lt;ref group=web name="DK1"/&gt; She has searched texts from various traditions to find descriptions of difficult periods on the spiritual path,&lt;ref group=web name="DK2"/&gt; and conducted interviews to find out more on the difficult sides of meditation.&lt;ref group=web name="DK1"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also [http://hardcorezen.info/zen-freak-outs/2865 Brad Warner (June 27, 2014), ''Zen Freak Outs!'']}}

==Influence==
{{See also|Timothy Leary#Influence|l1=Influence of Timothy Leary}}

The propagation of LSD-induced "mystical experiences", and the concept of ego death, had some influence in the 1960s, but Leary's brand of LSD-spirituality never "quite caught on".{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=222}}

===Reports of psychedelic experiences===
Leary's terminology influenced the understanding and description of the effects of psychedelics. Various reports by hippies of their psychedelic experiences describe states of diminished consciousness which were labelled as "ego death", but do not match Leary's descriptions.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=225-227}} Panic attacks were occasionally also labeled as "ego death".{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=227}}

===The Beatles===
John Lennon read ''The Psychedelic Experience'', and was strongly affected by it.{{sfn|Conners|2013}} He wrote "Tomorrow Never Knows" after reading the book, as a guide for his LSD-trips.{{sfn|Conners|2013}} Lennon took about a thousand acid-trips, but it only exacerbated his personal difficulties.{{sfn|Lee|Shlain|1992|p=182-183}} He eventually stopped using the drug. George Harrison and Paul McCartney also concluded that LSD use didn't result in any worthwhile changes.{{sfn|Lee|Shlain|1992|p=183-184}}

===Radical pluralism===
According to Bromell, the experience of ego death confirms a radical pluralism that most people experience in their youth, but prefer to flee from, instead believing in a stable self and a fixed reality.{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=80}} He further states this also led to a different attitude among youngsters in the 1960s, rejecting the lifestyle of their parents as being deceitful and false.{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=80}}

==Criticisms of ego death==

The relationship between ego death and LSD has been disputed. [[Hunter S. Thompson]], who tried LSD,{{sfn|Stephenson|2011}} saw a self-centered base in Leary's work, noting that Leary placed himself at the centre of his texts, using his persona as "an exemplary ego, not a dissolved one". {{sfn|Stephenson|2011}}  Dan Merkur notes that the use of LSD in combination with Leary's manual often did not lead to ego-death, but to horrifying bad trips.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=222-223}}

The relationship between LSD use and enlightenment has also been criticized. [[Sōtō]]-[[Zen]] teacher [[Brad Warner]] has repeatedly criticized the idea that psychedelic experiences lead to "enlightenment experiences".{{refn|group=note|See:
* [http://hardcorezen.blogspot.nl/2011/07/psychedelic-experience.html Brad Warner (Saturday, July 09, 2011), ''The Psychedelic Experience'']
* [http://hardcorezen.blogspot.nl/2011/07/mountain-of-drugs.html brad Warner (Wednesday, July 13, 2011), ''Mountain of Drugs'']

* [http://realitysandwich.com/102001/zen_trickster/ realitysandwich.com, ''Zen Trickster: A Talk with Brad Warner'']}} In response to ''The Psychedelic Experience'' he wrote:

{{quote|While I was at Starwood, I was getting mightily annoyed by all the people out there who were deluding themselves and others into believing that a cheap dose of acid, 'shrooms, peyote, "molly" or whatever was going to get them to a higher spiritual plane [...] While I was at that campsite I sat and read most of the book ''The Psychedelic Experience'' by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (aka Baba Ram Dass, later of Be Here Now fame). It's a book about the authors' deeply mistaken reading of the Tibetan Book of the Dead as a guide for the drug taking experience [...] It was one thing to believe in 1964 that a brave new tripped out age was about to dawn. It's quite another to still believe that now, having seen what the last 47 years have shown us about where that path leads. If you want some examples, how about Jimi Hendrix, Sid Vicious, Syd Barrett, John Entwistle, Kurt Cobain... Do I really need to get so cliched with this? Come on now.&lt;ref group=web name="BW_PE" /&gt;}}

The concept that ego-death or a similar experience might be considered a common basis for religion has been disputed by scholars in religious studies {{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} Scholars have also criticized Leary and Alpert's attempt to tie ego-death and psychedelics with Tibetan Buddhism. John Myrdhin Reynolds, has disputed Leary and Jung's use of the Evans-Wentz's translation of the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead,'' arguing that it introduces a number of misunderstandings about [[Dzogchen]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} Reynolds argues that Evans-Wentz's was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} and that his view of Tibetan Buddhism was "fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist".{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=78}} Nonetheless, Reynolds confirms that the nonsubstantiality of the ego is the ultimate goal of the Hinayana system .{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=44}}

In [[epistemology]], '''foundherentism''' is a [[theory of justification]] that combines elements from the two rival theories addressing [[infinite regress]], [[foundationalism]] prone to arbitrariness, and [[coherentism]] prone to circularity (problems raised by the [[Münchhausen trilemma]]).

==Overview==
Foundherentism was developed and defended by [[Susan Haack]] in ''Evidence and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-11851-9 |publication-place = Oxford, UK |title = Evidence and Inquiry |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1398949M/Evidence_and_inquiry |first=Susan|last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|edition = Evidence and inquiry |publication-date = 1993 |id = 0631118519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, [[foundationalism]] holds that [[basic belief]]s unilaterally support derived beliefs, with support always directed from the former to the latter; [[coherentism]] holds that beliefs mutually support each other when they belong to the same coherent belief-set. As these theories were refined, however, some foundationalists began to admit that even basic beliefs could be fallible, and that derived beliefs could mutually support each other; whereas some coherentists began to admit that experiential beliefs should be weighted so as to reflect realistic degrees of coherence or justification. So the rival theories began to lean closer together. Moreover, those foundationalists who wondered why there couldn't be mutual support between basic and derived beliefs were in danger of falling into coherentism. Those coherentists who wondered why experiential beliefs should be weighted more heavily than others were also falling into foundationalism.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Haack argues that foundationalism and coherentism don't exhaust the field, and that an intermediate theory is more plausible than either. It is possible to include the relevance of experience for the justification of empirical beliefs, as experientialist foundationalism does but coherentism does not, and at the same time, instead of requiring a privileged class of basic beliefs, to allow for pervasive mutual dependence among beliefs, as coherentism does but foundationalism does not. These are the key ideas of foundherentism. Precursors to Haack's view include [[Bertrand Russell]]'s epistemology, in which both empirical foundations and coherence are components of justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=Problems of Philosophy|year=1912|url=http://www.ditext.com/russell/rus2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Haack introduces the analogy of the [[crossword]] puzzle to serve as a way of understanding how there can be mutual support among beliefs (as there is mutual support among crossword entries) without vicious circularity. The analogy between the structure of evidence and the crossword puzzle helps with another problem too. The clues to a crossword are the analogue of a person's experiential evidence, and the already-completed intersecting entries are the analogue of his reasons for a belief. She claims that her metaphor has proven particularly fruitful in her own work, and has been found useful by many readers, not only philosophers but also scientists, economists, legal scholars, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haack|first=Susan|title=Evidence Matters: Science, Proof, and Truth in the Law|year=2014|url=https://www.academia.edu/20018761/Legal_Probabilism_An_Epistemological_Dissent_2014_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Franz Ulrich Theodor Aepinus''' (December 13, 1724{{snd}}August 10, 1802) was a [[Germans|German]] and [[Russian Empire]] [[natural philosopher]]. Aepinus is best known for his researches, theoretical and experimental, in [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]].

==Life==

He was born at [[Rostock]] in the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. He was descended from [[Johannes Aepinus]] (1499–1553), the first to adopt the Greek form (αἰπεινός) of the family name Hugk or Huck, and a leading theologian and controversialist at the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After studying [[medicine]] for a time, Franz Aepinus devoted himself to the physical and mathematical sciences, in which he soon gained such distinction that he was admitted a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1755 he was briefly the director of the [[Astronomisches Rechen-Institut]].  In 1757 he settled in [[St Petersburg]] as member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and professor of physics, and remained there till his retirement in 1798. The rest of his life was spent at [[Tartu|Dorpat]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aepinus, Franz Ulrich Theodor |volume=1|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He enjoyed the favor of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], who appointed him tutor to her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], and endeavoured, without success, to establish normal schools throughout the empire under his direction.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  In 1761, Aepinus was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1764, he was appointed as a head of the cryptographic service of Russia, and held this position till 1797, during 33 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Works==
[[File:Aepinus.png|thumb|Title page of his 1759 book]]
His principal work, ''Tentamen Theoriae Electricitatis et Magnetismi'' (An Attempt at a Theory of Electricity and Magnetism), published at St Petersburg in 1759, was the first systematic attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to these subjects. 
He also published a treatise, in 1761, ''De Distributione Caloris per Tellurem'' (On the Distribution of Heat in the Earth), and he was the author of memoirs on different subjects in [[astronomy]], [[mechanics]], [[optics]] and pure [[mathematics]], contained in the journals of the learned societies of St Petersburg and Berlin. His discussion of the effects of [[parallax]] in the transit of a planet over the sun's disc excited great interest, having appeared (in 1764) between the dates of the two transits of [[Venus]] that took place in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

==Electrical theories==
Aepinus and [[Henry Cavendish]] devised theories of electricity which were essentially the same, yet had been framed without any communication between these two philosophers. Aepinus however published his theory about ten years before that of Cavendish.  These are essentially modern theories which eventually put to rest the idea of two fluids.
[[File:Могила Эпинуса.jpg|thumb|Aepinus gravestone in [[Raadi cemetery]], [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]] ]]
Their theories said that 
* ''... the electric fluid is a substance, the particles of which repel each other, and attract the particles of all other matter, with a force inversely as the square of distance.'' [the square law was added later]
* ''The particles of all other matter also repel each other, and attract those of the electric fluid with a force varying according to the same law.  Or, if we consider the electric fluid as matter different from all other matter, the particles of all matter, both those of the electric fluid, and of other matter, repel particles of the same kind, and attract those of a contrary kind, with a force inversely as the square of the distance.''

Cavendish and Aepinus believed that the electric fluid was 
* ''another sort of matter. ... Its weight in any body probably bears a very small proportion to the weight of the matter in the body, but yet the force with which the electric fluid in any body attracts any particle of matter in that body, must be equal to the force with which the matter of the body repels that particle, otherwise the body would appear electrical, as will afterwards appear.''
In effect, they are imagining the 'electric fluid' as consisting of electrons with almost no mass, but still with substantial electrical attractive and repulsive power.  Static electricity then becomes a matter of a superabundance of electrons in one body, and a shortage of electrons in another.

[[File:"Freedom from Fear" - NARA - 513538.jpg|thumb|''Freedom from Fear'' from painter [[Norman Rockwell]], c. 1943]]
'''Freedom from fear''' is listed as a fundamental [[human right]] according to [[The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. On January 6, 1941, [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] called it one of the "[[Four Freedoms]]" at his [[State of the Union]], which was afterwards therefore referred to as the "Four Freedoms Speech."&lt;ref name="4FS"&gt;Roosvelt, Franklin Delano (January 6, 1941) [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrthefourfreedoms.htm ''The Four Freedoms''], American Rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In his speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt formulated freedom from fear as follows: "The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbour—anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="4FS" /&gt;

The four freedoms of Roosevelt formed an important pillar of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] that were adopted on December 10, 1948, by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfredsson, Gudmundur &amp; Asbjørn Eide (1999) ''The Universal UN Declaration of Human Rights: A Common Standard of Achievement'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;pg=PA523 page 524], Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, {{ISBN|978-9041111685}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom from fear is mentioned in the preamble of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''Universal Declarations of Human Rights'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
In 1943 painter [[Norman Rockwell]] created ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'', in his series of four paintings called ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''.

It is an important concept for [[Burma|Burmese]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who published a book on it in 1991 with the title ''[[Freedom from Fear (Aung San Suu Kyi)|Freedom from Fear]]''. In 1999 historian [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]] published a book called ''[[Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945]]''.

His book describes a theory of how a computer program might be implemented to learn and use new concepts that have not been programmed into it. It introduces the [[Schema Mechanism]], a general learning and concept-building mechanism inspired by [[Jean Piaget]]'s account of human cognitive development.

The Schema Mechanism is intended to replicate key aspects of cognitive development during infancy. It takes Piaget's theory of human development as source of inspiration for an artificial learning mechanism; and it extends and tests Piaget's theory by seeing whether a specific mechanism that works according to Piagetian themes actually exhibits Piagetian abilities.

He was a Visiting Fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies at [[Tufts University]], which is directed by the American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]. As a result of his studies there, he has written a book, [[Good and Real (book)|''Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics'']], in which he defends a rigorously mechanistic materialism. In this book, he discusses [[quantum mechanics]], defending the Everett or [[Everett interpretation|Multiple Worlds Interpretation]], against the dominant [[Copenhagen Interpretation]]. Among other things, he argues that the Everett Interpretation of quantum mechanics, allows for a completely [[Determinism|determinist]] outlook, and it undermines the views of those (like [[Roger Penrose]]) who hold that quantum mechanics can give us some special insights into the nature of consciousness. In this book, Drescher also provides treatments of the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] and [[Newcomb's paradox|Newcomb's Problem]] in order to build a defense of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]] and Kant's [[categorical imperative]] which does not require that we posit anything beyond the physical world as understood by the natural sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">'''Hendrik Gerhardus  Stoker''' (1899 &amp;ndash; 1993), born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, was a leading [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[philosopher]] who taught at [[Potchefstroom Campus|Potchefstroom]] (PU). He studied at PU and the [[University of Cologne]], and he completed his [[doctorate|doctoral]] [[dissertation]] on "Nature and the forms of [[conscience]]" under [[Max Scheler]].[http://www.redeemer.on.ca/~tplant/m/REFCCR.HTM] 

Stoker taught at PU from 1925 to 1970.  He developed a unique strand of Calvinistic Philosophy called "Wysbegeerte van die skeppingsidee" or translated in English "Philosophy of the creation-idea".  He's disagreed with [[Dooyeweerd]] and [[Vollenhoven]] who called their Philosophy "[[Wijsbegeerte van die Wetsidee]]" or translated "[[Philosophy of the cosmonomic idea]]", because the creation was more encompassing principle for Stoker than the laws of creation.  The name had the further benefit for Stoker that it was distinctly Christian, while the use of the term "law" instead of "creation" was preferred by Dooyeweerd and Vollenhoven.  

Stoker is however not remembered for his unique variation of [[Christian Philosophy]] but for his defence of [[Apartheid]] in South Africa. 
He was a member of the [[Gereformeerde Kerke van Suid Afrika]] and a friend of the Theologian and Poet [[Totius (poet)|Totius]].  He advocated educational segregation for Africans, whites and Coloured people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Elphick, T. R. H. ''Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History''. University of California Press. Davenport. pp. 373-373&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned during 1942 to 1943 for his anti-[[England]] stance and his pro-[[Afrikaans]] and pro-[[Germany|German]] sympathies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''Henry James Richter''' (1772–1857), artist and philosopher, was born in Middlesex, possibly at 40 Great Newport Street, Soho, on 8 March 1772 and baptised at [[St Anne's Church, Soho]], on 5 April at that same year.&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|last=Cust |first=Lionel |authorlink=Lionel Cust |volume=48 |pages=260-261 |wstitle=Richter, Henry James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Henry James was the second son (of five children) of John Augustus Richter and Mary Haig. John was originally from [[Dresden, Germany]] and was an artist, engraver, and [[Scagliola|scagliolist]], well known for his works in imitation of marble.&lt;ref name="Cust"&gt;{{cite ODNB|last1=Cust |first1=Lionel |last2=Wootton |first2=David |id=23599 |date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Augustus Richter was a partner with [[Domenico Bartoli]] another scagliolist in London beginning in 1767 and continuing through the 1777 or 1778. Bartoli emigrated from the port city of Livorn, Italy (often referred to in English as Leghorn) and, after working for almost 10 years with Richter, moved on to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://217.204.55.158/henrymoore/sculptor/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=141 The Henry Moore Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140608183633/http://217.204.55.158/henrymoore/sculptor/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=141 |date=8 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable item the elder Richter produced was a child's building blocks set called Richter's Anchor Blocks (an example of which is currently in the collection of the UK National Trust Museum of Childhood.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/660330 UK National Trust Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's older brother, John Richter (1769?–1830), was a prominent radical politician, and member of the [[London Corresponding Society]]. He was later arrested for high treason and incarcerated briefly in the [[Tower of London]]. In 1794, the Richter brothers compiled and printed [[John Milton]]'s book of poems called [[Paradise Lost]] which included 13 illustrations done by Henry James. The book was dedicated and presented to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|His Royal Highness George, Prince of Wales]] while John Richter was on trial for treason.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Joseph (2011).

He had a sister, Elizabeth Richter, who married Rev. James Stuart Freeman around July 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine (London, England)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H20dAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1039|year=1808|publisher=F. Jefferies|pages=1039–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter was educated at Dr Barrow's school, Soho and [[St Martin's Library School]], London.&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt; In about 1787, he began instruction under the artist [[Thomas Stothard]], with whom he remained a close friend. He also began an association with [[William Blake]].&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt; In 1788 he produced his first illustrations (to Shakespeare's plays), and first exhibited paintings, showing two landscapes at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited for many years. He became a student of the [[Royal Academy Schools]] in 1790, and reportedly studied anatomy.

==Career==
Throughout the 1790s Richter worked mainly as an illustrator, demonstrating skills as both draftsman and engraver; projects included editions of [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Sir Charles Grandison]]'' and ''[[Clarissa Harlowe]]'' (with others, both 1793), [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[Lives of the English Poets]]'' (with others, 1797), and J.-H. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul and Virginia (1799).&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt; In 1809 Richter began to exhibit at the Associated Artists in Water Colours, Bond Street, becoming a member in 1810, and president in 1811–12. His most popular work at this stage was the genre subject A Brute of a Husband, though he also established himself as a literary painter, with depictions of such characters as Don Quixote and Falstaff, and became one of the few notable artists to paint historical subjects in watercolour. With the dissolution of the Associated Artists in Water Colours in 1812 he was elected a member of the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours, though he resigned his membership in December of the same year, and until 1820 was represented on its walls only as an exhibitor. (In that year the society returned to its original form as the Society of Painters in Water Colours.)

Richter was a pioneer in painting from nature, in both practice and theory. In 1812 he painted the oil ''Christ Giving Sight to the Blind'', in bright sunlight on the roof of his house in Newman Street; the work was purchased by the trustees of the [[British Institution]] for 500 guineas and later presented to the New Church, Greenwich, completed in 1825, where it was installed as an altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Bryan1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Bryan|title=Dictionary of painters and engravers: biographical and critical|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6IZAAAAYAAJ|year=1889|publisher=G. Bell and sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second version, attempting to improve on its truth to nature, was exhibited four years later. Then, in 1817, he published the pamphlet Daylight: a recent discovery in the art of painting, with hints on the philosophy of the fine arts, and on that of the human mind, as first dissected by [[Immanuel Kant]]. His more general ideas, including his approach to color and use of models of his compositions in clay or wax, influenced other painters, notably the miniature painter [[James Holmes (artist)|James Holmes]]. Daylight combined his artistic interests with his study of metaphysical philosophy. Richter also wrote the article 'Metaphysics' in the Encyclopaedia Londonensis and a paper, German Transcendentalism (1855).&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Thomas Story|title=James Holmes and John Varley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR-aAAAAIAAJ|year=1894|publisher=R. Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 Richter was again elected to the [[Royal Watercolour Society|Society of Painters in Water Colours]], though his membership and the frequency of his exhibits varied through the decade. But from 1829 until his death he was both a member and a frequent exhibitor. The subjects of his most ambitious paintings of this later phase were taken from Shakespeare. He was also known for drawings and engravings of characters of [[Sir Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/view/all/who/Richter,+Henry+James The University of Edinburgh image collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

His work became highly popular through reproductive engravings and, from 1828, through the illustrations he produced for annuals such as the Forget-me-Not and Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833; The painting, ''The School in an Uproar'', was reproduced in several variations and even printed on pocket handkerchiefs. He reportedly produced as many as 150 works in the form of drawings, engravings and paintings. Some examples of his work are in the British Museum and in private collections. [[File:"The Love Letter" painting by Henry James Richter.jpg|thumb|The painting The Love Letter, currently in a private collection.]]The painting, ''The Love Letter'' was shows two characters taken from Sir Walter Scott's [[The Antiquary]] and was painted between 1816–1833. A poem of the same name was authored by [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] who was noted for creating literary pieces based on drawings and paintings and well known during that period in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook, London Fisher, Son and Co. 1833. Pages 58–59.[http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/annuals/id/9700/rec/1]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts the Mrs Mailsetter in an admonishing pose and Jenny Caxon the recipient of a love letter from her older, male beau, Lieutenant Richard Taffril, who was away at sea. An engraving by Charles Rolls of the painting and the poem were published side-by-side in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833 (London, UK Fisher Jackson). Rolls contributed by engraving a number of drawings and paintings done by Richter. It is believed that the painting may have been based on the drawing and subsequent engraving of a different view of the scene. This engraving has been referenced by the titles ''One Peep Was Enough'' and ''At the Post Office'' showing Mrs Mailsetter, Jenny and two other characters; Mrs Heukbane and Mrs Shortcake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://illustratingscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/itemshow/616 Illustrating Scott. The Antiquary 1832 Engraving]&lt;/ref&gt;

Richter was married twice: first, at Marylebone on 9 July 1808, to Elizabeth née Smith; and second, at Marylebone on 2 May 1818, to Charlotte Sophia née Edson (d. 1862). He had at least two sons and two daughters. On 8 April 1857, Henry James Richter died at his home at 101 Lisson Grove, London. He was 85. At the time of his death, he was translating a metaphysical work by J. S. Beck, a former student of Kant. His daughter Henrietta Sophia Richter (1813–1896) was a successful amateur portrait painter, who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1842 to 1849. His son [[Henry Constantine Richter]] (1821–1902) became a well recognised draftsman and lithographer, noted for his illustrations of birds and mammals which were reproduced in the works of the English ornithologist and bird artist, [[John Gould]].

[[File:Mappa di Eratostene.jpg|thumb|250px|The Hellenistic world where Alexander tried to rule his new Empire through the concept of Homonoia]]
'''Homonoia''' ({{lang-gr|Ὁμόνοια}}) is the concept of order and unity, ''being of one mind together''&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"&gt;[[#refMauriac1949|Mauriac 1949]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Tarn p. 400"&gt;[[#refTarn2002|Tarn 2002]], p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''union of hearts''.&lt;ref name="theosociety.org"&gt;{{cite web |date= October 1974 |url = http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/24-74-5/br-gfk2.htm |title = Of One Mind, of One Heart |work= [[Sunrise (magazine)|Sunrise Magazine]] |publisher = theosociety.org | accessdate = October 13, 2009 | last=Knoche, Grace F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by the Greeks to create unity in the politics of classical Greece.  It saw widespread use when [[Alexander the Great]] adopted its principles to govern his [[King of Asia|vast Empire]].

==Interpretation==

===Classical Greeks===
The concept of Homonoia was an ancient Greek concept which traditionally was not applied beyond their own culture.  The Greeks viewed Homonoia as an absence of factional fighting in their city states.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt; The Greeks viewed outside cultures as "barbarians".  The famed scholar [[Aristotle]] once told his student, a young Alexander the Great, "treat Greeks as friends, but [non-Greeks] as animals."&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt;

It was the scholar [[Isocrates]] who first looked beyond the Greek people.  While he didn't preach that the savages of the non-Greek world could be on par with the superior Greek people, he did believe they could be made Greek and thus be ''of one mind together''.  He claimed that Greekness could become a matter of nurture rather than nature.&lt;ref name= "Low p. 62"&gt;[[#refLow2007|Low 2007]], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time spent in the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]] that Isocrates was able to teach the concept to an influential audience.  Philip II took much of the concept to heart, but he too viewed it as a method reserved for the Greeks. He used the concept as his driving force behind creating the [[League of Corinth|Corinthian League]], an alliance to unite the Greek States for a war against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].  After Philip II was [[assassinated]] his son Alexander the Great became King of Macedonia and himself became a proponent of Homonoia.

===Alexander the Great===

Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, viewed non-Greeks as barbarian animals.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt; Alexander however, ignored his teacher's indication and expanded on the concept of Homonoia.  With an Empire covering most of the known world, Alexander sought to rule his subjects, whether they were Greek, Persian or Egyptian, under the concept of Homonoia.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 106"/&gt; In his short time as ruler of his vast Empire he tried to adopt customs of the cultures he conquered such as Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians paid to their social superiors.&lt;ref name= "Arrian VII, 11"&gt;[[#refArrian1983|Arrian 1983]], VII, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He also married the officers of his army to Persian wives in an effort to further create a sense of oneness in his new Empire.&lt;ref name= "Tetlow p. 171"&gt;[[#refTetlow2005|Tetlow 2005]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his policies he wanted to create a new Greco-Oriental empire as distinct from the more traditional system of a small ruling class of conquerors ruling over the recently vanquished.  It was his practice to place the old style Persian satrap as governors but in the newly created offices of taxation and finance he placed Macedonians.&lt;ref name= "Mauriac p. 108"&gt;[[#refMauriac1949|Mauriac 1949]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death most of his reforms lived on even as the Empire fragmented into [[Diadochi|successor states]].

===In the Romanized East===
''Homonoia'' was extended under Roman rule in the highly urbanized East as a symbolic mechanism for dealing with intra-city tensions and for linking the sometimes intensely individual eastern city-states.&lt;ref name= "Price pp. 126-32"&gt;{{harvnb|Price|1985| pp=126–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''temple of Homonoia'' at [[Aphrodisias]] in Caria appears as the setting for the wedding of Callirhoe and Dionysios in the first-century CE romance ''[[Chariton|Chaereas and Callirhoe]]''; the temple is objectified in coinage of Aphrodisias that shows the [[cult statue]] of Aphrodite of Aphrodisias with those of other cities, under the legend ''homonoia'': "Deities in the coin issues served as symbols that mediated the power within regional alliances, bolstered the prestige of the divine realm in human activity and provided the glue that bound together the political and the cosmic spheres."&lt;ref name= "Edwards p. 709"&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1994|p=709}} and bibliography&lt;br/&gt;Edwards notes several examples of ''homonoia'' coinage.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first century CE, the Greek [[rhetor]] [[Dio Chrysostom]] sought in one of his ''Discourses'' to establish ''homonoia'' between two cities that each claimed the sobriquet "first city", [[Nicaea]] and [[Nicopolis]].&lt;ref name= "Chrysostom 28.22"&gt;[[#refChrysostom1939|Chrysostom 1939]], 28.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hopi Hoekstra was born to a family of Dutch ancestry. Hoekstra's first name "Hopi" is derived from a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term of endearment.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Hoekstra attended a high-school near [[Palo Alto]], in California.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; She chose to attend college at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she initially intended to study [[political science]]. She chose the university because she wanted to play [[Pac-10]] volleyball, which she did for two years.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; She has stated that at one point she wanted to become the U.S. [[ambassador]] to the Netherlands, but she was drawn into biology by a class on [[biomechanics]] taught by [[Robert J. Full]]. She went on to work in Full's lab, studying [[cockroach]] [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. However, she later stated that she had a passion for fieldwork and for mice even at that point.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Career==
Hopi Hoekstra received her B.A. in Integrative Biology from UC Berkeley.  Before her graduate studies, she worked on [[grizzly bear]]s for a year in Yellowstone National Park. She obtained her Ph.D. in [[Zoology]] as a Howard Hughes Predoctoral Fellow at the [[University of Washington|University of Washington, Seattle]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For her postdoctoral work, she studied the genetic basis of adaptive melanism in pocket mice at the [[University of Arizona]].

==Research==
Hoekstra is best known for her “elegant and inventive research” studying the genetic mechanisms that influence the evolution of highly complex natural behaviors.&lt;ref name="nytimes2013-01-16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gorman|first1=James|title=Study Discovers DNA That Tells Mice How to Construct Their Homes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/science/mouse-study-discovers-dna-that-controls-behavior.html|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hoekstra published an article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on the [[genetics]] of burrowing behavior in two sister species of ''Peromyscus'' mice;  the [[oldfield mouse]] (''P. polionotus''), which builds elaborate burrows complete with an escape tunnel, and the deer mouse (''P. maniculatis''), which builds a simple and shallow nest.&lt;ref name="nytimes2013-01-16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The study is unusual for dealing with a highly complex natural behavior.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Using a combination of behavioral assays and classical genetic strategies, Hoekstra and her students identified four regions of [[DNA]], which control the length of the tunnels dug by the mice.&lt;ref name="nytimes2013-01-16"/&gt; With these sections of DNA in mind, Hoekstra is currently trying to narrow down the specific [[gene]]s that control tunneling behavior in mice.&lt;ref name="nytimes2013-01-16"/&gt; Students in her lab are also studying the connections between digging behavior and the neurobiology of reward.&lt;ref name="nytimes2013-01-16"/&gt;

She has also previously studied the evolution of the color of mice coats, and its significance for [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In 2013 her team published a paper in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', describing how coat color in mice was controlled by nine separate mutations within a single gene, named "agouti."&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt; Speaking about this discovery, Hoekstra said "The question has always been whether evolution is dominated by these big leaps or smaller steps. When we first implicated the agouti gene, we could have stopped there and concluded that evolution takes these big steps as only one major gene was involved, but that would have been wrong. When we looked more closely, within this gene, we found that even within this single locus, there are, in fact, many small steps."&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt; Her work supports the hypothesis that [[Evolution|evolution]] can occur through incremental changes.&lt;ref name="PNAS 2015"/&gt;

'''Human evolutionary developmental biology''' or informally '''human evo-devo''' is the human-specific subset of [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. Evolutionary developmental biology is the study of the evolution of [[developmental process]]es across different organisms. It is utilized within multiple disciplines, primarily evolutionary biology and [[anthropology]]. Groundwork for the theory that "evolutionary modifications in [[primate]] development might have led to … modern humans" was laid by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Louis Bolk]], and Adolph Schultz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mitteroecker | first=Philipp | last2=Bookstein | first2=Fred | date=2008-04-01 | title=The Evolutionary Role of Modularity and Integration in the Hominoid Cranium | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00321.x/abstract | journal=Evolution | volume=62 | issue=4 | pages=943–958 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00321.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary developmental biology is primarily concerned with the ways in which evolution affects development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Müller | first=Gerd B. | title=Evo–devo: extending the evolutionary synthesis | url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2219 | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=8 | issue=12 | pages=943–949 | doi=10.1038/nrg2219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to unravel the causes of evolutionary innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Guinard | first=Geoffrey | date=2012-12-01 | title=Evolutionary concepts meet the neck of penguins (Aves: Sphenisciformes), towards a "survival strategy" for evolutionary developmental biology | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12064-012-0156-1 | journal=Theory in Biosciences | volume=131 | issue=4 | pages=231–242 | doi=10.1007/s12064-012-0156-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach is relatively new, but has roots in Schultz's ''The physical distinctions of man,'' from the 1940s. Shultz urged broad comparative studies to identify uniquely human traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schultz | first=Adolph H. | year=1950 | title=The physical distinctions of Man | journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=94 | issue=5 | pp=428–449 |jstor=3143610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Brian Hall traces the roots of evolutionary developmental biology in his 2012 paper on its past present and future. He begins with [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] evolution and [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]'s genetics, noting the tendency of the followers of both men in the early 20th century to follow separate paths and to set aside and ignore apparently inexplicable problems.&lt;ref name="Hall 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://evolution-outreach.springeropen.com/ | title=Evolution: Education and Outreach | website=Evolution: Education and Outreach | doi=10.1007/s12052-012-0418-x | access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater understanding of genotypic and phenotypic structures from the 1940s enabled the unification of evolution and genetics in the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. [[Molecular biology]] then enabled researchers to explore the mechanisms and evolution of embryonic development in molecular detail, including in humans.&lt;ref name="Hall 2012" /&gt;

== Human and primate development ==
Many of the human evolutionary developmental biology studies have been modeled after primate studies and consider the two together in a comparative model. Brain ontogeny and human life history evolution were looked at by Leigh, in a 2006 paper. He compares brain growth patterns for ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' to get at the evolution of brain size and weight. Leigh found three different patterns, all of which pointed to the growth rate of ''H. erectus'' either matching or exceeding ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref name="Leigh 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Leigh | first=Steven R. | date=2012-12-01 | title=Brain Size Growth and Life History in Human Evolution | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9168-5 | journal=Evolutionary Biology | language=en | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=587–599 | doi=10.1007/s11692-012-9168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes the case that this finding had wide application and relevance t the overall study of human evolution. It is pertinent specifically to the connections between energy expenditure and brain development. These finding are of specific utility in studies on maternal energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="Leigh 2012" /&gt; Comparative study of nonhuman primates, fossils and modern humans to study patterns of brain growth to correlate human life history and brain growth.&lt;ref name="Leigh 2012" /&gt;

Jeremy De Silva and Julie Lesnik examined chimpanzee neonatal brain size to identify implications for brain growth in ''Homo erectus''. This changed the understanding of differences and similarities of post-natal brain growth in humans and [[chimpanzee]]s. The study found that there was a distinction necessary between growth time and growth rate.The times of growth were strikingly similar, but the rates were not. The paper further advocates the use of fossils to assess brain size in general and in relation to cranial capacity.&lt;ref name="DeSilva 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Cofran | first=Zachary | last2=DeSilva | first2=Jeremy M. | date=2015-04-01 | title=A neonatal perspective on Homo erectus brain growth | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248415000445 | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=81 | pages=41–47 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilization of endocranial volume as a measure for brain size has been a popular methodology with the fossil record since [[Darwinism | Darwin]] in the mid 1800s. This measure has been used to access the metabolic requirements for brain growth and the subsequent trade-offs.

=== Neoteny ===
Some of the work on human evolutionary developmental biology has centered around the [[Neoteny | neotenous]] features that present in humans, but are not shared across the primate spectrum. [[Stephen Jay Gould | Steven J. Gould]] discussed the presentation of neoteny with "terminal additions" in humans.{{sfn|Gould|1977|pp= }} Neoteny is defined as the delayed or slowed development in humans when compared with their non-human primate counterparts. The "terminal additions" were extensions or reductions in the rate and scope of stages of development and growth.{{sfn|Gould|1977|pp= }}{{pages needed|date=May 2017}} Gould hypothesized that this process and production of neoteny in humans might be the key feature that ultimately lead to the emotional and communicative nature of humans. He credits this factor as an integral facet of human evolution. However, there have also been cautions against the application of this aspect to group ranking during it inappropriate as a measure of evolutionary achievement.&lt;ref name="Pievani 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=JASs | url=http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/ContentsVol90.htm | doi=10.4436/jass.90016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil record ===

Early comparative and human studies examined the fossil record to measure features like cranial sizes and capacities so as to infer brain size, growth rate, total growth and potential implications for energy expenditure. Helpful as this is, the static nature of individual fossils presents its own challenge. The phylogenic fossil line is itself a hypothesis, so anything based upon it is equally hypothetical.&lt;ref name="McNulty 2005" /&gt;

Using the fossil record of Neanderthals, modern humans, and chimpanzees, Gunz et al. examined that patterns of endocranial development.&lt;ref name="Gunz 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gunz | first=Philipp | last2=Neubauer | first2=Simon | last3=Golovanova | first3=Lubov | last4=Doronichev | first4=Vladimir | last5=Maureille | first5=Bruno | last6=Hublin | first6=Jean-Jacques | year=2012 | title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development. Insights from a new cranial reconstruction of the Neandertal newborn from Mezmaiskaya | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248411002314 | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=62 | issue=2 | pages=300–313 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that there are common features shared between the three, and that modern humans diverge from these common patterns in the first year of life. They concluded that even though much of the developmental results are similar insofar as brain size, the trajectories by which they arrived are not shared. Most of the differences between the two arise post-natally, in the first year, with cognitive development.&lt;ref name="Gunz 2012" /&gt;

There have been a number of studies that not only take incomplete fossil records into consideration, but have attempt to specifically identify the barriers presented by this condition. For example, Kieran McNulty covers the potential utilities and constraints of using incomplete fossil taxa to examine longitudinal development in Australopithecus africanis.&lt;ref name="McNulty 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=McNulty | first=Kieran P. | date=2012-12-01 | title=Evolutionary Development in Australopithecus africanus | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9172-9 | journal=Evolutionary Biology | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=488–498 | doi=10.1007/s11692-012-9172-9 | issn=0071-3260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies on development have been human-specific. In his 2011 paper, Bernard Crespi focused on adaptation and genomic conflict in childhood diseases. He considers the evolution of childhood diseases and their risk levels, and finds that both risk and disease have evolved.&lt;ref name="Crespi 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Crespi | first=Bernard | date=2011-05-22 | title=The evolutionary biology of child health | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/278/1711/1441 | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | language=en | volume=278 | issue=1711 | pages=1441–1449 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2627 | pmc=3081756 | pmid=21288946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotchberg and Belsky incorporate a life-history perspective, looking at adolescence. Substantial variation in phenotypic paths and presentations suggest significant environmental influence. They focus on plasticity between stages of development and the factors that shape it. Rate of maturation, fecundity, and fertility were all impacted by environmental circumstances. They argue that early maturation can be positive, reflecting opportunistic actions within specific conditions.&lt;ref name="Belsky 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Hochberg | first=Ze'ev | last2=Belsky | first2=Jay | date=2013-04-29 | title=evolutionary developmental biology of human adolescence: beyond disease models of early puberty | url=http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-11-113 | journal=BMC Medicine | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=113 | doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-113 | pmc=3639027 | pmid=23627891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic and epigenetic basis ==

Technological advances that have allowed better and better access to the growth of the human form in utero have proven particularly formative in studies involving focus on genetic and epigenetic development. Bakker et al. look at the interconnected nature of developmental processes and attempt to use fetal vertebral abnormalities as an indicator for other malformations. They found that the origin of the cells was not nearly as highly correlated as the observed developmental signals.&lt;ref name="Broek 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Broek | first=Clara M. A. ten | last2=Bakker | first2=Alexander J. | last3=Varela-Lasheras | first3=Irma | last4=Bugiani | first4=Marianna | last5=Dongen | first5=Stefan Van | last6=Galis | first6=Frietson | date=2012-12-01 | title=evolutionary developmental biology of the Human Vertebral Column: On Homeotic Transformations, Pathologies and Prenatal Selection | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9196-1 | journal=Evolutionary Biology | language=en | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=456–471 | doi=10.1007/s11692-012-9196-1 | pmc=3514701 | pmid=23226903}}&lt;/ref&gt; In utero development and malformations were correlated in severity.&lt;ref name="Broek 2012" /&gt;

Freiston and Galis look at the development of ribs, digits, and mammalian asymmetry. They argue that this construction is relevant for the study of disease, the consistency in evolution of body plans, and understanding of developmental constraints.&lt;ref name="Galis 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Galis | first=Frietson | last2=Broek | first2=Clara M. A. Ten | last3=Dongen | first3=Stefan Van | last4=Wijnaendts | first4=Liliane C.

== Language and cognitive studies ==

Languages and cognitive function have also been subjects of evolutionary studies. Insofar as language and evolutionary developmental biology, there is tension from the gate. Much of this contention has centered around whether to view and study language as an adaptation in and of its self, or as a by-product of other adaptations. Jackendoff and Pinker have argued for language as an adaptation owing to the interdependent social nature of humans. To support these claims, he points to things like the bi-directionality in language usage and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Jackendoff 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Jackendoff | first=Ray | last2=Pinker | first2=Steven | date=2005-09-01 | title=The nature of the language faculty and its implications for evolution of language (Reply to Fitch, Hauser, and Chomsky) | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705000879 | journal=Cognition | volume=97 | issue=2 | pages=211–225 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a counter to the claims by theorists like [[Noam Chomsky]], who argued against language as a human specific adaptation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Fitch | first=W. Tecumseh | last2=Hauser | first2=Marc D. | last3=Chomsky | first3=Noam | date=2005-09-01 | title=The evolution of the language faculty: Clarifications and implications | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705000867 | journal=Cognition | volume=97 | issue=2 | pages=179–210 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation and adaptive theory has been argued even separate from its utility in the study of language. Gould and Lewontin engage with what they saw as flaws in adaptive theory using the analogy of the [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]s of San Marco. Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially.&lt;ref name="Gould 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gould | first=S. J. | last2=Lewontin | first2=R. C. | date=1979-09-21 | title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: a critique of the adaptationist programme | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume=205 | issue=1161 | pages=581–598 | pmid=42062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition.

This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way. Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of "neutral computation and mammalian brain development".&lt;ref name="Fitch 2009" /&gt; It may be more useful to consider specific components of neural computation and development, what has been selected for, and to what end.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2009"&gt;{{Cite conference | first=Tecumseh | last=Fitch | date=3–6 September 2009 | url=http://www.kli.ac.at/download/KLIreport2009.pdf | title=Skyhooks and Spandrels: What can Evo-Devo tell about the evolution of syntax | website=www.kli.ac.at | conference=21st Altenberg Workshop in Theoretical Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ploeger and Galis tackled modular evolvability and developmental constraints in human and other primate evolutionary trajectories. They argue that these should be treated with an interdisciplinary approach across the cognitive sciences. They frame this in the context of:

# Modularity — the ability of a system to organize individuals for the benefit of the whole
# Evolvability — ability of organism or organisms to adapt through evolution 
# Developmental constraints — those things that act as barriers to evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name="Ploeger 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Ploeger | first=Annemie | last2=Galis | first2=Frietson | date=2011-07-01 | title=evolutionary developmental biology and cognitive science | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.137/abstract | journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science| volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=429–440 | doi=10.1002/wcs.137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]] and [[social psychology]], an '''ingroup''' is a [[social group]] to which a person [[self-categorization theory|psychologically identifies]] as being a member. By contrast, an '''outgroup''' is a social group with which an individual does not identify. For example, people may find it psychologically meaningful to view themselves according to their [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[culture]], [[gender]], age, or [[religion]]. It has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena.

The terminology was made popular by [[Henri Tajfel]] and colleagues during his work in formulating [[social identity theory]]. The significance of ingroup and outgroup categorization was identified using a method called the [[minimal group paradigm]]. Tajfel and colleagues found that people can form self-preferencing ingroups within a matter of minutes and that such groups can form even on the basis of completely arbitrary and invented discriminatory characteristics, such as preferences for certain paintings.&lt;ref&gt;See "Kandinsky versus Klee experiment", [[Henri Tajfel|Tajfel]] ''[[et al.]]'' (1971) in [http://www.holah.karoo.net/tajfestudy.htm Tajfel, H.

==Associated phenomena==
The psychological categorization of people into ingroup and outgroup members is associated with a variety of phenomena. The following examples have all received a great deal of academic attention.

===In-group favoritism===
{{Main article|In-group favoritism}}
This refers to the fact that under certain conditions, people will prefer and have affinity for one’s ingroup over the outgroup, or anyone viewed as outside the ingroup. This can be expressed in one's evaluation of others, linking, allocation of resources, and many other ways.&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;{{cite book |title=Social psychology |author=[[Elliot Aronson|Aronson, E.]], [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson, T. D.]], Akert, R. D. &amp; Sommers, S. R.|year=2015|publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIVHrgEACAAJ| edition=9th, illustrated, revised|id={{ISBN|978-0-133-93654-4}} | isbn=0-13393654-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outgroup derogation===
Discrimination between ingroups and outgroups is a matter of favoritism towards an ingroup and the absence of equivalent favoritism towards an outgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Marilynn B.|authorlink=Marilynn Brewer|title=The Psychology of Prejudice: Ingroup Love and Outgroup Hate?|journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]]|date=Fall 1999|volume=55|issue=3|pages=429–444|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgroup derogation is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as being threatening to the members of an ingroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewstone|first1=Miles|authorlink1=Miles Hewstone |last2=Rubin|first2=Mark|last3=Willis|first3=Hazel|title=Intergroup Bias|date=February 2002|journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] | pages=575–604 |volume=53|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109|pmid=11752497}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon often accompanies ingroup favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their ingroup. Some research suggests that outgroup derogation occurs when an outgroup is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an ingroup. It has also been argued that outgroup derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Chen-Bo|last2=Phillips|first2=Katherine W.|last3=Leonardelli|first3=Geoffrey J.|last4=Galinsky|first4=Adam D.|title=Negational categorization and intergroup behavior|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]|year=2008|volume=34|issue=6|pages=793–806|pmid=18391025|doi=10.1177/0146167208315457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social influence===
{{Main article|Social influence}}
People have been shown to be differentially influenced by ingroup members. That is, under conditions where group categorization is psychologically salient, people will shift their beliefs in line with ingroup [[Norm (social)|social norms]].

===Group polarization===
{{Main article|Group polarization}}
This generally refers to the tendency of groups to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members, although polarization toward the most central beliefs has also been observed. It has been shown that this effect is related to a psychologically salient ingroup and outgroup categorization.

===Group homogeneity===
{{Main article|Outgroup homogeneity}}
Categorization of people into social groups increases the perception that group members are similar to one another. An outcome of this is the outgroup homogeneity effect. This refers to the perception of members of an outgroup as being homogenous, while members of one's ingroup are perceived as being diverse, e.g. "they are alike; we are diverse”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leyens|first1=Jacques-Philippe|last2=Yzerbyt|first2=Vincent|last3=Schadron|first3=Georges|title=Stereotypes and Social Cognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SO3AAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |isbn=0-80398583-5 |id={{ISBN|978-0-803-98583-4}}|pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially likely to occur in regard to negative characteristics.  Under certain conditions, ingroup members can be perceived as being similar to one another in regard to positive characteristics.  This effect is called ingroup homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Lynne M.|title=The Psychology of Prejudice: From Attitudes to Social Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MkAQAAMAAJ|year=2011|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-43380920-6|id={{ISBN|978-1-433-80920-0}}|pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postulated role in human evolution==

In [[evolutionary psychology]], ingroup favoritism is seen as an evolved mechanism selected for the advantages of [[coalition]] affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L. Cosmides |author2=J. Tooby |author3=R. Kurzban |title=Perceptions of race |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=173–179 | date=April 1, 2003 |publisher= |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00057-3 |pmid= 12691766|pmc=  |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences//retrieve/pii/S1364661303000573?cc=y |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that characteristics such as gender and [[ethnicity]] are inflexible or even [[Essentialism|essential]] features of such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Race in the Making: Cognition, Culture, and the Child's Construction of Human Kinds |author=L.

'''Jacques de Lavardin''', was a lord in Plessis-Bourrot, squire and noble of the [[king of France]], known for the translation of two works in French: the [[La Celestina|Celestine]] from [[Fernando de Rojas]] and of the ''Historia de vita et rebus gestis Scanderbegi'', a chronic of the Kingdom of [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg]] from [[Marin Barleti]]. De Lavardin was active during 1575 and 1585. He is the brother of the theologue and translator Jean de Lavardin, abbey of l'Estoile.

==Translation of Marin Barleti==
His translation of the ''Historia de vita et rebus gestis Scanderbegi'' (in French '''Histoire de Georges Castriot, surnommé Scanderberg, roy d'Albanie'') appeared in 1576. The sixth edition, appeared in 1621, is due to [[Nicolas Faret]], who added a chronologie where were included the events from [[Mahomet II]] to [[Osman II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=51oPAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Jacques+De+Lavardin&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lne4PpOcIa&amp;sig=gfEYHxnaixr4C3DGEcGBXY07Fic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UlZGS8ueO8uUtgfH2rT_AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Histoire de Georges Castriot, surnommé Scanderbeg, roy d'Albanie"] By Jacques de Lavardin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation of Fernando de Rojas==
A first translation in French from the Celestine had already been published from Galliot du Pré (printed from Nicolas Cousteau) in 1527. The adaptation of Jacques de Levardin, that dates 1577, was republished several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL8286637M/'La_Celestine'_in_the_French_translation_of_1578_by_Jacques_de_Lavardin_(Textos_B) "La Celestine' in the French translation of 1578 by Jacques de Lavardin (Text B)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kwame Gyekye''' (born 1939) is a [[Ghana]]ian [[philosopher]], and an important figure in the development of modern [[African philosophy]].

Gyekye studied first at the [[University of Ghana]], then at [[Harvard University]], where he obtained his [[Ph.D.]] with a thesis on Græco&amp;ndash;Arabic philosophy.  He has been a [[Fellow]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], and is a life-time Fellow of the [[Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was educated at [[Mfantsipim School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ar.ug.edu.gh/kwame-gyekye|title=Kwame Gyekye {{!}} University of Ghana Alumni Relations Office|website=ar.ug.edu.gh|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyekye is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Ghana]], and a Visiting Professor of Philosophy and African-American studies at [[Temple University]]. 

==Philosophical views==
===Person and community===
Gyekye challenges the view that in African thought, community confers personhood on the individual and thus the individual's identity is merely derivative of the community. He attributes this view to African philosopher [[Ifeanyi Menkiti]], as well as socialist political figures like [[Ghana]]'s [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Senegal]]'s [[Léopold Senghor]], and [[Tanzania]]'s [[Julius Nyerere]].

Instead, Gyekye argues that African thought ascribes definite value to the individual.  He cites an [[Akan (language)|Akan]] proverb, "All persons are children of God; no one is a child of the earth" in support of his argument that a person is conceived as a theomorphic being, having in their nature an aspect of God.  This soul (known as okra to the Akan) is described as divine and originating with God.  Thus, he argues, a person is viewed as more than just a material or physical object, but children of God, and therefore intrinsically valuable.  This intrinsic value, it is argued, makes nonsense of the view that the individual's value stems solely from the community.  Similarly, he argues that the person is conceived as a unique individual (as in the proverb "antelope's soul is one, duiker's another"), so that each individual is self-complete, and the reality of the person cannot be derivative and posterior to that of the community.

While Gyekye argues that the individual is ontologically complete, he also acknowledges that people live in community, as in the proverb, "When a person descends from heaven, he/she descends into a human society."  In his view, a person's abilities are not sufficient for survival, so that community is necessary for the survival of the individual, as articulated in the proverb, "A person is not a palm tree that he/she should be self-sufficient."

Thus, he argues, it is error to holds that African philosophy denies the individual, but instead, the individual is an intrinsically valuable child of God, intricately linked into a web of human relationships.  He cites a Ghanaian artist who wrote, "we are linked together like a chain; we are linked in life, we are linked in death; persons who share a common blood relation never break away from one another."

'''Sir Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|m|ɪ|t}}; 27 June 1925 – 27 December 2011) was an English academic described as "among the most significant British philosophers of the last century and a leading campaigner for racial tolerance and equality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/8981654/Professor-Sir-Michael-Dummett.html |title=Obituary for Professor Sir Michael Dummett |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=29 December 2011 |location=London |date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, until 1992, [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He wrote on the history of [[analytic philosophy]], notably as an interpreter of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and made original contributions particularly in [[philosophy of mathematics|the philosophies of mathematics]], [[philosophy of logic|logic]], [[philosophy of language|language]] and [[metaphysics]]. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between [[philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]], a term he helped to popularize. He devised the [[Quota Borda system]] of proportional voting, based on the [[Borda count]]. In [[mathematical logic]], he developed an [[intermediate logic]], already studied by [[Kurt Godel|Kurt Gödel]]: the Gödel–Dummett logic.

==Education and army service==
Dummett was the son of a merchant of silks. He studied at [[Sandroyd School]] and was a First Scholar at [[Winchester College]], later winning a Major Scholarship to study History at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1943. He was called up that year and served, initially as a private in the [[Royal Artillery]] before joining the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] in India and Malaya. He was also awarded a fellowship to [[All Souls College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |author=Daniel Isaacson |title=In Memoriam: Michael Dummett (1925–2011) |url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/in_memoriam_michael_dummett_1925-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1979, Dummett became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at Oxford, a post he held until retiring in 1992. During his term as Wykeham Professor, he held a Fellowship at [[New College, Oxford]]. He has also held teaching posts at [[Birmingham University]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Harvard University]]. He won the [[Schock Prize|Rolf Schock]] prize in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.su.se/english/research/2.26526 philosophy.su.se]&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[knight]]ed in 1999. He was the 2010 winner of the Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauener-foundation.ch/award.php Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career at Oxford, he supervised many philosophers who have gone on to distinguished careers, including [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|Adrian Moore]], [[Ian Rumfitt]], and [[Crispin Wright]].

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Semantic realism (epistemology)', 'Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)' and 'Semantic antirealism (epistemology)' redirect here--&gt;==
His work on the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] has been acclaimed. His first book ''[[Frege: Philosophy of Language]]'' (1973), written over many years, is now regarded as a classic.  The book was instrumental in the rediscovery of Frege's work, and influenced a generation of British philosophers.

In his 1963 paper "Realism"&lt;ref&gt;Originally a lecture to the Philosophical Society at Oxford in 1963, the paper was first published in 1978 in his book ''Truth and Other Enigmas''. See ''Truth and Other Enigmas'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; he popularised a controversial approach to understanding the historical dispute between [[philosophical realism|realist]] and other non-realist philosophy such as [[idealism]], [[nominalism]], [[Irrealism (philosophy)|Irrealism]]. He characterized all of the latter as [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. For Dummett, realism is best understood as '''semantic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, i. e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence of one's language is [[bivalence|bivalent]] (determinately true or false) and [[evidence-transcendent]] (independent of our means of coming to know which),&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/ Logicism and Neologicism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#ReaTru Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as [[natural numbers]]), moral categories, the material world, or even thought.  The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as, at base, analogous to the dispute between [[Intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

Franzane Abella commented that Dummett was really interested not in understanding problems via classical logic but via intutionistic logic, and Abella stated that "such mathematical entities are more likely to be an ontological myth for Dummett... because truth cannot be unidentified via intuition, and of course it will fall on the notion of '''logical opaqueness''', which statements are not likely to be understood easily in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=Dummettian Truth |url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/epistclass/dummett.pdf |journal= |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzane Abella further added that "Dummett has an astounding influence when he brought forward the '''deep-order justificationist semantics'''; this influenced the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]] and the classification of understanding via practices, whether the statement can be refuted or not based on its meaning." Abella summed up by saying that Dummett refuted the theory brought forward by realism about the cognisance of meaning. For example the psychological change in our conceptions of meaning of any statements should be properly grasped, because if not, there exists an alteration and confusion of meaning, and of course a failure in grasping truth-values.

Dummett espoused '''semantic anti-realism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; a position suggesting that truth cannot serve as the central notion in the theory of meaning and must be replaced by [[Verificationism|verifiability]].&lt;ref&gt;Panu Raatikainen, [http://newprairiepress.org/biyclc/vol5/iss1/10/ "The Semantic Realism/Anti-Realism Dispute and Knowledge of Meanings"], ''The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication'' '''5'''(1): 1–13. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic anti-realism is sometimes related to [[semantic inferentialism]].&lt;ref&gt; R. Ramanujam and Sundar Sarukkai (eds), ''Logic and Its Applications'', Springer, 2009, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Dummett was politically active, through his work as a campaigner against racism. He let his philosophical career stall in order to influence civil rights for minorities during what he saw as a crucial period of reform in the late 1960s. He also has worked on the theory of voting, which led to his introduction of the [[Quota Borda system]].

Dummett drew heavily on his work in this area in writing his book ''On Immigration and Refugees'', an account of what justice demands of states in relationship to movement between states.  Dummett in that book argues that the vast majority of opposition to immigration has been founded in racism and says that this has especially been so in the UK.

He has written of his shock on finding anti-Semitic and fascist opinions in the diaries of [[Frege]], to whose work he had devoted such a high proportion of his professional career.&lt;ref&gt;Dummett, Michael, "Preface to the first edition" in ''Frege: Philosophy of Language, Second Edition'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 1981), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections and voting==
{{see also|Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem|Robin Farquharson}}
Dummett and [[Robin Farquharson]] published influential articles on the theory of voting, in particular conjecturing that deterministic voting rules with more than three issues faced endemic [[strategic voting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00355-005-0014-x |title=The work and life of [[Robin Farquharson]] &lt;!-- |authorlink=Michael Dummett --&gt; 
|first=Michael |last=Dummett |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |year=2005 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=475–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dummett–Farquharson conjecture]] was proved by [[Allan Gibbard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Allan |last=Gibbard |title=Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |year=1973 |pages=587–601 |jstor=1914083 |doi=10.2307/1914083}}&lt;/ref&gt; a philosopher and former student of [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] and [[John Rawls]], and by the economist Mark A. Satterthwaite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Satterthwaite |title=Strategy-proofness and Arrow's Conditions: Existence and Correspondence Theorems for Voting Procedures and Social Welfare Functions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=10 |year=1975 |issue=2 |pages=187–217 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(75)90050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the Farquarson–Dummett conjecture by Gibbard and Sattherthwaite, Dummett contributed three proofs of the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] in his monograph on voting. He also wrote a shorter overview of the theory of voting for the educated public.

==Card games and tarot==
Dummett was also an established scholar in the field of [[card games]] history, with numerous books and articles to his credit. He is a founding member of the [[International Playing-Card Society]], in whose journal ''[[The Playing-Card]]'' he regularly published opinions, research and reviews of current literature on the subject; he is also a founding member of the [[Accademia del Tarocchino Bolognese]] in [[Bologna]]. His historical work on the use of the tarot pack in [[card games]] — he has said "(t)he fortune telling and occult part of it has never been my principal interest..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rudolf Farra and Maurice Salles |title=An Interview with Michael Dummett: From analytical philosophy to voting analysis and beyond |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |volume=27 |issue=2 |date=October 2006 |doi=10.1007/s00355-006-0128-9 |pages=347–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; — ''The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City'', attempted to establish that the invention of Tarot could be set in 15th-century [[Italy]]. He laid the foundation for most of the subsequent research on the game of [[Tarot card games|tarot]], including exhaustive accounts of the rules of all hitherto known forms of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

His analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown prior to the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that the middle of the 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. "The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=2004 |title=A History of Games Played With the Tarot Pack: The Game of Triumphs, Vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Dummett collaborated with [[Giordano Berti]] and Andrea Vitali to the project of the great Tarot exhibition at Castello Estense in Ferrara; in that occasion he wrote some texts for the catalog of the exhibition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=1987 |title="Sulle origini dei Tarocchi popolari" and "Tarocchi popolari e Tarocchi fantastici", in Le carte di Corte. I Tarocchi. Gioco e magia alla Corte degli Estensi, ''Nuova Alfa editoriale, Bologna 1987, pp.78–88''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Roman Catholicism==
In 1944, he was received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and remained a practising Catholic. Throughout his career, Dummett published a number of articles on various issues facing the contemporary Catholic Church, mainly in the English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] journal, ''New Blackfriars''. Dummett published an essay in the bulletin of the Adoremus Society on the subject of liturgy, and a philosophical essay defending the intelligibility of the Catholic Church's teaching on the [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Intelligibility of Eucharistic Doctrine" in William J. Abraham and Steven W. Holzer, eds., ''The Rationality of Religious Belief: Essays in Honour of Basil Mitchell'', Clarendon Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1987, one of his contributions to ''New Blackfriars'' sparked considerable controversy, when he seemingly attacked currents of Catholic theology which appeared to him to diverge from orthodox Catholicism and to "imply that, from the very earliest times, the Catholic Church, claiming to have a mission from God to safeguard divinely revealed truth, has taught and insisted on the acceptance of falsehoods." Dummett argued that "the divergence which now obtains between what the Catholic Church purports to believe and what large or important sections of it in fact believe ought, in my view, to be tolerated no longer: not if there is to be a rationale for belonging to that Church; not if there is to be any hope of reunion with the other half of Christendom; not if the Catholic Church is not to be a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world." A debate in the journal over these remarks continued for months, attracting contributions from the theologian [[Nicholas Lash]] and the historian [[Eamon Duffy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1741-2005/issues 1987 ''New Blackfriars'' '''68'''(809, 811)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and family==
Dummett retired in 1992 and was knighted in 1999 for "services to philosophy and to racial justice". He received the [[Lakatos Award]] in the philosophy of science in 1994.

Dummett died in 2011, aged 86. He was survived by his wife [[Ann Dummett|Ann]], whom he married in 1951 (and who died in 2012), and by three sons and two daughters. A son and daughter predeceased their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary_professor_sir_michael_dummett_innovative_philosopher_and_academic_who_campaigned_for_racial_equality_1_2029888 Sir Michael Dummett obituary in ''The Scotsman Online''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his philosophical work has focused on building philosophies that take into account plants as beings with their own form of [[subjectivity]], which has included showing how the field of philosophy, especially the tradition of [[continental philosophy]], has neglected plants or treated them as "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]", and how the field has been poorer for it.&lt;ref name=Pettman&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pettman |first1=Dominic |title=The Noble Cabbage: Michael Marder’s "Plant-Thinking"|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-noble-cabbage-michael-marders-plant-thinking/#! |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |date=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominic Pettman found Marder's book ''Plant-Thinking'' to be a work that made a substantial contribution to that nascent field, but also at times too simplistic, for example idealizing the ways that plants co-exist with other beings and not taking into account the ways that plants attack and defend against other beings.&lt;ref name=Pettman/&gt;

'''Newton Carneiro Affonso da Costa''' (born 16 September 1929 in [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]]) is a Brazilian [[mathematician]], [[logician]], and [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name="KM"&gt;http://www.cle.unicamp.br/cle-aips-event/newtondacosta.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied engineering and mathematics at the [[Universidade Federal do Paraná|Federal University of Paraná]] in [[Curitiba]] and the title of his 1961 Ph.D. dissertation was ''Topological spaces and continuous functions''.&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;

==Work==

===Paraconsistency===
Da Costa's international recognition came especially through his work on [[paraconsistent logic]] and its application to various fields such as philosophy, [[law]], [[computing]], and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-paraconsistent/#Mot&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the founders of this [[non-classical logic]].&lt;ref name="K"&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-paraconsistent/#ModHisParLog&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he constructed the theory of quasi-truth that constitutes a generalization of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s theory of truth, and applied it to the foundations of science.

===Other fields; foundations of physics===
The scope of his research also includes [[model theory]], generalized [[Galois theory]], axiomatic foundations of quantum theory and [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]], and abstract logics.&lt;ref name="L"&gt;http://hps.master.univ-paris-diderot.fr/sites/hps.master.univ-paris-diderot.fr/files/users/fcontami/Paty,M-2000d-QuantClasDom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Da Costa has significantly contributed to the [[philosophy of logic]], paraconsistent [[modal logic]]s, [[ontology]], and [[philosophy of science]]. He served as the President of the Brazilian Association of Logic and the Director of the Institute of Mathematics at the [[University of Sao Paulo]]. He received many awards and held numerous visiting scholarships at universities and centers of research in all continents.&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;

Da Costa and physicist [[Francisco Antônio Dória]] axiomatized large portions of [[classical physics]] with the help of [[Patrick Suppes]]' predicates. They used that technique to show that for the axiomatized version of  [[dynamical systems theory]], chaotic properties of those systems are undecidable and Gödel-incomplete, that is, a sentence like ''X is chaotic'' is undecidable within that axiomatics. They later exhibited similar results for systems in other areas, such as mathematical economics.

Da Costa believes that the significant progress in the field of logic will give rise to new fundamental developments in computing and technology, especially in connection with non-classical logics and their applications.

===Variable-binding term operators===
Da Costa is co-discoverer of the truth-set principle and co-creator of the classical logic of variable-binding term operators—both with [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. He is also co-author with Chris Mortensen of the definitive pre-1980 history of variable-binding term operators in classical first order logic: “Notes on the theory of variable-binding term operators”, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol.4 (1983) 63–72.

===P = NP===
Together with [[Francisco Antônio Dória]], Da Costa has published two papers with conditional relative proofs of the consistency of [[P = NP]] with the usual 
set-theoretic axioms [[ZFC]]. The results they obtain are similar to the results of DeMillo and Lipton (consistency of P = NP with fragments of arithmetic) and those of Sazonov and Maté (conditional proofs of the consistency of P = NP with strong systems).

Basically da Costa and Doria define a formal sentence [P = NP]' which is the same as P = NP in the standard model for arithmetic; however, because [P = NP]' by its very definition includes a disjunct that is not refutable in ZFC, [P = NP]' is not refutable in ZFC, so ZFC + [P = NP]' is [[consistent]] (assuming that ZFC is).  The paper then continues by an informal proof of the implication 
: If  ZFC + [P = NP]' is consistent, then so is ZFC + [P = NP].
However, a review by [[Ralf Schindler]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1001/1001-007.ps Schindler's review of the P = NP paper] (Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, v. 10 no. 1, March 2004, p. 118f)&lt;/ref&gt; points out that this last step is too short and contains a gap. A recently published (2006) clarification by the authors shows that their intent was to exhibit a conditional result that was dependent on what they call   a "naïvely plausible condition". The 2003 conditional result can be reformulated, according to da Costa and Doria 2006 (in press), as
: If ZFC + [P = NP]' is omega-consistent, then ZFC + [P = NP] is consistent.
So far no formal argument has been constructed to show that ZFC + [P = NP]' is omega-consistent.

In his reviews for [[Mathematical Reviews]] of the da Costa/Doria  papers on P=NP, logician [[Andreas Blass]] states that "the absence of rigor led to numerous errors (and ambiguities)"; he also rejects  da Costa's "naïvely plausible condition", as this assumption is "based partly on the possible non-totality of [a certain function] F and partly on an axiom equivalent to the totality of F".

==Career==
Peter lectured in [[natural philosophy]] at the [[University of Naples]] during [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s term of attendance (1239–1244). He was the author of 'Determinatio magistralis', "''on the question that the bodily organs have been created in order that they might carry out their functions, of the functions, created for the benefit of the organs."'' Peter felt this question to be purely a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] one, despite his vocation being natural philosophy.

In 1260 he presided over a dispute on physics held before [[Manfred of Sicily]].

==His works==

Works attributed to him include

* Two commentaries on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]] and the [[On Interpretation|Perihermenias]], both [[logical]] works
* A commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s 'De longitudine et brevitate vitae', discussing physical questions on the nature and causes of life.

'''Rachel Albeck-Gidron''' (born 1960) is an Israeli inter-disciplinary researcher of  Hebrew and comparative [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[art]].

==Research==
In her book, ''The Century of the Monads'', Albeck-Gidron claims that there is a deep similarity and even a relationship between [[monadology|monadic]] [[metaphysics]] and the basic assumptions of [[modernism|modernistic]] thought. This claim is demonstrated in 20th-century scientific thought patterns, in the central movements in plastic art from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and, particularly, in the world view of the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The Century of the Monads: Leibniz's Metaphysics and 20th-Century Modernity |location= |publisher=Bar-Ilan University Press |isbn= |year= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also developed a theoretical model of describing  the process of creation of  textual-versions and created a method of comparing between them, named 'the third text'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The 3rd text – a theoretical and methodological principle in comparative research, and its application in comparison of the versions of Berdyczewski's story 'Urva Parch' |journal=Sadan |volume=4 |year=2000 |issue= |pages=323–352 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron examines the [[Ashkenaz]]i [[Pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] as a [[Postmodernism|Postmodernistic]] Question, in a part of a [[sociological]] discussion in a problem known as 'invention of tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=Exiled and Suppressed Voices: On the Ashkenazi Pronunciation of Hebrew as a Postmodernistic Question |journal=Jerusalem Studies in Hebrew Literature |volume=19 |issue= |year=2003 |pages=69–90 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also analyzed the work of [[Yoel Hoffmann]] in the light of western and eastern poetics.

Albeck-Gidron is Associate professor of Hebrew literature at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/faculty/tomy/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, she has been appointed as visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] and taught the course "East West East in Israeli Literature: The Novels of Yoel Hoffmann".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/jewishstudies/people/scholars_2006_07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron studied [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] [[painting]] with painter [[Israel Hershberg]] at the [[Jerusalem Studio School]] in [[Jerusalem]].

===Early years===
Riazuddin was born in [[Ludhiana]] in [[British Punjab]] of the [[British Indian Empire]] in 1930. After the [[Partition of India]], his family migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and settled in Lahore, [[West Pakistan|West-Pakistan]]. At age 17, Riazuddin attended [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], and took his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.(Hons)]] in [[Mathematics]] under the supervision of [[Abdus Salam]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="IAS Fellows"&gt;{{Cite web

With the help of Salam, Riazuddin went to the United Kingdom on a scholarship and attended Cambridge University. At Cambridge, he was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Theoretical physics]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"/&gt; Riazuddin's [[dissertation]] was written on "''Charge Radius of Pion''" which also covered many issues relevant to the field of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|78650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riazuddin returned to Pakistan where he joined Punjab University as an [[Associate professor]]. In 1968, Riazuddin was awarded the [[Gold Medal|Gold Medal in Physical Sciences]] for scientists under 40 years of age by the [[Pakistan Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt;

===Academic career===
Riazuddin had joined Punjab University ini 1959 as an associate professor of Mathematics.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt; Four years later, he travelled to the United States for a fellowship awarded by Norman March and [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]].&lt;ref name="IAS Fellows"/&gt; He became a [[research associate]] professor at the [[University of Rochester]] where he stayed until 1965.&lt;ref name="IAS Fellows"/&gt; The same year, he joined the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he taught physics until 1966.&lt;ref name="IAS Fellows"/&gt; Later, he went to [[Chicago]], Illinois where he joined his brother [[Fayyazuddin]], and theoretical physicists Faheem Hussain and Peter Rottoli.

In 1971, Riazuddin traveled to the United Kingdom to join the [[Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory]] where he was joined by Michael Duff.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt; At Daresbury, he became senior research associate.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt; There, Riazuddin gained expertise and specialised in nuclear physics.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt;  At Daresbury, he trained British scientists in the field of nuclear physics.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt;

In 1981, he became visiting professor of physics and mathematics at the University of Iowa and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, now [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name="IAS Fellows"/&gt; In 1982, Riazuddin came back to Pakistan where he joined [[Quaid-e-Azam University]] as a professor of theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="IAS Fellows"/&gt; In 1982, Riazuddin also went to [[Saudi Arabia]] where he joined [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] and became Chairman of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and also taught physics at the Department of Physics. In 1983, Riazuddin, along with Asghar Qadir, went to [[Trieste]], Italy, to join the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]. Both scientists joined Salam where they continued research in their fields. In 1998, Riazuddin left [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] and returned to Pakistan to rejoin PAEC.&lt;ref name= "Pakistan Academy of Sciences"/&gt;

===Scientific research===
During his post-graduate research, Riazuddin made contributions to mathematical physics, as he was highly interested in complex [[mathematical series]], and its relation to [[modern physics]]. In 1959, Riazuddin was the first physicist to use the [[dispersion relation]] for [[Compton scattering]] of virtual photons on pions to analyse their charge radius.&lt;ref&gt;

He seldom published papers, preferring long correspondences with his brother Fayyazuddin, mentor Abdus Salam, and colleagues including [[Asghar Qadir]], [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]], and [[Masud Ahmad]]. During the 1960s, he associated himself with complex mathematical applications of nuclear physics. In 1960, Riazuddin used Nucleon-nucleon dispersion relation to discriminate proton-proton scattering in [[pseudoscalar meson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The same year, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], partnering with the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]], sponsored Riazuddin to undertake further research. Along with Munir Ahmad Rashid and Fayyazuddin, Riazuddin realised that the physical baryons are considered broken in [[special unitary group]]s, [[symmetric group]]s and the [[tensor product]].&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant papers were submitted at the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In 1967, at the Fermi Institute, Riazuddin, with his brother Fayyazuddin, carried out research in the field of [[current algebra]], where they applied the mathematical framework of current algebra in the applications of [[radiative recombination|radiative decays]] of mesons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin published a pioneering work on K mesons. Riazuddin postulated that radioactive decay in K mesons have almost vanished when [[chiral symmetry]] is introduced. After the introduction, the symmetries break the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, even when the contribution from [[penguin diagrams]] is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

From 1972, Riazuddin made pioneering research on [[neutrinos]]— an elusive particle postulated by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1930. In 1972, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin were the first to post mathematical frameworks of Current-algebra in neutrino scattering to determine the [[Scale invariance]] of Chiral symmetry breaking the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian Quantum Mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

n 1987, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin theorised that it is possible get light-neutrino masses in the range of a few electron volts by equalising the masses of superheavy neutrinos in [[background independence]] (universality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2000, Riazuddin began his research in the series [[List of unsolved problems in physics|unsolved problems in physics]]. In 2005, at the [[National Center for Physics]] (NCP), Riazuddin presented his papers on neutrinos where he provided the mathematical framework of the neutrinos. Neutrinos have heavier masses but the [[neutrino oscillations]] do not completely identify the overall scale of their exact masses because they are exceedingly tiny. To determine the exact masses, Riazuddin introduced the laws of limits, as he realised there was a limit, to the electron energy [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]] in [[tritium]] [[Beta decay|β-decay]]. In 2007, Riazuddin introduced SU(3) symmetry in the theory of [[double beta decay]]. He postulated the light neutrinos formed a [[triplet state]] in a SU(3) symmetry during the process. In 2008, Riazuddin pointed out that the neutrino mass has μ and τ symmetry and the [[Lepton number]] remains constant, a new type of [[Seesaw mechanism]] is formed, the so-called Riazuddin's Seesaw Model, the [[Dirac equation|Dirac mass]] [[Dirac matrix|matrix]] provided the [[Yukawa coupling]] to follow the [[Majorana fermion]] to satisfy the [[Leptogenesis (physics)|Leptogenesis]] asymmetry. Riazuddin proposed that this interaction can be avoided when two of the heavy right-hand neutrinos are (nearly) degenerate.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2009, Riazuddin published a mathematical theory of the [[non-standard model]], and its brief extensions to [[Tau (particle)|τ]] (tau) particles — particles that are similar to electrons with negative electric charge.&lt;ref name="NCP 5th Particle Physics Sypnoisis"&gt;{{Cite journal

==1971 war and atomic bomb project==
During his stay at [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin were central figures of Pakistan's atomic program during the early and critical years. In December 1972, Riazuddin returned to Pakistan on the request of Salam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salam asked Riazuddin to report to [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] — chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At PAEC, Salam assigned Riazuddin to his Theoretical Physics Group (TPG).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Theoretical Physics Group took research in [[fast neutron calculations]] — how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction – the theory [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] — how would fission weapon would detonated from several points at the same point during the detonation process – and hydrodynamics – how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave – and what kind of and how much fissile material and reflectors would be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salam had attracted theoretical physicists who worked under Riazuddin despite his younger age. Riazuddin was among the scientists who attended the Multan meeting that was managed by Salam and convened by [[President of Pakistan|Pakistan President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. After the meeting, Salam took Riazuddin, with Munir Ahmad Khan, to Bhutto's residence in Islamabad where the scientists briefed Bhutto about the development of the nuclear weapons programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Salam had traveled to the United States to evade the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]], he returned to Pakistan with stacks of historical books on the [[Manhattan Project]] in December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1973, the [[University of Maryland]] offered him a fellowship, and on the advice of Salam, Riazuddin went to United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There, he became a senior [[research scientist]] at the University of Maryland, and obtained the open-source information on the "[[Manhattan Project]]" from the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="Rahman 1998 39–40"&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riazuddin carefully studied American [[theoretical physicist]] [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s approach to develop the first implosion device, and made further advances on [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]], [[Oppenheimer-Phillips process]], [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]].

After his return from the United States, Riazuddin was inducted into the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) as [[Chief technical officer|member (technical)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974, he began to take research with the TPG, and began one of the pioneering member of the TPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Raziddin Siddiqui formed the Mathematical Physics Group (MPG) which closely collaborated with Theoretical Physics Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Riazuddin called his mathematician friend [[Asghar Qadir]], who specialised in [[special relativity]] under Riazuddin and Salam, to join the Mathematical Physics Group. Later in his career, Qadir published a college text book on theory of special relativity. Shortly after the India surprise [[nuclear test]] — [[Pokhran-I]], Munir Ahmad Khan called for a meeting to initiate the work on atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riazuddin and Salam represented the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG), and it was decided to develop the [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion method]] for the first device.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, the word "[[Atomic bomb|bomb]]" was never used; instead academic scientists preferred to use the scientific research rationale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theoretical Physics Group began its research and directly reported to Abdus Salam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=70–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 both MPG and TPG scientists completed the design and calculation of an atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with Qadir, Riazuddin continued to develop the theoretical designs of the atomic weapon during 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982 the PAEC finally developed the device under the leadership of [[Munir Ahmad Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PAEC carried out the first cold-test of the TPG's theoretical design by May 1983 at [[Kirana Hills]]. The test teams were headed by [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], a nuclear physicist, and Munir Ahmad Khan supervised the testings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riazuddin later disclosed that he worked as part of the team, under Abdus Salam, that worked on designs for Pakistan's nuclear explosive device. As he explained:

Riazuddin also worked in a [[neutron]] [[particle accelerator]] at PAEC. In 2000, Riazuddin retired from PAEC as a [[Scientist|chief scientist]]. In the same year, he was elected as Fellow of the [[Third World Academy of Sciences]] and Fellow of the [[Islamic World Academy of Sciences (IAS)]]. Riazuddin was also a visiting scientist at [[European Organization for Nuclear Research|CERN]].

==Legacy and fame==
Riazuddin was an internationally known theoretical physicist. He had made contributions with [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]]. At CERN, he was a widely respected [[physicist|theoretician]]. Riazuddin is the recipient of [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|Pakistan's highest civil awards]]: [[Tamgha-i-Imtiaz]], [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]], [[Hilal-i-Imtiaz]]. He is one of the [[:Category:Pakistani scientists|Pakistani scientists]] who were very close to [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Abdus Salam]]. At PAEC, Riazuddin had closely worked with another noted Pakistani [[theoretical physicist]] [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]] (late). Later in life, he worked as a professor of [[theoretical physics]] and [[Neutrino|neutrino physics]] at the [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Sciences and Technology]], in [[Islamabad]].

He had also been the director of the [[Riazuddin National Center for Physics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/media-centre/news/news-archive/2005/7/ictp-director-in-pakistan.aspx|title=ICTP Director in Pakistan|publisher=ICTP|date=July 6, 2005|website=www.ictp.it|access-date=July 3, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703144057/https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/media-centre/news/news-archive/2005/7/ictp-director-in-pakistan.aspx|archivedate=3 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; also at Quaid-e-Azam University. He was most famous for his TPG Group work Riazuddin and his team of theoretical physicists are widely credited to have developed and designed Pakistan's nuclear weapon devices.

On 26 April 2009, a day-long conference was held in [[Islamabad]] to pay tribute to an eminent [[research scientist]] and [[theoretical physicist]], Riazuddin. The conference was organised by [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Sciences and Technology]] ([[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|NUST]]) and Riazuddin National Centre for Physics (RNCP). In the conference, [[Masud Ahmad]], who is also the student of his, said:

"''Prof. Riaz always put in his best efforts to obtain original results while working on various issues related to science and technology''".

[[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|NUST]] Rector and a famous [[Pakistan]]i [[aerospace engineer]], [[Air Commodore]] Muhammad Asghar also paid tributes to him and said:

"''Prof. Riazuddin has a very strong and professional background in the field of [[Physics]]. He achieved many distinctions and awards from national as well as international institutes, which includes [[Tamgha-e-Imtiaz]], [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]] and [[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]] and awards from [[UNESCO]], [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and [[COMSTECH]] Prize in Physics''".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Robert Kirk''' is an  [[emeritus]] [[professor]] in the Department of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Nottingham]].  He is known for his work on [[philosophical zombies]]&amp;mdash;putatively unconscious beings physically and behaviourally identical to human beings.  Although Kirk did not invent this idea, he introduced the term ''zombie'' in his 1974 papers "Sentience and Behaviour"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=Sentience and Behaviour |journal=Mind |volume=83 |issue=329 |pages=43–60 |date=January 1974 |jstor=2252795 |doi=10.1093/mind/lxxxiii.329.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Zombies v.

Materialists |journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society |volume=48 |issue=Suppl |pages=135–152 |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter he offered a formulation of [[physicalism]] that aimed to make clear that if zombies are possible, physicalism is false: an argument that was not much noticed until David Chalmers's development of it in ''The Conscious Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |title=The Conscious Mind: in Search of a Fundamental Theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk himself had reversed his position earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=From Physical Explicability to Full-blooded Materialism |journal=Philosophical Quarterly|volume=29 |pages=229–37 |date=1979 |doi=10.2307/2218819}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has argued against the zombie idea in a number of books and articles on physicalism and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authormask=1 |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=Raw feeling: a philosophical account of the essence of consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authormask=1 |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=Zombies and Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-928548-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authormask=1 |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=The Inconceivability of Zombies |journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=39 |pages=73–98 |date=2008 |doi=10.1007/s11098-007-9103-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authormask=1 |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=The Conceptual Link from Physical to Mental |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authormask=1 |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=Robots, Zombies and Us |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2017 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as working on other topics in the philosophy of mind, Kirk has published on the question of how far translation and interpretation are determined by objective facts (see W. V. Quine’s ''Word and Object'' (1960)). His own book on this topic, ''Translation Determined'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authormask=1 |first=Robert |last=Kirk |title=Translation Determined |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">[[File:Henri de Saint-simon portrait.jpg|thumb|Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]]

'''Saint-Simonianism''' was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825).

Saint-Simon's ideas, expressed largely through a succession of journals such as ''l'Industrie'' (1816), ''La politique'' (1818) and ''L'Organisateur'' (1819–20)&lt;ref name="Hewett, 2008"&gt;Hewett, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  focused on the perception that growth in [[industrialization]] and scientific discovery would have profound changes on society. He believed that society would restructure itself by abandoning traditional ideas of temporal and spiritual power, an evolution that would lead, inevitably, to a productive society based on and benefiting from, a " ... union of men engaged in useful work"; the basis of "true equality".&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Simon, quoted in Leopold, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint-Simon's writings==
Saint-Simon's earliest publications, such as his ''Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIXe siècle (Introduction to scientific discoveries of the 19th century)'' (1803) and his ''Mémoire sur la science de l'homme (Notes on the study of man)'' (1813), (the latter of which is a eulogy to [[Napoleon]]), demonstrate his faith in science as a means to regenerate society. In his 1814 essay ''De la réorganisation de la société européenne (On the reorganisation of European society)'', written in collaboration with his then secretary [[Augustin Thierry]], Saint-Simon  seems to have foreseen the [[European Union]], expecting however that [[England]] would take the lead in forming a continent sharing the same laws and institutions.&lt;ref name="Goyau 1912"&gt;Goyau (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;

For his last decade Saint-Simon concentrated on themes of [[political economy]]. Together with [[Auguste Comte]], (then only a teenager), Saint-Simon projected a society bypassing the changes of the French Revolution, in which science and industry would take the moral and temporal power of medieval [[theocracy]].&lt;ref name="Goyau 1912"/&gt;

In his last work however, ''Le Nouveau Christianisme (The New Christianity)'' (1825), Saint-Simon reverted to more traditional ideas of renewing society through [[Christian]] [[The New Commandment|brotherly love]]. He died shortly after its publication.&lt;ref name="Hewett, 2008"/&gt;

==The arts==
In his last years and in the period after his death, Saint-Simon's ideas, which gave prominence to art as a prized aspect of work, interested numerous artists and musicians, amongst them [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Félicien David]] (who wrote a number of hymns for the movement) &lt;ref&gt;Locke, Ralph P.. "Music, Musicians, and the Saint-Simonians", Chicago: Univ of Chicago Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0226489027}} &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Liszt]]. For a brief period, the historian and writer [[Léon Halévy]] acted as secretary to the philosopher.

==The movement after Saint-Simon's death==
Following Saint-Simon's death in 1825, his followers began to differ as to how to promulgate his ideas. A 'charismatic' faction, led by [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]], purchased the newspaper ''[[Le Globe]]'' as their official organ, and formed an increasingly religiously-minded ritualistic group based on a community founded at [[Ménilmontant]], before being banned by the authorities in 1832. Following this some of Enfantin's followers visited [[Constantinople]] and then [[Egypt]] and influenced the creation of the [[Suez Canal]] in search of [[messiah|Messianic]] revelations, and the formal Saint-Simonian movement expired.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=31-37|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others who had been associated with the group and were not so followers of Enfantin, (such as [[Olinde Rodrigues]] and [[Gustave d'Eichthal]]) developed Saint-Simonian notions practically and involved themselves in the development of the French economy, founding a number of leading concerns including the [[Suez Canal]] Company and the bank [[Crédit Mobilier]].&lt;ref name="Leopold, 1998"&gt;Leopold, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been noted that Saint-Simonian ideas exerted a significant influence on new religious movements such as [[Spiritualism]] and [[Occultism]] since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific misconduct''' is the violation of the standard codes of [[scholarly method|scholarly conduct]] and [[ethics|ethical behavior]] in the publication of [[professional]] [[science|scientific research]].  A ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' review on ''Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries'' provides the following sample definitions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The consequences of scientific misconduct can be damaging for perpetrators and journal audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Xie |first=Yun |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/08/what-are-the-consequences-for-scientific-misconduct/ |title=What are the consequences of scientific misconduct? |doi=10.1126/science.1158052 |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Misconduct: Do the Punishments Fit the Crime? |author=Redman and Berz |publisher=Sciencemag |volume=321 |url=http://astro.berkeley.edu/~kalas/ethics/documents/redan08.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for any individual who exposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Research Triangle Institute |title=Consequences of  Whistleblowing for the Whistleblower in Misconduct in Science Cases |year= 1995 |url=https://wiki.umn.edu/pub/IBS8099F10/WhistleBlowing/RTI_-_Consequences_of_Whistleblowing_report.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition there are public health implications attached to the promotion of medical or other interventions based on false or fabricated research findings.

Three percent of the 3,475 research institutions that report to the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]]' [[Office of Research Integrity]], indicate some form of scientific misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wired Magazine]], March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However the ORI will only investigate allegations of impropriety where research was funded by federal grants. They routinely monitor such research publication for red flags and their investigation is subject to a statute of limitations. Other private organizations like the Committee of Medical Journal Editors (COJE) can only police their own members.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The validity of the methods and results of scientific papers are often scrutinized in [[journal club]]s. In this venue, members can decide amongst themselves with the help of peers if a scientific paper's ethical standards are met.

==Motivation to commit scientific misconduct==
According to [[David Goodstein]] of [[Caltech]], there are motivators for scientists to commit misconduct, which are briefly summarised here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodstein |first1=David |year=January–February 2002 |title=Scientific misconduct |journal=Academe |publisher=[[American Association of University Professors|AAUP]] |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2002/JF/Feat/good.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Career pressure
:Science is still a very strongly career-driven discipline. Scientists depend on a good [[reputation]] to receive ongoing support and [[funding]], and a good reputation relies largely on the publication of high-profile scientific papers. Hence, there is a strong imperative to "[[publish or perish]]". Clearly, this may motivate desperate (or fame-hungry) scientists to fabricate results.
; Ease of fabrication
: In many scientific fields, results are often difficult to reproduce accurately, being obscured by [[noise]], [[artifact (observational)|artifacts]], and other extraneous [[data]]. That means that even if a scientist does falsify data, they can expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field. There are no "scientific police" who are trained to fight scientific crimes; all investigations are made by experts in science but amateurs in dealing with criminals. It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fanelli | first1 = D. | editor1-last = Tregenza | editor1-first = Tom | title = How Many Scientists Fabricate and Falsify Research? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Survey Data | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005738 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5738 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19478950| pmc =2685008 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5738F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of scientific misconduct==
The U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] defines three types of research misconduct: [[Fabrication (science)|fabrication]], falsification, and [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/oig/session.pdf |title=New Research Misconduct Policies, NSF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910021419/https://www.nsf.gov/oig/session.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;45 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] Part 689 [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/45cfr689_07.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Fabrication'' is making up results and recording or reporting them.  This is sometimes referred to as "drylabbing".&lt;ref name=Shapiro1992&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Shapiro | first =  M.F. | year = 1992 | title = Data audit by a regulatory agency: Its effect and implication for others | journal = Accountability in Research | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–29 | doi = 10.1080/08989629208573818 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/index/793939942.pdf|format=PDF | pmid = 11653981}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more minor form of fabrication is where references are included to give arguments the appearance of widespread acceptance, but are actually fake, or do not support the argument.&lt;ref&gt;Emmeche, slide 5&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Falsification'' is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
* ''Plagiarism'' is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. One form is the appropriation of the ideas and results of others, and publishing as to make it appear the author had performed all the work under which the data was obtained. A subset is '''citation plagiarism''' – willful or negligent failure to appropriately credit other or prior discoverers, so as to give an improper impression of priority. This is also known as, "citation amnesia", the "disregard syndrome" and "bibliographic negligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene Garfield |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/demandcitationvigilance012102.html |title=Demand Citation Vigilance |publisher=''The Scientist'' 16(2):6  |date=January 21, 2002 |accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, this is the most common type of scientific misconduct. Sometimes it is difficult to guess whether authors intentionally ignored a highly relevant cite or lacked knowledge of the prior work.  Discovery credit can also be inadvertently reassigned from the original discoverer to a better-known researcher. This is a special case of the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmeche, slide 3, who refers to the phenomenon as Dulbecco's law.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Plagiarism-fabrication – the act of taking an unrelated figure from an unrelated publication and reproducing it exactly in a new publication, claiming that it represents new data.
** Self-plagiarism – or [[multiple publication]] of the same content with different titles or in different journals is sometimes also considered misconduct; [[scientific journal]]s explicitly ask authors not to do this. It is referred to as "salami" (i.e. many identical slices) in the jargon of medical journal editors. According to some editors this includes publishing the same article in a different language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wame.org/resources/publication-ethics-policies-for-medical-journals#orig|title=Publication Ethics Policies for Medical Journals|publisher=Wame.org The World Association of Medical Editors|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731131343/http://www.wame.org/resources/publication-ethics-policies-for-medical-journals/#orig|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other types of research misconduct are also recognized:
* [[Ghostwriter|Ghostwriting]] – the phenomenon where someone other than the named author(s) makes a major contribution. Typically, this is done to mask contributions from authors with a [[conflict of interest]].
* Conversely, research misconduct is not limited to not listing authorship,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} but also includes the act of conferring authorship on those that have not made substantial contributions to the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmje.org/#author|title=ICMJE – Home|author=|date=|website=www.icmje.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wame.org/resources/publication-ethics-policies-for-medical-journals#authorship|title=Publication Ethics Policies for Medical Journals|publisher=Wame.org  The World Association of Medical Editors|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731131343/http://www.wame.org/resources/publication-ethics-policies-for-medical-journals/#authorship|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by senior researchers who muscle their way onto the papers of inexperienced junior researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kwok | first1 = L.

=== Photo manipulation ===&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[peer review]] --&gt;
Compared to other forms of scientific misconduct, image fraud (manipulation of images to distort their meaning) is of particular interest since it can frequently be detected by external parties. In 2006, the ''Journal of Cell Biology'' gained publicity  for instituting tests to detect [[photo manipulation]] in papers that were being considered for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/science/24frau.html?_r=1 | work=[[New York Times]] | title=It May Look Authentic; Here's How to Tell It Isn't | author=[[Nicholas Wade]] | date=2006-01-24 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to the increased usage of programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]] by scientists, which facilitate photo manipulation. Since then more publishers, including the [[Nature Publishing Group]], have instituted similar tests and require authors to minimize and specify the extent of photo manipulation when a manuscript is submitted for publication. However, there is little evidence to indicate that such tests are applied rigorously. One Nature paper published in 2009&lt;ref name="Kato" /&gt; has subsequently been reported to contain around 20 separate instances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11jigen |url=http://katolab-imagefraud.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/dna-demethylation-in-hormone-induced.html |title=Shigeaki Kato (the University of Tokyo): DNA demethylation in hormone-induced transcriptional derepression |publisher=Katolab-imagefraud.blogspot.co.uk |date=2012-01-15 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of image fraud.

Although the type of manipulation that is allowed can depend greatly on the type of experiment that is presented and also differ from one journal to another, in general the following manipulations are not allowed:{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* splicing together different images to represent a single experiment
* changing [[brightness]] and [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of only a part of the image
* any change that conceals information, even when it is considered to be aspecific, which includes:
** changing brightness and contrast to leave only the most intense signal
** using [[clone tool]]s to hide information
* showing only a very small part of the photograph so that additional information is not visible

==Responsibility of authors and of coauthors==
All authors of a scientific publication are expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted to academic journals for publication.

Simultaneous submission of scientific findings to more than one journal or duplicate publication of findings is usually regarded as misconduct, under what is known as the Ingelfinger rule, named after the editor of the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] 1967-1977, Franz Ingelfinger.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, Jennifer (December 2002) [https://exversion.com/pdfs/v25n6p195-198.pdf "The Ingelfinger Rule"] (PDF) Science Editor • Vol. 25 • No. 6 • p. 195. Retrieved 20 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honorary authorship|Guest authorship]] (where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement, also known as gift authorship) and ghost authorship (where the real author is not listed as an author) are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct. In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of [[Gerald Schatten]] who co-authored with [[Hwang Woo-Suk]], the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce,&lt;ref name="BMJ1995"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Lessons from the Pearce affair: handling scientific fraud |journal=[[BMJ]] |date= June 17, 1995 |volume=310 |issue=6994 |pages=1547–48 |doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6994.1547 |pmid=7787632 |pmc=2549935 | last1 = Lock | first1 = S}} {{registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception)&lt;ref name="Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1994–1995) |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/7/4972.htm |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and the coauthors with [[Jan Hendrik Schön]] at Bell Laboratories. More recent cases include that of Charles Nemeroff,&lt;ref name="the-scientist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/news/home/24445/|title=Journal editor quits in conflict scandal|author=|date=|website=The Scientist|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the editor-in-chief of ''Neuropsychopharmacology'', and a well-documented case involving the drug [[Actonel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejabberwock.org/wiki/index.php?title=Actonel_Case_Media_Reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. The failure to keep data may be regarded as misconduct. Some scientific journals require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors might have commercial or non-commercial conflicts of interest. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about ethical aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies (Nemeroff,&lt;ref name="the-scientist.com"/&gt; Blumsohn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickerson |first=John |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/ |title=Did a British university sell out to P&amp;G?  |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities of research institutions ==
In general, defining whether an individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, the more likely it is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.

Well publicised cases illustrate the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct. A King's College (London) internal investigation showed research findings from one of their researchers to be 'at best unreliable, and in many cases spurious'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilmshurst P | year = 2002| title = Institutional corruption in medicine (2002) | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 325 | issue = 7374| pages = 1232–35 | doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7374.1232| pmid = 12446544| pmc = 1124696}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the college took no action, such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring. It was only 10 years later, when an entirely separate form of misconduct by the same individual was being investigated by the [[General Medical Council]], that the internal report came to light.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In a more recent case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jayaraman |first=K. S. |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/447764a.html |title=Indian scientists battle journal retraction | work=Nature |volume=447 | issue=7146 |date=June 14, 2007 | doi = 10.1038/447764a | pages=764 | pmid=17568715|bibcode=2007Natur.447..764J }}&lt;/ref&gt; an internal investigation at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune determined that there was evidence of misconduct by Dr. [[Gopal Kundu]], but an external committee was then organised which dismissed the allegation, and the NCCS issued a memorandum exonerating the authors of all charges of misconduct. Undeterred by the NCCS exoneration, the relevant journal (''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]'') withdrew the paper based on its own analysis.

==Responsibilities of uninvolved scientific colleagues==
Some academics believe that scientific colleagues who suspect scientific misconduct should consider taking informal action themselves, or reporting their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |author1=Gerald Koocher  |author2=Patricia Keith Speigel  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=22 July 2010| title= Peers Nip Misconduct in the Bud | doi = 10.1038/466438a | bibcode=2010Natur.466..438K | volume=466 |issue=7305  | journal=Nature | pages=438–40 | pmid=20651674}} and (with Joan Sieber) Responding to Research Wrongdoing: A User Friendly Guide, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This question is of great importance since much research suggests that it is very difficult for people to act or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior, unless they have help from their organizations. A "User-friendly Guide," and the existence of a confidential [[organizational ombudsman]] may help people who are uncertain about what to do, or afraid of bad consequences for their speaking up.&lt;ref&gt;See Mary Rowe, Linda Wilcox and Howard Gadlin, Dealing with – or Reporting – "Unacceptable" Behavior – with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect," in JIOA, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 52–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility of journals==
Journals are responsible for safeguarding the research record and hence have a critical role in dealing with suspected misconduct. This is recognised by the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]] (COPE) which has issued clear guidelines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicationethics.org/files/retraction%20guidelines.pdf Retraction Guidelines] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; on the form (e.g. retraction) that concerns over the research record should take.
* The COPE guidelines state that journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error). Retraction is also appropriate in cases of redundant publication, plagiarism and unethical research.
* Journal editors should consider issuing an expression of concern if they receive inconclusive evidence of research or publication misconduct by the authors, there is evidence that the findings are unreliable but the authors' institution will not investigate the case, they believe that an investigation into alleged misconduct related to the publication either has not been, or would not be, fair and impartial or conclusive, or an investigation is underway but a judgement will not be available for a considerable time.
* Journal editors should consider issuing a correction if a small portion of an otherwise reliable publication proves to be misleading (especially because of honest error), or the author / contributor list is incorrect (i.e. a deserving author has been omitted or somebody who does not meet authorship criteria has been included).

Evidence emerged in 2012 that journals learning of cases where there is strong evidence of possible misconduct, with issues potentially affecting a large portion of the findings, frequently fail to issue an expression of concern or correspond with the host institution so that an investigation can be undertaken. In one case the Journal of Clinical Oncology issued a Correction despite strong evidence that the original paper was invalid.&lt;ref name="Cordoba2"&gt;{{Cite journal

The cases of [[Joachim Boldt]] and [[Yoshitaka Fujii]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/major-fraud-probe-of-japanese-anesthesiologist-yoshitaka-fujii-may-challenge-retraction-record/ |title=Major fraud probe of Japanese anesthesiologist Yoshitaka Fujii may challenge retraction record &amp;#124; Retraction Watch |publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[anaesthesiology]]  focussed attention on the role that journals play in perpetuating scientific fraud as well as how they can deal with it. In the Boldt case, the Editors-in-Chief of 18 specialist journals (generally anaesthesia and intensive care) made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval. In the Fujii case, involving nearly 200 papers, the journal [[Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia]], which published 24 of Fujii's papers, has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a non-specific response from Dr. Fujii, there was no follow-up on the allegation of data manipulation and no request for an institutional review of Dr. Fujii's research. Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia went on to publish 11 additional manuscripts by Dr. Fujii following the 2000 allegations of research fraud, with Editor Steven Shafer stating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaeditor.org/FujiiStatementOfConcern.pdf Fujii Statement of Concern] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2012 that subsequent submissions to the Journal by Dr. Fujii should not have been published without first vetting the allegations of fraud. In April 2012 Shafer led a group of editors to write a joint statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaeditor.org/Fujii_Joint_EIC_Stmt.pdf Fujii Join EIC Statement] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of an ultimatum made available to the public, to a large number of academic institutions where Fujii had been employed, offering these institutions the chance to attest to the integrity of the bulk of the allegedly fraudulent papers.

==Consequences for science==

The consequences of scientific fraud vary based on the severity of the fraud, the level of notice it receives, and how long it goes undetected.  For cases of fabricated evidence, the consequences can be wide-ranging, with others working to confirm (or refute) the false finding, or with research agendas being distorted to address the fraudulent evidence.  The [[Piltdown Man]] fraud is a case in point:  The significance of the bona-fide fossils that were being found was muted for decades because they disagreed with Piltdown Man and the preconceived notions that those faked fossils supported.  In addition, the prominent paleontologist [[Arthur Smith Woodward]] spent time at Piltdown each year until he died, trying to find more Piltdown Man remains.  The misdirection of resources kept others from taking the real fossils more seriously and delayed the reaching of a correct understanding of human evolution.  (The [[Taung Child]], which should have been the death knell for the view that the human brain evolved first, was instead treated very critically because of its disagreement with the Piltdown Man evidence.)

In the case of Prof [[Don Poldermans]], the misconduct occurred in reports of trials of treatment to prevent death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=G.|title=Suspect Drug Research Blamed for Massive Death Toll|journal=Science|date=30 January 2014|volume=343|issue=6170|pages=473–74|doi=10.1126/science.343.6170.473|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6170/473|accessdate=14 September 2014|ref=Science2014|pmid=24482457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial reports were relied upon to issue guidelines that applied for many years across North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=G. D.|last2=Francis|first2=D. P.|title=Perioperative beta blockade: guidelines do not reflect the problems with the evidence from the DECREASE trials|journal=BMJ|date=29 August 2014|volume=349|issue=aug29 8|pages=g5210–g5210|doi=10.1136/bmj.g5210|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5210|pmid=25172044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Dr Alfred Steinschneider, two decades and tens of millions of research dollars were lost trying to find the elusive link between infant sleep apnea, which Steinschneider said he had observed and recorded in his laboratory, and [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS), of which he stated it was a precursor. The cover was blown in 1994, 22 years after Steinschneider's 1972 ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' paper claiming such an association,&lt;ref name="aappublications646"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinschneider A |title=Prolonged apnea and the sudden infant death syndrome: clinical and laboratory observations |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=646–54 |date=October 1972 |pmid=4342142 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/50/4/646}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Waneta Hoyt]], the mother of the patients in the paper, was arrested, indicted and convicted on five counts of second-degree murder for the smothering deaths of her five children.&lt;ref name="amazon1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Talan, Jamie |author2=Firstman, Richard |title=The death of innocents |publisher=Bantam Books |location=New York |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0553100130 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While that in itself was bad enough, the paper, presumably written as an attempt to save infants' lives, ironically was ultimately used as a defense by parents suspected in multiple deaths of their own children in cases of [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]]. The 1972 ''Pediatrics'' paper was cited in 404 papers in the interim and is still listed on Pubmed without comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Prolonged apnea and the sudden infant death syndrome: clinical and laboratory observations|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=4342142 | volume=50|issue=4 |journal=Pediatrics|pages=646–54 | last1 = Steinschneider | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for those who expose misconduct==

The potentially severe consequences for individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research.  This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct.  Persons who expose such cases, commonly called [[whistleblower]]s, can find themselves open to retaliation by a number of different means.&lt;ref name="BMJ1995"/&gt; These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters – designed to protect those who raise concerns. A whistleblower is almost always alone in their fight – their career becomes completely dependent on the decision about alleged misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst|first=Peter|title=Dishonesty in Medical Research|url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the accusations prove false, their career is completely destroyed, but even in case of positive decision the career of the whistleblower can be under question: their reputation of "troublemaker" will prevent many employers from hiring them. There is no international body where a whistleblower could give their concerns. If a university fails to investigate suspected fraud or provides a fake investigation to save their reputation the whistleblower has no right of appeal.

==Exposure of fraudulent data==
With the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of [[plagiarism]] and [[multiple publication]] within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr. [[Harold Garner]]'s laboratory at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] is [[Déjà vu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejavu.vbi.vt.edu/dejavu/ |title=Déjà vu: Medline duplicate publication database |publisher=Dejavu.vbi.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication. All of the entries in the database were discovered through the use of text data mining algorithm [[eTBLAST]], also created in Dr. Garner's laboratory. The creation of Déjà vu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dejavu.vbi.vt.edu/dejavu |title=Deja vu: Medline duplicate publication database |publisher=Dejavu.vbi.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722061546/http://dejavu.vbi.vt.edu/dejavu/ |archivedate=2014-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent classification of several hundred articles contained therein have ignited much discussion in the scientific community concerning issues such as [[ethics|ethical behavior]], journal standards, and intellectual copyright. Studies on this database have been published in journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Errami M |author2=Garner HR |doi=10.1038/451397a |title=A tale of two citations |date=2008-01-23 |volume=451 |issue=7177 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |pages=397–99 |pmid=18216832|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7177/pdf/451397a.pdf |bibcode=2008Natur.451..397E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Long TC |author2=Errami M |author3=George AC |author4=Sun Z |author5=Garner HR |doi=10.1126/science.1167408 |title=SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY: Responding to Possible Plagiarism |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2009-03-06 |volume=323 |issue=5919 |pages=1293–94 |pmid=19265004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tools which may be used to detect fraudulent data include [[error analysis (mathematics)|error analysis]]. Measurements generally have a small amount of error, and repeated measurements of the same item will generally result in slight differences in readings. These differences can be analyzed, and follow certain known mathematical and statistical properties. Should a set of data appear to be too faithful to the hypothesis, i.e., the amount of error that would normally be in such measurements does not appear, a conclusion can be drawn that the data may have been forged. Error analysis alone is typically not sufficient to prove that data have been falsified or fabricated, but it may provide the supporting evidence necessary to confirm suspicions of misconduct.

==Data sharing==
Kirby Lee and [[Lisa Bero]] suggest, "Although reviewing raw data can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, having such a policy would hold authors more accountable for the accuracy of their data and potentially reduce scientific fraud or misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = Ethics: Increasing accountability | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature05007.html | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1038/nature05007 | last1 = Lee | first1 = Kirby }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Starhawk''' (born '''Miriam Simos''' on June 17, 1951) is an American writer, teacher and activist.&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk (2002). ''Webs of Power: Notes from the Global Uprising''. New Society Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; She is known as a theorist of [[feminist]] [[Neopaganism]] and [[ecofeminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|title=Celebrate The Winter Solstice With Los Angeles' Own Eco-Pagans|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/11/starhawk-los-angeles-ritual_n_4390396.html|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a columnist for [[Beliefnet.com]] and for ''On Faith'', the ''[[Newsweek]]''/''[[Washington Post]]'' online forum on religion. 
Starhawk's book ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'' (1979) was one of the main inspirations behind the [[Goddess movement]].
In 2012, she was listed in [[Watkins Books|Watkins]]' ''Mind Body Spirit'' magazine as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |title=Watkins' Spiritual 100 List for 2012 - Watkins MIND BODY SPIRIT Magazine |publisher=Watkinsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Starhawk was born in 1951 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. Her father Jack Simos, died when she was five. Her mother, Bertha Claire Goldfarb Simos, was a professor of [[social work]] at [[UCLA]]. Both her parents were the children of [[Jewish]] immigrants from Russia.

In [[high school]] she and fellow feminist [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] were best friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=1KrA4BQ6rAY&amp;t=14m37s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Fine Arts from UCLA. In 1973, while she was a graduate student in [[film]] there, she won the [[Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards|Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award]] for her novel, ''A Weight of Gold'', a story about [[Venice, California]], where she then lived. She received an MA in [[Psychology]], with a concentration in feminist therapy, from [[Antioch University West]] in 1982.

==''The Spiral Dance''==
{{main|The Spiral Dance}}
Following her years at UCLA, after a failed attempt to become a fiction writer in New York City, Starhawk returned to California. She became active in the Neopagan community in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and trained with [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor Anderson]], founder of the [[Feri Tradition]] of witchcraft, and with [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]], a feminist separatist involved in [[Dianic Wicca]].

She wrote a book, ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'', on Goddess religion, which she finished in 1977 but was unable to publish at first. Feminist religious scholar [[Carol P. Christ]] included an article on witchcraft and the Goddess movement in the anthology ''Womanspirit Rising'' (1979). Christ put Starhawk in touch with an editor at [[Harper &amp; Row]], who eventually published the book.

First published in 1979, ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess'' became a best-selling book about [[Neopagan]] belief and practice. A 10th-anniversary edition was published in 1989, followed by a 20th-anniversary edition in 1999.  The original text of ''The Spiral Dance'' was left largely intact for these editions, expanded primarily by introductions and commentaries reflecting on the book's origins, the rituals described, and the evolution of the author's beliefs and practices. Since its publication, ''The Spiral Dance'' has become a classic resource on [[Wicca]] and modern [[witchcraft]], [[spiritual feminism]], the [[Goddess movement]], and [[ecofeminism]]. The work is distinguished by its visionary mysticism, "broad philosophy of harmony with nature," and ecstatic consciousness.

==Beliefs==

"'What do we do...those of us who do believe the earth is sacred, who do believe that we have a responsibility to care for the living systems that sustain us, and who do believe that we have a responsibility to take care of each other?'"&lt;ref&gt;"Starhawk's Tangled Web." http://www.starhawk.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk believes that the Earth is a living entity, and that faith-based activism can reconnect oneself to basic human needs. She posits core religious values of community and self-sacrifice as important to eco-pagan movements, as well as the broader environmental justice movement.

Starhawk advocates combining social justice issues with a nature-based spirituality that begins with spending time in the natural world, saying that doing so "...can open up your understanding on deeper and more subtle levels where the natural world will speak to you."&lt;ref&gt;Blumberg, Antonia (December 11, 2013). "Celebrate The Winter Solstice With Los Angeles' Own Eco-Pagans". The Huffington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;
Starhawk's activism is deeply rooted in an anti-war philosophy, as she believes that war teaches one to see people culturally different than themselves as inhuman and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;"Feminist, Earth-based Spirituality and Ecofeminism," in Healing the Wounds by Judith Plant&lt;/ref&gt;
Starhawk has written extensively on activism, including advice for activist organizers, examinations of white privilege within radical communities, and calls for an intersectionality of fighting oppression that includes spirituality, eco-consciousness, and sexual and gender liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starhawk.org/writings/writings.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505044500/http://starhawk.org/writings/writings.html |archivedate=May 5, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==

Starhawk's feminism and spirituality are closely interconnected, and her belief that feminism should challenge power structures denotes her intersectional approach.&lt;ref&gt;Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion (1979) by Carol P. Christ and Judith Plaskow&lt;/ref&gt; Her ecofeminism links life-giving Mother Nature with the life-giving of women through birth, as well as the link between ecological destruction and patriarchal oppression under male-dominated Western political economies.
She calls for a reconceptualization of the way we think about power that is different from what she posits as our typical understanding of 'power over' others, and believes that patriarchal systems of oppression are dying out and will be replaced by more egalitarian structures that have existed previously with many women in positions of power, including as priestesses, poets, healers, singers, and seers. Such matrilineal lineages, she argues, have been erased from history because of their "political implications."

Starhawk argues that our patriarchal culture of domination has confused the erotic with domination and violence.&lt;ref&gt;The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Goddess (1979) by Starhawk&lt;/ref&gt; Sexuality, she says, "...is sacred because through it we make a connection with another self — but it is misused and perverted when it becomes an arena of power-over, a means of treating another — or oneself — as an object."&lt;ref&gt;Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex and Politics (1982) by Starhawk&lt;/ref&gt; Such analyses of gendered power relations are explored in her books ''Webs of Power: Notes from the Global Uprising'' (2003) and ''Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery'' (1998). In the latter, Starhawk links the rise of kinship to patriarchal domination, and traces a psychology of liberation in analyzing an oppressor she argues is embedded deeply in all of us, the 'Self-hater.'&lt;ref&gt;Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery (1988) by Starhawk&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Starhawk is interested in how such oppressions can be reformed into new sources of power, particularly amongst women, that arise innately and reject dominion over others.

Starhawk's feminist writings have been used to analyze the differences between mainstream rhetoric and feminist rhetoric, particularly in relation to her motive of writing rhetoric as revealing immanent truths rather than being utilized for persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K., and Cindy L. Griffin. "A Feminist Perspective on Rhetorical Theory: Toward a Clarification of Boundaries." Western Journal of Communication 56.4 (1992): 330–49. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter purpose of mainstream rhetoric is viewed by Starhawk as adhering to patriarchal logic, and her vision of 'empowered action' – which involves rejecting the tenets of the oppressive system and then openly challenging them – attempts to transform persuasive mainstream rhetoric to immanent feminist rhetoric.

==Projects==

In 1979, partly to commemorate the publication of ''The Spiral Dance'', Starhawk and her friends staged a public celebration of the [[Sabbat (neopaganism)|Neopagan holiday]] of [[Samhain]] (Halloween) incorporating an actual [[spiral dance]]. This group became the [[Reclaiming (neopaganism)|Reclaiming Collective]], and their annual Spiral Dance ritual now draws hundreds of participants.

Starhawk continues to work with Reclaiming, a tradition of Witchcraft that she co-founded. This now international organization offers classes, workshops, camps, and public rituals in earth-based spirituality, with the goal to "unify spirit and politics".

She also works internationally as a trainer in [[nonviolence]] and [[direct action]], and as an activist within the [[peace movement]], [[feminism|women's movement]], [[environmental movement]], and [[anti-globalization movement]]. She travels and teaches widely in North America, Europe and the Middle East, giving lectures and workshops.

She was influential in the decision by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] to include earth-centered traditions among their sources of faith.  She led numerous workshops for, and was an active member of The [[Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans]] (CUUPS), an interest group of [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarians]] honoring goddess-based, earth-centered, tribal, and pagan spiritual paths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuups.org/content2/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511204010/http://www.cuups.org/content2/ |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starhawk has taught in several San Francisco Bay Area colleges and universities, including [[John F. Kennedy University]], [[Antioch University West]], the [[Creation Spirituality|Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality]] at [[Holy Names University]], and [[Creation Spirituality|Wisdom University]]. She is presently adjunct faculty at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]], and is currently affiliated with [[United for Peace and Justice]], the RANT trainers' collective, Earth Activist Training, and other groups.

'''Tahir Allauddin''' Al-Gillani (السيد طاهر علاؤ الدين الجيلاني البغدادي) (18 June 1932 – 7 June 1991) formally referred to as '''His Holiness, Qudwatul Awliya Naqeeb ul Ashraaf Hazoor Pir Syedna Tahir Allauddin alGillani alQadri alBaghdadi''', was a Sufi Saint who lived in the twentieth century and was the head of the [[Qadiriyya]] Baghdadia Spiritual [[Tariqa]]. He was the custodian of the Shrine of Ghous-e-Azam [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] and has been accepted by many as a reformer of [[Tassawwuf]] and [[Tariqat]].&lt;ref name="thefinancialdaily1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefinancialdaily.com/Articles/ViewArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=3658|title=Spiritual Master Tahir Alauddin By: Yahya Hussain - Articles Detail|publisher=thefinancialdaily.com|accessdate=2015-09-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045102/http://thefinancialdaily.com/Articles/ViewArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=3658|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Baghdad on 18 June 1932, he traces his lineage by seventeen steps to [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] and 28 steps to the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilani.com.pk/sufies/tahir.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221081449/http://www.gilani.com.pk/sufies/tahir.htm |date=21 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Al-Gillani left Baghdad and migrated to Pakistan, where he settled permanently in Quetta. He stayed in Pakistan until he died in June 1991 in Germany, and later on he was buried in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. He had three sons, AlSyed Mahmood Mohyuddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri, AlSyed Abdul Qadir Jamaluddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri and AlSyed Muhammad Ziauddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri, who propagate the teachings of Silsilah e [[Qadiriyya]] Tahiria.

==Background and education==
Al-Gillani came from an Iraqi family who are the [[custodians]] of the [[Mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani|mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani]]. He is the youngest of the six sons of Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf  Mahmood Hussamuddin al-Gillani al-Qadri. His grandfather, Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf [[Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani]], was the first [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] (11 November 1920 – 20 November 1922) following the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The current Custodian of the Shrine of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] is his elder-brother, Naqib ul Ashraaf AlSyed Ahmed Zafar Al-Gillani, who also served as the ambassador of Iraq in Pakistan from 1978 until 1992.&lt;ref name="gilanisyeds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilanisyeds.com/darbar-e-ghousia-gilania|title=gilanisyeds.com&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;This website is for sale!&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;gilanisyeds Resources and Information.|publisher=gilanisyeds.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Al-Gillani would spend the entire night alone in seclusion at the shrine of his ancestor Shaykh [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]. He received his spiritual training and mentoring directly from his father Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf Alsyed Mahmood Hussamuddin AlGillani Al-Qadri, who was a Sufi and the custodian of the mausoleum of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]]. Al-Gillani completed his other traditional religious studies at the  [[Madrassa]] of Syed Sultan Ali in Baghdad, where he studied under scholars of Iraq including Syed Ali Afridi, Qasim alQaise, Khalil ar-Ravee and the Grand Mufti of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tazkira e Qadiria |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration==
In 1956, Al-Gillani left the city of Baghdad and migrated to Pakistan after receiving spiritual orders from [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]. Al-Gillani first completed 40 days seclusion (Chilla) at the Shrine of the Sufi saint Data Ganj Baksh [[Ali Hujwiri]] in Lahore.&lt;ref name="Qudwatul Awliya"&gt;{{cite book |title=Qudwatul Awliya |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then settled in [[Quetta]], where he established the Darbar-e-Ghousia religious school.&lt;ref name="Qudwatul Awliya"/&gt; In honour of Al-Gilani's presence, the government of [[Balochistan]] renamed the road to Al-Gillani Road.&lt;ref name="AlGilani Road"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthstreetview.com/?lid=7046510_PK_RRD_02&amp;place=Share-Al-Gilani-Pakistan|title=Share Al Gilani, Balochistan, Pakistan - Satellite Image, Street View and Map|publisher=earthstreetview.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darbar-e-Ghousia became the official headquarters of Tariqa Qadiria in the sub-continent and is still run by the sons of Al-Gillani.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

He received a personal visit from President General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], to welcome him to Pakistan. General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] pledged Baith (Oath of Allegiance) in the [[Qadiriyya]] Tariqa at the hands of Al-Gillani.&lt;ref name="yamurshid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yamurshid.com/Main/images/phocagallery/HQA/1214331090_hhsta3.jpg|title=Image: 1214331090_hhsta3.jpg, (400 × 250 px)|publisher=yamurshid.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Gillani was visited by presidents, politicians, tribal leaders and religious scholars for his prayers, advice and guidance.

==Life sketch==

Following in the footsteps of his ancestor [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]], Al-Gillani spent the majority of his life in [[Khalwa]] (spiritual seclusion) and undertaking Mujahida (spiritual exercises). There is little known about Al-Gillani's life as he would strictly forbid his followers from writing about him. Al-Gillani was very strict in adherence to the laws of [[Shariah]] and [[Tariqah]], and until he died he worked tirelessly at propagating the teachings of his ancestor Abdul Qadir Gilani and the other Mashaikh of the [[Qadiriyya]] path. He encouraged Islamic Unity and would often speak out against acts which were considered bad innovations and rituals that had crept inside [[Tassawuf]] &lt;ref name="Qudwatul Awliya"/&gt;

Since a young age, he began touring across the world for propagating Islam and the teachings of Tariqa Qadiria. His visits included Saudi Arabia, India, Bangladesh, United Kingdom, Germany, Egypt, Canada, Indonesia, Singapore, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sri Lanka and the Gulf States.&lt;ref name="thefinancialdaily1"/&gt; During Al-Gillani’s visit of Ceylon in 1958, he established a care-home in Ceylon for needy and orphaned children.

When Al-Gillani visited India in 1952, he visited the city of Bareilly on the invitation of Mufti Muhammad Mustafa Raza Khan Noori Qadri, the Grand Mufti of India. When Al-Gillani reached [[Bareilly]], his car was lifted by the hundreds of thousands of devotees and carried to the residence of Mufti Mustafa Raza Khan.&lt;ref name="barielly photo"&gt;https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/644192_455297664553207_231134639_n.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that Mufti Mustafa Raza Khan was so respectful of Al-Gillani that he remained barefoot for the duration of his stay and would stand to serve him. On this occasion, Maulana Mustafa Raza Khan also made several of his family members pledge Baith on the hands of Al-Gillani including the current Grand Mufti of India Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Qadri al-Azhari.&lt;ref name="Tazkira e Awliya Hyderabad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tazkira e Awliya Hyderabad |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this visit to India, Al-Gillani  was visited by the heads of major Sufi Tariqas situated here, including Abdul Qadeer Badayuni Qadri and [[Muhammad Abdul Qadeer Siddiqi Qadri]].

In the 1960s, Al-Gillani was invited to the city of [[Faisalabad]] by the grand scholar of Pakistan Muhadith e  Azam e Pakistan Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri to attend the opening ceremony of Jamia Rizvia. To welcome Al-Gillani and for his protocol, Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri arranged for rolls of white silk to be spread the entire journey from his Madrassa to the Railway Station. It is reported that a small spot had been left uncovered near the door of the Madrassa and Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri kneeled down and used his own beard to sweep this area clean.&lt;ref name="Tazkira e Awliya Hyderabad"/&gt;

After a three storey stage was erected, Al-Gillani was seated at the top and covered in rose petals, and Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri and other Mashaikh sat beneath his feet on the second storey and Maulana Sardar Ahmed placed his own sons and students on the last level. At the conclusion of the gathering, the crowds were un-controllable as they rushed in the hope of meeting or touching Al-Gilani so Maulana Sardar Ahmed ordered for a side wall had to be demolished so Al-Gillani could leave safely.&lt;ref name="Tazkira e Awliya Hyderabad"/&gt;

Al-Gillani would be invited as 'Main Guest' to conferences and events, being held both nationally and internationally. These include the International Khatm e Nabuwat Conference held at [[Minar e Pakistan]], the inauguration of Minhaj-ul-Quran International held at Lahore in 1984, the International Minhaj-ul-Quran Conference held at [[Lahore]] in 1987, the Al-Hejaz Conference held in London and the historic International Minhaj ul Quran Conference held at Wembley Arena, London in 1988 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5csDQHKXiZ8 |title=3/4: Yaadain Hazoor Qudwatul Awliya Syedna Tahir Alauddin(ra) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==

''''' The Enigma of Health: The Art of Healing in a Scientific Age''''' ({{lang-de|Über die Verborgenheit der Gesundheit}}) is a 1993 book by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] about the [[philosophy of medicine]] in which Gadamer examines the key components of [[medical practice]] such as [[death]], [[life]], [[anxiety]], [[freedom]], [[health]] and [[the relationship between the body and the soul]] based on the [[phenomenological framework]] developed by [[Martin Heidegger]] in ''[[Being and Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malpas|first1=Jeff|last2=Gander|first2=Hans-Helmuth|title=The Routledge Companion to Hermeneutics|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317676645|pages=556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUaLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA556&amp;lpg=PA556&amp;dq=ENIGMA+OF+HEALTH+figal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FdpSDAn4uK&amp;sig=37SPejuZXMx6iKrM9O9J-mHdFYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivk8Kn-4HYAhUkQZoKHb7wDdcQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ENIGMA%20OF%20HEALTH%20figal&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doyon|first1=Stéphane|title=GADAMER, Hans-Georg, The Enigma of Health.

{{italic title}}
The book '''''The Mechanism of Mind''''' by [[Edward de Bono]] details the underpinning model of mind that leads to the many thinking skills developed by its author, including [[lateral thinking]].

== The Model ==
The model detailed in the book, and referred to again in many of Edward de Bono's other books, is one of Neurones networked together by many stronger and weaker connections and activating as a result of input stimulus or stimulation from other neurones that are themselves active. Neurones that are active together form stronger connections and are more likely to activate together in the future. The model is a [[Self-organizing system]].

It is not intended that the model be a detailed analysis of how human brains are structured but the broadest possible abstraction that can provide meaningful understanding of the nature of thinking. Nor is it intended to build a cohesive theory but to provide the reader with a collection of concepts that will illuminate further thinking about thinking.

More detailed models and theories specifically about the brain can be found under the topic of [[Cognitive Science]] and [[connectionism]].

== Behaviour of the Model ==
The characteristic behaviour of the system is shown to create and reinforce patterns. The current set of patterns in the system determine how new experiences are integrated. Attention tends to flow along well-worn paths and patterns have large catchment areas. Novel experiences are often lost as attention flows down old paths that are in some way similar to the new experience. Sometimes starting at a different point in an established pattern can lead to a jump out of that pattern to a new one.

These behaviours are analogs to human thinking behaviours such as circular thinking, prejudice, polarisation, insight and humour.

== Consequences ==
The mind as modeled has some severe limitations.

From ''The Mechanism of Mind'' page 182:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Cquote|The limitations of the special memory surface can take one of three forms:

# Inability to carry out certain functions.
# Actual error.
# Inefficient use of information available to it.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thinking modes such as Natural Thinking, Logical Thinking, Mathematical Thinking and Lateral Thinking, are examined in the light of these limitations to see how they may be addressed. The techniques of Lateral Thinking are shown to be specifically designed to bypass these limitations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">"'''Unified Science'''" can refer to any of three related strands in contemporary thought.
* Belief in the [[unity of science]] was a central tenet of [[logical positivism]]. Different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways, e.g. as a [[reductionism|reductionist]] thesis, that the objects investigated by the [[special sciences]] reduce to the objects of a common, putatively more basic domain of science, usually thought to be physics; as the thesis that all of the theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or "universal slang"; or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common [[scientific method|method]].
* The writings of [[Edward Haskell]] and a few associates, seeking to rework science into a single discipline employing a common artificial language. This work culminated in the 1972 publication of ''[[Full Circle (Haskell)|Full Circle: The Moral Force of Unified Science]]''.  The vast part of the work of Haskell and his contemporaries remains unpublished, however. Timothy Wilken and [[Anthony Judge]] have recently revived and extended the insights of Haskell and his coworkers.
* Unified Science has been a consistent thread since the 1940s in [[Howard T. Odum]]'s [[systems ecology]] and the associated [[Emergy Synthesis]], modeling the "[[ecosystem]]": the geochemical, biochemical, and thermodynamic processes of the [[lithosphere]] and [[biosphere]]. Modeling such earthly processes in this manner requires a science uniting geology, physics, biology, and chemistry (H.T.Odum 1995). With this in mind, Odum developed a [[Energy Systems Language | common language of science]] based on electronic schematics, with applications to ecology economic systems in mind (H.T.Odum 1994).

{{Semiotics}}
'''Vyacheslav Vsevolodovich Ivanov''' ({{lang-ru|Вячесла́в Все́володович Ива́нов}}, 21 August 1929 – 7 October 2017) was a prominent [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Russia]]n [[philologist]], [[semiotician]] and [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Europeanist]] probably best known for his [[glottalic theory]] of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[consonant]]ism and for placing the Indo-European [[urheimat]] in the area of the [[Armenian Highland]]s and [[Lake Urmia]].

==Early life==
Vyacheslav Ivanov's father was [[Vsevolod Ivanov]], one of the most prominent Soviet writers. His mother was an actress who worked in the theatre of [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]. His childhood was clouded by disease and war, especially in [[Tashkent]].

Ivanov was educated at [[Moscow University]] and worked there until 1958, when he was fired on account of his sympathy with [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Roman Jakobson]]. By that time, he had made some important contributions to [[Indo-European studies]] and became one of the leading authorities on [[Hittite language]].

==Career==
* 1959–1961 — head of the Research Group for Machine Translation at the Institute of Computer
Technology of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], Moscow
* 1963–1989 — head of the Structural Typology Sector of the [[Institute for Slavic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Slavic Studies]] of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Moscow
* 1989–1993 — director of the [[Margarita Rudomino All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature|All-Union Library of Foreign Literature]] in Moscow (VGBIL)
* 1989–1995 — chair of the Department of Theory and History of World Culture of the Philosophical Faculty of [[Moscow State University]]
* 1992–2017 — founding director of Moscow State University’s [[Institute of World Culture]]
* 2003–2017 — founding director of the Russian Anthropological School at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] in Moscow
* from November 1991 — professor in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures and the Program of Indo-European Studies at [[UCLA|University of California — Los Angeles]]; retired in 2015, distinguished research professor since then

The member of the academies of sciences and learned societies: 
* the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]
* the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]
* the [[British Academy]]
* the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]
* the [[Latvian Academy of Sciences]]
* the [[Linguistic Society of America]]
* the [[American Philosophical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;Pilshchikov, I. &amp; Vroon, R. (2018). [http://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/smp/article/view/smp.2018.5.1.05 Vyacheslav V. Ivanov (1929–2017) and his Studies in Prosody and Poetics]. Studia Metrica et Poetica, Vol 5 No 1, 106-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a full member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 2000, and he has been a Foreign Fellow of the [[British Academy]] since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/users/professor-dr-vjaceslav-ivanov British Academy Fellows. Record for: IVANOV, Professor Dr Vjaceslav]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 1989 he was elected to the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]], but left for the United States soon thereafter.

==Scholarly contribution==
During the early 1960s, Ivanov was one of the first Soviet scholars to take a keen interest in the development of [[semiotics]]. He worked with [[Vladimir Toporov]] on several linguistic monographs, including an outline of [[Sanskrit]]. In 1962 he joined Toporov and [[Juri Lotman]] in establishing the [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]]. In the 1980s Ivanov worked with [[Tamaz Gamkrelidze]] on a new theory of [[Indo-European migrations]], which was most recently advocated by them in ''Indo-European and Indo-Europeans'' (1995).

==Other interests==
In 1965 Vyacheslav Ivanov edited, wrote extensive scholarly comments, and published the first Russian edition of previously unpublished "Psychology of Art" by [[Lev Vygotsky]] (the work written in the first half of the 1920s). The second, extended and corrected edition of the book came out in 1968 and included another Vygotsky's unpublished work, his treatise on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (written in 1915-1916). The first edition of the book was subsequently translated into English by Scripta Technica Inc. and released by [[MIT Press]] in 1971.

Apart from his scholarly pursuits, Vyacheslav Ivanov wrote poetry. He also published several books of memoirs, including two on his acquaintances with [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]].

'''''Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness''''' is a 1998 book by neurologist and Zen practitioner [[James H. Austin]], in which the author attempts to establish links between the [[neurology|neurological]] workings of the [[human]] [[brain]] and [[meditation]]. The eventual goal would be to establish mechanisms by which [[meditation]] induces changes in the activity of the [[brain]], which in turn induces a state of mental clarity. For example, Austin presents evidence from [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] scans that deep relaxed breathing reduces brain activity.

The publishers described their book as a "Comprehensive text on the evidence from [[neuroscience]] that helps to clarify which brain mechanisms underlie the subjective states of [[Zen]], and employs Zen to 'illuminate' how the brain works in various states of [[consciousness]]". Austin starts with a discussion of Zen Buddhism, its goals, and practices. Having laid this groundwork, he then turns to explore the neurological basis of consciousness.

Austin wrote a follow-up, ''Zen-Brain Reflections''.
