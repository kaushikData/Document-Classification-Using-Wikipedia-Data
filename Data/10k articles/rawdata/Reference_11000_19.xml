Terrorism cannot be justified on any account. Japan reiterates its firm condemnation of brutal terrorist attacks, which victimize the innocent. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims and the bereaved and wish the injured will have a speedy recovery.}}

In spite of the name, the included texts have broad coverage and do not necessarily relate to the [[Old Testament]]. [[William Wolfgang Hallo|William W. Hallo]], writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'' in 1970, described it as "a modern classic ever since its first appearance in 1950", because "for the first time it assembled some of the most significant Ancient Near Eastern texts in authoritative, generously annotated English translations based on the accumulated insight of several generations of scholarship scattered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=William W. |last=Hallo|publisher=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|title=Review: The Ancient Near East Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament Consisting of Supplementary Materials for The Ancient Near East In Pictures and Ancient Near Eastern Texts by James B.

culture where such materials are scarce or nonexistent, and to preserve and disseminate these materials
for research and instructional purposes. In doing so, its mission is to provide these materials to the general public through outreach
programs such as live performances, exhibitions, seminars, workshops, and summer music
camps and to engage in collaborative research and creative projects with units at Indiana University as
well as with state and national institutions and associations. In addition, AAAMC develops instructional multi-media
materials such as websites, CD-ROM programs, and video documentaries related to various
aspects of African American music and provides practical experience in archiving and 
preparation of materials for public use.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/12085/17878&lt;/ref&gt; 

The AAAMC supports the research of scholars, students, and the general public worldwide by providing access to holdings which include oral histories, photographs, musical and print manuscripts, audio and video recordings, educational broadcast programs, and the personal papers of individuals and organizations concerned with Black music. The repository also encourages exploration of its collections and related topics through a variety of public events, print and online publications, and pedagogical resources.&lt;ref&gt;https://aaamc.indiana.edu/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8442">The '''Augmented Reality Markup Language''' ('''ARML''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/arml The ARML 2.0 Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; is a data standard to describe and interact with [[augmented reality]] (AR) scenes. It has been developed within the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)]] by a dedicated ARML 2.0 Standards Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/arml2.0swg The official web presence of the ARML 2.0 Standards Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt; ARML consists of both an [[XML]] grammar to describe the location and appearance of virtual objects in the scene, as well as [[ECMAScript]] bindings to allow dynamic access to the properties of the virtual objects, as well as event handling, and is currently published in version 2.0. ARML focuses on visual augmented reality (i.e. the camera of an AR-capable device serves as the main output for augmented reality scenarios).

== Data model ==
ARML is built on a generic object model that allows serialization in several languages. Currently, ARML defines an XML serialization, as well as a [[JSON]] serialization for the ECMAScript bindings. The ARML object model consists of three main concepts:
* '''Features''' represent the physical object that should be augmented.
* '''VisualAssets''' describe the appearance of the virtual object in the augmented scene.
* '''Anchors''' describe the spatial relation between the physical and the virtual object.

=== Feature ===
The definition of a ''Feature'' is reused from the [[Geography Markup Language|Geography Markup Language (GML)]] and describes the physical object that should be augmented. The physical object is described by a set of metadata, including an ID, a name and a description. A Feature has one or more Anchors.

=== Anchor ===
An Anchor describes the location of the physical object in the real world. Four different Anchor types are defined in ARML:
# '''Geometries'''
# '''Trackables'''
# '''RelativeTo'''
# '''ScreenAnchor'''

==== Geometries ====
Geometries describe the location of an object through a set of fixed coordinates. [[WGS84]] (latitude, longitude, altitude) is used as the default coordinate reference system, other arbitrary coordinate reference systems can be supplied if required. ARML allows 0- (Point), 1- (LineString) and 2-dimensional (Polygon) geometries. Geometry Anchors reuse the syntax as defined in GML3. As an example, the following snippet defines the location of the [[Wiener Riesenrad]].

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
 &lt;gml:Point gml:id="ferrisWheelViennaPoint"&gt;
  &lt;gml:pos&gt;
    48.216622 16.395901
  &lt;/gml:pos&gt;
 &lt;/gml:Point&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Trackables ====
Trackables are patterns that are searched, recognized and tracked in the video screen coming from the camera of the device. A wide variety of different tracking technologies exist, including [[QR code]]s, [[Natural feature]]s, 3D and Face Tracking. As all these tracking types use different algorithms and technologies, the definition of a Trackable is abstracted and split into two parts, a '''Tracker''' and its associated '''Trackables'''. A Tracker describes the technology (or algorithm) with which its associated Trackables should be tracked, using URIs identifying the algorithm. The Trackable itself describes the pattern the algorithm should look for in the video stream.

Example: A natural feature tracker and an associated Trackable
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
 &lt;Tracker id="defaultImageTracker"&gt;
  &lt;uri xlink:href="http://opengeospatial.org/arml/tracker/genericImageTracker" /&gt;
 &lt;/Tracker&gt;
    
 &lt;Trackable&gt;
  &lt;config&gt;
   &lt;tracker xlink:href="#defaultImageTracker" /&gt;
   &lt;src&gt;http://www.myserver.com/myMarker.jpg{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/src&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
  &lt;size&gt;0.20&lt;/size&gt;
 &lt;/Trackable&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== RelativeTo ====
RelativeTo Anchors allow the definition of a location relative to other Anchors or the user's position. The former allows the setup of a scene and the location of all included virtual objects based on a single Anchor, like a Trackable placed on a table. The latter allows for scenarios where the actual location of the user is irrelevant. The virtual objects are simply placed around the user, regardless of his or her physical location.

==== ScreenAnchor ====
Contrary to the previous three Anchor types, ScreenAnchors do not describe a location in the 3-dimensional virtual scene. Instead, they define an area on the device screen, allowing for status bars and the like.

=== VisualAsset ===
VisualAssets describe the appearance of the virtual objects in the augmented scene. ARML allows various kinds of VisualAssets to be described, including plain text, images, HTML content and 3D models. VisualAssets can be oriented (either to always automatically face the user, or to maintain a specific static orientation) and scaled. Additionally, visibility conditions can be applied (i.e. the Asset is only visible on the screen if the distance to the user is within certain boundaries).

== History ==
In late 2009, [[Wikitude]] (formerly Mobilizy), the creators of the Wikitude World Browser, started an early initiative on creating a format all AR Browsers at that time could adhere to, called the Augmented Reality Markup Language (ARML).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perey.com/MobileARSummit/Mobilizy-ARML.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This format is now called ARML 1.0 and serves as an input format for the Wikitude World Browser.

In late 2011, Martin Lechner, Wikitude's CTO and the main driver of the ARML initiative, established the Augmented Reality Markup Language 2.0 Standards Working Group (ARML 2.0 SWG) within the OGC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1721&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal was to create an internationally accepted standard for Augmented Reality, based on the ideas of ARML 1.0 and similar formats. During [[International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality|ISMAR]] in [[Atlanta]] in November 2012, the first ARML 2.0 specification was officially published,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1473&lt;/ref&gt; making ARML 2.0 an official OGC Candidate Standard.

== Related standards ==
ARML 2.0 is reusing ideas, structure, syntax and semantics of the following existing and widely used standards:&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lechner, The Augmented Reality Markup Language 2.0, Dissertation&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[HyperText Markup Language]], [[ECMAScript]] ([[JavaScript]]) and [[Cascading Style Sheets]]
* [[Geography Markup Language]]
* [[Keyhole Markup Language]]
* [[COLLADA]]
* [[XPath 2.0]]

In addition, the following, ARML-independent initiatives also deal with creating standards for Augmented Reality environments:
* Augmented Reality Application Format (ARAF) &lt;ref&gt;http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-a/augmented-reality-application-format&lt;/ref&gt; developed within [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[MPEG]]
* KARML &lt;ref&gt;https://research.cc.gatech.edu/kharma/content/karml-reference&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]
* MobAR &lt;ref&gt;http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/release_program/MobAr_v1_0.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; developed within the [[Open Mobile Alliance|Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)]]

== Examples ==
The following example describes a 3D Model (assuming one is available on http://www.myserver.com/myModel.dae{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) on a Trackable, like a fiducial marker, located at http://www.myserver.com/myMarker.jpg{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;arml&gt;
 &lt;ARElements&gt;

  &lt;!-- register the Tracker to track a generic image --&gt;
  &lt;Tracker id="defaultImageTracker"&gt;
   &lt;uri xlink:href="http://opengeospatial.org/arml/tracker/genericImageTracker" /&gt;
  &lt;/Tracker&gt;

  &lt;!-- define the artificial marker the Model will be placed on top of --&gt;
  &lt;Trackable&gt;
   &lt;assets&gt;
    &lt;!-- define the 3D Model that should be visible on top of the marker --&gt;
    &lt;Model&gt;
     &lt;href xlink:href="http://www.myserver.com/myModel.dae" /&gt;
    &lt;/Model&gt;
   &lt;/assets&gt;
   &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;tracker xlink:href="#defaultImageTracker" /&gt;
    &lt;src&gt;http://www.myserver.com/myMarker.jpg&lt;/src{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;
   &lt;/config&gt;
   &lt;size&gt;0.20&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;/Trackable&gt;
 &lt;/ARElements&gt;
&lt;/arml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''Balmoral Grist Mill Museum''' is a restored 1874 water powered [[grist mill]] located in [[Balmoral Mills]], [[Nova Scotia]]. The site includes a {{convert|1|km|mi}} walking trail along the ravine of Balmoral Brook. The mill is part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system. It could be used to grind [[wheat]], [[oats]], and [[buckwheat]] into [[flour]] and [[meal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/en/home/ourmuseums/default.aspx Nova Scotia Museums]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125041021/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/en/home/ourmuseums/default.aspx |date=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mill was built in 1874 by Alexander McKay, the son of Scottish immigrants.  He purchased the land for the mill for $12.  He utilized a new technology for the time, the [[water turbine]], to drive four grindstones.  When Alexander died in 1886, the mill passed to his son, Hugh.&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Reid|first=Mark Collin|title=Against the grain|magazine=[[Canada's History]]|date=April-May 2018|volume=98|issue=2|pages=64-65|issn=1920-9894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh sold the mill 20 years later to Alexander McLean MacDonald.  MacDonald passed the mill to his son Archie in 1940.  In the 1950s, the mill, facing competition from larger modern mills, shut down.&lt;ref name="reid" /&gt;

In 1964, the Sunrise Trail Museum in [[Tatamagouche]] began the process of restoring the mill, hiring the former owner, Archie MacDonald to run the mill.  Due to financial constraints, the mill was sold to the Nova Scotia government in 1966.  The government restored the mill and added an electric motor to drive the mill stones in place of the turbine that once provided power.&lt;ref name="reid" /&gt;

'''''Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. Ltd. et al. v. Wikileaks et al.''''' was a lawsuit filed by [[Julius Baer Group|Bank Julius Baer]] against the website [[WikiLeaks]].

In early February 2008, Judge [[Jeffrey White]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] forced [[Dynadot]], the [[domain registrar]] of wikileaks.org, to disassociate the site's [[domain name]] records with its servers, preventing use of the domain name to reach the site. Initially, the bank only wanted the documents to be removed (WikiLeaks had failed to name a contact person).

The judge's actions roused media and cyber-liberties groups to defend WikiLeaks' rights under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and brought renewed scrutiny to the documents the bank hoped to shield.

The judge lifted the injunction and the bank dropped the case on 5 March 2008.&lt;ref name=Claburn/&gt;

==Background==
In 2002, the bank learned that records pertaining to the arrangement of anonymizing trusts in the [[Cayman Islands]] for clients from 1997 to 2002 had been leaked. They interviewed the local employees with a [[polygraph]] as per company policy. The bank was unsatisfied with the answers of Cayman unit COO [[Rudolf Elmer]], and terminated his employment. In June 2005, the leak was reported by the Swiss financial weekly ''Cash'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', though details of individual accounts were not reported on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=16 June 2005
|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, Elmer released documents related to WikiLeaks regarding surveillance of him and his family. The next month, some of the leaked account data began appearing on WikiLeaks. Contributors to WikiLeaks allege that these provide evidence of [[asset hiding]], [[money laundering]] and [[tax evasion]]. Ten account holders in the United States, Spain, Peru, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, and Switzerland have been identified so far on WikiLeaks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

According to [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg|Daniel Schmitt]]'s analysis for WikiLeaks, leaked account data exists from after the date that Elmer left the Caymans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=15 February 2008
|work=[[WikiLeaks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2011, Elmer announced he would hand over offshore account details of 2,000 "high-net-worth individuals" to WikiLeaks. Then he would return to Switzerland from exile to face trial. Julius Baer says Elmer falsified the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss whistleblower Rudolf Elmer plans to hand over offshore banking secrets of the rich and famous to WikiLeaks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/16/swiss-whistleblower-rudolf-elmer-banks|date=16 January 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law firm representing Baer was Lavely and Singer. The law firm representing Baer works primarily in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. They applied for and got the injunction at a court in San Francisco - 450 miles (700&amp;nbsp;km) from Los Angeles. They claimed to be acting, in part, to protect Baer's customers from having information about the customers become public. But one of the documents filed in court by Lavely and Singer identified one of the customers of interest by name as well as giving his street address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s.p10.hostingprod.com/@spyblog.org.uk/ssl/wikileak/2008/02/lavely_singer_demonstrate_how_not_to_protect_the_confidentiality_of_customers_of.html |title=WikiLeak: Lavely &amp; Singer demonstrate how not to protect the confidentiality of customers of Bank Julius Baer |publisher=S.p10.hostingprod.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action, injunction==
{{wikinews|'Wikileaks.org' taken off line in many areas after fire, court injunction}}
In January, Bank Julius Baer began sending cease &amp; desist letters to WikiLeaks and its [[domain registrar]], Dynadot, for the wikileaks.org [[domain name]], citing the [[DMCA]].&lt;ref name=injunction&gt;{{cite press release | title=Wikileaks.org under injunction | url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks.org_under_injunction | work=WikiLeaks | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/california/candce/3:2008cv00824/200125/ |title=Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. Ltd. et al. v. WikiLeaks et al |publisher=News.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February 2008, Judge [[Jeffrey White]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] issued a permanent injunction against Dynadot forcing it to "lock the wikileaks.org domain name".&lt;ref&gt;[https://s.p10.hostingprod.com/@spyblog.org.uk/ssl/wikileak/censorship_threats_from_lawyers/ WikiLeak: Censorship threats from Lawyers Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712221746/https://s.p10.hostingprod.com/%40spyblog.org.uk/ssl/wikileak/censorship_threats_from_lawyers/ |date=2011-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mirror sites, such as http://wikileaks.be, were not affected.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7250916.stm Whistle blower site taken offline]," ''[[BBC News]]'', Monday, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dofonline.co.uk/governance/swiss-bank-obtains-injunction-against-whistleblower-site5352.html Swiss bank obtains injunction against whistleblower site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522125353/http://www.dofonline.co.uk/governance/swiss-bank-obtains-injunction-against-whistleblower-site5352.html |date=2008-05-22 }}," ''Director of Finance Online'', 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the posted [[injunction]] stated that "immediate harm will result to Plaintiffs in the absence of injunctive relief", as is required for injunctions to be granted. The general assumption is that some leaked documents were alleged by the bank to be [[libel]]lous, [[trade secrets]], [[copyright]]ed, or otherwise prohibited for distribution, in a manner that would cause harm to it.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=14974 Making Company Data Truly Public]," ''CorpWatch'', 12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks had not sent a representative to the hearing at which the injunction was granted. According to an editorial on the WikiLeaks website, Julius Baer had some communication with WikiLeaks before going to court to get the injunction, but did not inform WikiLeaks in which city it would seek the injunction and did not present to the court these email communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks_blasts_Cayman_Islands_bank |title=Wikileaks blasts Cayman Islands bank |work=WikiLeaks |date= |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916232953/http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks_blasts_Cayman_Islands_bank |archivedate=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coincidental fire at the hosting company used by WikiLeaks, [[PRQ]], centered in a high power supply regulator serving the majority of the data center, shut down and destroyed some sections of the specific DNS and dedicated hosting server racks used by WikiLeaks the same week.

==Negative publicity for bank==
The Julius Baer lawsuit drew a great deal more negative attention than would the leaks alone, due to the ''[[Streisand effect]]''.  Julius Baer had already got an injunction against WikiLeaks, prohibiting WikiLeaks from circulating the documents that Julius Baer wanted to suppress,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7268581.stm Legal aid for whistle-blower site]," ''[[BBC News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; without attracting significant attention from news media. But then Julius Baer drew a huge amount of attention to itself by seeking and getting a second injunction imposing a measure that would suppress not only the information that Julius Baer considered embarrassing, but also the entire WikiLeaks website consisting of all manner of documents presented as evidence of all manner of crimes - both in corporations and in governments, including human rights abuses - by many alleged criminals worldwide in cases having nothing to do with Julius Baer. For example, the site has given exposure to evidence of human rights abuses in China and political corruption in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betanews.com/article/EFF_ACLU_say_Wikileaks_shutdown_harms_First_Amendment_rights/1204147680 |title=EFF, ACLU say Wikileaks shutdown harms First Amendment rights |publisher=Betanews.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/02/26-0 |title=EFF, ACLU Move to Intervene in Wikileaks |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WikiLeaks website claims to have 1.2 million documents that users have posted anonymously to provide evidence of incidents of wrongdoing that deserve public scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#Wikileaks_has_1.2_million_documents.3F |title=About |work=WikiLeaks |date= |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504122032/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks%3AAbout |archivedate=4 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 14 of these documents were pertinent to the Julius Baer case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/27212/ |title=EFF, ACLU Move to Intervene in Wikileaks Case - USA |publisher=Kansas City infoZine News |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as backfiring in terms of the attention it attracted, the injunction could not be entirely effective in suppressing the website anyway in that the alternate WikiLeaks [[tld|domains]] were unaffected, and WikiLeaks was still available directly by its IP address, 88.80.13.160. To shut down these access methods, it would be necessary to pursue injunctions in the jurisdictions where they are registered, or where the servers reside, which are deliberately scattered to make this difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Vying for Control of the Internet: Is Wikileaks Unstoppable? | work=The Legality | url=http://www.thelegality.com/archives/28 | date=27 February 2008 | accessdate=3 March 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302214546/http://www.thelegality.com/archives/28 | archive-date=2008-03-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injunction lifted, case dropped==

One of the [[amicus curiae]] was Jordan McCorkle, an ordinary citizen who reads the WikiLeaks website regularly.

Beaford Arts is England's oldest [[rural arts]] organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beaford-arts.org.uk/ |title=Welcome |publisher=Beaford Arts |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; based at Greenwarren House in the village of [[Beaford]] in North [[Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beaford-arts.org.uk/index.php?id=10 |title=How to find us |publisher=Beaford Arts |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been involved in a number of arts projects including [[James Ravilious]]'s work to create the Beaford Archive. This collection of 80,000 black-and-white photographs taken over seventeen years "forms a unique exploration of the society, culture, geography and economy of a 'corner of England'".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hamilton, lecturer, Open University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better|date=July 2017}} The Beaford Archive also includes 10,000 older images of north Devon, mainly taken between 1880 and 1920, collected by Ravilious from his subjects during his work. It is currently stored in secure conditions in the [[North Devon Record Office]].

Beaford Arts' present functions are:
* supporting the existing work in the Beaford Archive
* developing and supporting new rural art work
* promoting performances in rural areas (the average population density in northern Devon is 189 people per square mile&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;)
* running a residential arts centre in Beaford for children and young people from across Devon.

For ten years from 1992 the Beaford Centre ran [[The Plough arts centre]] in [[Great Torrington|Torrington]]. Since 2002, however, they have been independent organisations.

'''''Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words''''' ({{ISBN|0-7679-1043-5}}) is a book by [[Bill Bryson]], published under several titles since 1984, that catalogues some of the [[English language]]'s most commonly misused words and phrases in order to demonstrate preferable [[usage]]. It helps writers and editors to think about how to make written communication clearer (or, in some cases, at least how to make it immune from pedantic editorial disparagement by avoiding the pedants' trigger points).

It was first published in 1984 with the title ''The [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] Dictionary of Troublesome Words'' ({{ISBN|014051130X}}) in the [[United Kingdom]] and with the title ''The [[Facts on File]] Dictionary of Troublesome Words'' ({{ISBN|0871968894}}) in the [[United States]]. It was republished in a revised edition in 1987; and again in the UK in 1997 under the title ''Troublesome Words'' ({{ISBN|0-14-026640-2}}). In 2002 it was published as ''Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words''.

As the author states, "This book might more accurately, if less convincingly, have been called ''A Guide to Everything in English Usage That the Author Wasn't Entirely Clear About Until Quite Recently.''"  Bryson describes the [[English language]] as a valuable entity, with no two experts agreeing on any point of usage, claiming that those guides that do exist for the common user often expect the reader to be familiar with [[grammatical]] terms not encountered since (or even at) high school.

Using almost forty standard works on the subject as his guide, Bryson aims to produce a list of difficult English words that is generally readable and informative while also useable as a [[reference work]].

This aim is accomplished using a large degree of [[humor|humour]] as well as a willingness to hold the experts he quotes up to the light for their own failings, thus illustrating how easy it is to make errors of usage, or at least to fail to adhere to preferable or optimal usage.

Like all other major usage advice books, it reflects the language epistemology of professional editors, which is not completely coincident with that of [[linguistics|linguistic scientists]].&lt;ref name="Pinker1994"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pinker |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=2007 |origyear=1994 |chapter=Chapter 12: The Language Mavens |title=[[The Language Instinct]] |pages=382–418 |isbn=978-1469228440 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes use of both [[linguistic prescription]] and [[linguistic description]], attempting to avoid the pathological extremes of prescription (valueless [[pedant]]ry such as [[hypercorrection]]) while also making use of its helpful side (which encourages [[critical thinking]]).

==Legal issues==

===.NET===
The Mono project aims to avoid infringing on any patents or copyrights, and to the extent that they are successful, the project can be safely distributed and used under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. On November 2, 2006, Microsoft and Novell announced a joint agreement whereby Microsoft promised not to sue Novell or its customers for patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/news/press/item.jsp?id=1196 Microsoft and Novell Announce Broad Collaboration on Windows and Linux Interoperability and Support]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement on the blog of Mono project leader [[Miguel de Icaza]], this agreement only extends to Mono for Novell developers and users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Nov-04.html|title=Statement on the blog of Mono project leader Miguel de Icaza regarding patent protection for Mono|date=2006-11-04|accessdate = 2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the possible threat of Microsoft patents, the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] recommends that people avoid creating software that depends on Mono or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Why free software shouldn't depend on Mono or C#

| quote=''We should systematically arrange to depend on the free C# implementations as little as possible. In other words, we should discourage people from writing programs in C#. Therefore, we should not include C# implementations in the default installation of GNU/Linux distributions, and we should distribute and recommend non-C# applications rather than comparable C# applications whenever possible.''

C# implementations can still be attacked by Microsoft's patents: the Community Promise is designed to give the company several outs if it wants them. We don't want to see developers' hard work lost to the community if we lose the ability to use Mono, and until we eliminate software patents altogether, using another language is the best way to prevent that from happening.''
| accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Microsoft/Novell agreement was criticized by some in the [[open source]] community because it violates the principles of giving equal rights to all users of a particular program (see [[Microsoft-Novell agreement|Agreement with Microsoft]] and [[Mono (software)#Mono and Microsoft's patents|Mono and Microsoft's patents]]).

In response to the Microsoft/Novell agreement, the [[Free Software Foundation]] revised its [[GNU General Public License]] to close the loophole used by Microsoft and Novell to bypass the GPL's very restrictive provisions on patent deals.&lt;ref name="gnuvsmicrosoft"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/index.htm Microsoft takes on the free world.]&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF also stated that by selling coupons for Novell's Linux software, the mechanism by which Microsoft circumvented the GNU license, it considers Microsoft to be a Linux vendor, and thereby subject to the full terms and conditions laid out in the GPL.&lt;ref name="gnuvsmicrosoft"/&gt;

The .NET landscape started to change in 2013, when Microsoft decided to open source many of its core .NET technologies under [[Apache License]],&lt;ref name="msopensource1"&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-still-open-sources-more-technologies-than-many-think-7000023595/ Microsoft still open sources more technologies than many think]&lt;/ref&gt; with even more donated to newly formed [[.NET Foundation]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="msopensource2"&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-open-sources-more-of-its-net-technologies-7000028031/ Microsoft open sources more of its .Net technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; Open sourced technologies include [[ASP.NET MVC]], [[Entity Framework]], [[Managed Extensibility Framework]], [[Microsoft Roslyn|Roslyn]] compiler-as-a-service infrastructure (together with C# and [[Visual Basic.NET]] compilers), [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] functional-first language compiler,&lt;ref name="fsharpfoundation"&gt;[http://fsharp.org/ The F# Software Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; and many more.&lt;ref name="netfoundationprojectlist"&gt;[http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects .NET Foundation Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft and [[Xamarin]] announced collaboration, with the intent to increase cross-platform availability of .NET on Mac OS, Linux, and mobile devices.&lt;ref name="msxamarincollaboration"&gt;[http://www.citeworld.com/article/2114289/development/xamarin-partners-microsoft-deliver-net-everywhere.html Xamarin partners with Microsoft to deliver .NET everywhere]&lt;/ref&gt;
Microsoft released in June 2016 .NET Core 1.0, which is an open source crossplatform environment and a lean version of the pure Windows implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=core: Home repository for .NET Core|date=2018-01-14|url=https://github.com/dotnet/core|publisher=.NET Foundation|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional computer applications==

===Desktop applications===
Although Java's [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] (Abstract Window Toolkit) and [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] libraries are not shy of features, Java has struggled to establish a foothold in the desktop market. [[Sun Microsystems]] was also slow, in the eyes of some,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to promote Java to developers and end users alike in a way that makes it an appealing choice for desktop software. Even technologies such as [[Java Web Start]], which have few parallels within rival languages and platforms, have barely been promoted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The release of Java version 6.0 on December 11, 2006, saw a renewed focus on the desktop market with an extensive set of new tools for closer integration with the desktop. At the 2007 [[JavaOne]] conference Sun made further desktop related announcements, including a new language aimed at taking on [[Adobe Flash]] ([[JavaFX]]), a new lightweight way of downloading the JRE that sees the initial footprint reduced to under 2&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|Mb]], and a renewed focus on [[multimedia]] libraries.

An alternative to AWT and Swing is the [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] ([[Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT]]), which was originally developed by IBM and now maintained by the [[Eclipse Foundation]]. It attempts to achieve improved performance and visualization of Java desktop applications by relying on underlying native libraries where possible.

&lt;!-- Used to be "has taken a significant lead", except the supporting citation is merely a list of Mono applications, it doesn't offer any comparison with any other language or platform (let alone suggest a 'significant' lead by either.) --&gt;
On Windows, Microsoft's .NET is a popular desktop development providing both Windows Forms (a lightweight wrapper around the Win32 API), Windows Presentation Foundation, and Silverlight. With the integration of .NET into the Windows platform, .NET apps are first class citizens in the Windows environment with tighter OS integration and native look and feel compared to Java's Swing.

Outside of Windows, Silverlight is portable to the Mac OS X desktop. Mono is also becoming more common in open source and free software systems due to its inclusion&lt;ref name="monoapplications"&gt;[http://www.osnews.com/story.php/9780/Mono-Applications-Aplenty! Mono-Applications-Aplenty!, OSNews]&lt;/ref&gt; on many Linux desktop environments.

===Server applications===
This is probably the arena in which the two platforms are closest to being considered rivals. Java, through its [[Java EE]] (a.k.a. Java Platform Enterprise Edition) platform, and .NET through [[ASP.NET]], compete to create web-based dynamic content and applications.

Both platforms are well used and supported in this market. Of the top 1,000 websites, approximately 24% use ASP.net and also 24% use Java, whereas of all the websites approximately 17% use ASP.net and 3% use Java.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usage of server-side programming languages broken down by ranking|url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/programming_language/ranking|work=W3Techs.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Should the following not be part of Licensing, above ??? --&gt;
&lt;!-- The paragraphs below deal only with licensing and legal issues, and add nothing to the discussion about Server Applications that is the main focus of this topic!! --&gt;
Some of Oracle's Java-related license agreements for Java EE define aspects of the Java platform as a trade secret,&lt;ref name="sunj2eesdk5update2"&gt;[http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&amp;PartDetailId=java_ee_sdk-5_02-nojdk-oth-JPR&amp;SiteId=JSC&amp;TransactionId=noreg Java EE SDK 5 Update 2 No JDK download page (reference to license agreement)]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and prohibit the end user from contributing to a third-party Java environment. Specifically, at least one current license for an Oracle Java EE development package contains the following terms: ''"You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may not copy, modify, or distribute Software." — "Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software." — "You may not publish or provide the results of any  benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Oracle." — "Software is confidential and copyrighted."''&lt;ref name="sunj2eesdk5update2"/&gt;  However, while Oracle's software is subject to the above license terms, Oracle's Java EE [[API]] reference has been implemented under an open-source license by the [[JBoss]] and [[JOnAS]] projects.

Microsoft's implementation of [[ASP.NET]] is not part of the standardized CLI, and while Microsoft's runtime environment and development tools are not subject to comparable secrecy agreements to Java EE, the official Microsoft tools are not [[open source]] or [[free software]], and require Windows servers. However, a [[cross-platform]] free software ASP.NET implementation is part of the [[Mono (software)|Mono project]] (minus webparts and [[Web Services Enhancements]]).&lt;ref name="mono_asp_net"&gt;[http://www.mono-project.com/ASP.NET Mono: ASP.NET]&lt;/ref&gt; Mono supports ASP.NET 4.0 including Web Forms, Microsoft AJAX, and ASP.NET MVC.&lt;ref name="mono_asp_net_4"&gt;[http://www.mono-project.com/Compatibility Mono: ASP.NET]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embedded applications==

===Mobile applications===
Google's popular [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform for mobile application is based on Java. Google adopted a customised virtual machine called Dalvik to optimise the execution of Java code for mobile devices.

Oracle provides [[Java ME]]; a reference implementation for mobile OEM vendors. Java ME is made up of various profiles that are subsets of the Java desktop environment with additional libraries targeted at mobile and set-top-box development. Java ME has a very large base within the mobile phone and [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, with only the cheapest devices now devoid of a [[K virtual machine|KVM]] (a cut down [[JVM|Java Virtual Machine]] for use on devices with limited processing power). Java software, including many games, is commonplace.

While many feature phones include a JVM, they are not always heavily used by users (particularly in South Africa). Initially Java applications on most phones typically consisted of menuing systems, small games, or systems to download ringtones etc. However, more powerful phones are increasingly being sold with simple applications pre-loaded, such as translation dictionaries, world clock displays (darkness/light, timezones, etc.) and calculators. Some of these are written in Java, although how often phone owners actually use them is probably unknown. &lt;!--Full featured cell phone applications are rare.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}--&gt;

Microsoft currently ships the [[.NET Compact Framework]] that runs on Windows CE and mobile devices, set-top boxes, and PDAs as well as the [[Xbox 360]]. Microsoft also provides the [[.NET Micro Framework]] for embedded developers with limited resources. 
Alternatively, Novell licenses embeddable versions of Mono to 3rd parties to use in their devices, and [[Xamarin]] commercially distributes the [[MonoDroid]] and [[MonoTouch]] framework for Android and iPhone development, respectively.
Windows Phone 7 uses Silverlight for native apps, but Windows Phone 8 has C# and XAML as the main languages.

===Home entertainment technologies===
Java has found a market in digital television, where it can be used to provide software that sits alongside programming, or extends the capabilities of a given [[Set Top Box]]. [[TiVo]], for example, has a facility called "[[Home Media Engine]]", which allows [[JavaTV]] software to be transmitted to an appropriate TiVo device to complement programming or provide extra functionality (for example, personalized stock tickers on a business news program.)

A variant of Java has been accepted as the official software tool for use on the next generation optical disc technology [[Blu-ray]], via the [[BD-J]] interactive platform. This will mean that interactive content, such as menus, games, downloadables, etc. on all Blu-ray optical discs will be created under a variant of the Java platform.

Rather than using Java, [[HD DVD]] (the defunct high definition successor to [[DVD]]) used a technology jointly developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] called [[HDi Interactive Format|HDi]] that was based on [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[JavaScript]], and other technologies that are comparable to those used by standard [[Web browser]]s.

The BD-J platform [[Application programming interface|API]] is more extensive than its iHD rival, with an alleged 8,000 methods and interfaces, as opposed to iHD's 400.&lt;ref name="bludvd1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/carroll/index.php?p=1583 |title=HD-DVD vs. Blu-ray, round 2 |access-date=2007-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308214735/http://blogs.zdnet.com/carroll/index.php?p=1583 |archive-date=2007-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And while Microsoft is pushing iHD's XML presentation layer by including it with Windows Vista, iHD is still a newcomer in a market sector where Java technologies are already commonplace.&lt;ref name="bluedvd2"&gt;[http://www.pcauthority.com.au/print.aspx?CIID=60242&amp;SIID=  Format Wars - Blu-ray vs HD DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that the HD DVD format has been abandoned in favor of Blu-ray means that HDi is no longer supported on any [[optical disc]] format, making the BD-J format a clear winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.itwire.com/content/view/16780/1154/1/0/

| last=Zaharov-Reutt|first=Alex
| quote=''While many claimed that creating interactivity with HDi was much simpler than using BD-J, the fact that HD DVD will see few future releases beyond 2008 means that, whatever the enthusiasts position on the relative merits of HDi vs BD-J, the BD-J interactivity format is now the winner''

==Runtime inclusion in operating systems==

===.NET/Mono===
On Windows, Microsoft has promoted .NET as its flagship development platform&lt;ref name="mscsharpflagship"&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/learning/books/developer/feature/050301.mspx Microsoft article that refers to C# as its "flagship" language.]&lt;/ref&gt; by including the .NET runtime in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7. Microsoft also distributes the Visual Studio Express development environment at no cost,&lt;ref name="vsexpress"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/ |title=Visual Studio Express |access-date=2010-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612162039/http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/ |archive-date=2011-06-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Visual Studio Community development environment at no cost, with limited use for organizations.&lt;ref name="vscommunity"&gt;[http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs Visual Studio Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

.NET Framework 3.5 runtime is not pre-installed on versions of Windows prior to Vista SP1, and must be downloaded by the user, which has been criticized because of its large size (65 MB download for .NET 3.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither .NET nor Mono are installed with Mac OS X out-of-the-box, the Mono project can be downloaded and installed separately, for free, for any Mac user who wants to build or run C# and .NET software.

If Java is not installed on a computer by default, it may be downloaded by the user as a Web plugin. The Web plugin process has been criticized because of the size of the Java plugin. Unlike other plugins, the Java download is a full runtime environment capable of running not just applets, but full applications and dynamic WebStart apps. Because of this, the perceived download footprint is larger than some web plugins. However, compared to Java, other popular browser plugins have larger sizes: Java 6 [[Java Runtime Environment|JRE]] is 13 MB, but [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat Reader]] is 33 MB, [[QuickTime]] 19 MB, [[Windows Media Player]] 25 MB, the [[.NET Framework|.NET Framework 3.0]] runtime is 54 MB, and the .NET Framework 3.5 runtime is 197 MB (it's a united package for x86, x64 and IA-64, each part has approximately 60 MB).

At the [[JavaOne]] event in May 2007 Sun announced that the deployment issues with Java would be solved in two major updates during the lifespan of Java 6 (the changes will not be held over to Java 7.)  These include:
* The introduction of a new consumer JRE edition, with an initial 2&amp;nbsp;Mb footprint and the ability to download the remaining 9&amp;nbsp;Mb in sections using an on-demand methodology.
* The development of drop-in cross platform [[JavaScript]] code, which can be used from a Web page to install the necessary JRE for a given applet or [[Rich Internet Application]] to run, if necessary.
* An improvement in support for automatically downloading updates to the JRE.
* support for pre-loading of the JRE, so applets and applications written in Java start up almost instantaneously.

In [[sociology]] and [[gender studies]], "'''doing gender'''" is the idea that in [[Western civilization|Western culture]], [[gender]], rather than being an innate quality of individuals, is a [[psychological conditioning|psychologically ingrained]] [[social construct]] that actively surfaces in everyday human interaction.  This term was used by [[Candace West]] and Don Zimmerman in their article "'''Doing Gender'''", published in 1987 in ''[[Gender and Society]]''.  According to this paper, an individual's performance of gender is intended to construct gendered behavior as naturally occurring.  This façade furthers a system through which individuals are judged in terms of their failure or success to meet gendered societal expectations, called the accountability structure.  The concept of doing gender was later expanded by authors such as West and Fenstermaker in the book ''Doing Gender, Doing Difference''.  

==Concept==
The concept of "doing" gender came from conversations of gender from sociology and gender studies. The specific term "doing gender" was used in West and Zimmerman's article by the same title, originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;  West and Zimmerman illustrate that gender is performed in interactions, and that behaviors are assessed based on socially accepted conceptions of gender.  Rather than focusing on how gender is ingrained in the individual or perpetuated by institutions, West and Zimmerman emphasize the interactional level as a site where gender is invoked and reinforced.  They begin by differentiating [[sex]] from sex category and [[gender]].  In this piece, sex is the socially agreed upon criteria for being male or female, usually based on and individual's [[genitalia]] at birth or chromosomal typing before birth.  Sex category is the assumed biological category, regardless of the individual's gender identification. This is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;{{rp|127}}  Gender, in this context, is the degree to which an actor is masculine or feminine, in light of societal expectations about what is appropriate for one's sex category.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Doing gender according to West and Zimmerman "is to advance a new understanding of gender as a routine accomplishment embedded in every day interaction".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;  Essentially, West and Zimmerman argued that gender is something that humans created.  As humans, we have categorized and defined many aspects of life.  If someone was not in favor of their gender role or did something that was not deemed "correct" for that gender this person would be committing an act of social deviance.

Gender is described as 'omnirelevant,' as it is apparent and relevant in almost every interaction.  In their article, West and Zimmerman use examples such as bathrooms, sports, coupling, conversations, professions and the might have been{{Clarify|date=May 2018}} division of labor to illustrate the ways in which gender is prevalent in many taken for granted activities.  West and Zimmerman employ the example of a professional woman in a male-dominated field, through which it becomes apparent that the woman will have to make decisions as to whether or not she should engage in "unfeminine" behavior that would otherwise be an integral part of her identity.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Another component of this theory is gendered assessment of behavior.  In the above example, the woman is engaging in behavior that will be assessed as either masculine or feminine by her co-workers.  According to West and Zimmerman, this woman will be evaluated based on how her actions compare to accountability standards of the sex category she belongs to.  Deviations from these expectations do not have an immediate effect on the accountability structure itself.  Instead, failures to meet these standards are attributed to the individual rather than to the rigidity of recognized categories.  With this theory, West and Zimmerman stress the importance of social interaction in maintaining the gender structure.  Because individuals "do" and assess gender in interaction, gender is visible in a wide variety of activities such as conversation.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

==Foundations==
The idea that gender is something that individuals actively 'do' was largely inspired by the social psychological approach taken by Erving Goffman (1976) in ''Gender Display''.(p.&amp;nbsp;129)  Goffman theorizes that humans make the assumption that each has an "essential nature," which can be interpreted by reading "natural signs given off or expressed by them" (p.&amp;nbsp;75).  One of the most basic natures that can be assumed from interpreting these signs is one's masculinity or femininity.  Not only is gender often determined by others relatively easily, but this determination often establishes the ways in which individuals interact with one another.  Goffman asserts that, because we habitually function within such scripts, they are taken to be further evidence of essential natures.  He coins the term "gender display" as a way to conceptualize the ways in which individuals act in a gender appropriate manner.  However, these performances are optional and vulnerable to disturbance, as inappropriate gender display can just as easily be invoked as socially accepted ones.  Goffman asserts that there is a "scheduling" of gender displays around activities, so that the activities themselves are not interrupted by gender displays.  For instance, colleagues may interact in a gendered manner during their lunch hour, rather than while they are working together on a project.  West and Zimmerman take issue with this piece of Goffman's perspective, claiming that this masks the ways in which gender displays permeate nearly all social situations in that individuals cannot avoid being interpreted as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

== In the media ==
Media has a powerful influence over many aspects of modern life.  The way gender is expressed and perceived by audiences varies from culture to culture.  The language within a culture as "the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis [states], notes how language influences our perceptions and thus shapes our reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McGrath | first = Karen | title = Teaching sex, gender, transsexual, and transgender concepts | journal = [[National Communication Association#Publications|Communication Teacher]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 96&amp;ndash;101 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17404622.2013.865764 | date = 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/17404622.2013.865764 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As language evolves within a culture and new language is added, the gender identities are influenced and categories change.  The influence of language and the significance it has often communicated over media and the gender categories people use to place gender roles in, may change or add new categories.  There are other areas that gender roles and differences stem from, "some researchers suggest that gender differences result from a variety of factors including socialization and biology…gender roles are often manifested through communication and culture (Goffman, 1976; Lauzen et al., 2008; Wanta &amp; Legett, 1989; Williams &amp; Best, 1990; Wood, 2009)."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Jessica | last2 = Mackey-Kallis | first2 = Susan | last3 = Shyles | first3 = Len | last4 = Barry | first4 = Kelly | last5 = Biagini | first5 = Danielle | last6 = Hart | first6 = Colleen | last7 = Jack | first7 = Lauren | title = Face it: the impact of gender on social media images | journal = [[Communication Quarterly]] | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 588&amp;ndash;607 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01463373.2012.725005 | date = 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01463373.2012.725005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender is something that is always out there whether we are mindful of it or not: "Gender identity and gender roles are a significant part of everyday life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On top of this, gender roles help us make sense of our environment, they influence relationships and our own views.  Since the social aspect of life is such an essential part and needs to be fulfilled, we are exposed to gender roles frequently and sometimes unconsciously, absorbing it if it fits with the category that society has influenced us to perceive it as.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "In contemporary media and culture, women's and men's social desirability and gender often been defined in terms of their bodies. For women this has often involved comparing themselves to and even replicating the 'thin ideal'."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These views like the 'thin ideal' are reinforced through media with advertising, actors, and Photoshop touchups.  On the other end, men have been shown images of being extremely fit and muscular, usually in a pose that expresses power, and the cultures values of what 'masculinity' is for a culture.  "Gender-based definitions of success frequently revolve around presenting or developing their bodies as strong, youthful, active and physically dominant."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These roles are promoted by society, with visual displays and traits assigned to specific gender roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "Goffman (1976) accounts for these traits in his research of magazine and newspaper photography, finding women to be pictured in more submissive positions while men are depicted in more elevated positions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These depictions of gender are growing in certain trending shows and movies. Lauzen and colleagues (2008) examined gender roles in television, "they found male characters on prime time television were more likely to inhabit work roles, including blue collar, white collar, and extracurricular activities, while women were portrayed in more interpersonal roles involving romance, friendship, and family."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The way gender roles are portrayed in TV can spill into everyday life. Another area that 'doing gender' is being expressed is in video games: "Female characters are represented as highly sexualized while male characters possess exaggerated strength, are hyper masculine, aggressive, and, with the exception of showing hostility, lack emotion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The way gender roles are represented in video games adds another influence that society has to take in and this can make people think that these fictional depictions can be obtained. This then creates perspectives used to categorize gender roles and as we see others 'doing gender' we want to believe that we should be looking like these characters in games or actors in advertisements and T.V. "A number of studies, for example, have demonstrated extensive 'gender-swapping' in 'avatar' creation for online gaming and in text based CMC."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in video games and in especially online environments allow people to step into other gender roles, by 'doing gender' that may be different in how they present themselves in real life. These online environments allow users to shape their roles in gender.

===Social media and dating ===
The rise of [[social media]] networks allows people to communicate globally and manage how others perceive them and how they choose to express their gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The increase of digital content in today's technology has influences over gender roles, "Digital formats…represent exciting possibilities for individuals who can explore the freedom of presenting a physical self that might differ from the one they present or perform in everyday life or form socially-defines expectations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  People will put themselves into a role to look as though they fit in and to avoid embarrassment in case they violate a social norm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Responses and critiques==
{{main|Gender performativity}}
[[Judith Butler]] has written extensively on this topic, using the term "gender performativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= June 2011 |access-date = 4 May 2016 | title= Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/your-behavior-creates-your-gender}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She explains the same idea of doing gender by explaining gender as a performance that people are taught and attempt to recreate through actions and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Butler|first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | chapter = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GNNww3jmH3kC&amp;pg=PA278 | editor-last = Case | editor-first = Sue-Ellen | title = Performing feminisms: feminist critical theory and theatre| page = 278 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780801839696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of doing gender has been critiqued by scholars who assert that it does not take human agency and acts of resistance into account.&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz" /&gt; 

In order to illustrate the possibility of change, several works have been published in which researchers claim to document an 'undoing' or 'redoing' of gender.  Francine M. Deutsch, in "Undoing Gender" (2007), examines how the concept of doing gender has been employed in research.  Deutsch uses examples of studies that use West and Zimmerman's work to illustrate how normative gender ideals are apparent in a variety of contexts.  This, she argues, contributes to the invisibility of gender transgression and does not work towards West and Zimmerman's goal of eliminating gender inequity.  In order to facilitate the undoing of gender, Deutsch suggests that "The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered; (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions; (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality; (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change; and (5) interaction as the site of change" (p.&amp;nbsp;114).  By focusing on these areas, Deutsch asserts, it is easier to find practical solutions to problems cause by gender inequity.&lt;ref name="Undoing" /&gt;

Catherine Connell (2010) presented the idea of "redoing gender" as well as "doing [[transgender]]" in her work, "Doing, Undoing or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople".  Connell posits that transpeople may redo gender by altering normative ideas of gender in their interactions, but may simultaneously participate in the doing of gender in other ways.  Connell coins the term "doing transgender" in order to provide a way to examine how transpeople must make sense of the disconnect between sex, gender and sex category, which they may obscure or actively express in interactions.&lt;ref name="Redoing" /&gt;

In January 2009, the academic journal ''Gender and Society'' published a West and Zimmerman Symposium, in honor of the concept of doing gender.  Nine short articles were composed for the symposium, including a piece by West and Zimmerman.  Several authors argued that the doing gender framework did not allow for agency, intent or consciousness.  Other authors argued that biology needed to be focused on when considering doing gender, in order to understand what role the body plays in gender assessment.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Risman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mess" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raewyn" /&gt;

West and Zimmerman responded with an article titled "Accounting for Doing Gender", in which they restated their original argument, with an emphasis on accountability.  In this, they argued, the doing gender framework does not hide agency, but contextualizes it.  Because individuals' gender will be interpreted based on the accountability structure, the effectiveness of their resistance may not serve to "undo" gender.  The authors contend that gender may be "redone" but never "undone", as accountability structures may change but gender will not disappear.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;

== Doing difference ==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2017}}
'''Doing difference''' is a concept&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt; that grew out of the authors' earlier idea of "doing gender", presented at the American Sociological Association in 1977 by Candace West and Don Zimmerman and published in  ''Gender and Society'' in 1987.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; In 1995, Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker sought to extend the idea of gender as an ongoing interactional process into the realms of race and class.

They begin by asserting that the intersection of these three fundamental ways to categorize social difference cannot{{clarify|date=May 2018}} simply be thought of in a mathematical or even strictly hierarchical sense.  That is, simply plugging in these concepts as variables in a multiple regression model to predict life success in a particular society provides a simplified way to look at their relative effects, but would fail to provide an adequate basis for even understanding, lesser yet altering systemic inequalities based on race, class, and gender.  For instance, poor black women in the United States face immense social disadvantages, but to place them at the bottom of some abstract listing of vulnerable populations tells us little about how race, class, and gender interacted in their [[biography]] and social milieu to constrain and direct their lives.  Their analysis of these core differences from the standpoint of [[ethnomethodology]] turns the focus away from individual characteristics.  Instead, they are understood processually as "emergent properties of social situations" which simultaneously produce systematically different outcomes for social groups and the rationale for such disparities.

The authors assert that the reason [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] were not adequately considered in earlier works is because the [[feminist movement]] has historically been the province of white middle class women in the developed world who were not sufficiently affected or attuned to the nature of these corollary oppressions.  Furthermore, few women outside this privileged lot were able to gain access to institutions of higher education, which might have permitted them to engage in the academic discourse and activity about such shortcomings.  Even if they had, the [[gatekeeper]]s within the academy and at leading journals made this unlikely process even more difficult.  Perhaps overt racism and [[classism]] (and [[sexism]]) is less apparent today in these institutions, but the tendency remains for those in positions of power to view the world in a way that discounts the experience of marginalized groups.

The central theme of "difference" here is meant to illustrate how the concepts of race and gender have been falsely conceived as biologically bound predictors of behavior and aptitude among those who are a certain skin color or sex.  The commonalities within these somewhat arbitrary categories often exaggerated and the behavior of the most dominant group within the category (e.g. rich white men or women) becomes idealized as the only appropriate way to fulfill one social role.  This conceptualization is then employed as a means of excluding and stigmatizing those who do not or cannot live up to these standards.  This process of "doing difference" is realized in constant interpersonal interactions that reaffirm and reproduce social structure.  Experiencing the world through the interaction of these "essentialized" characteristics and especially through dominant group's frame of reference (power interests) produces a pattern of thought and behavior that reproduces these social inequalities.

Social science research has rendered dubious any claim that race can simply be conflated with color, or gender with genitalia, or even class with paychecks.  Class may not seem as prone to ideas about natural social differentiation, but within capitalist societies, it is often assumed that one's economic situation is a more or less direct indication of one's capacity to achieve.  Since women and people of color taken are more often poor, natural disadvantage is at least tacitly assumed by many.  Given the general observation that powerful groups seem to rely heavily on these ideas of natural subordination, many liberationist thinkers came to the conclusion that this essentialism would be a prime rhetorical vehicle to subvert.  Thus, the [[deconstruction]] of [[role theory]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] within sociology was a central theme from the 1960s onward.  This still left a somewhat gaping theoretical vacuum, one that continues to be felt by people struggling with this challenge to fundamentally alter their social cosmology.

[[Social constructionism]] has assumed the major explanatory role in these discussions by positing that the meanings of these supposedly [[ascribed status]]es are in fact situationally dependent on the sort of social context in which we employ them.  That is, race, class, and gender aren't just objective scientific facts, but dynamic processes of culturally constructing cues for moral behavior (for which one can be held personally accountable) in a particular circumstance.  It is these constantly occurring processes, not some divinely decreed grand plan, which reproduces social structure.  Individuals "do difference" when they acknowledge (knowingly or unknowingly) how their categorization renders them socially accountable to acting in a particular way in a situation.  However, when individuals recalibrate "doing difference" to produce alternative ways to conceptualize interaction patterns, it amounts to social change.

[[Image:Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building''' is an exhibit building located at the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont|Shelburne]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]]. It was built as a memorial to the Museum's founder, [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]], and her husband, [[James Watson Webb II]]. It is home to the museum's European Paintings Collection.  The collection is shown in six period rooms relocated from Electra and J. Watson Webb's 1930s New York City apartment on 740 Park Avenue.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1960, [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]]'s children erected the '''Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building''' in honor of the Museum founder. Completed in 1967, the Memorial Building’s silhouette duplicates that of the 1843 Wilcox-Cutts House in [[Orwell, Vermont]]. The Memorial Building represents the architectural idiom known as [[Greek Revival]]. It was a style pervasive in the United States, gaining prominence in the second quarter of the 19th century and reaching its peak of popularity by 1850.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt;

Drawing inspiration from Grecian temples, Greek Revival architects adopted the rectangular structure of colonial houses and reoriented it so that the triangular gables would run parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the road. Anchoring the pedimented facade with a heavily columned, often two-storied porch, and sometimes flanking the main gable with mirroring wings, such as in the Memorial Building, architects achieved the proportion and symmetry of the ancient structures that inspired them.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
===Bronze Sculptures===
[[Sculptor]]s have been casting their ideas in [[bronze]] since around 2,300 BCE. The Romans perfected the process and by the early 16th-century monumental bronze statues of heroes on horseback, saints, and monarchs stood in public squares all over Europe, while smaller figures decorated churches and the homes of art patrons. Bronze sculpture is made by using a mold or by casting from an original model. Either process allows an artist to create several nearly identical copies of one work of art. In the 19th century, technological changes improved the production of multiple casts and smaller tabletop sculptures became fashionable and affordable. Both European and American art collectors decorated their parlors with statues of animals, classical goddesses, and romantic figures. 

[[Shelburne Museum]]'s bronze collection focuses on small decorative bronzes. Bronze castings of exotic animals by French artist [[Antoine Louis Barye]] can be seen in the Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building. His small sculptures of elephants, crocodiles and lions are displayed in the library. Barye spent hours at the Paris zoo sketching the anatomy of animals to accurately reproduce them in bronze. His sculpture elephant and driver, located in the foyer captures the rough skin of an elephant and the contrasting soft cloth costume of his driver. 

On the first floor, there are two [[Edgar Degas]] bronzes. The horse and rider combinations were originally modeled in wax and later cast in bronze (after the artist’s death in 1917). Degas' studies horses and jockeys was a way to explore the effects of form, space, and motion.

In the basement of the '''Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building''', there is a collection of 19th and 20th century American bronzes. It features work by such western artists as [[Charles Marion Russell|Charles Russell]] and [[Harry Jackson (artist)|Harry Jackson]]; these artists, who often served as cowhands and guides of the western plains, modeled their work after real people and personal experiences. Their bucking broncos, cowboys, and portraits of Native Americans are romantic interpretations of a vanishing American west.

===European Paintings===
[[Shelburne Museum]]’s collection of fine art includes objects originally in the collection of [[Henry O. Havemeyer]] and [[Louisine Elder Havemeyer]], parents of [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]] who inherited the collection from them. The European painters still represented by the collection include [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Mary Cassatt]]. The [[Havemeyer]]s were among the first American collectors of French Impressionists painting and amassed one of the most important collections of Old Masters and [[Impressionist]] paintings on American soil. 

The French artist [[Édouard Manet]] (1832–1883) felt strongly that keen observation made a great painter. A brilliant technician who used broad strokes of paint as comfortably as he did minute dabs of color, Manet explored ideas about light that set the stage for the Impressionist movement. He completed "Blue Venice" while touring [[Italy]] in 1874. His dashes of paint create the effect of sunlight sparkling on water; on the gondolier, Manet used multiple strokes of color to create a three-dimensional effect.

[[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926), a prominent leader of the Impressionist movement, stressed the importance of working outdoors and letting art illustrate the color and movement of the natural environment. Five landscapes by Monet are included in the Museum’s collection. In the 1880s and 1890s Monet captured the changing effects of natural light by creating series of paintings of the same subject in different weather and light conditions. His "Haystacks in the Snow" is part of a series of over thirty paintings of haystacks. 

Pastels, soft, colorful chalks, were perfected by the French in the 19th century. [[Edgar Degas]] is considered one of the founders of [[Impressionism]] though he preferred to be considered a [[Realist visual arts|Realist]]. Degas's work differed from other Impressionists; while Monet concernated on the effects of light and shadow, Degas focused on unusual perspectives and complex formal structures.  The [[Shelburne Museum]] has seven Degas works in the collection, which can be seen in the '''Electra Havemeyer Webb Memeorial Building'''.

The one American Impressionist [[Mary Cassatt]], had close ties to the [[Havemeyer]] and Webb families. [[Louisine Elder Havemeyer]], [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]]'s mother, was a close friend to Cassatt.  Cassatt played a large role in shaping the Havemeyer's French Impressionist collection.  You can find the Cassatt pastels and prints in the '''Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building''', including a portrait of the museum's founder, [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]], and her mother [[Louisine Elder Havemeyer]].

===Furniture===
[[Shelburne Museum]]'s furniture collection represents the different styles and tastes of 18th and 19th century America. It includes examples of the most sophisticated urban furniture produced in the nation as well as many simpler pieces made by country cabinetmakers for use in rural homes. These country pieces include one of the greatest strengths of the Museum – its collection of paint-decorated furniture. 

During the American industrial revolution (ca. 1865-1900) the furniture industry, like every other major industry, was mechanized. Individual craftspeople and designers like [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work can be seen in the '''Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building''' continued to work for upper class patrons, but inexpensive, factory-made chairs, tables, beds, and stands flooded and eager market of middle-class Victorians. The popularity of carved decoration and elaborate upholster, characteristic of the period, can be seen on the furniture displayed in the parlor of the Lightouse (see [[Colchester Reef Light]]) and on the promenade deck of the [[Ticonderoga (steamboat)|Ticonderoga]] steamboat).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1244">In computer science, '''Fhourstones''' is an integer [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] that efficiently solves positions in the game of [[Connect Four|Connect-4]].  It was written by John Tromp in 1996-2008,&lt;ref&gt;https://tromp.github.io/c4/fhour.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is incorporated into the [[Phoronix Test Suite]].  The measurements are reported as the number of game positions searched per second.

Available in both ANSI-C and Java, it is quite portable and compact (under 500 lines of source), and uses 50Mb of memory.
The benchmark involves (after warming up on three easier positions) solving the entire game, which takes about ten minutes on contemporary PCs, scoring between 1000 and 12,000 kpos/sec. It has been described as more realistic than some other benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Embedded Software: Second International Conference, EMSOFT 2002|date=2003|publisher=Springer|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fhourstones was named as a pun on [[Dhrystone]] (itself a pun on [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone]]), as "dhry" sounds the same as "drei", German for "three": fhourstones is an increment on dhrystones.

The '''Fort de Bois-d'Arcy''', also called the '''Batterie de Bois-d'Arcy''', is one of the forts constructed at the end of the 19th century to defend [[Paris]]. It is located in the commune of  [[Bois-d'Arcy, Yvelines|Bois d'Arcy]] in the [[Yvelines]] département of France. The fort is located in the southern part of the town to the south of [[Route nationale 12]]. It is now the home of the French national film archives, the [[National Center of Cinematography and the moving image|Centre national de la cinématographie]].

==History==
Built between 1874 and 1881, the fort was planned to reinforce the western fortifications of Paris. The southwestern forts were designed to cover the approach of a relieving army from the western portions of France. The Bois-d'Arcy fort protected the neighboring [[Fort de Saint-Cyr]], [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] and the Camp de Satory, covering the Trappes valley and railway lines from [[Le Havre]] and [[Tours]].&lt;ref name="arcy1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boisdarcy.fr/La-Batterie-de-Bois-d-Arcy.php | title=La Batterie de Bois d'Arcy | publisher=Mairie Bois de l'Arcy | accessdate=July 15, 2012 | author=Thiébaud, Eric | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331132903/http://www.boisdarcy.fr/La-Batterie-de-Bois-d-Arcy.php | archivedate=March 31, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II the fort was occupied by German forces.  Before leaving, the Germans blew up the front of the fort in 1944.&lt;ref name="arcy1"/&gt;

==Film depository==
During the 1960s the fort was placed at the disposal of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] and was used by the  [[Centre national de la cinématographie]] from 1969 as a storage center for nitrate-based films. It has since been designated a depository for all French films and is involved in the digitization of movies for [[digital preservation]].&lt;ref name="pajolec1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ipr.univ-paris1.fr/spip.php?article364 | title=lletins :: Bulletin n° 26 Les archives françaises du film à Bois d’Arcy | publisher=Institut Pierre Renouvin | accessdate=July 15, 2012 | author=Le Pajolec,  Sébastien}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is classed as a  [[Monument historique]], designated on 15 February 1991.&lt;ref name="merimee1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00087792 | title=Batterie de Bois d'Arcy | publisher=Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication | work=Merimee | accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Moore''' (29 January 1657 – 1715) was a British physician and [[astrologer]] who wrote and published what later became ''[[Old Moore's Almanack]]''.

He was born into poverty in [[Bridgnorth]]. Moore was self-educated, learning to read by himself, and became a physician and astrologer. He served at the court of [[Charles II of England]].

The almanac that bears his name was first published in 1697, originally giving weather and astrological predications, and is still published annually.

The '''''Gazetteer of India, Union Territory: Goa, Daman and Diu''''' is an official publication from the Government of [[Goa]], published in 1979, and contains a lot of background information and history about the region of Goa.

This book's editor was Dr V. T. Gune, then Director of Archives, Archaeology and the Executive Editor and Member Secretary of the Goa Gazetteer editorial board. This publication came from the Government of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu's Gazetteer Department. It was printed by the Government Central Press of [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai).

It has not been updated since its publication, and no new volume of its kind has been put out yet.

This book was published less than two decades after [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial rule]] ended. This probably gets reflected in the attempt to be extra-critical of Portuguese rule, while play-up the positive changes brought in post-1961.

==Plot==
[[Mickey Mouse]] walks from his house and spots [[Horace Horsecollar]] pulling a hay [[wagon]] with all his friends playing music. He hops on the wagon and helps up [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] (who jumped on his leg) onto the wagon. Just then, [[Pete (Disney)|Peg-Leg Pete]] shows up in his [[Decrepit car|jalopy]], his horn bellows in a high pitched voice "Make way for the future!". Pete spots Minnie and gives her a flirty gaze, so Mickey puts Clarabelle in the gaze in Minnie's place much to Pete's disgust and horror. Angry at being pranked, Pete kidnaps Minnie and rams his car into the wagon, sending Mickey and Horace flying towards the screen. Seeing Mickey and Horace bounce off the fabric, Pete hurls them even harder into the screen until they burst from their two-dimensional, black and white world to the three-dimensional, colorful and modern movie theater. As Pete taunts Mickey from inside the screen and closes the hole in the screen, Mickey tries to get back into his world, pulling back the curtains to reveal a wider screen. Horace then walks onto the stage wearing a [[Captain America]] T-shirt, glasses and carrying a smartphone, [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]] [[Milk Duds]] and [[popcorn]]. Mickey decides to use Horace as a mock [[biplane]] to fly around the theater and fire at Pete with Hershey's Milk Duds. When they crash land onto the stage, Mickey finds the smartphone Horace brought (and apparently stole) onto the stage, so he calls Pete on his [[Candlestick telephone|candlestick phone]] and Horace sprays foam from a [[fire extinguisher]] into the smartphone and out from Pete's phone.

Pete's car then lands in a frozen lake and the screen fills with water, giving Mickey the idea to poke a hole in the screen with his tail and let the water leak out, causing Pete, Minnie and the other cartoon animals to flood out onto the stage. Minnie is unsure about the new area, asking Mickey if they've landed in [[Poughkeepsie]]. Mickey and Minnie's reunion is short-lived, however, as Pete gives chase to the characters in and out of the screen until he kidnaps Minnie again, punches Mickey onto a support beam and nails the screen shut. Horace and the others decide to swing from the beam and try to break through the screen like a [[wrecking ball]], but the plan only manages to flip the screen upside-down, causing Pete to fall from the ground.

Mickey and the others flip it again and Pete lands on the ground, his car crashing down on him. Getting an idea, Minnie encourages Mickey to flip the screen again, this time having Pete land on a [[cactus]], which sets off a chain of events. First, Pete gets an [[electrical shock]] on some [[telephone line|telephone cables]], then he has his face get hit by all the steps on a [[ladder]], lands face first in the mud, and gets his rear end poked on a [[pitchfork]], and falls onto a [[seesaw]], where he gets hit on the head by numerous tools. Then one of the tools, a [[sledgehammer]], rams the pitchfork deeper into his rear end. Finally, the sledgehammer falls on the opposite side of the seesaw, where Pete is launched, also making the pitchfork fly off of his rear, and lands face-first in his jalopy.

Horace, Mickey, and Minnie begin to laugh hysterically at Pete's pain. Suddenly, Horace's hand gets stuck behind the screen due to him pounding the screen. Mickey tries to pull him out, but only succeeds by spinning the screen horizontally like a [[Flip book|flip-book]]. To Mickey's realization, it rewinds the scene. Seeing this as an opportunity, Mickey and Horace begin spinning the screen around like a flip-book until Pete is completely knocked out.

Minnie then drives Pete's car with Pete in tow and completely tears the screen down, revealing the black-and-white world in color for the first time. Mickey and his friends enter their world again and dance for a moment while [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] briefly peeks out from the side of the screen. The horn that was on Pete's car tells an unconscious Pete, "Ah, get a horse!", before Mickey and his friends bring down a new screen, then Mickey waves goodbye to Pete and the audience, and he and Minnie give Horace a kiss on the cheeks as Horace blushes. As the [[Iris shot|iris]] closes, Pete, who has woken up by now, tries to get back in through the screen, but gets his head (and half his body) stuck. Seconds later, the flap on Pete's pants open up to reveal the words "THE END" and Pete bellows "Hey!!", as the screen cuts to the credits. After the credits, the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo is in black-and-white, and Clarabelle jumps over the castle, making the arch with her milk.

==Production==
''Get a Horse!'' was conceived and directed by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who became the first woman to solo direct a Disney animated film.&lt;ref name=EWFirstLook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title=''Frozen'', ''Get a Horse!'' female directors mark firsts for Disney|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-frozen-get-a-horse-female-director-20131124,0,6771111.story?page=1|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started working on the short after ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' director, [[Rich Moore]], told her that Disney was looking for some Mickey Mouse ideas for television. Being fond of the earliest Mickey Mouse shorts, mostly because of their simplicity and freshness, she decided for a style resembling the 1920s animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharkey|first=Betsy|title=Zany Disney short sizes up 3-D battle in animated ''Get a Horse!''|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-zany-disney-short-sizes-up-3d-battle-in-animated-get-a-horse-20131127,0,5346665.story#axzz2m9hrvnh1|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced in a year and 6 months, its [[traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]] was supervised by [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]], and its [[computer animation]] by Adam Green.&lt;ref name=AWNAnnecy&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=''Get A Horse'' – A New Mickey Mouse Short 85 Years in the Making|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/get-horse-new-mickey-mouse-short-85-years-making|accessdate=June 22, 2013|publisher=Animated World Network|date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve the 1928 look, aging and blur filters were added to the image, while for the CG part, they created new models, faithful to the character designs of 1928.&lt;ref name=ASAnnecy&gt;{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=First Peek: ''Get A Horse'' Premieres At Annecy|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/get-a-horse-premiere-at-annecy|accessdate=June 22, 2013|publisher=Animation Scoop|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally temporary, the production team incorporated archival recordings of [[Walt Disney]]'s Mickey Mouse voice from 1928 to 1947, and spliced it into the character's dialogue.&lt;ref name=TNYTMasterVoice&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Mekado|title=Resurrecting His Master’s Mouse Voice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/movies/walt-disneys-voice-lives-in-new-mickey-mouse-cartoon.html|accessdate=27 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not find recordings of some words, including the word "red", so the crew took three sounds, a "rrr", a "ehh", and a "duh" from Disney's recordings and spliced them together.&lt;ref name=TNYTMasterVoice /&gt;

==Critical response==
[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' lauded the short film as "one of the wittiest and most inventive animated shorts in a long time". He particularly points out that the film "begins as an early black-and-white Mickey Mouse cartoon but then bursts its boundaries into color and 3D in marvelously antic ways that call to mind the stepping-off-the-screen techniques of [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' and [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]''.

The '''''Handbook''''' (formerly the '''''Church Handbook of Instructions''''' and earlier the '''''General Handbook of Instructions''''') is a two-volume book of instructions and policies for leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The books are prepared by the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]. Along with the church's [[standard works]] (i.e., its scriptural canon), the ''Handbook'' stands as the preeminent policy and practice guide for the leaders of the LDS Church.&lt;ref name = EOM&gt;{{citation |last= May |first= Frank O., Jr. |contribution= General Handbook of Instructions |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3726 |page= 541 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church distributes copies of the handbook only to individuals who fill certain leadership [[Calling (LDS Church)|callings]] within the church hierarchy, but one of the two volumes can be accessed on the church's official website.&lt;ref name = online&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]], [http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=12085646&amp;itype=storyID "LDS Church handbook on social issues available online"], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2010-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
In general, the ''Handbook'' contains institutional church policies, as opposed to church doctrine.&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; However, brief statements of doctrine are commonly presented at the start of sections in the handbook to provide the doctrinal context in which the policies are being set and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in discussing the church's position on elective [[abortion]], the handbook states, "The Lord commanded, 'Thou shalt not... kill, nor do anything like unto it' (D&amp;C 59:6). The Church opposes elective abortion for personal or social convenience." ''Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops'', (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2010), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the ''Handbook'' unifies the church's [[scripture]] and [[creed]]s with its [[ecclesiology]] and [[ecclesiastical polity|polity]].

''Handbook'' acts as a "standard reference point" for bishops and other leaders to make decisions. The leaders are encouraged to follow the handbook "with the guidance of the Holy Ghost" and with "sensitivity to individual circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Otterson |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Otterson |url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/commentary-understanding-the-handbook |title=Understanding the Handbook |work=Mormon Newsroom |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structure and distribution==
The ''Handbook'' is divided into two volumes. However, ''Handbook 1'' is not available to the general public or the general church membership. On the other hand, the text of ''Handbook 2'' can be accessed on the church's official website.&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

===''Handbook 1''===
''Handbook 1'' is subtitled ''Stake Presidents and Bishops''. It contains information that is primarily relevant to the functions and duties of [[stake president]]s, [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]], [[mission president]]s, [[district president]]s, [[branch president]]s, and their counselors. Other individuals who receive a copy of are [[temple president]]s and their counselors, [[general authorities]], [[auxiliary organization (LDS Church)|general auxiliary presidencies]], [[area seventies]], and ward and branch clerks.&lt;ref name="Handbook 1 2010"&gt;''Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops'', (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2010), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics in ''Handbook 1'' include guidelines involving general, [[area (LDS Church)|area]], and regional administration; duties of the stake president; duties of the bishop; [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]] and marriage; [[missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] service; administering church welfare; [[disciplinary council|church discipline]] and name removal; interviews and counseling; physical facilities; creating, changing, and naming new units; [[military]] relations; [[Church Educational System]]; [[Perpetual Education Fund]]; records and reports; finances; stake [[patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarch]]; [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] and blessing policies; and general church policies on administrative, medical and health, and moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops'', (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2010), p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has stated that it did not place ''Handbook 1'' online with ''Handbook 2'' because church authorities were concerned that if it were widely read by the church membership, members "might decide they don’t need to go see their bishop... It made much more sense to reserve that volume for leaders."&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

===''Handbook 2''===
''Handbook 2'' is subtitled ''Administering the Church''. It contains information primarily relevant to the functions of the leaders of the church's [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] and auxiliary organizations. Every quorum president and auxiliary organization leader at stake, ward, district, and branch levels receives a copy of ''Handbook 2'', just as most of the individuals who receive ''Handbook 1''. Counselors to quorum or auxiliary presidencies and [[high council (Latter Day Saints)|stake high councilors]] also receive copies of ''Handbook 2'', just like other leaders in church congregations.&lt;ref name="Handbook 2 2010"&gt;''Handbook 2: Administering the Church'', (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2010), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics in ''Handbook 2'' include guidelines involving families and the church in God's plan, [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] principles, leadership in the church, the ward council, the work of salvation in the ward and stake, welfare principles and leadership, [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]], [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]], [[Relief Society]], [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]], [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]], [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]], activities, music, stake organization, single members, uniformity and adaptation, meetings in the church, [[calling (LDS Church)|callings]] in the church, and priesthood ordinances and blessings. ''Handbook 2'' also contains some of the general church policies on administrative, health, and moral issues that are contained in ''Handbook 1''.&lt;ref name = online/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook 2: Administering the Church'', (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2010), p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supplements===
Occasionally, updates, supplements, or changes of material in the ''Handbook'' with written directives from the church's First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve, or [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]] are released. Leaders are instructed to write the changes into their copies of the handbook and to keep the handbook and the supplemental materials together.&lt;ref name="Handbook 2 2010"/&gt; New editions of the handbook are published to incorporate the issued supplements into the text of the handbook.

===Unauthorized distribution===
''Handbook 1'' is not available to the general public or the general church membership. The text of ''Handbook 2'' is available on the church's official website.&lt;ref name = online/&gt; In the past, unauthorized copies of the restricted handbook have been made available on the [[internet]]. The church asserts copyright over the contents of the ''Handbook'' and prohibits its duplication.&lt;ref name="Handbook 1 2010"/&gt; The handbook emphasizes that it has been prepared solely for use by general and local church officers to administer the affairs of the church.&lt;ref name="Handbook 1 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbook 2 2010"/&gt; The copyright to the ''Handbook'' is owned by [[Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]], a [[corporation]] that is owned by the LDS Church, which owns the church's [[intellectual property]] rights.

After the 1998 version of the ''Church Handbook'' was published, [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]]'s Utah Lighthouse Ministry published portions of it on the internet without permission from the church or including the book's copyright notice. The text was also disseminated to other websites, which the ULM's website linked to. In the 1999 [[lawsuit]] ''[[Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry]]'', a [[United States district court]] issued an [[injunction]] prohibiting the further duplication of the contents of the handbook and ordered ULM to remove the offending material from its website.&lt;ref&gt;Tech Law Journal, [http://www.techlawjournal.com/courts/lds/Default.htm Summary of Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministries (LDS Copyright Case)] (29 December 1999) (accessed 2 August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the LDS Church notified the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] that it believed the copyright to the ''Handbook of Instructions'' had been violated by a link posted in [[Wikinews]].&lt;ref name = Moore&gt;Carrie A. Moore, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700225944,00.html "LDS Church alleges Wikimedia site infringed copyright"], ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', 2008-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The link directed readers to the text of the handbook on the [[WikiLeaks]] website, unaffiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation. Shortly after the complaint was made, Wikinews removed the link to the text from the article.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2010, the church placed the new ''Handbook 2'' on its official website,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen as "part of a recent trend in the church to become more transparent."&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

== Media discussion ==
Although the ''Handbook'' covers a wide variety of topics related to church organization and policy, media attention has focused largely on the church's policies on social issues that are outlined in the ''Handbook''. As summarized by the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', the ''Handbook'' states that the LDS Church&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;opposes gambling (including government-run lotteries), guns in churches, euthanasia, Satan worship and hypnotism for entertainment. It "strongly discourages" surrogate motherhood, sperm donation, surgical sterilizations (including vasectomies) and artificial insemination — when "using semen from anyone but the husband." But [the church] supports organ donation, paying income taxes, members running for political office and autopsies — "if the family of the deceased gives consent."&lt;ref name = online/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding [[birth control]], the ''Tribune'' comments:&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The handbook says it is a "privilege" for Mormon couples to nurture and rear children, but the decision of how many to have is "extremely intimate and private and should be left between the couple and the Lord." Moreover, church members "should not judge one another in this matter." The book also says sexual relations in marriage "are divinely approved not only for the purpose of procreation, but also as a way of expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Tribune'' has also noted that the LDS Church discourages the use of [[in vitro fertilization]] using [[semen]] and [[ovum|ova]] from people outside the couple and that the LDS Church has no official stance on drinking [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

The ''Tribune'' quoted one member of the church as applauding the public availability of the ''Handbook'', as it will allow the members of the church to become more familiar with the church's stance on certain social issues:&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“I've known church members who were shocked that the handbook strongly discourages vasectomies. They had no idea that there was any policy concerning it.... If there are such policies, I think it is wise that everyone — not just those with leadership callings — knows about them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some members have complained that the ''Handbook'' does not always explain the doctrinal justification for the church's stance on certain social issues, such as that related to artificial insemination of single women in the church. The ''Handbook'' states that artificial insemination of single women in the church "is not approved" and that "single sisters who deliberately refuse to follow the counsel of church leaders in this matter are subject to church discipline" but it does not explain why similar treatment would not be meted out to single women in the church who adopt children.&lt;ref name = online/&gt;

==History==
[[File:LDS_General_Handbook_1968.png|right|thumb|100px|upright|1968 Leader Handbook]]
The document that is identified as the first ''Church Handbook of Instructions'' was published in 1899 as a small, 14-page booklet.&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; It primarily contained instructions on how to manage [[in kind|in-kind payments]] of [[tithe|tithing]] by church members.&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; The handbook was revised every year until 1910 and approximately every five years thereafter.&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; The book has been variously called the ''Annual Instructions'', the ''Circular of Instructions'', the ''Handbook of Instructions'', the ''General Handbook of Instructions'', the ''Church Handbook of Instructions'', and finally the ''Handbook''.

In 1998, the book was split into two volumes for the first time and was renamed the ''Church Handbook of Instructions''. A new edition was published and released to church leaders in November 2010, with the new names ''Handbook 1'' and ''Handbook 2''. One of the major changes between the 2006 and 2010 versions of the handbook is that the 2010 version "has softened the language about gay Mormons" and eliminated statements "that same-sex relationships 'distort loving relationships' and that gays should repent of their 'homosexual thoughts or feelings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Fletcher Stack, [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50658721-76/church-behavior-homosexual-gay.html.csp "Updated LDS handbook softens language on gays"], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2010-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume summaries==
At the front of each volume is a one-page summary of the more important issues discussed in the editorials of that period.

==Original indexes reprinted==
''Harrison's Reports'' published its own index up to eight times per year. In the reprint volumes, these indexes are printed on yellow paper at the beginning of each calendar year's gathered reprints of 52 (occasionally 53) weeks of issues.

==Index of shorts==
Although ''Harrison's Reports'' reviewed only feature films, not shorts, the indexes included lists of forthcoming and recently released shorts, grouped by releasing company. Published separately from these reprints, ''An Index to Short Subjects Listed in Harrison’s Reports 1926-1962'' by Gerald Jones (self-published November 2004) is a complete alphabetical index of all the shorts and cartoons listed in the many separate indexes. This index used to be available online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120226184850/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~gpjones/shorts/ Short Subjects listed in Harrison's Reports, 1926-64]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical review==
The review by ''Library Journal'' stated, “Taken in its 43-year entirety, Harrison's Reports is a very useful reflection of the industry's major trends and provides something of a social history of the United States as well.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Library Journal]]'' review; August 1992, page 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other reprints of film reviews==
''Harrison’s Reports'' is one of the three English-language periodicals with 10,000 or more film reviews reprinted in book form. The other two are
* ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' as '''''[[Variety Film Reviews]]''''' (1907–1996) in 24 volumes.
* ''[[The New York Times]]'' as '''''The New York Times Film Reviews''''' (1913–2000) in 22 volumes.

[[File:Homology vertebrates-en.svg&lt;!-- This image, Homology vertebrates-en.svg, is referred to in the text! Please don't change it without also updating the text with something equally or more suitable. --&gt;|thumb|300px|The principle of homology: The biological relationships (shown by colours) of the bones in the forelimbs of vertebrates were used by [[Charles Darwin]] as an argument in favor of [[evolution]].]]

In [[biology]], '''homology''' is the existence of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different [[Taxon|taxa]]. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of [[vertebrates]], where the [[Bat wing development|wings of bats]], the arms of [[primate]]s, the front flippers of [[whale]]s and the forelegs of [[Canidae|dogs]] and [[Equidae|horses]] are all derived from the same ancestral [[tetrapod]] structure. [[Evolutionary biology]] explains homologous structures [[adaptation (biology)|adapted]] to different purposes as the result of descent with modification from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]]. The term was first applied to biology in a non-evolutionary context by the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] in 1843. Homology was later explained by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by [[Pierre Belon]] in 1555.

In [[developmental biology]], organs that developed in the embryo in the same manner and from similar origins, such as from matching [[Primordium|primordia]] in successive segments of the same animal, are [[serial homology|serially homologous]]. Examples include the legs of a [[centipede]], the [[Insect mouthparts|maxillary palp]] and [[Insect mouthparts|labial palp]] of an insect, and the [[Vertebral column|spinous processes]] of successive [[Vertebral column|vertebrae]] in a [[vertebral column]]. Male and female [[reproductive organ]]s are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the [[ovaries]] and [[testicles]] of mammals including humans.

[[Sequence homology]] between [[protein]] or [[DNA sequence]]s is similarly defined in terms of shared ancestry.  Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a [[speciation]] event (orthologs) or a [[Gene duplication|duplication event]] (paralogs). Homology among proteins or DNA is inferred from their sequence similarity.  Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by [[divergent evolution]] from a common ancestor. [[Sequence alignment|Alignments]] of multiple sequences are used to discover the homologous regions.

Homology remains controversial in [[ethology|animal behaviour]], but there is suggestive evidence that, for example, [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the [[primates]].

==History==
[[File:BelonBirdSkel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Pierre Belon]] compared the skeletons of birds and humans in his ''Book of Birds'' (1555).&lt;ref name=Panchen1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panchen |first1=A. L. |title=Homology—history of a concept |journal=Novartis Found Symp |date=1999 |volume=222 |pages=5–18 |pmid=10332750}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Homology was noticed by [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] (c. 350 BC), and was explicitly analysed by [[Pierre Belon]] in his 1555 ''Book of Birds'', where he systematically compared the skeletons of birds and humans. The pattern of similarity was interpreted as part of the static [[great chain of being]] through the [[mediaeval]] and [[early modern]] periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change.
In the German ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' tradition, homology was of special interest as demonstrating unity in nature.&lt;ref name=Panchen1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brigandt/&gt;
In 1790, [[Goethe]] stated his [[foliar theory]] in his essay "Metamorphosis of Plants", showing that flower part are derived from leaves.&lt;ref name=Dornelas&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1677-04202005000400001 |title=From leaf to flower: Revisiting Goethe's concepts on the ¨metamorphosis¨ of plants |year=2005 |last1=Dornelas |first1=Marcelo Carnier |last2=Dornelas |first2=Odair |journal=Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=17 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[serial homology]] of limbs was described late in the 18th century.
The French zoologist [[Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] showed in 1818 in his ''theorie d'analogue'' ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between [[Georges Cuvier]]'s ''[[embranchement]]s'', such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 [[Cuvier-Geoffroy debate]]. Geoffroy stated the principle of connections, namely that what is important is the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.
The Estonian [[embryologist]] [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] stated what are now called [[von Baer's laws]] in 1828, noting that related animals begin their development as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, animals in the same [[family (biology)|family]] are more closely related and diverge later than animals which are only in the same [[order (biology)|order]] and have fewer homologies. von Baer's theory recognises that each [[taxon]] (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as [[recapitulation theory]].
The term "homology" was first used in biology by the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] in 1843 when studying the similarities of vertebrate [[fin]]s and limbs, contrasting it with the matching term "analogy" which he used to describe different structures with the same function.
Richard Owen codified 3 main criteria for determining if features were homologous: position, development, composition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] explained homologous structures as meaning that the organisms concerned shared a [[body plan]] from a common ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref name=Panchen1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sommer |first1=R.

[[File:Nephrotoma guestfalica.jpg|thumb|The hind wings of [[Diptera]]n flies such as this [[cranefly]] have [[divergent evolution|evolved divergently]] to form small club-like [[haltere]]s. These are homologous with the hind wings of other insects.]]

Biological structures or sequences in different [[taxon|taxa]] are homologous if they are derived from a [[common descent|common ancestor]]. Homology thus implies [[divergent evolution]]. For example, many [[insect]]s (such as [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]) possess two pairs of flying [[wing (insect)|wings]]. In [[beetle]]s, the first pair of wings has evolved into a pair of [[elytron|hard wing covers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Günter P. |title=Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7vzAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-5146-1 |pages=53–54 |quote=elytra have very little similarity with typical wings, but are clearly homologous to forewings.

Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral [[vertebrate]]s have evolved into the front flippers of [[whale]]s, the wings of [[bird]]s, the running forelegs of [[dog]]s, [[deer]], and [[horse]]s, the short forelegs of [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s, and the grasping [[hand]]s of [[primate]]s including humans. The same major forearm bones ([[humerus]], [[Radius (bone)|radius]], and [[ulna]]{{efn|These are coloured in the lead image: humerus brown, radius pale buff, ulna red.}}) are found in fossils of [[lobe-finned fish]] such as ''[[Eusthenopteron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homology: Legs and Limbs|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/homology_02|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homology vs analogy===

The opposite of homologous organs are [[Analogy (biology)|analogous]] organs which do similar jobs in two taxa that were not [[phylogeny|present in their last common ancestor]] but rather [[convergent evolution|evolved separately]]. For example, the [[insect wing|wings of insects]] and birds evolved independently in [[phylum (biology)|widely separated groups]], and converged functionally to support powered [[flight]], so they are analogous. Similarly, the wings of a [[sycamore maple]] seed and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous, as they develop from quite different structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secret Found to Flight of 'Helicopter Seeds' |url=http://www.livescience.com/3672-secret-flight-helicopter-seeds.html |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=2 March 2017 |date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lentink, D.; Dickson, W.

===In cladistics===
{{further|Cladistics}}

Specialised terms are used in taxonomic research. Primary homology is a researcher's initial hypothesis based on similar structure or anatomical connections, suggesting that a character state in two or more taxa share is shared due to common ancestry. Primary homology may be conceptually broken down further:  we may consider all of the states of the same character as "homologous" parts of a single, unspecified, transformation series.  This has been referred to as topographical correspondence.  For example, in an aligned DNA sequence matrix, all of the A, G, C, T or implied gaps at a given nucleotide site are homologous in this way.  Character state identity is the hypothesis that the particular condition in two or more taxa is "the same" as far as our character coding scheme is concerned.  Thus, two Adenines at the same aligned nucleotide site are hypothesized to be homologous unless that hypothesis is subsequently contradicted by other evidence.  Secondary homology is implied by [[parsimony analysis]], where a character state that arises only once on a tree is taken to be homologous.&lt;ref name="de Pinna1991"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1991.tb00045.x| title=Concepts and Tests of homology in the cladistic paradigm| year=1991| last1=de Pinna | first1=M.

&lt;/ref&gt; As implied in this definition, many [[cladistics|cladists]] consider secondary homology to be synonymous with [[synapomorphy]], a shared derived character or [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] state that distinguishes a [[clade]] from other organisms.&lt;ref name="PageHolmes2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Page, Roderick D.M. |author2=Holmes, Edward C. |title=Molecular Evolution: A Phylogenetic Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2lWhjuK8m8C |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-1336-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brower, A.

Shared ancestral character states, symplesiomorphies, represent either synapomorphies of a more inclusive group, or complementary states (often absences) that unite no natural group of organisms.  For example, the presence of wings is a synapomorphy for pterygote insects, but a symplesiomorphy for holometabolous insects.  Absence of wings in non-pterygote insects and other organisms is a complementary symplesiomorphy that unites no group (for example, absence of wings provides no evidence of common ancestry of silverfish, spiders and annelid worms).  On the other hand, absence (or secondary loss) of wings is a synapomorphy for fleas.

Homologies provide the fundamental basis for all biological classification, although some may be highly counter-intuitive. For example, [[deep homology|deep homologies]] like the ''[[pax6]]'' genes that control the development of the eyes of vertebrates and arthropods were unexpected, as the organs are anatomically dissimilar and appeared to have evolved entirely independently.&lt;ref name=Brusca/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean B. |authorlink=Sean B.

Among insects, the [[stinger]] of the female [[honey bee]] is a modified [[ovipositor]], homologous with ovipositors in other insects such as the [[Orthoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], and those [[Hymenoptera]] without stingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shing |first1=H. |last2=Erickson |first2=E.

The three small bones in the [[middle ear]] of mammals including humans, the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]], are today used to transmit sound from the [[eardrum]] to the [[inner ear]]. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homology: From jaws to ears — an unusual example of a homology|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/homology_06|publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudimentary organs such as the human [[coccyx|tailbone]], now much reduced from their functional state, are readily understood as signs of [[evolution]], the explanation being that they were cut down by [[natural selection]] from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make no sense at all if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=112}}

{{further|ABC model of flower development}}

The four types of flower parts, namely [[carpel]]s, [[stamen]]s, [[petal]]s, and [[sepal]]s, are homologous with and derived from leaves, as [[Goethe]] correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of [[gene expression]] in the growing zones ([[meristem]]s) is described by the [[ABC model of flower development]]. Each of the four types of flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by a small number of genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form [[ovule]]s and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the [[flowering plants]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Dornelas"/&gt;

==Developmental biology==
[[File:Pachyrhachis problematicus 45.JPG|thumb|The [[Cretaceous]] snake ''[[Pachyrhachis problematicus]]'' had hind legs (circled).]]

[[Developmental biology]] can identify homologous structures that arose from the same tissue in [[embryogenesis]]. For example, adult [[snake]]s have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by [[fossil]] evidence: the [[Cretaceous]] snake ''[[Pachyrhachis problematicus]]'' had hind legs complete with hip bones ([[ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[ischium]]), thigh bone ([[femur]]), leg bones ([[tibia]], [[fibula]]) and foot bones ([[calcaneum]], [[astragalus]]) as in tetrapods with legs today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homologies: developmental biology |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/lines_07 |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with anatomical structures, [[sequence homology]] between [[protein]] or [[DNA sequence]]s is defined in terms of shared ancestry.  Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a [[speciation]] event ([[Sequence homology#Orthology|orthologs]]) or a [[Gene duplication|duplication event]] ([[Sequence homology#Paralogy|paralogs]]). Homology among proteins or DNA is typically inferred from their sequence similarity.  Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by divergent evolution of a common ancestor.  [[Sequence alignment|Alignments]] of multiple sequences are used to indicate which regions of each sequence are homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koonin, E. V. |title=Orthologs, Paralogs, and Evolutionary Genomics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=39 |issue= |pages=309–38 |year=2005 |pmid=16285863 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.114725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologous sequences are orthologous if they are descended from the same ancestral sequence separated by a [[speciation]] event: when a species diverges into two separate species, the copies of a single gene in the two resulting species are said to be ''orthologous''. The term "ortholog" was coined in 1970 by the [[molecular evolution]]ist [[Walter M. Fitch|Walter Fitch]].&lt;ref name="Fitch WM 99–113"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fitch, W. M. |title=Distinguishing homologous from analogous proteins |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–113 |date=June 1970 |pmid=5449325 |doi=10.2307/2412448|jstor=2412448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologous sequences are paralogous if they were created by a duplication event within the genome. For [[gene duplication]] events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often belong to the same species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the [[Homeobox]] ([[Hox gene|Hox]]) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within [[chromosome]]s but also [[Genome evolution|whole genome duplications]]. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are spread across multiple chromosomes: the HoxA–D clusters are the best studied.&lt;ref name=Zakany&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zakany |first=Jozsef |last2=Duboule |first2=Denis |date=2007 |title=The role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=359–366 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.05.011|issn=0959-437X |pmid=17644373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weeper Capuchin 01 (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--format for low image--&gt;|[[Dominance hierarchy]] behaviour, as in these [[weeper capuchin]] monkeys, may be homologous across the [[primates]].]]

==In behaviour==
{{main|Homology (psychology)}}

It has been suggested that some behaviours might be homologous, based either on sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual's development, though this remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=David S |title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013 |volume=55 |issue=1|pages=13–21 |doi=10.1002/dev.21015 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full |pmid=22711075}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman [[primates]], argue that patterns of behaviour in [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajecki, D. W.; Flanery, Randall C. |editor=Lamb, M. E.; Brown, A. L. |title=Social Conflict and Dominance in Children: a Case for a Primate Homology |work=Advances in Developmental Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtDGBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT125|year=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |isbn=978-1-135-83123-3 |page=125 |quote=Finally, much recent information on children's ''and'' nonhuman primates' behavior in groups, a conjunction of hard human data and hard nonhuman primate data, lends credence to our comparison. Our conclusion is that, based on their agreement in several unusual characteristics, dominance patterns are homologous in primates. This agreement of unusual characteristics is found at several levels, including fine motor movement, gross motor movement, and behavior at the group level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imperial War Museum Duxford''' is a branch of the [[Imperial War Museum]] near [[Duxford]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], England. Britain's largest [[aviation museum]],&lt;ref name=Holt/&gt; Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 [[aircraft]], military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibition buildings.&lt;ref name=A&amp;V&gt;For a list of aircraft, vehicles and boats at Duxford, see {{cite web |date=June 2008 |url=http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/upload/pdf/AircraftandVehicles.pdf |title=IWM Duxford: Aircraft and Vehicles |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=26 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804174610/http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/upload/pdf/AircraftandVehicles.pdf |archive-date=4 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also provides storage space for the museum's [[Imperial War Museum#Collections|other collections]] of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates several [[British Army]] regimental museums, including those of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] (named ''[[Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum|Airborne Assault]]'') and the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]].

Based on the historic [[Duxford Aerodrome]], the site was originally operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF)  during the [[First World War]]. During the [[Second World War]] Duxford played a prominent role during the [[Battle of Britain]] and was later used by [[United States Army Air Forces]] fighter units in support of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|daylight bombing]] of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. After the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage. The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976.

In keeping with the site's history many of Duxford's original buildings, such as [[hangar]]s used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. Many of these buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance and over thirty have [[listed building]] status,&lt;ref name=IWMDhistoric&gt;Imperial War Museum Duxford (2009) [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5713 Historic Duxford] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001151237/http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5713 |date=1 October 2009 }}.

==Museum history==
{{main|Imperial War Museum}}
The Imperial War Museum originated during the First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, formed by the British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and [[British Empire|her Empire]]. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the ''Imperial'' War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, Gaynor 'Museum as Memorial: The Origins of the Imperial War Museum', ''Journal of Contemporary History'' Vol. 23 No. 1 (January 1988). Available via [[JSTOR]] at [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260869]. Retrieved 13 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the museum's terms of reference were enlarged to include the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;'Imperial War Museum: Collection of war relics', ''The Times'' 14 May 1940 Issue 48615 Page 4 Column F&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces were engaged.&lt;ref name="IWMLguide2"&gt;''Imperial War Museum London'' (guidebook), (London: Imperial War Museum, 2009) pp. 2 {{ISBN|978-1-904897-95-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth-century building in [[Southwark]] which was previously the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]) had been extended in 1966, by the end of the decade the museum was seeking additional space.&lt;ref name=Frankland&gt;{{cite book | last = Frankland | first = Noble | title = History at War | publisher = Giles de la Mare | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-1-900357-10-4 | page = 205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAF Duxford, a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter station had been declared surplus to requirements by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1969, and the museum duly requested permission to use part of one of the airfield's hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March–October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982&lt;ref&gt;Frankland (1999) pg. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt; and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/ National Museum Directors' Conference] (September 2005) [http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/media/documents/newsletters/newslettersep05.doc Newsletter] No.48.

[[File:Bf109atimperialwarmuseumduxford.jpg|thumb|Tableau of crashed Bf 109E in Hangar 4.]]Hangar 4 is one of Duxford's historic hangars, and now houses an exhibition exploring Duxford's history as an operational RAF airfield from the First World War to the [[Cold War]]. The early period is represented by a [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]], a type operated by Duxford's No.2 Flying Training School from 1920. The latter period is represented by a [[Hawker Hunter]] which flew at Duxford with [[No. 65 Squadron RAF]], a [[Gloster Javelin]], the type which made the last operational flight at Duxford in 1961, and by a Hungarian [[Mikoyan|Mikoyan-Gurevich]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], a common [[Warsaw Pact]] jet fighter. Britain's air defence during the Second World War is particularly emphasised, with exhibits representing the Battle of Britain, [[the Blitz]] and the [[V-1 flying bomb]] offensive from 1944. Notable aircraft include a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E which was flown during the Battle of Britain until forced down in [[Sussex]] due to engine failure. It is displayed as part of a tableau showing the crashed aircraft under guard. One unusual aircraft on display is the [[Juan de la Cierva|Cierva]] [[Cierva C.30|C.30A]] [[autogyro]], which was used by 74 (Signals) Wing, based at Duxford, to test the calibration of coastal radar units.&lt;ref name=cheek39-42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Imperial War Museum Duxford [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5716 Hangar 4: The Battle of Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822022206/http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5716 |date=22 August 2009 }} and [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1224/setPaginate/No The Battle of Britain Exhibition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423133811/http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1224/setPaginate/No |date=23 April 2009 }}.

With Duxford's association with the [[US Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration of the role of American air power in the [[Second World War]]. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]] was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General [[Jimmy Doolittle]] in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), [[Washington, D.C.]], (1991) and Los Angeles (1992).

Significant vehicles in the collection include three command vehicles used by Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Law Montgomery]], commander of [[21st Army Group]] during the north-west Europe campaign. Also on display are extracts from Montgomery's personal papers, which are held by the Imperial War Museum's [[Imperial War Museum#Collections|Department of Documents]].&lt;ref&gt;'Montgomery documents',''The Times'' 8 July 1982, Issue 61280, page 2 column A&lt;/ref&gt; Other tableaux depict scenes from post-1945 conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], the [[Northern Ireland]] [[Troubles]], the [[Falklands War]], British [[UNPROFOR|peacekeeping contributions in Bosnia]] and the [[Gulf War]]. As many of the vehicles in the Land Warfare Hall are maintained in running condition, the site features [[Automobile repair shop|garages]] and a running area behind the building.

===Forgotten War===
The Land Warfare Hall also houses the Forgotten War exhibition, which opened on 25 March 1999 and was a joint project between the Imperial War Museum and the [[Burma Star]] Association. The Association represents veterans of the [[Burma campaign]] who often consider themselves to have fought in a "[[Forgotten Army]]" compared to those who fought in Europe. The exhibition explores aspects of the Second World War [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|in the Far East]] and features artefacts, archival film and photographs, and [[Tableau vivant|tableaux]] depicting scenes such as troops moving through [[jungle]] and a [[Burma|Burmese]] village. The exhibition was supported financially by the Burma Star Association and by £126,000 from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Imperial War Museum Duxford |title=The Forgotten War Exhibition |url=http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1186 |publisher=duxford.iwm.org.uk |accessdate=24 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323112627/http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1186 |archivedate=23 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Air Classics |issue=June 1999 |title=Forgotten War |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3901/is_199906/ai_n8870342/ |publisher=findarticles.com |accessdate=24 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Anglian Regiment Museum and Memorial===
The Land Warfare Hall also accommodates the Royal Anglian Regiment Museum. The [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] was formed in 1964 by the amalgamation of the three regiments of the [[East Anglian Brigade]] and the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment]]. The museum was opened in June 1996 by noted war correspondent [[Martin Bell]], who had previously served as a [[sergeant]] in the [[Suffolk Regiment]] while a [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|national serviceman]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal Anglian Regiment Museum [http://www.royalanglianmuseum.org.uk/support.html Supporters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827200603/http://www.royalanglianmuseum.org.uk/support.html |date=27 August 2009 }}.

Retrieved 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2010 a Royal Anglian Regiment memorial was dedicated at Duxford. A fundraising campaign, which raised more than £340,000, was launched following the [[British forces casualties in Afghanistan since 2001#April 2007|deaths in action of nine soldiers]] of 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment during the unit's 2007 [[Operation Herrick|operational tour in Helmand Province]], Afghanistan. The memorial is inscribed with the names of 78 soldiers killed since 1958 (when the first of the three East Anglian regiments was formed) in conflicts including Afghanistan, Iraq, Northern Ireland and [[Aden Emergency|Aden]]. The dedication was attended by more than 5000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/royal_anglian_memorial_unveiled_we_will_never_forget_their_sacrifices_1_1156020 |title=Royal Anglian memorial unveiled: we will never forget their sacrifices |author=Collett, Amy |date=14 September 2010 |work=PeterboroughToday.co.uk |publisher=Johnston Publishing Limited |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North side: collections storage==
In addition to the exhibition buildings, Duxford's 'North Side', the area of the site north of the A505 road, provides storage for the Imperial War Museum's [[Imperial War Museum#Documents|collecting departments]]. The stored collections include the [[film]] collection, with potentially hazardous [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrocellulose film|nitrate film]] kept in purpose-built vaults at nearby [[Ickleton]].

'''Iometer''' is an [[Input/output|I/O]] [[subsystem]] measurement and characterization [[Tool#Tool metaphors|tool]] for single and [[Computer cluster|clustered systems]]. It is used as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] and [[troubleshooting]] tool and is easily configured to replicate the behaviour of many popular [[Application software|applications]]. One commonly quoted measurement provided by the tool is [[IOPS]].
==History==
Created by [[Intel Corporation]] (Sean Hefty, David Levine and Fab Tillier are listed by the Iometer [[About dialog]] as the [[software developer|developers]]), the tool was officially announced at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] (IDF) on 17 February 1998. In 2001 Intel discontinued development and subsequently handed the sources to the [[Open Source Development Lab]] for release under the [[Intel Open Source License]]. On 15 November 2001 the Iometer project was registered at [[SourceForge.net]] and an initial version was made available. Experiencing no further development, the project was relaunched by Daniel Scheibli in February 2003. Since then it has been driven by an international group of individuals who have been improving and [[porting]] the product to additional [[Computing platform|platforms]].

==Functionality==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Iometer-screenshot.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Screenshot of Iometer tachometer view]] --&gt;
Iometer is based on a [[client–server model]], where one instance of the Iometer [[graphical user interface]] is managing one or more 'managers' (each one representing a separate Dynamo.exe [[Process_(computing)|process]]) which are doing the [[Input/output|I/O]] with one or more [[thread pool|worker threads]]. Iometer performs [[Asynchronous I/O]] - accessing [[computer file|files]] or [[Block device#Block devices|block devices]] (later one allowing to bypass the [[file system#User data|file system buffers]]).

Iometer allows the configuration of [[Disk storage|disk]] parameters such as the 'Maximum Disk Size', 'Starting [[Disk sector|Disk Sector]]' and '# of Outstanding I/Os'. This allows a [[User_(computing)|user]] to configure a test file upon which the 'Access Specifications' configure the I/O types to the file.
Configurable items within the Access Specifications are:
* Transfer Request Size
* Percent  Random/Sequential distribution.
* Percent Read/Write Distribution
* Aligned I/O's.
* Reply Size
* TCP/IP status
* Burstiness.
In conjunction with the Access Specifications, Iometer allows the specifications to be cycled with incrementing outstanding I/O's, either [[exponential function|exponentially]] or [[Linearity|linearly]]. The tool outputs 50 parameters into a [[Comma-separated values|.CSV file]], allowing multiple applications to analyse and generate graphs and reports on the measured performance.

'''Nellya Baughman'''&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; (August 21, 1935 – May 11, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who was best known by her [[ring name]] '''Judy Grable'''. She was an active wrestler during the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to her nickname "The Barefoot Contessa" due to her preference for wrestling barefoot,&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; she was also known as "the acrobatic blonde with the educated flying feet."&lt;ref name=god98/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Grable trained for her professional wrestling career with [[The Fabulous Moolah]] in her training school in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=god90/&gt; She debuted in 1953 using the name Peaches Grable.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; Moolah's female trainees worked in Boston under promoter [[Paul Bowser]], and in Boston, Grable and Moolah were involved in a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]].&lt;ref name=god90/&gt;

She wrestled in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) territories through the 1950s and the 1960s. In September 1956, a [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] was held to determine the new [[NWA World Women's Championship|NWA World Women's Champion]], but lost to long-time rival The Fabulous Moolah.&lt;ref name=god98&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 1958 Grable made an appearance as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[What's My Line?]]''.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; The episode became famous in part because of the highly risque banter from guest panelist [[Groucho Marx]] and consequent [[Malapropism|malapropisms]] by regular panelist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] and host [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]].

Even though she retired in the late 1960s, Grable's last in-ring work occurred in Superstar Wrestling in 1974.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

On March 31, 2017, Grable was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a part of the Legacy wing.

==Personal life==
Grable was the youngest of six children, including four brothers and one sister.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; She was a [[tomboy]] who liked fishing, hunting, and sports.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; She also [[high school wrestling|wrestled]] at [[Grand Junction High School]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; Her family later moved to Florida, where Grable became interested in the [[circus]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; She was employed at [[Ringling Brothers Circus]] as an [[acrobatics|acrobat]] for six months, deciding she would rather wrestle after falling off a high wire.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

In the late 1960s, Grable retired from wrestling after marrying a serviceman.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; Grable returned to school, graduating in 1978.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; She was then employed as a nurse's assistant in a home for veterans.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; One of her daughters works as a wrestler under the name Debbie Grable.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

Grable died on May 11, 2008 after living with diabetes, strokes, and [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

This is the '''list of NATO country codes'''. Up to and including the seventh edition of [[STANAG]] 1059, these were two-letter codes (digrams). The eighth edition, promulgated February 19, 2004, and effective April 1, 2004, replaced all codes with new ones based on the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] codes. Additional codes cover gaps in the ISO coverage, deal with the imaginary countries used for exercise purposes, and designate large geographical groupings and water bodies (ranging from oceans to rivers). It consists of two-letter codes for geographical entities, four-letter codes for subdivisions, and lists the ISO three-letter codes for reference. The digrams match the [[List of FIPS country codes|FIPS 10-4 codes]] with a few exceptions.

The ninth edition's ratification draft was published on July 6, 2005, with a reply deadline of October 6, 2005. It replaces all two- and four-letter codes with ISO or ISO-like three- and six-letter codes. It is intended as a transitional standard: once all [[NATO]] nations have updated their information systems, a tenth edition will be published.

For diplomatic reasons, Macedonia is designated as the [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] and receives a (temporary) code explicitly different from the ISO one.

The Republic of Palau is also often indicated (at least in the United States) as PW.

'''Moll Dyer''' (died c. 1697?) is the name of a [[legend]]ary 17th-century resident of [[Leonardtown, Maryland]], who was said to have been accused of [[witchcraft]] and chased out of her home by the local townsfolk on a winter night. Her body was found a few days later, partially frozen to a large stone.

==History==
Stories say her spirit haunts the land, looking for the men who forced her from her home. The land near her cabin is said to be cursed, never again growing good crops, and an unusual number of lightning strikes have been recorded there.  A white dog is mentioned as causing accidents on Moll Dyer road.

One interviewer reported that while hunting along Moll Dyer's Run around 1970 he saw a "very dense fog patch, cylindrical in shape, with the light emanating about eight inches down from the top.... It crossed the stream and went east ... moving across the wind instead of with the wind ... then turned and went south.... But what made it really strange was that it did it twice! ... I'm not saying that it was the spirit of Moll Dyer. I just don't know what it was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert B.|last=Durham|title=Modern Folklore|publisher=lulu.com|date=2015|ISBN= 978-1312909694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has survived for generations, though no historical record has been found of Moll Dyer's existence. Records from the colonial period are often incomplete and the county courthouse burned in 1831 so early documents were lost. Historical evidence includes:
* An immigration record shows that Mary Dyer, Marg. Dyer, and Malligo Dyer were transported to Maryland in October 1677 on a ship commanded by Capt. Thomas Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Hall of Records Land Books, Liber 15, Folio 438.&lt;/ref&gt; (Moll is a nickname for Mary.)
* A "great epidemic" occurred in Southern Maryland in 1697/98. (Archives of MD, V23, p.&amp;nbsp;396)
* In the 18 August 1892 edition of ''The St. Mary's Beacon'' (Edition 604, Volume LII), Joseph F. Morgan wrote that Moll lived in the area for many years, and that her cottage was burned while "[[Cotton Mather]] held sway in the land of the Puritans." (Mather was born in 1663 and died in 1728.) This story has been reprinted in the "Chronicles of St. Mary's," which are available from the St. Mary's County Historical Society.
* There were several witchcraft trials in Maryland, starting in 1654 and continuing until 1712. Rebecca Fowler of neighboring Calvert County was hanged as a witch on 9 October 1685.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Historical Magazine XXXL pP. 271–298&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Washington Times]]'' has called her "perhaps Maryland's best-known bit of witch lore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/oct/10/20041010-102416-3747r/|title=Witchcraft a part of Maryland's past|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=October 10, 2004|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local newspapers occasionally reprint the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.somdnews.com/stories/10302009/entetop175334_32180.shtml/|title=Witch or not, Moll Dyer legend lives on|date=30 October 2009|work=The Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moll Dyer's Rock ==
According to legend, Moll Dyer rested on a large stone before she died, leaving indentations (either hands or knees or both) behind.  In 1972, an 875-pound boulder was moved from a wooded ravine near Moll Dyer Road to the Leonardtown courthouse lawn in front of the old 1876 jailhouse, which now serves as the St. Mary's County Historical Society building. The rock remains there to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somd.lib.md.us/tobacco_to_tomcats/tobacco_to_tomcats.pdf|title=Tobacco to Tomcats... St. Mary's County since the Revolution|last=Shoemaker|first=Sandy|publisher=StreamLine Enterprises|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Local legend has it that the rock itself is cursed, and that people who go near it will experience dizziness eventually leading to fainting.

== Impact ==
The [[Weather Channel]] aired an episode about Moll Dyer in their series ''American Supernatural'' on 5 October 2014.

''Sister Witch, The Life of Moll Dyer'' was written by local novelist David W. Thompson and published by Solstice Publishing on October 31, 2017. Inspired by Moll Dyer's life, it pulls together the historical record and local oral traditions surrounding her legend.

The ''Legend of the Witch, Moll Dyer'' was choreographed by St. Mary's Ballet founder Jane Caputo and set to the music of [[Loreena McKennitt]] in 1999.  The ballet was performed at [[St. Mary's Ryken High School]] and at the [[College of Southern Maryland]]'s Leonardtown campus as part of the county's yearly Halloween celebration from 1999 to 2003 and again in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ellynne|last=Brice Davis|url=http://www.somdnews.com/stories/101106/entepeo170411_32098.shtml|title=Ballet recalls witch legend|newspaper=Southern Maryland News|publisher=Southern Maryland Newspapers|location=Charles County, Maryland|date=October 11, 2006|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ballet recasts the legend in the mold of a [[morality tale]] of [[feminism]] and tolerance. 

The song "Fire and Snow" (2007) by folk/rock duo Hobbyhorse of San Francisco is about Moll Dyer.

Moll Dyer Road, 3.4 miles south of Leonardtown, is named after her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stmarystoday.com/news_stories_november_2005.htm |title=Spooktacular Wreck: Crack-up at Moll Dyer Road Sends 2 on Fly-out LEONARDTOWN |date=27 October 2005 |work=St. Mary's Today |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025142946/http://www.stmarystoday.com/news_stories_november_2005.htm |archivedate=October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the creek, Moll Dyer's Run, which parallels the road then crosses Route 5, goes past Our Lady's Chapel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourladyschurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/OLC-History-01.pdf Our Lady's Chapel]&lt;/ref&gt; on Medley's Neck Road, and eventually flows into [[Breton Bay]].

==Variations==
As with all folktales, the story has been passed down through the generations and changes with the telling. In 1994 Thomas Jarboe conducted a series of interviews with ten local residents, including a member of the Dyer family, a local historian, and several people from families that have lived in the county since the 1600s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} According to these interviews, Moll Dyer is said to have come from Ireland, Virginia, Kentucky, New England, or Connecticut. She is said to have been a widow, a woman disappointed in love, or the mother of two sons. She may have born{{clarification needed|date=November 2018|reason=Borne a Dyer or born as a Dyer?}} a Dyer or married a man named Dyer. Two people said they had heard her name as "Moldy Dyer" and that she was a Native American maid abandoned by her white lover after the birth of their child. The date of her death varied from the mid-1600s to the late 1700s. Several people said they thought Moll Dyer was [[Catholic]] or that she had come to Maryland because it was more religiously tolerant than other colonies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2098">A '''mook''' {{IPAc-en|m|ʊ|k}} is a publication which is physically similar to a [[magazine]] but is intended to remain on bookstore shelves for longer periods than traditional magazines.&lt;ref name="Brand Mooks"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/10/20/meet-japans-brand-mooks-half-magazine-half-book-all-hit/ |last=Osawa |first=Juro |title=Meet Japan's 'Brand Mooks': Half-magazine, Half-book, All Hit |work=Japan Real Time |publisher=''The Wall Street Journal'' |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francelivre.org/index.php/eng/News/Carte-blanche-to-Livres-Hedbo/Mooks-are-here-to-stay |title=Mooks are here to stay |last=Taillandier |first=Fanny |work=FranceLivre |date=January 13, 2014 |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "magazine" and "[[book]]".  It was first used in 1971, at a convention of the Fédération Internationale de la Presse Périodique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TiIwhF0C6M8C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237 |title=The Innovative Attraction of English |last=Cannon |first=Garland |work=Manuscript, Narrative, Lexicon |publisher=Associated University Presses |page=237 |year=2000 |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The format has become particularly popular in Japan, where several fashion designers publish "brand mooks" to promote their products.&lt;ref name="Brand Mooks"/&gt;

American examples of mooks include ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]'' and ''[[Craft (magazine)|Craft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperhewitt.org/es/conversations/2007/05/23/its-magazine-its-book-its-mook |title=It's a Magazine, It's a Book, It's a Mook |last=Lupton |first=Ellen |work=Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum |publisher=Smithsonian |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512214553/http://www.cooperhewitt.org/es/conversations/2007/05/23/its-magazine-its-book-its-mook |archivedate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Mall''' is a [[Landscape architecture|landscaped park]] within the [[National Mall and Memorial Parks]], an official unit of the [[National Park Service#National Park System|United States National Park System]]. It is located near the [[Downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown area]] of [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[capital city]] of the [[United States]], and is administered by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="INDEX"&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Parks: Index 2012-2016|url=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/upload/NPIndex2012-2016.pdf|page=44|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2017-12-26|ref=National Park Index|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226004602/https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/upload/NPIndex2012-2016.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''National Mall'' commonly includes areas that are also officially part of neighboring [[West Potomac Park]] and [[Constitution Gardens]] to the southwest. The term is often taken to refer to the entire area between the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the west and east to the [[United States Capitol]] grounds, with the [[Washington Monument]] dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint.&lt;ref name="foundation statement"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Maps/NMMParks_map.pdf |title=Foundation statement for the National Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Park |work=National Mall Plan |format=pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |pages=6–10 |accessdate=2017-12-26 |quote=The National Mall stretches from the grounds of the U.S. Capitol west to the Potomac River, and from the [[Jefferson Memorial|Thomas Jefferson Memorial]] north to Constitution Avenue. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226062014/https://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Maps/NMMParks_map.pdf |archivedate=2017-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller designation sometimes referred to as the ''National Mall (proper)'' excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them.&lt;ref name="National Register Nomination Form" /&gt;

===L'Enfant City Plan===
In his 1791 plan for the future city of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]] envisioned a garden-lined "grand avenue" approximately 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) in length
and {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide, in an area that would lie between the Capitol building and an equestrian statue of [[George Washington]] to be placed directly south of the [[White House]] (see [[L'Enfant Plan]]).&lt;ref name="National Register Nomination —Form"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfanz |first=Donald C. |url={{NRHP url|id=66000031}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory — Nomination Form: National Mall |publisher=National Park Service |date=1981-02-11 |accessdate=2010-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223101453/http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/66000031.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherald&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherald |first=James L |url=http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Documents/Studies/ElmsoftheMonuCore_HistandMgmtPlan_122009.pdf |title=Elms for the Monumental Core: History and Management Plan |id=Natural Resource Report NPS/NCR/NRR--2009/001 |place=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Center for Urban Ecology, National Capital Region, [[National Park Service]] |pages=2–5 |date=December 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129074707/http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Documents/Studies/ElmsoftheMonuCore_HistandMgmtPlan_122009.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm |title=Map 1: The L'Enfant Plan for Washington |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2009-10-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121111024/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm |archivedate=2009-01-21}}&lt;br&gt;(2) L'Enfant identified himself as "Peter Charles L'Enfant" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ...."] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the United States, [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, "Pierre Charles L'Enfant". (See: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C.) The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as ''[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405134623/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm |date=2014-04-05 }}'' and as '' [http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228094032/http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html |date=2010-02-28 }}'' on its website.

The [[Washington City Canal]], completed in 1815 in accordance with the L'Enfant Plan, travelled along the former course of [[Tiber Creek]] to the [[Potomac River]] along the present line of [[Constitution Avenue]], NW (formerly B Street, NW) and south around the Capitol, thus defining the northern and eastern boundaries of the Mall.&lt;ref name=canal&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul K.|last=Williams|url=http://househistoryman.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-ill-fated-washington-city-canal.html|title=The ill fated Washington City Canal: filled in and paved over in 1871|work=The House History Man|date=2013-10-28|accessdate=2018-06-19|via=[[Blogger]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909221544/http://househistoryman.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-ill-fated-washington-city-canal.html|archive-date=2016-09-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite book|title= A History of the National Capital from Its Foundation Through the Period of the Adoption of the Organic Act, Volume 2|last=Bryan |first= Wilhelmus Bogart |year=1916 |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |page=104 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WyIUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web |url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=209 |title="Lock Keeper's House" marker |publisher=Historical Marker Database |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being shallow and often obstructed by [[silt]], the canal served only a limited role and became an open sewer.&lt;ref name=canal/&gt; The portion of the canal that traveled near the Mall was covered over in 1871 for sanitary reasons.&lt;ref name=canal/&gt;

===Downing Plan===
During the early 1850s, architect and horticulturist [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] designed a landscape plan for the Mall.&lt;ref name=Sherald /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanlon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|first=David|last=Schuyler|title=Downing, Andrew Jackson|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/17/17-00235.html|work=American Council of Learned Societies: American National Biography Online|date=February 2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=2017-09-18|quote=In late 1850 Downing was commissioned to landscape the public grounds in Washington, D.C. This 150-acre tract extended west from the foot of Capitol Hill to the site of the Washington Monument and then north to the president's house. Downing saw this as an opportunity not simply to ornament the capital but also to create the first large public park in the United States. He believed that the Washington park would encourage cities across the nation to provide healthful recreational grounds for their citizens. Although only the initial stages of construction had been completed at the time of his death, Downing's commission, as well as the influence of his writings, merited the epithet "Father of American Parks".|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918202843/http://www.anb.org/articles/17/17-00235.html|archivedate=2017-09-18|df=}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|url=http://gardens.si.edu/our-gardens/downing-urn.html|title=Downing's Plan for the Mall|work=[[Smithsonian Gardens]]: The Downing Urn in the Enid A.

During that period, the Mall was subdivided into several areas along B Street NW:
* The Monument Grounds between 17th and 14th Street NW
* The Agricultural Grounds between 14th and 12th Street NW
* The Smithsonian Grounds between 12th and 7th Street NW
* The Armory Square between 7th and 6th Street NW

In 1856, the Armory (No. 27 on the map above) was built at the intersection of B Street SW and 6th Street SW on the Armory Grounds. In 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], the building was converted to a military hospital known as [[Armory Square Hospital]] to house [[Union Army]] casualties.

In 1902, the [[McMillan Plan|McMillan Commission]]'s plan, which was partially inspired by the [[City Beautiful Movement]] and which purportedly extended L'Enfant's plan, called for a radical redesign of the Mall that would replace its greenhouses, gardens, trees, and commercial/industrial facilities with an open space.&lt;ref name=Sherald /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanlon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{Citation|last=Moore |first=Charles (ed) |title=The Improvement Of The Park System Of The District of Columbia: Report by the United States Congress: Senate Committee on the District of Columbia and District of Columbia Park Commission |place=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1902 |chapter=The Mall |pages=43–46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob7PAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |id=Fifty-Seventh Congress, First Session, Senate Report No. 166 |via=[[Google Books]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624140851/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob7PAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq= |archivedate=2016-06-24 |df= }}.

In subsequent years, the vision of the McMillan plan was generally followed with the planting of American elms and the layout of four boulevards down the Mall, two on either side of a wide [[lawn]].&lt;ref name="Mall History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satellite imagery of the National Mall in Google maps ''in'' {{coord|38.89|-77.023611|scale:6500|name=National Mall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with a plan that it completed in 1976, the NPS converted the two innermost boulevards (Washington and Adams Drives) into gravel walking paths.&lt;ref name="Mall History"/&gt; The two outermost boulevards (Jefferson Drive [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|Southwest]] (SW) and Madison Drive [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]] (NW)) remain paved and open to vehicular traffic.&lt;ref name="Mall History"/&gt;

From the 1970s to 1994, a [[fiberglass]] model of a [[triceratops]] named "''[[Uncle Beazley]]''" stood on the Mall in front of the [[National Museum of Natural History]].

The full-size Triceratops replica and eight other types of dinosaurs were designed by two prominent paleontologists, Dr. Barnum Brown of the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, and Dr. John Ostrom of the Peabody Museum, in Peabody, Massachusetts. The sculptor, Louis Paul Jonas, executed these prehistoric animals in fiberglass, after the designs of Barnum and Ostrom, for the Sinclair Refining Company's Pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1964. After the Fair closed, the nine dinosaurs, which weighed between 2 and 4 tons each, were placed on trucks and taken on a tour of the eastern United States. The Sinclair Refining Company promoted the tour for public relations and advertising purposes, since their trademark was the dinosaur. In 1967, the nine dinosaurs were given to various American museums.&lt;p&gt;This particular replica was used for the filming of ''The Enormous Egg'', a movie made by the [[National Broadcasting Company]] for television, based on a children's book of the same name by Oliver Buttersworth.

==Purposes==
The National Park Service states that the purposes of the National Mall are to:
* Provide a monumental, dignified, and symbolic setting for the governmental structures, museums and national memorials as first delineated by the L'Enfant plan and further outlined in the McMillan plan.
* Maintain and provide for the use of the National Mall with its public promenades as a completed work of civic art, a designed historic landscape providing extraordinary vistas to symbols of the nation.
* Maintain National Mall commemorative works (memorials, monuments, statues, sites, gardens) that honor presidential legacies, distinguished public figures, ideas, events, and military and civilian sacrifices and contributions.
* Forever retain the West Potomac Park section of the National Mall as a public park for recreation and enjoyment of the people.
* Maintain the National Mall in the heart of the nation's capital as a stage for national events and a preeminent national civic space for public gatherings because it is here that the constitutional rights of speech and peaceful assembly find their fullest expression.
* Maintain the National Mall as an area free of commercial advertising while retaining the ability to recognize sponsors.&lt;ref name="foundation statement"/&gt;

The population of American elm trees planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas in accordance with the McMillan Plan has remained intact for the past 70 years because of disease management and immediate tree replacement. [[Dutch elm disease]] (DED) first appeared on the Mall during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS has used a number of methods to control this [[fungus|fungal]] epidemic, including [[sanitation]], [[pruning]], injecting trees with [[fungicide]], replanting with DED-resistant American elm [[cultivar]]s and combatting the disease's local insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the smaller European elm [[bark beetle]] ([[Scolytus]] multistriatus), by trapping and by spraying with [[insecticide]]s. [[Soil compaction]] and root damage by crowds and construction projects also adversely affect the elms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherald |first=James L |url=http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Documents/Studies/ElmsoftheMonuCore_HistandMgmtPlan_122009.pdf |title=Elms for the Monumental Core: History and Management Plan |id=Natural Resource Report NPS/NCR/NRR--2009/001 |place=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Center for Urban Ecology, National Capital Region, [[National Park Service]] |date=December 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129074707/http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Documents/Studies/ElmsoftheMonuCore_HistandMgmtPlan_122009.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The National Mall, in combination with the other attractions in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], makes the nation's capital city one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. It has several other uses in addition to serving as a tourist focal point.

===Protests and rallies===
{{further|List of rallies and protest marches in Washington, D.C.|List of political rallies on the National Mall}}

The National Mall's status as a wide, open expanse at the heart of the capital makes it an attractive site for protests and rallies of all types. One notable example is the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], a [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], at which [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivered his speech "[[I Have a Dream]]".

The largest officially recorded rally was the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam War Moratorium Rally]] on October 15, 1969. However, in 1995, the NPS issued a crowd estimate for the [[Million Man March]] with which an organizer of the event, [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], disagreed.&lt;ref name=Leef&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Leef|last2=Melillo|first2=Wendy|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/21925324.html|title=If It's Crowd Size You Want, Park Service Says Count It Out; Congress Told Agency to Stop, Official Says|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=A.34|date=1996-10-13|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Nukols|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213034009/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7afad98b7d78423cbb5140fe810e3480/when-it-comes-inaugural-crowds-does-size-matter|archivedate=2017-02-13|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7afad98b7d78423cbb5140fe810e3480/when-it-comes-inaugural-crowds-does-size-matter|title=Inaugural crowds sure to be huge _ but how huge?|accessdate=2017-03-16|date=2017-01-18|work=The Big Story|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|quote=IT STARTS WITH THE MILLION MAN MARCH .....

===Presidential inaugurations===

During [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]]s, people without official tickets gather at the National Mall. Normally, the Mall between [[7th Street (Washington, D.C.)|7th]] and 14th Streets NW is used as a staging ground for the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nikita |last=Stewart |title=Entire Mall To Be Open To Public |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403719.html?hpid=topnews |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2008-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111112455/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403719.html?hpid=topnews |archivedate=2012-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2008, the Presidential Inaugural Committee (see: [[United States presidential inauguration#Organizers|United States presidential inauguration organizers]]) announced, "for the first time, the entire length of the National Mall will be opened to the public so that more people than ever before will be able to witness the swearing-in of the [[President of the United States|President]] from a vantage point in sight of the Capitol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pic2009.org/pressroom/entry/open_inauguration/ |title=National Mall Will Be Open to the Public on Inauguration Day |accessdate=2011-03-14 |date=2008-12-04 |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207144648/http://www.pic2009.org/pressroom/entry/open_inauguration/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee made this arrangement because of the massive attendance – projected to be as many as 2 million people – that it expected for the [[first inauguration of Barack Obama]] on January 20, 2009.

Despite the arrangement, a throng of people seeking access to the event climbed and then removed temporary protective fences around the Smithsonian's Mary Livingston Ripley Garden, six blocks from the site at which Obama took his inaugural oath. Hordes then trampled the garden's vegetation and elevated plant beds when entering and leaving the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/25/AR2009032500925.html |title=For Smithsonian, a Sad Souvenir of the Inauguration |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-23 |last=Higgins |first=Adrian |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=H.1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111112504/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/25/AR2009032500925.html |archivedate=2012-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others could not find a way to enter the Mall in time to view the ceremony.

===Other events and recreational activities===
The National Mall has long served as a spot for jogging, picnics, and light recreation for the [[Demographics of Washington, D.C.|Washington population]]. The Smithsonian Carousel, located on the Mall in front of the Arts and Industry Building, is a popular attraction that operates seasonally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/guides/english.htm|title=Welcome to the Smithsonian|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=August 2006|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212123602/http://www.si.edu/guides/english.htm|archivedate=2010-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[carousel]] was built by the [[Allan Herschell Company]] and arrived at [[Gwynn Oak Park]] near [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in 1947. It was moved to the Mall in 1981.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian carousel"/&gt;

In 1983, one of his cabinet members canceled a fourth of July Beach Boys concert on federal grounds in Washington, D.C., fearing the band would bring the wrong element to the capital. The move looked like crackbrained politics on every level &amp;ndash; the administration appeared painfully out of touch (banning the Beach Boys?), and the official who canned the show didn't even realize that the band was publicly down with the Reagans.&lt;p&gt;This was political theater of the absurd, and it was therefore a place where Dead Kennedys felt exceedingly at home. The San Francisco foursome took action, putting together a punk-rock festival on the Mall, the expanse of lawn stretching between the Washington Monument and the Capitol building. They were goading the government to try to stop them. Instead, thousands of punks filled the grounds that day, and skinny DK's frontman [[Jello Biafra]] greeted them by comparing the Monument to a giant hooded Klansman. As he jumped around like an insane marionette to their ornery punkability, government helicopters hovered over the stage and D.C. cops nervously patrolled the edge of the throng.}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223202239/http://sites.google.com/site/livedeadkennedys/1983/19830703 |archivedate=2011-02-23 |url=https://www.sites.google.com/site/livedeadkennedys/1983/19830703 |title=1983-07-03 - Rock Against Reagan, National Mall, Washington, DC |work=Dead Kennedys Concert Guide |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=2015-03-04 }}&lt;br&gt;(3) {{cite news|last=Richards |first=Chris |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/click-track/post/dave-grohl-glancing-back-blasting-forward/2011/04/08/AFk5w02C_blog.html |title=Dave Grohl, glancing back, blasting forward |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2015-03-04 |quote=On a family trip to Illinois in summer 1983, Grohl's older cousin switched him on to punk rock — something that really clicked back home in July at a Dead Kennedys show on the National Mall.

The Plan proposed a number of changes to the Mall.

Additional proposed changes included the replacement of the Sylvan Theater on the Washington Monument grounds with a facility containing offices, restaurants and restrooms.&lt;ref name=Summary /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Post /&gt;&lt;ref name=Examiner /&gt;

==Reconstruction and restoration==

From 2010 to 2012, NPS contractors rebuilt the aging Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, which had first been constructed in the early 1920s and whose water had come from the pipes that supply Washington, D.C., with its drinking water. As a result of the project, the pool now receives filtered water from the Tidal Basin through a [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|last=Ruane|first=Michael E.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112094338/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/shoring-up-support-for-lincoln-reflecting-pool/2011/05/10/AFPUcLkG_story.html|archivedate=2012-11-12|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/shoring-up-support-for-lincoln-reflecting-pool/2011/05/10/AFPUcLkG_story.html|title=Shoring up support for Lincoln reflecting pool|work=Post Local|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|first=Tyler|last=Henning|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518095855/http://www.modernpumpingtoday.com/improved-filtration-revitalizes-a-national-treasure/|archivedate=2015-05-18|url=http://www.modernpumpingtoday.com/improved-filtration-revitalizes-a-national-treasure/|title=Improved Filtration Revitalizes a National Treasure|work=Modern Pumping Today|publisher=Highlands Publications, Inc.|date=April 2013|accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and a topical guide to the Bahá'í Faith.

'''[[Bahá'í Faith]]''' &amp;ndash; [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 19th-century [[Persia]], emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind.

Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Piya''''' ({{zh|c=埤雅|p=''Píyǎ''|w=''P'i-ya''}}; "Increased [Er]ya") was a [[Chinese dictionary]] compiled by [[Song Dynasty]] scholar Lu Dian ([[:zh:陆佃|陸佃/陆佃]], 1042-1102). He wrote this ''[[Erya]]'' supplement along with his ''Erya Xinyi'' (爾雅新義 "New Exegesis of the ''Erya''") commentary. Although the ''Piya'' preface written by his son Lu Zai (陸宰/陆宰) is dated 1125, the dictionary was written earlier; Liu (1963:87) estimates around the Yuanfeng era (元豐, 1078–1085), and [[Joseph Needham]] (1986: 192) says around 1096.

Lu Dian arranged the ''Piya'' into 8 semantically based chapters that closely correspond with the last [[Erya#Contents|''Erya'' chapters]] 13-19. The only exceptions are Chapter 5 ("Explaining Horses") that is contained in ''Erya'' 19 ("Explaining Domestic Animals") and Chapter 8 ("Explaining Heaven") that anomalously corresponds with the first part of the ''Erya''.

The preface explains Lu's motives for defining flora and fauna terminology. Since Song officials changed the basis for the [[Imperial examination]] from mastering poetry to ''jingyi'' (經義/经义 "expounding on a classical quotation"), literati no longer studied the lyrical names for plants and animals.

'''Provost Developments Ltd v Collingwood Towers Ltd''' [1980] 2 NZLR 205 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding "subject to solicitor's approval" clauses in conditional contracts.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Collingwood entered into a sale agreement with Provost for several adjoining properties. The sale was conditional on "subject to my solicitor's approval". Due to receiving a better offer, the vendor's solicitor refused to give their approval, and based on this, the vendor claimed the contract had come to an end.

Provost filed in court for [[specific performance]] for Collingwood to honour the sale agreement.

==Held==
The Court said that the solicitor approval could only be withheld for legal issues, not for where a better offer was received. Richardson J stated "..it seems to me that the role of solicitor under clause 19 was to be limited accordingly to consideration of what might be loosely but conveniently be termed the legal implications of the transaction, including in that description the form of the agreement, its validity, and the burden of the commitments entered into thereafter".

A '''rhyming dictionary''' is a specialist [[dictionary]] designed for use in writing [[poetry]] and [[lyrics]]. In a rhyming dictionary, words are categorized into [[equivalence class]]es that consist of words that [[rhyme]] with one another. They also typically support several different kinds of rhymes and possibly also [[alliteration]] as well.

Because rhyming dictionaries are based on [[pronunciation]], they are difficult to compile. Words and rhyming patterns change their pronunciation over time and between [[dialect]]s. Rhyming dictionaries for [[Old English]], [[Elizabethan poetry]], or [[Standard English]] would have quite different content. Rhyming dictionaries are invaluable for [[historical linguistics]]; as they record pronunciation, they can be used to reconstruct pronunciation differences and similarities that are not necessarily reflected in spelling.

A simple [[reverse dictionary]], which collates words starting from the end, provides a rough rhyming dictionary to the extent that spelling follows pronunciation. However, a precise rhyming dictionary reflects pronunciation, not spelling.

== Online Rhyming Dictionaries ==

Today, there are many [[websites]] on the [[internet]] that provide the same function as rhyming dictionaries but online.

The '''Rotunda of the Winter Palace''' in [[St Petersburg]] is a circular hall in the northwest wing of the palace created for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] by the architect [[Auguste de Montferrand]].
Designed in a circular [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] temple style, it served as an anteroom, [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] and link between the more public state rooms of the palace and the more intimate rooms used by the Imperial family. The room is [[dome]]d and top lit by an [[oculus]].

The Rotunda was one of the many rooms destroyed by the Winter Palace fire of 1837.  It was rebuilt in near-original style, but with the addition of a gallery under the dome.

Today, the Rotunda is an exhibition hall of the [[State Hermitage Museum]].

The '''Royal Mint'''  is a government-owned mint that produces coins for the United Kingdom. Operating under the name ''Royal Mint Ltd,'' the mint is a [[limited company]] that is wholly owned by [[HM Treasury|Her Majesty's Treasury]] and is under an exclusive contract to supply all the nation's coinage. As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally, the mint also produces [[planchet]]s, [[commemorative coin]]s, various types of [[medal]]s and [[precious metal]] [[bullion]].&lt;ref name="RoyalMintAbout"&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Royal Mint|url=http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/|accessdate=25 August 2015|publisher=The Royal Mint|date=25 August 2015|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year, making up 70% of its total sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/factory-of-the-month-the-royal-mint/|title=Factory of the month: The Royal Mint|last=|first=|date=7 December 2012|website=|publisher=themanufacturer.com|access-date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed over 1,100 years ago, the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the [[Kingdom of England]], all of [[Great Britain]] and eventually most of the [[British Empire]]. The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor, was established in 886 AD and operated within the [[Tower of London]] for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called [[Royal Mint Court]] where it remained until the 1960s. As Britain followed the rest of the world in [[Decimalisation|decimalising]] its currency, the Mint moved from London to a new {{convert|38|acre}} plant in [[Llantrisant]], [[Wales]] where it has remained since.

In 2009 after recommendations for the mint to be privatised the Royal Mint ceased being an executive government agency and became a [[State-owned enterprise|state-owned company]] wholly owned by [[HM Treasury]]. Since then the mint has expanded its business interests by reviving its bullion trade and developing a £9 million visitor centre.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Alfred_den_store,_Nordisk_familjebok.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alfred_den_store,_Nordisk_familjebok.png|thumb|150x150px|Coin of [[Alfred the Great]]|alt=Drawing of a coin showing a portrait of Alfred the Great]]
The history of coins in [[Great Britain]] can be traced back to the second century BC when they were introduced by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes from across the [[English Channel]]. The first record of coins being minted in Britain is attributed to [[Kent]]ish tribes such as the [[Cantiaci|Cantii]] who around 80–60 B.C. imitated those of [[Marseille]] through [[casting]] instead of [[Hammered coinage|hammering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coinproject.com/jan/volume1/issue4/volume1-4-2.html|title=Britain's First Coins|last=Rudd|first=Chris|date=|website=|access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] began their [[Roman conquest of Britain|invasion of Britain]] in AD&amp;nbsp;43, they set up mints across the land, including in [[London]] which produced [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] for some 40 years before closing. A mint in London reopened briefly in 383&amp;nbsp;AD until closing swiftly as [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman rule in Britain]] came to an end. For the next 200 years no coins appear to have been minted in Britain until the emergence of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|English kingdoms]] in 650&amp;nbsp;AD when as many as 30 mints are recorded across Britain with one being established in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/history/the-royal-mint-story/index.html|title=The Royal Mint Story|website=Royal Mint|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control of Britain's mints alternated as different tribes battled over territory. In 886&amp;nbsp;AD [[Alfred the Great]] recaptured London from the [[Danelaw]] and began issuing silver pennies bearing his portrait;{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=3}} this is regarded as the start of the continuous history of the Royal Mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/3764|title=The Royal Mint|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Museums Victoria]]|access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 886 to 1805 ===
[[File:The_Tower_of_London_1647.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Tower_of_London_1647.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|The [[Tower of London]] in 1647|alt=1847 drawing of the Tower of London on the River Thames]]
In 1279, the country's numerous mints were unified under a single system whereby control was centralised to the mint within the [[Tower of London]], mints outside of London were reduced with only a few local and episcopals continuing to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C207|title=Records of the Royal Mint|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The National Archive]]|access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pipe rolls]] detailing the financial records&amp;nbsp;of the London mint show an expenditure of £729 17s 8½d and records of timber bought for workshops.

Individual roles at the mint were well established by 1464. The master-worker was charged with hiring engravers and the management of [[moneyer]]s, while the [[Warden of the Mint|mint warden]] was responsible for witnessing the delivery of dies. A specialist mint board was set up in 1472 to enact a 23 February indenture which vested the mint's responsibilities into three main roles; a [[Warden of the Mint|warden]], a [[Master of the Mint|master]] and&amp;nbsp;a [[comptroller]].

In the 16th century having suffering from the effects of the [[Black Death]], mainland [[Europe]] was in the middle of an [[economic expansion]], [[England]] however was suffering with financial difficulty brought on by excessive government spending. By the 1540s wars with [[France]] and [[Scotland]] led [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to enact [[The Great Debasement]] which saw the amount of precious metal in coin significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amrcoins.com/information-and-articles/the-testoons-of-henry-viii/|title=The Testoons of Henry VIII|last=|first=|date=|website=AMR Coins|access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further gather control of the country's currency, [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|monasteries]] were dissolved which effectively ended major coin production outside of London.

In 1603, the [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|union of Scotland and England]] under King [[James VI and I|James VI]] led to a partial union of both countries' currencies, the [[pound Scots]] and the [[pound sterling]]. Due to Scotland heavily debasing its silver coins, a Scots mark was worth just 13.5d compared to an English mark which was worth 6s 8d. To bridge the difference between the values, unofficial supplementary [[token coin]]s, often made from [[lead]] were made by unauthorised minters across the country. By 1612 there were 3,000 such unlicensed mints producing these tokens, none of whom paying anything towards the [[The Crown|crown]]. ''The Royal Mint'', not wanting to divert manpower away from minting more profitable [[gold]] and [[silver]], hired outside agent [[John Harington, 1st Baron Harington of Exton|Lord Harington]] who under licence started issuing [[copper]] [[Farthing (English coin)|farthings]] in 1613. Private licenses to mint these coins were revoked in 1644 which led traders to resume minting their own supplementary tokens. In 1672 the Royal Mint finally took over the production of copper coinage.

==== Civil War mints ====
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Half-crown of Charles I (State 2) 2.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] Civil War half-crown|alt=Drawing of the reverse and obverse of a Charles I Civil War half-crown coin]]
Prior to the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]], England signed a treaty in 1630 with [[Spain]] which ensured a steady supply of silver [[bullion]] to the [[Tower of London|Tower mint]]. Additional branch mints to aid the one in London were set up including one at [[Aberystwyth Castle]], in [[Wales]]. In 1642 [[parliament]] seized control of the Tower mint and after [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] tried to arrest the [[Five Members]] he was forced to flee London, establishing at least 16 emergency mints across the [[British Isles]] in [[Colchester]], [[Chester]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Dublin]], [[Exeter]], [[Salisbury]], parts of [[Cornwall]] including [[Truro]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Worcester]], [[York]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Newark, Peterborough|Newark]], [[Pontefract]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] (see also [[siege money]]).

After raising the royal standard in [[Nottingham]] marking the beginning of the war, Charles called upon [[Loyalism|loyalist]] mining engineer [[Thomas Bushell (mining engineer)|Thomas Bushell]], the owner of a mint and silver mine in [[Aberystwyth]], to move his operations to the royalist-held [[Shrewsbury]], possibly within in the grounds of [[Shrewsbury Castle]]. The mint there was however short-lived, operating for no more than three months before Charles ordered Bushell to relocate the mint to his headquarters in the royal capital of [[Oxford]]. The new Oxford mint was established on 15 December 1642 in [[New Inn Hall]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], the present site of [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St. Peter's College]]. There, silver plates and foreign coins were melted down and in some cases just hammered into shape to produce coins quickly. Bushell was appointed the mint's warden and master-worker, where he laboured alongside notable engravers [[Nicholas Briot]], [[Thomas Rawlins]] and [[Nicholas Burghers]], the later of whom being appointed Graver of Seals, Stamps and Medals in 1643. When [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] took control of Oxford that same year, Bushnell was ordered to move to [[Bristol Castle]] where he continued minting coins until it fell to parliamentary control on 11 September 1645, effectively ending Bushnell's involvement in the civil war mints.

In Southern England in November 1642 the king ordered royalist [[Parliament of England|MP]] [[Sir Richard Vyvyan, 1st Baronet|Richard Vyvyan]] to build one or more mints in [[Cornwall]] where he was instructed to mint coins from whatever bullion that could be obtained and deliver it to [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Ralph Hopton]], a commander of royalist troops in the region. Vyvyan built a mint in [[Truro]] and became its Master until 1646 when it was captured by [[Roundhead|parliamentarians]]. In nearby [[Exeter]] which had been under control of [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] since the beginning of the war, a mint was ordered to be set up after parliament debated the proposal on 8 December 1642. After approval was granted, a mint and moneyers were dispatched on 8 December 1642 to the town which was under constant threat of attack by [[Cavalier|loyalist]] troops. In September 1643 the town was captured by the [[Cornish Royalist Army]] led by [[Maurice of the Palatinate|Prince Maurice]] leading to Vyvyan moving his nearby mint in [[Truro]] to the now recaptured town. The exact location of the mint in [[Exeter]] is unknown, however maps from the time show a street named Old Mint Lane near Friernhay which was to be the site of a [[Great Recoinage of 1696|1696 Recoinage]] mint. Much less is known about the mint's employees with only Richard Vyvyan and clerk Thomas Hawkes recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/utilities/action/act_download.cfm?mediaid=29445&amp;langtoken=eng|title=Making a Mint?|last=Morgns|first=Geraint|date=December 1999|work=Country Quest|access-date=17 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831203640/http://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/utilities/action/act_download.cfm?mediaid=29445&amp;langtoken=eng|archive-date=2012-08-31|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France [[Hammered coinage|hammer stuck coins]] had been banned from the [[Monnaie de Paris|Paris Mint]] since 1639 and replaced with [[Milled coinage|milled]] coinage.{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=282}} After arriving, it wasn't until 9 May 1651 that his testing began in [[Drury House]], having first required permission from parliament.

In 1656 [[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] ordered engraver [[Thomas Simon]] to cut a series of dies featuring his [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] and for them to be minted using the new milled method. Few of Cromwell's coins entered circulation with Cromwell himself dying in 1658 and the Commonwealth collapsing two year later. Without Cromwell's backing of milled coinage, [[Peter Blondeau]] returned to France leaving England to continue minting hammer struck coins.

[[File:Sir_Isaac_Newton_1702.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Isaac_Newton_1702.jpg|thumb|249x249px|[[Isaac Newton]] in 1702|alt=Portrait of Isaac Newton from 1702]]
In 1662, after previous attempts to introduce [[milled coinage]] into Britain had failed, the restored monarch [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] recalled [[Peter Blondeau]] to establish a permanent machine-made coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Linecar|1985|pages=88–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Glyn|2010|p=888}} Despite the introduction of the newer, milled coins, like the old [[Hammered coinage|hammered coins]] they suffered heavily from counterfeiting and [[Methods of coin debasement|clipping]]. To combat this the text ''Decus et tutamen'' (An ornament and a safeguard) was added to some coin rims.&lt;ref name="Division1986"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=eq20AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=the+origin+of+the+process+is+attributed+to+%5B%5BIsaac+Newton%5D%5D,+after+being+appointed+%5B%5BMaster+of+the+Mint%5D%5D+%28charge+he+held&amp;dq=the+origin+of+the+process+is+attributed+to+%5B%5BIsaac+Newton%5D%5D,+after+being+appointed+%5B%5BMaster+of+the+Mint%5D%5D+%28charge+he+held&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mGS-VKGZKYOqU7HiguAH&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|title=Economic Progress Report|publisher=Information Division of the Treasury.|year=1986|author=Great Britain. Treasury. Information Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, which saw the ousting of [[James II of England|James II]] from power, parliament took over control of the mint from the [[The Crown|Crown]] which had up until then allowed the mint to act as an independent body producing coins on behalf of the government.

Under the patronage of [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], [[Isaac Newton]] became the mint's [[Warden of the Mint|warden]] in 1696. His role, intended to be a [[sinecure]], was taken seriously by Newton, who went about trying to combat the country's growing problems with counterfeiting. By this time, forgeries accounted for 10% of the country's coinage, [[Methods of coin debasement|clipping]] was commonplace and the value of silver in coins had surpassed their [[face value]]. [[William III of England|King William III]]&amp;nbsp;initiated the [[Great Recoinage of 1696]] whereby all coins were removed from circulation and enacted the [[Coin Act 1696]] making it [[high treason]] to own or possess [[counterfeit]]ing equipment.&amp;nbsp;Satellite mints to aid in the re-coinage were established in [[Bristol]], [[Chester]], [[Exeter]], [[Norwich]], and [[York]], with returned coins being valued by weight, not [[face value]].

The [[Acts of Union 1707]] united England and Scotland into one country, leading London to take over production of Scotland's currency and thus replacing Scotland's [[Pound Scots]] with the English [[Pound sterling|Pound Sterling]] which caused the Edinburgh mint to eventually close on 4 August 1710. As [[British Empire|Britain's empire]] continued to expand, so to was the need to supply its coinage. This along with the need for new mint machinery and cramped conditions within the [[Tower of London]], led to plans for the mint to move to nearby [[East Smithfield]].

=== 1805 to 1967 ===

==== Tower Hill ====
{{further information|Royal Mint Court}}
[[File:The Royal Mint, London (378803870).jpg|alt=Exterior of the Johnson Smirke Building in London|left|thumb|280x280px|Johnson Smirke Building in 2007]]
Located opposite from the Tower of London on Tower Hill, the new purpose-built mint began construction in 1805 and was completed by 1809. However it was not until 1812 that the move became official, when keys from the old mint were ceremoniously delivered to the Constable of the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/history/the-royal-mint-story/tower-hill/index.html|title=Tower Hill|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Mint|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the front of the site stood the Johnson Smirke Building whose [[namesake]] comes from its designer James Johnson and builder [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]. This building was flanked on both sides by gatehouses behind which another building housed the mint's new machinery. A number of other smaller buildings were also erected which housed mint officers and staff members. The entire site was protected by a boundary wall which was patrolled by the Royal Mint's military guard.

By 1856, the mint was beginning to prove inefficient, suffering from irregularities in minted coins' fineness and weight. Instructed by [[Prime Minister]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the Master of the Mint [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] was informed that unless the mint could raise its standards and become more economical it would be broken up and placed under management by contractors. Graham sought advice from German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] who in turn recommended his student [[George Frederick Ansell]] as being able to resolve the mint's issues. In a letter to the treasury dated 29 October 1856, Ansell was put forward as candidate and subsequently was awarded the role of temporary clerk on 12 November 1856 with a £120 a year salary.{{sfn|Ansell|1870|p=}}

Upon taking office, Ansell discovered that the weighing of metals at the mint was extremely loose. At the mint it had been the custom to weigh silver to within 0.5 ounces and gold to a pennyweight (0.05 ounces), however these standards meant losses were being made from overvalued metals. In one such case Ansell delivered 7920.00 ounces of gold to the mint where it was&amp;nbsp;weighed by an official at 7918.15 ounces, a difference of 1.85 ounces. Requesting a second weighing on more accurate scale, the bullion was certified to weigh 7919.98 ounces, far closer to the previous measurement which was off by 960 [[Grain (unit)|grains]]. To increase the accuracy of weights, more precise weighing equipment was ordered and specifications were revised to 0.10 ounce for silver and gold to 0.01oz. Between 1856 and 1866 the old scales were gradually removed and replaced with ones made by Messrs. De Grave, Short, and Fanner; winners of a [[1862 International Exhibition]] prize award for work relating to [[Weighing scale|balances]].{{sfn|Ansell|1870|p=}}

Another observation Ansell made was the loss of gold during the manufacturing process. He found that 15-20 ounces could be recovered through the sweep, that is the leftover burnt rubbish from the minting process which was often left in open boxes for many months before being removed. Wanting to account for every particle, he hypothesised that because the [[Conservation of mass]] meant it was physically impossible for gold to just disappear he put down the lost weight to a combination of [[oil]], [[dust]] and different types of foreign matter amongst the gold.

In 1859, the Royal Mint rejected a batch of gold that was found to be too brittle for the minting of gold sovereigns. Analysis revealed the presence of small amounts of [[antimony]], [[arsenic]] and [[lead]]. With Ansell's background in [[chemistry]], he persuaded the Royal Mint to allow him to experiment with the [[alloy]] and was ultimately able to produce 167,539 gold [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]].&lt;ref name="1859 'Ansell' Sovereign2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldsovereignexpert.com/coins/47/1859-Ansell-Gold-Sovereign/|title=1859 'Ansell' Sovereign|ref=harv|accessdate=8 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215090816/http://goldsovereignexpert.com/coins/47/1859-Ansell-Gold-Sovereign/|archivedate=15 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a second occasion in 1868, it was again discovered that gold coins, this time totalling £500,000 worth, were being produced with inferior gold. Although the standard practise at the mint was for rejected coins (known as brockages) to be melted down, many entered general circulation and the mint was forced to return thousands of ounces of gold to the [[Bank of England]]. Although Ansell offered to re-melt the substandard coins, his offer was rejected causing a row between him and senior mint chiefs which ultimately led to him being removed from his position at the mint.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;W.

==== Royal Mint Refinery ====
After relocating to its new home on Tower Hill, the Mint came under increased scrutiny of how it dealt with unrefined gold that had entered the country. Initially the [[Master of the Mint]] was responsible for overseeing the practise since the position's inception in the 1300s, however the refinery process proved too costly and suffered from a lack of accountability from the master. A [[Royal Commission]] later set up in 1848 to address these issues gave recommendation for the refinery process to be [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] to another external agency thereby removing the refining process from the mint's responsibilities. The opportunity to handle in Mint's refinery was taken up by [[Sir Anthony de Rothschild, 1st Baronet|Anthony de Rothschild]], a descendant of the [[Rothschild family]] and heir to the [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[investment banking]] company [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]]. Rothschild secured a lease from the government in January 1852, purchasing equipment and a premise adjacent to the Royal Mint on 19 Royal Mint Street under the name of ''Royal Mint Refinery''.

==== Colonial Expansion ====
[[File:The Royal Mint, Sydney 1888.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Royal Mint, Sydney in 1888|alt=Drawing of Sydney Royal Mint building in 1888]]
As Britain's influence as a [[Great power|world power]] expanded, with colonies being established abroad, a greater need for currency led to the Royal Mint opening satellite branches of itself overseas. In [[Australia]], the local Legislative Council petitioned the UK government to establish a branch of the Royal Mint in [[Sydney]] ([[Sydney Mint]]) after prospector [[Edward Hargraves]] discovered gold in [[Ophir, New South Wales|Ophir]], [[New South Wales]] in 1851. The petitioned gain [[royal assent]] in 1853 and plans were made by the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London to open the Royal Mint's first overseas branch within the colony. The Royal Mint's Superintendent of Coining travelled to Australia to oversee its establishment on [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] within the southern wing of [[Sydney Hospital]] where it opened in 1854. Its success led to the opening of [[Melbourne Mint]] on 2 June 1872 which cost £368,350 and [[Perth Mint]] which opened on 20 June 1899. In 1926 after operating for 72 years, the [[Sydney Mint]] closed due to its inferior technology and capabilities being superseded by those in Melbourne and Perth. After [[Federation of Australia|Australia was federalised]] in 1901, Great Britain continued to own the mints to as late as 1 July 1970, when they became statutory authorities of the [[Government of Western Australia]].

In [[Canada]], which had been under [[Canada under British rule|British rule]] since 1763, British coins circulated alongside those of other nations until 1858 when London started producing coins for the newly established [[Canadian dollar]]. As Canada developed, in 1890 calls were made for a mint to be built in [[Ottawa]] to facilitate the country's gold mines. The new mint opened on 2 January 1908 by [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] producing coins for circulation including [[Ottawa Mint sovereign|Ottawa Mint sovereigns.]] In 1931 under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the mint came under the control on the [[Government of Canada]] and subsequently renamed the [[Royal Canadian Mint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Ottawa30.html|title=Ontario's Historical Plaques|last=|first=|date=|website=ontarioplaques.com|access-date=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:HongKong-1Dollar-1867.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong silver dollar (1867)|alt=Obverse and reverse of an 1867 silver Hong Kong dollar coin]]A fifth branch of the Royal Mint was established in [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[India]] on 21 December 1917 as part of a wartime effort.

As South Africa began cutting ties with Britain, the mint closed on 30 June 1941 only to be later reopened as the [[South African Mint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southcapecoins.co.za/news/the-history-of-the-south-african-mint/|title=The History of the South African Mint|last=|first=|date=|website=southcapecoins.co.za|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although just six mints were officially controlled by London's Royal Mint, many more independent mints were set up to facilitate parts of the [[British Empire]]. In [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]] the [[British Columbia gold rushes]] led to a mint being set up in 1862 under Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] where it produced a few gold and silver coins before being shut down in 1862 to aid the city of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in becoming the regions [[Capital city|provincial capital]].{{sfn|Hainsworth|2005|p=148}} On 26 February 1864 an Order of Council requested for the founding of independent mint ([[Hong Kong Mint]]) in [[British Hong Kong]] to issue silver and bronze coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/History/en_US/web/mh/publications/spa_pspecial_02_01.html|title=Hong Kong Currency|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]]|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11029|title=Royal Mint: Branch Mints |last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mint was short lived however due to its coins being heavy debasement causing significant losses. The site was sold to [[History of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.|Jardine Matheson]] in 1868 and the mint machinery sold to the Japanese Mint in [[Osaka]].{{sfn|Ingham|2007|p=70}}

[[New Zealand]]'s [[New Zealand one-dollar coin|$1]] and [[New Zealand two-dollar coin|$2]] coins are minted by the Royal Mint in the United Kingdom. The 10 cent, 20 cent and 50 cent coins are minted by the Royal Canadian Mint. Other mints the Bank has used over time include: the Royal Australian Mint, Norwegian Mint and the South African Mint Company. The F4 Coin mintings data has details about the number and value of coin mintages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/notes-and-coins/coins/history-of-new-zealand-coinage|title=The history of coins in New Zealand|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1914 to 1967 ====
In 1914 as war broke out in Europe, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]] instructed for gold coins to be removed from circulation so as to help pay for the war effort. The government started to issue £1 and 10 shilling treasury notes as replacement paving the way for Britain leaving the gold standard in 1931.
[[File:Royal Mint Reducing Machine.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Engraving room at the Royal Mint in 1934|alt=Engraving room at the Royal Mint in 1934]]
From 1928, the [[Irish Free State]] (later Republic of Ireland) issued its own [[Coins of the Republic of Ireland|coins]]. These were produced by the Royal Mint until Ireland established its own [[Currency Centre]] in Dublin in 1978.

During World War II the Mint played an important role in ensuring that people were paid for their services with [[hard currency]] rather than banknotes. Under [[Operation Bernhard]], the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] planned to collapse the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British economy]] by flooding the country with forged notes leading the [[Bank of England]] to stop issuing banknotes of £10 and above. To meet these demands the Mint doubled its output so that by 1943 it was minting around 700 million coins a year despite being under constant threat of being bombed. The Deputy Master of the Mint John Craig recognised the dangers to the Mint, introduced a number of measures to ensure the Mint could continue to operate in the event of a disaster. Craig added emergency water supplies, reinforced the Mint's basement to act as an [[air-raid shelter]] and even accepted employment of women for the first time. For most of the war the mint managed to escape the destruction of [[the Blitz]] until December 1940 when three members of staff were killed in an [[Airstrike|air-raid]]. Around the same time an auxiliary mint was set up at [[Pinewood Studios]] which had been requisitioned for the war effort. Staff and machinery from Tower Hill were moved to the site in [[Buckinghamshire]] where it started production in June 1941 and operated for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Beardon|2013|p=177}}{{sfn|Challis|1992|p=579}} Over the course of the war the Royal Mint was hit on several different occasions and at one point was put out of commission for three weeks. As technology changed with the introduction of electricity and demand continuing to grow, the process of rebuilding continued so that by the 1960s little of the original mint remained, apart from Smirke's 1809 building and its gatehouses at the front.

On 1 March 1966 the government announced its intention for the pound to be [[Decimalisation|decimalised]] which would require a large-scale withdrawal and minting of millions of new coins, this, as well as commitments to overseas customers, meant the mint was to be faced with a heavy workload. Lack of space at the mint and with [[Decimal Day]] looming it became apparent that the mint needed to again relocate to a larger site. With a degree of urgency plans were made in April 1967 for a new site to be built outside of London, although over twenty sites were considered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/mar/26/royal-mint#column_1661|title=Royal Mint|last=Pearson|first=Arthur|date=26 March 1970|website=[[Hansard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717050847/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/mar/26/royal-mint#column_1661|archive-date=2009-07-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the small [[Wales|Welsh]] town of [[Llantrisant]] located {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} north-west of [[Cardiff]] was chosen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/discover/decimalisation/a-new-royal-mint|title=A New Royal Mint|last=|first=|date=|website=The Royal Mint|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until now improvements at the Tower Hill mint had cost £800,000.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Work on the new mint began in August 1967 with the construction of a [[Planchet|blank]] treatment plant and plant for striking. This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1968 by the royal attendance of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] and their son [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|Investiture of Prince Charles]] as the [[Prince of Wales]]; however, such protests failed to materialise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmyFMW4-DU8|title=Queen Opens New Mint (1968)|publisher=[[Pathé News]]|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process. Upon completion the final cost for the land, buildings and plant&amp;nbsp;came to £8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1970/mar/17/royal-mint-move#S5CV0798P0_19700317_CWA_14|title=Royal Mint (Move)|last=Taverne|first=Dick|date=17 March 1970|website=[[Hansard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717050720/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1970/mar/17/royal-mint-move#S5CV0798P0_19700317_CWA_14|archive-date=2009-07-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin, a gold sovereign, was struck in London in November 1975. In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin-related acts, the ''[[Coinage Act 1971|Coinage Act of 1971]]'' was passed, which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of [[Master of the Mint]]. Under this act, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] took over the role, with a Deputy Master being appointed by the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to exercise all the powers and duties of the Master within the mint.

==== Financial Difficulties ====
After moving to Wales, the mint struggled to become profitable as the Western world fell into a [[1973–75 recession|deep recession]] during the early 1970s. To combat a rising national debt, the mint was established as a [[trading fund]] on 1 April 1975 which required it to become self-financing. This measure proved successful and the mint started to become profitable through heavy exports.To allow for more financial freedom and better management the mint became an Executive Agency in April 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/apr/02/royal-mint#S6CV0170P0_19900402_CWA_45|title=HC Deb 02 April 1990 vol 170 cc390-1W|last=|first=|date=|website=Hansard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710034211/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/apr/02/royal-mint#S6CV0170P0_19900402_CWA_45|archive-date=2009-07-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 global financial crisis]], a [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|rescue package]] costing £500 billion was announced to help stabilise Britain's banking system. This led to fear that the government would attempt to finance the cost by selling off state-owned organisations. In a 2009 pre-budget report the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Alistair Darling]] stated that the treasury would "explore the potential benefits of alternative future models for the Royal Mint".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/privatisation-royal-mint-llantrisant-rolls-2118375|title=Privatisation of Royal Mint at Llantrisant rolls closer|last=Blake|first=Aled|date=17 March 2009|work=[[Wales Online]]|access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A month later in his [[2009 United Kingdom budget]] he recommended that the mint be made a company with a view of it being sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/22/budget-public-sector-jobs-risk|title=Budget 2009: Thousands of public sector jobs at risk|last=Bawden|first=Anna|date=22 April 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was met with outrage by unions and opposition parties in parliament who called it the "selling off the family silver" and that it would result in jobs losses. In contrast, the chief executive of the mint Andrew Stafford welcomed the decision stating that it would lead to further growth and secure the future of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8011331.stm|title=Royal Mint privatisation closer|last=|first=|date=21 April 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2009, rather than being fully privatised, the mint ceased to be an [[executive agency]] and its assets vested in a [[limited company]], ''Royal Mint Ltd''. The owner of the new company became The Royal Mint trading fund, which itself continued to be owned by [[HM Treasury]]. As its sole shareholder the mint pays an annual dividend of £4 million to treasury with the remaining profits being reinvested into the mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/24/royal-mint-makes-mint|title=Royal Mint Makes a Mint … Again|last=Kollewe|first=Julia|date=24 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] announced a £20 billion [[Privatization|privatisation]] drive to raise funds with the ''Royal Mint'' being up for sale alongside other institutions including the [[Met Office]] and [[Companies House]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/34b153b6-75e9-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a|title=Green Investment Bank bidders ready final offer|last=Pickard, Plimmer|first=Jim, Gill|date=11 September 2016|work=[[Financial Times]]|access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Revival ====
With its new found financial freedom the Mint begun diversifying their product range through expanding to offer items outside their usual coin-related merchandise. By the early 2000s the Mint was selling different types of jewellery, commemorative plates and figurines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/~/media/Files/AnnualReports/ar200102.pdf|title=Royal Mint Annual Report 2001-02|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Royal Mint|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613074520/http://www.royalmint.com/~/media/Files/AnnualReports/ar200102.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually creating its own ''Royal Mint Classics'' range of collectable goods. This part of the business proved popular in attracting new customers however suffered from poor product development. Example of its products included a [[hip flask]] with an embedded [[Two pounds (British coin)|£2 coin]], an [[Edinburgh Crystal]] clock combined with a [[Five pounds (British coin)|millennium Crown]], and a [[Wedgwood]] plate featuring [[Britannia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/~/media/Files/AnnualReports/ar19992000.pdf|title=Royal Mint Annual Report 1999 -2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Royal Mint|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331181932/http://www.royalmint.com/~/media/Files/AnnualReports/ar19992000.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Mint decided to resume its focus on coins, downsizing non-coin related business and discontinuing its Classics range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/~/media/Files/AnnualReports/ar200708.pdf|title=The Royal Mint Annual Report 2007-08|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Royal Mint|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330004630/http://www.royalmint.com/~/media/Files/AnnualReports/ar200708.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to securing the medal product contract, the mint held a competition to design a series of commemorative [[Fifty pence (British coin)|fifty pence coins]] that would enter general circulation prior to the event. The Mint received over 30,000 entries with a further 17,000 from a children's competition on [[Blue Peter]]. In all, a total of 29 designs featuring a sport were selected by the Mint, with the youngest designer being just 9 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11527266|title=London 2012 Olympic 50p coins go into circulation|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=1 July 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A £2 coin commemorating London's handover to Rio was also released in 2012.

==== The Royal Mint Experience ====
In April 2014 the mint announced plans for the development of a visitor centre in Llantrisant where members of the public could take part in a guided tour of the facility and learn about the mint's history. The development's contract, estimated to be worth £7.7 million was awarded to construction firm ISG and design consultant Mather &amp; Co who had previously designed the [[Norwegian Olympic Museum]], as well as a handful of visitor attractions for sporting clubs including [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea F.C]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City F.C]], [[FC Porto]] and the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/royal-mint-appoints-design-consultancy-9034558|title=The Royal Mint appoints design consultancy for its £7.5m interactive museum|last=Barry|first=Sion|date=13 April 2015|work=[[Wales Online]]|access-date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matherandco.com/work/|title=Mather &amp; Co - Our Work|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=matherandco.com|access-date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fund the development, a grant of £2.3 million was provided by the [[Welsh Government]] towards the attraction which aimed to attract 200,000 visitors a year to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/news/the-royal-mint-announces-plans-for-first-visitor-centre|title=The Royal Mint announces plans for first visitor centre|last=|first=|date=24 April 2014|website=The Royal Mint|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2016, two years after its announcement the now named ''Royal Mint Experience'' opened to the public at a final cost of £9 million.

==== Recent Events ====
In the same month the mint took in 48 tonnes of silver&amp;nbsp;recovered from the shipwreck of the [[SS Gairsoppa]] which was used to produce limited edition coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/royal-mint-takes-delivery-48-6916447|title=Royal Mint takes delivery of 48 tonnes of silver salvaged from site of WWII shipwreck|last=Evans|first=Carrie|date=4 April 2014|work=Wales Online|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, after nearly 50 years, the mint began producing its own line of [[bullion]] bars and [[Bullion coin|coins]] under its revived ''Royal Mint Refinery'' brand. Then in 2016, the mint announced plans for [[Royal Mint Gold]] (RMG), a [[digital gold currency]]  that uses [[blockchain]] to trade and invest in [[gold]]. Operated by [[CME Group]], the technology is to be created by technology companies [[AlphaPoint]] and [[BitGo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-blockchain-gold-idUKKBN17D2RL|title=CME Group, Royal Mint test blockchain-based gold trading platform|date=11 April 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]|last1=Anna|first1=Irrera|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system currency which was due to launch in 2017 will be on the [[gold standard]], whereby one RMG token equates to 1 gram of physical gold held within in a Royal Mint vault. Up to $1 billion worth of RMG is set to be issued by the mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2017-cme-group-uk-royal-mint-detail-plans-blockchain-gold/|title=Consensus 2017: CME Group, UK Royal Mint Detail Plans for Blockchain Gold|date=23 May 2017|publisher=[[CoinDesk]]|last1=Castor|first1=Amy|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
=== Coin production ===
As the sole body responsible for minting [[legal tender]] coins in the United Kingdom under contract from [[HM Treasury]], the mint produces all of the country's physical currency apart from banknotes which are printed by the [[Bank of England]]. On average it produces 2 billion [[pound sterling]] coins struck for general circulation every year with an estimated 28 billion pieces circulating altogether. Outside of the UK, the mint provides services to over 60 different countries including New Zealand and many [[Caribbean]] nations in the form of producing national currencies or supplying ready to strike [[planchet]]s.&lt;ref name="RoyalMintAbout"/&gt; In 2015 it was estimated that 2.4 billion coins were minted for overseas countries outweighing that of domestic coinage and providing over 60% of the mint's revenue from circulating currencies. The sale of commemorative coins also form part of the mint's operations with coins of varying quality and made of different precious metals released yearly for the collector's market.

=== Bullion ===
[[File:Royal Mint Refinery Logo.svg|thumb|150x150px|Royal Mint Refinery Seal|alt=Seal of the Royal Mint Refinery]]Another important operation performed by the mint which contributes to half the mint's revenue is the sale of [[bullion]] to investors or general members of the public in the form of [[Gold bar|bars]] or [[Bullion coin|coins]]. Historically the mint has refined its own metal, however under the advice of an 1848 Royal Commission the process was separated with the independent ''Royal Mint Refinery'' being purchased and operated by [[Sir Anthony de Rothschild, 1st Baronet|Anthony de Rothschild]] in 1852. The [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] family continued the refinery's management until it was sold to [[Engelhard]] in 1967, a year later the Royal Mint relocated to Wales and ceased their bullion bar interests until reviving the brand in 2015. Bullion bars produced by the mint are stamped with the original Royal Mint Refinery emblem and come in a range of different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.royalmint.com/gold-bars-royal-mint-refinery/|title=Gold bars now available from The Royal Mint|last=Oliver|first=Dan|date=21 January 2015|website=The Royal Mint|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins were released almost every year alongside [[Proof coinage|proof]] versions up to 1982 when production was discontinued. In 1987 the mint started to produce a new type of bullion coin, the 1oz [[Britannia (coin)|Britannia]] coin which was gold and had a face value of £100. A silver version with a face value of £2 was also released in 1997. Production of the previously discontinued sovereign and half sovereigns resumed in 2000. In 2014 a lunar coin series begun being minted annually in celebration of [[Lunar New Year]] and in 2016 a series featuring [[The Queen's Beasts]] began.

=== Medals ===
On occasion, the mint produces medals for government departments and under private contract for clients such as Royal societies, colleges and universities. Most notably the mint has made [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] medals as well as many military honours including the [[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]] and the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Cross]] for the [[British Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.royalmint.com/a-badge-of-honour-our-pride-in-making-medals-at-the-royal-mint/|title=A badge of honour – our pride in making medals at The Royal Mint|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Mint Blog|access-date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] the mint won a contract to produce 4,700 gold, silver and bronze medals for competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/london-olympics-business/8207463/London-2012-Olympics-Royal-Mint-wins-contract-to-make-medals.html|title=London 2012 Olympics: Royal Mint wins contract to make medals|last=Ruddick|first=Graham|date=16 December 2010|work=The Telegraph|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1851, the making of medals at the mint was at the discretion of engravers who could undertake the work independently and receive and additional wage. A Royal patent which was issued in 1669 granted the mint the sole right to produce medals of any metal which bore a portrait of a monarch. Engravers would use the facilities at the mint to make commemorative medals to their own design for sale. A key date in the mint's history of producing medals for the military is 1815 when the [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the beginning of awarding military campaign medals. By 1874 the mint was responsible for making all bars and clasps for war medals in the country and was making campaign medals such as the [[New Zealand Medal]], the [[Abyssinian War Medal]] and the [[Ashantee Medal]].&lt;ref name="medals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Mint: Medals|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11028|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archive]]|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], military medals were manufactured by the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and private contractors, however in 1922 a new medal unit created by the mint became the sole manufacturer of all Royal and State medals and decorations in metal, except the [[Victoria Cross]] which is made by [[Hancocks &amp; Co]].&lt;ref name="medals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hancocks-london.com/the-victoria-cross/|title=Victoria Cross|last=|first=|date=|website=hancocks-london.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924230657/https://www.hancocks-london.com/the-victoria-cross/|archive-date=2017-09-24|dead-url=yes|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2010, all British military medals were made by the mint however now must compete with other manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Trial of the Pyx==
The [[Trial of the Pyx]] is the procedure in the United Kingdom for ensuring that newly-[[Mint (coin)|minted]] [[British coinage|coins]] conform to required standards. The trials have been held since the twelfth century, normally once per calendar year, and continue to the present day. The form of the ceremony has been essentially the same since 1282. They are [[trial (law)|trials]] in the full judicial sense, presided over by a judge with an expert jury of [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]]s. Since 1871, the trials have taken place at the Hall of the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], having previously taken place at the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="goldsmiths"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trial of the Pyx|url=http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/trial.htm|accessdate=2 September 2008|publisher=The Goldsmiths' Company|year=2004|work=The Goldsmiths' Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given modern production methods, it is unlikely that coins would not conform, although this has been a problem in the past as it would have been tempting for the [[Master of the Mint]] to steal [[precious metals]].

The term "Pyx" refers to the [[boxwood (genus)|boxwood]] chest (in [[Greek language|Greek]], πυξίς, ''pyxis'') in which coins were placed for presentation to the jury. There is also a Pyx Chapel (or Pyx Chamber) in [[Westminster Abbey]], which was once used for secure storage of the Pyx and related articles.

Coins to be tested are drawn from the regular production of The Royal Mint. The Deputy Master of the Mint must, throughout the year, randomly select several thousand sample coins and place them aside for the Trial. These must be in a certain fixed proportion to the number of coins produced. For example, for every 5,000 bimetallic coins issued, one must be set aside, but for silver [[Maundy money]] the proportion is one in 150.

The trial today consists of an inquiry independent of the royal mint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/history/history-of-the-royal-mint/trial-of-the-pyx/index.html|title=Trial of the Pyx|website=[[Royal Mint Museum]]|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury is composed of [[Freedom of the Company|Freemen]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Company of Goldsmiths]], who assay the coins provided to decide whether they have been minted within the criteria determined by the relevant Coinage Acts.&lt;ref name="royal mint 3"&gt;{{cite web

'''Substrate''' is used in a converting process such as [[printing]] or coating to generally describe the base material onto which, e.g. [[image]]s, will be printed.  Base materials may include:
* plastic films or foils, 
* [[release liner]]
* [[textile]]s, 
* plastic containers
* any variety of [[paper]] (lightweight, heavyweight, coated, uncoated, paperboard, cardboard, etc.), or 
* [[parchment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8908">[[Image:Tartaloren irudikapena.jpg|thumb|250px|Tartalo, in the Izenaduba Basoa amusement park in [[Mungia]] ([[Biscay]]).]]
'''Tartaro''', '''Tartalo''', or '''Torto''' in [[Basque mythology]], is an enormously strong one-eyed [[giant (mythology)|giant]] very similar to the Greek [[Cyclops]] that [[Ulysseus|Ulysses]] faced in Homer's [[Odyssey]]. He is said to live in caves in the mountains and catches young people in order to eat them; in some accounts he eats sheep also. 

'''Alarabi''' is another name for the creature. '''Anxo''' (or '''Ancho''') may also be equivalent, but some sources say this is another name for the [[Basajaun]].

==Names==
Tartaro (or Tartaroa&lt;ref name=cerquand1/&gt;) is the form given in some translated tales and commentary in French and English{{Efn|[[Julien Vinson]] and [[Wentworth Webster]], who were collaborators.}}{{sfnp|Webster|1877|pp=1–16}}{{sfnp|Vinson|1883|pp=46, 46–53}}

Torto, Anxo and Alarabi{{Efn|Alarabi is a form seen in [[Biscay]]{{cn|date=October 2017}}.}} were the forms listed in [[Jose Migel Barandiaran]]'s ''Basque Mythology'',{{sfnp|Barandiaran|2009|p=92}} with "Tartalo" described as a local variant particular to the Cegama ([[Zegama]]) region.{{sfnp|Barandiaran|2009|p=92}} Tartalo being a proper name was an idia floated by Barandiaran;{{sfnp|Barandiaran|1973|p=27}} but here is an example of a tale in which three Tartaros appear.{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=3}}

Anxo or Ancho is however explained as an alternate name for [[Basajaun]] by some sources.&lt;ref name=gran-enc-anxo/&gt;{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=47}} Webster ventured that "Ancho" derived from "Sancho".{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=47}}

==Origins==
Tartaro has been described as the Basque equivalent to the cyclops [[Polyphemus]],&lt;ref name=cerquand3/&gt;{{sfnp|Barandiaran|1973|p=27}} and similarity to this cyclops in Homer's ''Odyssey'' is compelling,{{sfnp|Barandiaran|2009|p=92}} however direct derivation from Homeric sources may not be necessarily involved,{{sfnp|Barandiaran|1973|p=27}} since parallels to these can be found worldwide.{{sfnp|Webster|1877|pp=1–2}}&lt;ref name=crooke&gt;{{citation|last=Crooke |first=W. |title=Some notes on Homeric Folk-lore |journal=Publications of the Folklore Society |volume=62 |year= |pages=168–169, 172–173 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fl8lOckzYd4C&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier |title=Basque Mythology: History of the myths and deities of the Basque Mythology |location=Euskadi Public Reading Network |edition=2018 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Basque_Mythology_History_of_the_myths_and_deities_?id=vlpZDwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{illm|Jean-François Cerquand{{!}}Cerquand|fr|Jean-François Cerquand}} suggested that name "Tartaro"{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Or "Tartaroa"&lt;ref name=cerquand1/&gt;}} derived from the [[Tartar people]], just as the word "ogre" derived from "Hungarians",{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=1}}&lt;ref name=cerquand3/&gt; but [[Wentworth Webster]] agreed, though he expressed some doubt.{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=1}}

==Characteristics==
Tartaro according to foltale tradition is a huge, one-eyed being,{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=1}} are usually cave-dwelling, capturing young folk or those who sought shelter in his cave, and devouring them.{{sfnp|Barandiaran|2009|p=92}} In one oral account, the Tartaro ate one whole sheep each day.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. D'Abbadie's version", narrated by the Abbé Heguiagaray of the parish of Esquiule in La Soule)", {{harvp|Webster|1877|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
A mystical ring is a common theme in the Tartalo/Tartaro tales.{{sfnp|Barandiaran|1973|p=27}} In one version, the Tartaro (a prince turned monster who needed a bride to turn back) makes a gift of a ring to a girl, and it turns out to be a "talking ring"; she cuts off her finger to rid herself of it, and the monster.{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=4}} Webster noted this ring motif had its parallel in the Celtic (Scottish Gaelic) ''[[Conall Cra Bhuidhe]]'' ("Conall Yellowclaw"), published by [[John Francis Campbell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Webster|1877}}, p. 4, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt; but none to be found in classical sources.{{sfnp|Webster|1877|p=3}}

The motif of the hero blinding Tartaro has both a classical and Celtic (Irish) parallel: Oddyseus blinding the cyclops Polyphemus in Homer's ''Odyssey'' and [[Lugh|Lug]] hurling a spear or projectile into the eye of [[Balor]].&lt;ref name=crooke/&gt;

==Story==
One day, while two brothers of the ''Antimuño'' [[baserri]] were hunting, a [[storm]] broke, so they decided to take refuge from the rain in a cave, which was Tartalo's cave. Soon after, Tartalo appeared with his flock of sheep.  He saw the two brothers and said: "one for today and the other for tomorrow".

That same day he cooked and ate the eldest one, and then, he went to sleep.  While he was sleeping, the youngest brother stole Tartalo's ring and then he stuck the roasting spit in his only eye. Tartalo was [[Blindness|blind]], but not dead yet.

He started to look for the boy among his [[sheep]], but he put on a sheep's skin and escaped from Tartalo. But, unluckily, when he got out of the flock of sheep, the accuser ring started to shout: "Here I am, here I am!".

Tartalo got out of his cave and he started to run after the ring, hearing its shouts. The young one wasn't able to take off the ring, so, when he arrived to the edge of a cliff, he cut off his finger, and since Tartalo was near, he decided to throw it down the cliff. Tartalo, following the ring's shouting, fell off the cliff.

'''''The Muppet Movie''''' is a 1979 [[Musical film|musical]] [[Road movie|road]] [[comedy film]] and the first theatrical film featuring [[the Muppets]]. Directed by [[James Frawley]] and produced by [[Jim Henson]], the film's screenplay was conceived by ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' writers [[Jerry Juhl]] and [[Jack Burns]]. An [[Co-production (media)|American and British venture]] produced by [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] and [[ITC Entertainment]] between the first half and the second half of ''The Muppet Show'''s [[List of The Muppet Show episodes|third season]], the film depicts [[Kermit the Frog]] as he embarks on a cross-country trip to [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. Along the way, he encounters several of the Muppets—who all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show business—while being pursued by Doc Hopper, an evil [[restaurateur]] with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his [[frog legs]] business.

In addition  to the Muppet performers, the film stars [[Charles Durning]] and [[Austin Pendleton]], and features cameo appearances by [[Dom DeLuise]], [[James Coburn]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Mel Brooks]], among others. Notable for its [[surreal humour]], [[meta-reference]]s and prolific use of [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s, ''The Muppet Movie'' was released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 1979, and in the United States on June 22, 1979, and received critical praise; including two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Kenneth Ascher]]'s [[Film score|musical score]] and their song, "[[Rainbow Connection|The Rainbow Connection]]". In 2009, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

The success of ''The Muppet Movie'' led to several other feature films starring the Muppets: ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981), ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (1984), ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992), ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996), ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (1999),  ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' (2011), and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (2014).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS.--&gt;

It all starts when [[Kermit the Frog]] enjoys a relaxing afternoon in a [[Florida]] swamp, strumming his banjo and singing "[[Rainbow Connection|The Rainbow Connection]]", when he is approached by a [[Hollywood]] [[talent agent]] named Bernie  ([[Dom DeLuise]]) who encourages Kermit to pursue a career in show business. Inspired by the idea of "making millions of people happy", Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to [[Los Angeles]], but is soon pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper ([[Charles Durning]]) and his shy assistant Max ([[Austin Pendleton]]) in an attempt to convince Kermit to be the new spokesman of Hopper's struggling [[Deep frying|French-fried]] [[frog legs]] restaurant franchise, to Kermit's disgust. As Kermit continuously declines his offers, Hopper resorts to increasingly vicious means of persuasion.

Meeting [[Fozzie Bear]], who works as a hapless comedian in the El Sleezo Cafe, Kermit invites Fozzie to accompany him. The two set out in a 1951 [[Studebaker Champion|Studebaker]] loaned to Fozzie by his hibernating uncle. The duo's journey includes misadventures which introduce them to a variety of eccentric human and Muppet characters, including [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem|Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]] and their manager [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], who receives a copy of the script from the pair (one of a number of self-references) at an old Presbyterian [[Church (building)|church]]; [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], who works as a [[Plumbing|plumber]], and his girlfriend [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]]; [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]], who runs after them after they mistakenly think that he has turned them down at a [[used car]] lot; and the immediately love-stricken [[Miss Piggy]] at a [[fair]].

While Kermit and Miss Piggy form a relationship over dinner that night, Doc Hopper and Max do a surprise attack to Miss Piggy and use her as bait to lure Kermit into a trap. Using an electronic cerebrectomy device, scientist Professor Krassman ([[Mel Brooks]]) decides to brainwash Kermit in an attempt to force Kermit to perform in Doc's [[television advertisement|commercials]] until an infuriated Miss Piggy knocks out Doc Hopper's henchmen and causes the scientist to be brainwashed by his own device. After receiving a job offer, however, she promptly abandons a devastated Kermit.

Having been joined by [[Rowlf the Dog]] and reunited with Miss Piggy, the Muppets continue their journey to Hollywood. Fozzie's [[1941 Ford|1946 Ford]] [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]] station wagon trade-in breaks down in the [[New Mexico]] desert. He then comes across [[Big Bird]], who tells him he's on his way so he can act in a [[Television show|television program]] in New York. During a campfire that night, the group sadly considers that they may miss the audition the next day, and Kermit wanders off, ashamed of himself for seemingly bringing his friends on a fruitless journey. Upon consulting a more optimistic vision of himself, Kermit remembers that it was not just his friends' belief in the dream that brought them this far, but also his own faith in himself. Reinvigorated, he returns to camp to find that the Electric Mayhem and Scooter have read the script in advance, and arrived to help them the rest of the way.

Just as it seems they are finally on their way, the group is warned by Max that Doc Hopper has hired an [[Assassination|assassin]] named Snake Walker to kill Kermit. Kermit decides he will not be hunted down by a bully any longer and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby [[ghost town]] occupied by [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] and his assistant [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]], who invent materials that have yet to be tested. While confronting Hopper, Kermit explains his motivations, attempting to appeal to Hopper's own hopes and dreams, but Hopper is unmoved and orders his henchmen to kill him and all his friends. They are saved only when one of Dr. Bunsen's inventions, "insta-grow" pills, temporarily turns [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] (the Electric Mayhem’s drummer) into a giant, causing Hopper and his men to flee while Max turns around, laughs gleefully and waves his hat at the Muppets.

The Muppets proceed to Hollywood, and after getting by his secretary, Miss Tracy ([[Cloris Leachman]]), via causing her [[Allergy|allergic]] reactions to their [[dander]] and [[fur]], are hired by producer and studio executive Lew Lord ([[Orson Welles]]). The Muppets attempt to make their first movie involving a surreal pastiche of their experiences. The first take goes awry when Gonzo, holding pastiche versions of the balloons he flew away on earlier, crashes into the rainbow, breaking it in half and sending it falling onto the rest of the set, bringing it down as well, then Crazy Harry pulls two levers in the control room, which overloads the electricity circuits and causes enough of an explosion to blow a hole in the roof of the studio. However, in their stunned silence of the whole chain of events, a [[rainbow]] suddenly shines through the hole into the studio right onto the Muppets. The Muppets, joined by Big Bird, [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Bert and Ernie|Ernie and Bert]], [[Grover]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[Herry Monster]], [[Count von Count]], [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Little Bird]], [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Biff and Sully]], [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Gladys the Cow]], [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]], [[Two-Headed Monster]], and others sing the final verses of "The Rainbow Connection."

==Production==
The main obstacle the filmmakers were faced with during the development of ''The Muppet Movie'' was whether the Muppets would transition seamlessly from television to film. In 1978, director [[James Frawley]], [[Jim Henson]], and [[Frank Oz]] filmed several camera tests outside [[London]] to test how the characters would appear in real-world locations.&lt;ref name=Frawley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roessner|first1=Beth|title=First 'Muppets' director recalls original|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/21/first-muppets-director-jim-frawley/6715775/|accessdate=September 5, 2014|work=USA Today|date=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To perform Kermit static on a log, Henson squeezed into a specially designed metal container complete with an air hose (to breathe), a rubber sleeve which came out of the top to perform Kermit and a monitor to see his performance, and placed himself under the water, log, and the Kermit puppet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swansburg|first=John|title=Muppet Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/jim-henson-the-biography-by-brian-jay-jones.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also assisted in this operation by [[Kathryn Mullen]] and [[Steve Whitmire]]. This scene took five days to film.

Before this, no film had a hand puppet act with its entire body appearing on-screen. That is, hand puppets were only seen from the waist up, and it became a major plot point to show Kermit with legs. To have Kermit ride a bicycle in a full-body shot, a Kermit puppet with legs was posed onto the seat and his legs and arms were attached to the pedals and handlebars. An overhead crane with a marionette system held the bicycle through strong strings invisible to the camera, guiding the bicycle forward. The crane and system was out of the camera's frame of vision.&lt;ref name=Frawley/&gt;

Other shots required Muppets standing and acting in a full-body shot. Specially-made, remote-controlled puppets were placed on the set and controlled by puppeteers out of the frame. A dancing Kermit and [[Fozzie Bear]] were operated by Henson and [[Frank Oz]] in front of a blue screen, and were composited onto a separate reel of the stage. Both of these effects and the bicycle effect would be used again, and refined, in subsequent Muppet films.

[[Austin Pendleton]] recalled that the film was shot on "a very unhappy set, because Jim [Frawley] was very unhappy directing that movie. And I noticed that was the only time the Muppet people used an outside person to direct a Muppet movie. They never did that again. After that, it was either [[Jim Henson]] or [[Frank Oz]]. And I would have liked to have been in one of those, because those sets were very harmonious. But this was not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/austin-pendleton,31009/ |title=Austin Pendleton &amp;#124; Film &amp;#124; Random Roles |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming locations included [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="NMex"&gt;{{cite book|title=100 years of filmmaking in New Mexico 1898–1998 |publisher=New Mexico Dept. of Tourism|year=1998|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing reprise of "Rainbow Connection" featured a crowd of more than 250 Muppet characters—virtually every Muppet that had been created up to that point in time. According to Henson Archivist Karen Falk: "137 puppeteers were enlisted from the Puppeteers of America (along with the regular Muppet performers) to perform every Muppet extant. Prior to the day-long filming of the shot, [[Jim Henson]] gave the enthusiastic participants a lesson in the art of cinematic puppetry. Amazingly, it did take just one day." The Muppet Show Fan Club newsletter answered the question of "How did they do it?" The response was "There are 250 puppets in the last shot of the film, and they're all moving. How? 150 puppeteers in a 6' deep, 17' wide pit, that's how. They were recruited through the Los Angeles Guild of The Puppeteers of America and almost every puppeteer west of the Rockies reported for pit duty."&lt;ref&gt;''The Muppet Show Fan Club'' newsletter (vol. 2, no. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The film is dedicated to ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] who appears in the movie in a cameo role and died during production in September 1978.

===Style===
''The Muppet Movie'' uses [[meta-reference]]s as a source of humor, as characters occasionally break the [[fourth wall]] to address the audience or comment on their real-life circumstances. In one scene, Kermit and Fozzie encounter [[Big Bird]] on the road, offering him a lift to Hollywood, but he declines, heading to New York City to break into public television, referencing the character's role in ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

In a particularly meta-fictional [[plot twist]], Kermit and Fozzie actually give the screenplay to Dr. Teeth, who later uses it to find and rescue them after they have been stranded in the desert.

===Prop vehicles===
Several classic cars were specially selected by Henson for appearances in the film. The most prominent were a pair of 1951 [[Studebaker]] Commander Coupes driven by [[Fozzie Bear]] in the film. One car was painted but unmodified and driven by a person in the front seat. It was used for long, traveling shots. The second car was driven by a person in the trunk, who viewed the road through a TV set. The television received its image from a camera located in the center nose of the car's front grille. This made it possible for [[Frank Oz]] to perform [[Fozzie Bear]] in the front seat, and have the character seemingly drive the car in close-up shots. This car is now on display at the [[Studebaker National Museum]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]].

Doc Hopper is chauffeured throughout the movie by Max in a 1959 [[Cadillac Series 70|Cadillac Fleetwood 75 Limousine]].

The final car driven by the Muppets is a [[1946 Ford]] [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]] station wagon, famous for its wood panel siding and a valuable collectible.

==Music==
{{main|The Muppet Movie (soundtrack)}}
The film's music was written by [[Kenneth Ascher]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]. Regarding the music's composition, Williams said; "Jim Henson gave you more [creative] freedom than anybody I've ever worked with in my life. I said, 'You want to hear the songs as we're writing them?' He said, 'No. I'll hear them in the studio. I know I'm gonna love them.' You just don't get that kind of freedom on a project these days."&lt;ref name="songfacts"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3146| title = Rainbow Connection| work = Songfacts.com| accessdate = December 7, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Movin' Right Along", "Never Before, Never Again", and "I Hope That Somethin' Better Comes Along" were shortened in the film, compared to their soundtrack versions, for continuity purposes. The latter, a duet between Rowlf and Kermit, contained references that the studio considered too mature for children, although the song appeared complete in the British theatrical and home video debut versions. In "Finale: The Magic Store", a line performed by Kermit in the film is sung by Fozzie on the soundtrack recording.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film proved to be a huge hit at the box office during the summer of 1979 and ended up grossing $76,657,000 domestically&lt;ref name=JimBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt; (adjusted for inflation, this would equal $265,703,546 in 2016 dollars), making it the [[1979 in film|seventh highest-grossing film of 1979]] and also, the second highest-grossing Muppet film after the release of ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' in 2011. The success of the film gave [[The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Productions]] an opportunity to release more Muppet productions theatrically.

The film's successful theatrical release encouraged [[Lew Grade]] into furthering his own film distribution company, which later backfired with the massive box office failures of ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (from [[EMI Films|EMI]]) and ''[[Raise the Titanic (film)|Raise the Titanic]]'' (from [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]]), both released by Associated Film Distribution just a year later.&lt;ref name="grade"&gt;Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins &amp; Sons 1987 p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''The Muppet Movie'' received positive reviews. The film currently holds an 88% approval rating on  [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average score of 8/10, based on 48 reviews. The site's consensus says "''The Muppet Movie'', the big-screen debut of Jim Henson's plush creations, is smart, lighthearted, and fun for all ages."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/muppet_movie/|title=The Muppet Movie|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars. In his favorable review, he was fascinated that "''The Muppet Movie'' not only stars the Muppets but, for the first time, shows us their feet."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19791114/REVIEWS/51114006/1023|title=The Muppet Movie|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=rogerebert.com|date=November 14, 1979|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' offered equal praise, stating that the film "demonstrates once again that there's always room in movies for unbridled amiability when it's governed by intelligence and wit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=The Screen: Muppets Go to Hollywood:Roadiest Road Picture|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03EFDD1239E732A25751C2A9609C946890D6CF&amp;partner=Rotten+Tomatoes&amp;pagewanted=print|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]]'s annual movie guide found the film enjoyable, though he called the score "pedestrian",[http://themoviegeek.com/moviedetail.php?id=663] despite the song "[[Rainbow Connection]]" being nominated for an Academy Award.

In 2009, it was named to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] for being "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant and will be preserved for all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = 25 new titles added to National Film Registry | newspaper = Yahoo News | publisher = Yahoo | date = December 30, 2009 | url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_en_mo/us_classic_films_glance;_ylt=Am9aCMfxzzsN4EY9F802IESs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTNzcHU5NnU4BGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMDkxMjMwL3VzX2NsYXNzaWNfZmlsbXNfZ2xhbmNlBGNjb2RlA21vc3Rwb3B1bGFyBGNwb3MDMTAEcG9zAzcEcHQDaG9tZV9jb2tlBHNlYwN5bl9oZWFkbGluZV9saXN0BHNsawMyNW5ld3RpdGxlc2E- | accessdate = December 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106004526/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_en_mo/us_classic_films_glance|archivedate=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Upright Motive No. 1: Glenkiln Cross''''' is a bronze sculpture by [[Henry Moore]], cast in a number of copies in 1955-56.  It was the first of a series of narrow vertical sculptures by Moore, who compared them to [[totem pole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/united-states-of-america/fort-worth/amon-carter-museum/upright-motive-no1-glenkiln-cross-1955-56-lh-37 Henry Moore Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edition==
[[File:Glenkiln-cross.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Washington, D.C.]]
There are versions in [[Glenkiln Sculpture Park]], in [[Dumfries and Galloway]], south-west [[Scotland]], from where it takes its name,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/uk/glenkiln/glenkiln-estate/upright-motive-no1-glenkiln-cross-1955-56-lh-37 Henry Moore Foundation], Glenkiln&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kroller-Muller Museum]] in [[Otterlo]] in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Amon Carter Museum]] in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/united-states-of-america/fort-worth/amon-carter-museum/upright-motive-no1-glenkiln-cross-1955-56-lh-37 Henry Moore Foundation], Fort Worth&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=10362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag01/julaug01/moore/moore.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these are mounted in a row with others of the "Upright Motive" series, as at Otterlo and Fort Worth; three in a row producing a reminiscence of the three crosses in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].

==History==

Moore described how the original idea came from a commission for an [[Olivetti]] building in [[Milan]], where he "visited the site and a lone [[Lombardy poplar]] growing behind the building convinced me that a vertical work would act as the correct counterfoil to the horizontal rhythm of the building. This idea grew ultimately into the 'Upright Motifs'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/united-states-of-america/fort-worth/amon-carter-museum/upright-motive-no1-glenkiln-cross-1955-56-lh-37 Henry Moore Foundation], Fort Worth&lt;/ref&gt; 
Between 1951 and 1976, Sir [[William Keswick]], who owned the Glenkiln estate, bought and arranged works by Henry Moore, [[Jacob Epstein]], and [[Auguste Rodin]], creating the world's first collection of sculpture in a landscape setting, Glenkiln Sculpture Park.  Moore and Keswick installed the first cast of the cross on a hilltop, where they saw a shepherd and his flock;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sculptsite.com/sculpture-headlines-Henry-Moore-Tate-Exhibition-03-26-10.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022821/http://www.sculptsite.com/sculpture-headlines-Henry-Moore-Tate-Exhibition-03-26-10.html |archive-date=2011-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore said "From a distance it looks rather like one of the [[high cross|old Celtic crosses]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/uk/glenkiln/glenkiln-estate/upright-motive-no1-glenkiln-cross-1955-56-lh-37 Henry Moore Foundation], Glenkiln&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12887">{{Short description|vanishing hitchhiker, ghostly hitchhiker, disappearing hitchhiker, phantom hitchhiker is an urban legend in which a hitchhiker vanishes}}

The '''vanishing hitchhiker''' (or variations such as the '''ghostly hitchhiker''', '''disappearing hitchhiker''', '''phantom hitchhiker''') is an [[urban legend]] in which people travelling by vehicle, meet with or are accompanied by a [[hitchhiker]] who subsequently vanishes without explanation, often from a moving vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Gillian|title=The Vanishing Hitchhiker at Fifty-Five|journal=Western Folklore|date=1998|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.2307/1500246|jstor=1500246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public knowledge of the story expanded greatly with the 1981 publication of [[Jan Harold Brunvand]]'s non-fiction book ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker''.&lt;ref name="Langlois, Janet L."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langlois|first1=Janet L.|title=The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings by Jan Harold Brunvand|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|date=July–September 1983|volume=96|issue=381|pages=356–357|jstor=540959|language=|doi=10.2307/540959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis, Bill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Bill|title="The Hook" Reconsidered: Problems in Classifying and Interpreting Adolescent Horror Legends|journal=Folklore|date=1994|volume=105|pages=61–75|jstor=1260630|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd on behalf of Folklore Enterprises, Ltd|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1994.9715874}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Brunvand suggests that the story of ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker'' can be traced as far back as the 1870s and has "recognizable parallels in Korea, Tsarist Russia, among Chinese-Americans, Mormons, and Ozark mountaineers."&lt;ref name="Fine, Gary Alan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Gary Alan|title=The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings by Jan Harold Brunvand|journal=Western Folklore|date=April 1982|volume=41|issue=2|pages=156–157|jstor=1499791|publisher=Western States Folklore Society|doi=10.2307/1499791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories have been reported for centuries across the world.

==Variations==
A common variation of the above involves the vanishing [[hitchhiker]] departing as would a normal passenger, having left some item in the [[vehicle]], or having borrowed a garment for protection against the cold.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007"/&gt; The vanishing hitchhiker may also leave some form of information that encourages the [[motorist]] to make subsequent contact.

In such accounts of the legend, the garment borrowed is often found draped over a [[gravestone]] in a local [[cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007"/&gt; In this and other versions of the [[urban legend]], the unsuspecting motorist makes contact with the family of a [[deceased]] person using the information the hitchhiker left behind and finds that the family's description of the deceased matches the passenger the motorist picked up and also finds that they were killed in some unexpected way (usually a [[car accident]]) and that the driver's encounter with the vanishing hitchhiker occurred on the anniversary of their death.

Other variations reverse this scenario, in that the hitchhiker meets a driver; the hitchhiker later learns that the driver is actually an [[ghost | apparation]] of a person who died earlier.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007"/&gt;

Not all vanishing hitchhiker legends involve [[ghost]]s. One popular variant in [[Hawaii]] involves the goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]], travelling the roads incognito and rewarding kind travellers, other variants include hitchhikers who utter [[prophecies]] (typically of pending [[Disaster|catastrophe]]s or other evil events) before vanishing.

There is a similar story which is about two travellers sitting next to each other on a [[train]] (normally a man and a woman), one of them is reading a book and the other person asks what the book is about, the first person says that it's about [[ghost]]s and they then have a conversation about ghosts, the second person then asks if the first person believes in ghosts or has ever seen one, to which the first person says that they have never seen or believed in ghosts at all, the second person then says that, this is doubtful and with that the second person vanishes.

==Classifications==

=== Beardsley and Hankey===
The first proper study of the story of the vanishing hitchhiker was undertaken in 1942–43 by [[United States|American]] [[folklore|folklorists]] Richard Beardsley and Rosalie Hankey, who collected as many accounts as they could and attempted to analyze them.&lt;ref name="Beardsley 1942"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beardsley|first1=Richard K.|last2=Hankey|first2=Rosalie|title=The Vanishing Hitchhiker|journal=[[California Folklore Quarterly]]|date=October 1942|volume=1|issue=4|pages=303–335|doi=10.2307/1495600|jstor=1495600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beardsley 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beardsley|first1=Richard K.|last2=Hankey|first2=Rosalie|title=A History of the Vanishing Hitchhiker|journal=[[California Folklore Quarterly]]|date=January 1943|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13–25|doi=10.2307/1495651|jstor=1495651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beardsley-Hankey survey elicited 79 written accounts of encounters with vanishing hitchhikers, drawn from across the United States.&lt;ref name="Beardsley 1942"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beardsley 1943"/&gt; They found: "Four distinctly different versions, distinguishable because of obvious differences in development and essence." These are described as:

*'''A.''' Stories where the hitchhiker gives an address through which the motorist learns he has just given a lift to a ghost.
**49 of the Beardsley-Hankey samples fell into this category, with responses from 16 states of the United States.
*'''B.''' Stories where the hitchhiker is an old woman who prophesies disaster or the end of World War II; subsequent inquiries likewise reveal her to be deceased.
**Nine of the samples fit this description, and eight of these came from the vicinity of [[Chicago]]. Beardsley and Hankey felt that this indicated a local origin, which they dated to approximately 1933: two of the version B hitchhikers in this sample foretold disaster at the [[Century of Progress]] Exposition and another foresaw calamity "at the [[World's Fair]]". The strict topicality of these unsuccessful forecasts did not appear to thwart the appearance of further Version  'B' hitch-hikers, one of whom warned that [[Northerly Island]], in [[Lake Michigan]], would soon be submerged (this has not yet occurred).
*'''C.''' Stories where a girl is met at some place of entertainment, ''e.g.'', dance, instead of on the road; she leaves some token (often the overcoat she borrowed from the motorist) on her grave by way of corroborating the experience and her identity.
**The uniformity amongst separate accounts of this variant led Beardsley and Hankey to strongly doubt its folkloric authenticity.
*'''D.''' Stories where the hitchhiker is later identified as a local divinity.

Beardsley and Hankey were particularly interested to note one instance (location: [[Kingston, New York]], 1941) in which the vanishing hitchhiker was subsequently identified as the late [[Frances Xavier Cabrini|Mother Cabrini]], founder of the local Sacred Heart Orphanage, who was [[beatified]] for her work. The authors felt that this was a case of Version 'B' glimpsed in transition to Version 'D'.

Beardsley and Hankey concluded that Version 'A' was closest to the original form of the story, containing the essential elements of the legend. Version 'B' and 'D', they believed, were localized variations, while 'C' was supposed to have started life as a separate ghost story which at some stage became conflated with the original vanishing hitchhiker story (Version 'A').

One of their conclusions certainly seems reflected in the continuation of vanishing hitchhiker stories: The hitchhiker is, in the majority of cases, female and the lift-giver male. Beardsley and Hankey's sample contained 47 young female apparitions, 14 old lady apparitions, and 14 more of an indeterminate sort.

===Baughman===
Ernest W. Baughman's ''Type- and Motif-Index of the Folk Tales of England and North America'' (1966) delineates the basic vanishing hitchhiker as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ghost of young woman asks for ride in automobile, disappears from closed car without the driver's knowledge, after giving him an address to which she wishes to be taken. The driver asks person at the address about the rider, finds she has been dead for some time. (Often the driver finds that the ghost has made similar attempts to return, usually on the anniversary of death in automobile accident. Often, too, the ghost leaves some item such as a scarf or traveling bag in the car.)&lt;ref&gt;Baughman, Ernest W. (1966). ''Type and Motif-Index of the Folktales of England and North America''. Indiana University. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baughman's classification system grades this basic story as motif E332.3.3.1.

Subcategories include:
* E332.3.3.1(a) for vanishing hitchhikers who reappear on anniversaries;
* E332.3.3.1(b) for vanishing hitchhikers who leave items in vehicles, unless the item is in a pool of water in which case it is E332.3.3.1(c);
* E332.3.3.1(d) is for accounts of sinister old ladies who prophesy disasters;
* E332.3.3.1(e) contains accounts of phantoms who are apparently sufficiently solid to engage in activities such as eating or drinking during their journey;
* E332.3.3.1(f) is for phantom parents who want to be taken to the sickbed of their dying son;
* E332.3.3.1(g) is for hitchhikers simply requesting a lift home;
* E332.3.3.1(h-j) are a category reserved exclusively for vanishing nuns (a surprisingly common variant), some of whom foretell the future.

Here, the phenomenon blends into religious encounters, with the next and last vanishing hitchhiker classification &amp;nbsp;— E332.3.3.2&amp;nbsp;— being for encounters with divinities who take to the road as hitchhikers. The legend of [[Saint Christopher]] is considered one of these, and the story of [[Philip the Evangelist]] being transported by God after encountering the Ethiopian on the road ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:26-39) is sometimes similarly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Wechner, Bernd "[http://bernd.wechner.info/Hitchhiking/bible.html Hitch-hiking in the ''Bible'']". Retrieved 30 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical reception==
Paranormal researcher Michael Goss in his book ''The Evidence for Phantom Hitch-Hikers'' discovered that many reports of vanishing hitchhikers turn out be based on [[folklore]] and [[hearsay]] stories. Goss also examined some cases and attributed them to [[hallucination]] of the experiencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmetzke|first1= Angelika|date=1988| title=''The Evidence for Phantom Hitch-Hikers'' by Michael Goss|department=Review|journal= Folklore|volume= 99|issue= 2|page=265|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1988.9716449}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goss most of the stories are "fabricated, folklore creations retold in new settings."&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007"&gt;Nickell, Joe. (2007). ''Adventures in Paranormal Investigation''. University of Kentucky Press. pp. 74-82. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic [[Joe Nickell]], who investigated two alleged cases, concluded that there is no reliable evidence for vanishing hitchhikers. Historical examples have their origin in folklore tales and [[urban legend]]s. Modern cases often involve conflicting accounts that may well be the result of [[exaggeration]], [[illusion]] or [[hoax]]ing.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007"/&gt;

The '''''Wielkopolska Chronicle''''' (or ''Chronicle of Greater Poland'', {{lang-pl|Kronika wielkopolska}}) is an anonymous medieval [[chronicle]] describing supposed history of [[Poland]] from legendary times up to the year 1273. It was written in Latin at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century.

==Origins and possible authorship==
The chronicle was written from the point of view of the region of [[Wielkopolska]] (''Greater Poland''). Its actual title is unknown. In one of the remaining copies it's written down as ''Chronicum Poloniae'' and in another ''Annalia vestuste gentic Polonorum vel Kronice''.&lt;ref name="slownik"/&gt;

Some historians, such as [[Brygida Kürbis]] have argued that the first edition of the work was created between 1283 and 1296 and its author was the curator of the [[Poznań]] [[Chapter (religion)|capitulary]], [[Godzisław Baszko]]. A second edition was completed between 1377 and 1384, which is partly supported by inclusion of material supported by the Chronicle of Dzierzwa from the beginning of 14th century. Others, like [[Jan Dąbrowski (historian)|Jan Dąbrowski]], have posited that the entire chronicle was written by [[Jan of Czarnków]] in the second half of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="slownik"&gt;{{cite book | title=Słownik Literatury Staropolskiej. Średniowiecze - Renasans - Barok. | publisher=Zakład Narodowy Imienia Ossolińskich | editor=Michałowska,  Teresa | year=1990 | pages=354 | isbn=8304022192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milosz"&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of Polish Literature | publisher=University of California Press | author=Miłosz, Czesław | authorlink=Czesław Miłosz | year=1983 | pages=11 | isbn=9780520044777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nine existing manuscripts, including a ''Great Chronicle'' copy which contains a collection of historical sources collected in Wielkopolska at the end of the 14th century.

The purpose of the author was to record the history of the rulers of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]]. The chronicle covers mythical events from pre-history up to the year 1271/72, and in two additions the year 1273. As a source, stylistically the chronicle is composed of two parts. The first, going up to the year 1202 is based on the ''[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|Chronica Polonorum]]'' of [[Wincenty Kadłubek]]. The second part, written more in the style of [[annals]] is based on yearly records of Capitularies of [[Gniezno]] and Poznań. Other sources used by the author most likely include the lost ''Annales Polonorum historiae'', church archives, and ''Vita s. Stanislai, Vita maior'' ([[Life of Saint Stanisław]]) of [[Wincenty of Kielcza]]. The introduction to the work has survived in two editions of the manuscript.  One of these was written in 1295/1296 (it mentions [[Przemysł II]] as the current ruler). The other, more extensive one, was most likely created in the 14th century.

The chronicle was translated into Polish in 1965  by [[Kazimierz Abgarowicz]].&lt;ref name="qjsp"&gt;''Quarterly Journal of Scientific Publications'', 1965, Polska Akademia Nauk, Ossolineum, pg. 22, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZLQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Wielkopolska+Chronicle%22&amp;dq=%22Wielkopolska+Chronicle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZCXJUYqvLMKvyAGVroGwBQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The chronicle can be seen as a ''[[gesta (genre)|gesta ducum]]'', a composition whose purpose is to celebrate the deeds of princes and kings. The central figures of the work are the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] rulers of Wielkoposka, [[Przemysł I]] and [[Przemysł II]]. Przemysł I is presented as an ideal of a ruler who combines knightly valor (engaging himself only in defensive wars) with religious values (Christian humility and devotion). Other ideal rulers presented in the chronicle include other Polish kings and dukes, including [[Bolesław II the Generous]] (before the murder of [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Saint Stanisław]]) and [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]].

==Contents==

Among other stories, legends, and historical narratives, the Wielkopolska Chronicle contains the first recorded version of the legend of [[Lech, Čech, and Rus]], as well as a Polish version of the story of [[Waldere|Waldere and Hildegyth]] (also [[Waltharius]]), a popular tale of medieval Europe, transplanted onto Polish soil.

'''William A. Muldoon''' (May 25, 1852 &amp;ndash; June 3, 1933) was the [[Greco-Roman Wrestling]] [[Champion]], a [[physical culture|physical culturist]] and the first chairman of the [[New York State Athletic Commission]]. He once wrestled a match that lasted over seven hours. Nicknamed "The Solid Man,"&lt;ref&gt;"The Solid Man" nickname was referenced from a popular song of the time, "Muldoon, the Solid Man" by [[Edward Harrigan|Edward ("Ned") Harrigan]]. The moniker may have also been a nod to the "[[Solid Muldoon]]", a [[P.T. Barnum]] exhibit claimed to be the petrified remains of an ancestral missing link between man and ape, later revealed as a [[hoax]].&lt;/ref&gt; Muldoon established himself as champion in [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] in the 1880s and over the years gained a remarkable measure of public influence that would continue through his days as a health farm proprietor in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and his service on [[NYSAC]]. Muldoon was a mainstay in New York sports for over 50 years.

==Early life==
Born in [[Allegany County, New York]], Muldoon was the son of Irish immigrants. His father was a farmer. Showing a knack for strength athletics at a young age, Muldoon gained a local reputation as a standout in [[caber-tossing]], weightlifting, sprinting and amateur wrestling. His youth was otherwise characterized by a brutish, flash temper, and his desire to be treated with the respect of an adult despite being a child.

Muldoon journeyed to Paris to serve as a volunteer in the French Army in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-71, where he met publisher [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.]], who told Muldoon he had the potential to be the best Greco-Roman wrestler in the world if he concentrated on it.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Ring Magazine]]'' publisher [[Nat Fleischer]] in his volume, "From Milo to Londos" (The Ring Athletic Library, Book No. 13, 1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1876, Muldoon was living in New York City, where he accepted appointment to the [[New York Police Department]] at the behest of Senator [[John Morrissey]], former bare-knuckle boxing champion. At the time of his resignation in 1881 Muldoon was a detective.

==The Solid Man==
In 1880, Muldoon gained recognition as [[World Championship|World's]] [[Greco-Roman Wrestling|Greco-Roman]] [[Champion]] with a win over title claimant Thiebaud Bauer. His rise to prominence brought challengers from across the globe, including [[Edwin Bibby]] and Tom Cannon of England, [[Donald Dinnie]] of Scotland, [[Sorakichi Matsuda|"Mat" Sorakichi]] of Japan, [[Karl Abs|Carl Abs]] of Germany, [[William Miller (Australian athlete)|William Miller]] of Australia, and [[John McMahon (wrestler)|John McMahon]] and [[Clarence Whistler]], the latter being Muldoon's opponent in a titanic seven-hour match in 1881, where neither could gain a single fall.&lt;ref&gt;Whistler, who died young, was later eulogized by Muldoon as the toughest man he ever met on the mat. Their 1881 match ignited a professional and personal rivalry that punctuated wrestling's popularity in the early to mid-1880s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the celebrated match with Whistler, Muldoon assembled an athletic combination and toured the country promoting athletic events and defending his title against all comers. Muldoon became involved in theater around this time, stemming from his fame in athletics. In 1883 he shared the bill with [[Maurice Barrymore]], a boxer turned actor, in [[Helena Modjeska|Madame Modjeska's]] production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] "[[As You Like It]]." In 1887, he appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as "The Fighting Gaul" in "Spartacus."

Muldoon was one of a party of gentlemen entertained by [[Robert Emmet Odlum]], brother of women's rights activist [[Charlotte Odlum Smith]], on the morning of May 19, 1885, the day he jumped from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and was killed.  Muldoon assisted in unsuccessful resuscitation efforts and summoned an ambulance, which was too late to save Odlum.&lt;ref name="Odlum"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FP4NAQAAIAAJ |title= The Life and Adventures of Prof. Robert Emmet Odlum, Containing an Account of his Splendid Natatorium at the National Capital |year= 1885 |author= Catherine Odlum | publisher= Gray and Clarkson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DE4D91739E533A25753C2A9639C94649FD7CF|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Odlum's Leap to Death|date=May 20, 1885|page=1|accessdate=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:William Muldoon1.jpg|thumb|left|An 1887 "Allen &amp; Ginter" tobacco card depicting Muldoon]]

In 1889 Muldoon trained [[John L. Sullivan]] for his famous 75-round fight against [[Jake Kilrain]] for the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight bare-knuckle boxing championship]]. He had done so on a friendly wager and offered to absorb expenses if Sullivan lost. Sullivan won and Muldoon gained national notice for restoring the boxing champion to fighting form. Muldoon's methods at accomplishing Sullivan's rejuvenation gained much public interest.

Muldoon was never defeated for his Greco-Roman Championship. He wrestled in his final championship match in 1890, defeating [[Evan Lewis (wrestler)|Evan Lewis]] in Philadelphia. Despite being implored by promoters and challengers to come out of retirement, Muldoon never wrestled another finish match or claimed any active championship. He symbolically passed his [[World Championship|World's]] [[Greco-Roman Wrestling|Greco-Roman]] [[Championship]] to protégé [[Ernest Roeber]] (whom Lewis later defeated). Muldoon would make his final public appearance as a wrestler in a charity exhibition match against Roeber at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1894.

That same year Muldoon moved his health farm from [[Belfast, New York]] to [[White Plains, NY|White Plains]]. As he tapered off direct involvement in professional athletics he devoted more time to devising his system on restoring one's health. Muldoon continued to train boxers and wrestlers until [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/Horton_Law boxing was banned in New York] at the turn of the century.

==Later years==
In 1900, Muldoon opened what would become the work of his life, the well-known health institute "The Olympia," at [[Purchase, New York]]. In subsequent years through the success of the Olympia Muldoon would again gain national notice as he treated such notables there as [[U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain]] [[Joseph Hodges Choate]], publisher [[Ralph Pulitzer]], Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Major General [[J. Franklin Bell]], essayist [[Elbert Hubbard]] novelist [[Theodore Dreiser]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[Elihu Root]], who was sent to Muldoon by [[Teddy Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]. In 1907 there was talk that Muldoon would be appointed to the president's cabinet to oversee physical health. For his uncompromised methods at his health farm Muldoon was dubbed the "Professor." Journalist [[Nellie Bly]] was the first woman to complete Muldoon's system.

In the spring of 1909 Muldoon made a final return to the stage in a theatrical tour organized in benefit of [[The Lambs]]. Muldoon dedicated a Civil War monument to the town of [[Belfast, New York]], listing the names of local veterans in 1915, including that of his older brother John.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alleganycountynylocalhistory.com/TownVillageReservation/TownBelfast/BelfastCivilWarVet/Belfast%20Civil%20War%20Vets.htm] at www.usgennet.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Muldoon Mausoleum 2011.JPG|thumb|The mausoleum of William Muldoon in [[Kensico Cemetery]]]]
In 1921 Muldoon was personally tapped by Governor [[Nathan Lewis Miller]] as the inaugural Chairman of the [[New York State Athletic Commission]], when [[Walker Law|professional boxing's status was legally restored in New York]]. While on [[NYSAC]], Muldoon's czarish decrees characterized his inflexible sense of integrity to the press and sporting public. He was dubbed in the papers the "Iron Duke."

In 1927 Muldoon was profiled by "[[The New Yorker]]" magazine and in 1929 by "[[The Saturday Evening Post]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Stanley |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1927/07/16/1927_07_16_018_TNY_CARDS_000174304 |title=Profiles: Spartacus in Westchester |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/t1238.htm#A27708 |title=Contents Lists |publisher=Philsp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biography was published in 1928, with a foreword by [[Jack Dempsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Every, Edward. Muldoon – The Solid Man of Sport. New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Muldoon died at age 81 in [[Westchester County, New York]], and was interred in a grandiose private mausoleum at [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]]. Sometime after the end of his wrestling career and before the turn of the century, Muldoon had mendaciously claimed for years that he was born in 1845, and 7 years older than his age verified in the Muldoon Family Bible, which documents his real birth year.

In 1996, Muldoon was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

In 2004, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum under the "Pioneer Era" category.

==Personal==
Muldoon claimed to be a lifelong bachelor. However, he was married twice; the first marriage ended in divorce, the other in separation. His housekeeper of 30 years Leonie Lutringer left her entire estate to Muldoon in 1922. It was revealed later in his life that he had adopted his longtime secretary Margaret Farrell &amp;ndash; she received his entire estate at his death. Muldoon was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1931, though his doctors did not reveal the nature of his illness to him. Muldoon died two years later. Retired boxing champion [[Gene Tunney]], a disciple of Muldoon, remarked to the ''[[New York Times|Times]]'' at the time of Muldoon's death, "All I know about training I learned from him…. His patience, intellectual courage and wisdom were inspirational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/06/04/archives/william-muldoon-iron-duke-of-athletics-idol-of-boxing-world-was.html?sq=william%2520muldoon%2520dies&amp;scp=4&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=WILLIAM MULDOON; ' Iron Duke' of Athletics, Idol of Boxing World, Was John L.

Muldoon was a strong advocate of compulsory military service, [[equestrianism]], [[physical culture]] and the [[Boy Scouts of America]], citing the latter as the only organization left devoted to leadership-building for young men.

The '''World Football Elo Ratings''' is a ranking system for men's national [[association football]] teams that is published by the website eloratings.net. It is based on the [[Elo rating system]] but includes modifications to take various football-specific variables into account, like the margin of victory, importance of a match, and home field advantage. Other implementations of the Elo rating system are possible and there is no single nor any official Elo ranking for football teams. 

Since being developed, the Elo rankings have been found to have the highest predictive capability for football matches.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lasek, Z. Szlávik and S. Bhulai (2013), [http://lasek.rexamine.com/football_rankings.pdf The predictive power of ranking systems in association football], Int. J. Applied Pattern Recognition1: 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA's official rankings, both the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for men and  the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]] are based on a modified version of the Elo formula, the men's rankings having switched away from FIFA's own system for matches played since June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2018/m=6/news=2026-fifa-world-cuptm-fifa-council-designates-bids-for-final-voting-by-the-fifa-.html|title=2026 FIFA World Cup™: FIFA Council designates bids for final voting by the FIFA Congress|work=fifa.com|publisher=FIFA|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Highest average over entire team history====
This table is directly extracted from the eloratings.net website. The numbers represent may not be directly comparable. For [https://www.eloratings.net/England England] and [https://www.eloratings.net/Scotland Scotland] they represent 146 years of matches (in 2018), for [https://www.eloratings.net/Ukraine Ukraine] 26 years, and for [https://www.eloratings.net/Montenegro Montenegro] 11 years. For [https://www.eloratings.net/Croatia Croatia] and [https://www.eloratings.net/Slovakia Slovakia] the average is dominated by the single rating during the 50 years between the few games played between 1940 and 1943 and the rebirth of the countries in the 1990s. Likewise, [https://www.eloratings.net/South_Africa South Africa]'s average is mostly determined by the 44 matches (of a 417 total in 2018) played in the 86 years before it rejoined FIFA in 1992.

====Highest average ratings since 1970====
This table is a list of the national teams with the highest average Elo score over approximately the last half century, from 1 January 1970 to 1 January 2018.&lt;!--Updated every year--&gt; Before this time intercontinental play was fairly limited and many nations in Africa, North America, and Asia had played too few games yet to create a representative Elo score. Only teams playing over the entire period are included. Short-lived or recently originated strong football teams, like East-Germany and Croatia, appear in the decades table below.

==Biggest upsets==
This is a list of matches with the biggest point exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eloratings.net/upsets Upsets] at eloratings.net (per June 2018 this page is under reconstruction)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the importance of the match, the goal differential and the perceived home team advantage are factored in the exchange, these are not necessarily the most surprising wins as expressed by the difference in Elo rating.{{efn|In those terms, most surprising may have been the 2:1 win of Luxembourg (Elo rating 1036) over Switzerland (ER 1794) in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 2|World Cup qualification match in September 2008]] (a 758 point difference). In another [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 3|World Cup qualifier in October 2004]] Liechtenstein (ER 1049) held the 853 points higher rated Portuguese team (ER 1902) to a 2:2 draw.}}&lt;br&gt;

==History and overview==
The Elo system, developed by [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-American mathematician [[Arpad Elo|Árpád Élő]], is used by [[FIDE]], the international chess federation, to rate [[chess]] players, and by the [[European Go Federation]], to rate [[Go (game)|Go]] players. In 1997, Bob Runyan adapted the Elo rating system to international [[Association football|football]] and posted the results on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lyons |first1=Kieth |title=What are the World Football Elo Ratings? |url=https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-world-football-elo-ratings-27851 |publisher=The Conversation |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first maintainer of the World Football Elo Ratings web site, currently maintained by Kirill Bulygin. Other implementations of the Elo rating system are possible &lt;ref name="Laesk et. al."&gt;J. Lasek, Z. Szlávik and S. Bhulai (2013), [http://lasek.rexamine.com/football_rankings.pdf The predictive power of ranking systems in association football], Int. J. Applied Pattern Recognition1: 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Runyan system is the best known.

The Elo system was adapted for football by adding a weighting for the kind of match, an adjustment for the home team advantage, and an adjustment for goal difference in the match result.

The factors taken into consideration when calculating a team's new rating are:
*The team's old rating
*The considered weight of the tournament
*The goal difference of the match
*The result of the match
*The expected result of the match

The different weights of competitions in descending order are:
*[[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] Finals
*[[Football Continental Championships|Continental championships]] finals and Intercontinental tournaments
*World Cup and Continental championship qualifiers
*All other tournaments
*[[Friendly match]]es

The ratings consider all official international matches for which results are available. Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eloratings.net/about |title=The World Football Elo Rating System |publisher=Eloratings.net |date= |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches; ratings for teams with fewer than 30 matches are considered provisional.

===Comparison with other systems===
A 2009 comparative study of eight methods found that the implementation of the Elo rating system described below had the highest predictive capability for football matches, while the men's FIFA ranking method (2006–2018 system) performed poorly.  &lt;ref name="Laesk et. al." /&gt;

The [[FIFA World Rankings]] is the official national teams rating system used by the [[FIFA|international governing body of football]]. The [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|FIFA Women's World Rankings system]] has used a modified version of the Elo formula since 2003. In June 2018, the FIFA ranking switched to an Elo-based ranking as well, starting from the current FIFA rating points.&lt;ref&gt;FIFA Council, [https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2018/m=6/news=2026-fifa-world-cuptm-fifa-council-designates-bids-for-final-voting-by-the-fifa-.html 2026 FIFA World Cup™: FIFA Council designates bids for final voting by the FIFA Congress], 10 Jun 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between the World Football Elo Rating and the new men's FIFA rating system is that the latter does not consider goal differential and counts a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] as a win/loss rather than a draw; thus, a 7:0 [[Blowout (sports)|blowout]] is considered equal to a 7:6 penalty shoot-out win (neither method distinguishes a win in [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] from a win in regular time). The FIFA method is also less sensitive to the difference in ratings and more sensitive to match status.&lt;ref name=fifarev&gt;FIFA council, [https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/revision-of-the-fifa-coca-cola-world-ranking.pdf?cloudid=fzltr4s8tz3v3vy0aqo1 Revision of the FIFA / Coca-Cola World Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, World Football Elo Ratings considers all official international matches for which results are available, including those involving "unaffiliated" teams that are not a member of FIFA.

==Calculation principles==
&lt;!--This text is a tad unclear and as it is doesn't add to the understanding
The basic principle behind the Elo ratings is only in its simplest form similar to that of a league; unlike the FIFA rankings, who effectively run their table as a normal league table but with weightings to take into account the other factors, the Elo system has its one formula which takes into account the factors mentioned above. There is no first step as in the FIFA system where a team immediately receives points for the result, there is just one calculation in the Elo system.
 --&gt;
The ratings are based on the following formulae:

:'''&lt;math&gt;R_n = R_o + P&lt;/math&gt;'''
where
:'''&lt;math&gt;P = K G (W - W_e)&lt;/math&gt;'''

Where;
{| style="width:50%;"
|-
|width=4%|
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The new team rating&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_o&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The old team rating&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'''||= Weight index regarding the tournament of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;'''||= A number from the index of goal differences&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The result of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;W_e&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The expected result&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;'''||= Points Change&lt;br&gt;
|}

"Points Change" is rounded to the nearest integer before updating the team rating. &lt;br&gt;

===Status of match===
The status of the match is incorporated by the use of a weight constant. The constant reflects the importance of a match, which, in turn, is determined entirely by which tournament the match is in; the weight constant for each major tournament is:
{| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 90%;"
|-
!Tournament or Match type!!K
|-
|[[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], [[Football at the Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] (1908–1980) ||60
|-
|[[Football Continental Championships|Continental championship]] and intercontinental tournaments||50
|-
|World Cup and Continental qualifiers and major tournaments||40
|-
|All other tournaments||30
|-
|[[Friendly match]]es||20
|}
The FIFA adaptation of the Elo rating will feature 8 weights, with the knockout stages in the World Cup weighing 12x more than some friendly matches.&lt;ref name=fifarev/&gt;

===Number of goals===
The number of goals is taken into account by use of a goal difference index.

If the game is a draw or is won by one goal
:&lt;math&gt;G = 1&lt;/math&gt;

If the game is won by two goals
:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

If the game is won by three  or more goals
*Where '''N''' is the goal difference
:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{11+N}{8}&lt;/math&gt;

Table of examples:

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 90%;"
|-
!Goal Difference!!G
|-
|0||1
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+1&lt;/nowiki&gt;||1
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+2&lt;/nowiki&gt;||1.5
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+3&lt;/nowiki&gt;||1.75
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+4&lt;/nowiki&gt;||1.875
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+5&lt;/nowiki&gt;||2
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+6&lt;/nowiki&gt;||2.125
|}

===Result of match===
W is the result of the game (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss). This also holds when a game is won or lost on extra time. If the match is decided on penalties, however, the result of the game is considered a draw (W = 0.5).

===Expected result of match===
W&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected result (win expectancy with a draw counting as 0.5) from the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;W_e = \frac{1}{10^{-dr/400} + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''dr'' equals the difference in ratings (add 100 points for the home team). So ''dr'' of 0 gives 0.5, of 120 gives 0.666 to the higher-ranked team and 0.334 to the lower, and of 800 gives 0.99 to the higher-ranked team and 0.01 to the lower.

The FIFA adaptation of the Elo rating does not incorporate a home team advantage and has a larger divisor in the formula (600 vs 400), making the points exchange less sensitive to the rating difference of two teams.&lt;ref name=fifarev/&gt;

===Examples for clarification===
The same example of a three-team friendly tournament on neutral territory is used as on the [[FIFA World Rankings]] page. Beforehand team A had a rating of 630 points, team B 500 points, and teams C 480 points.&lt;br&gt;The first table shows the points allocations based on three possible outcomes of the match between the strongest team A, and the somewhat weaker team B:

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 90%;"
|-
| ||'''Team A'''||'''Team B'''||'''Team A'''||'''Team B'''||'''Team A'''||'''Team B'''
|-
!Score
|colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"|3 : 1||colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"|1 : 3||colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"|2 : 2
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'''
||20||20||20||20||20||20
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;'''
||1.5||1.5||1.5||1.5||1||1
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;'''
||1||0||0||1||0.5||0.5
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;W_e&lt;/math&gt;'''
||0.679||0.321||0.679||0.321||0.679||0.321
|-
!Total (P)
||+9.63||-9.63||-20.37||+20.37||-3.58||+3.58
|}

When the difference in strength between the two teams is less, so also will be the difference in points allocation. The next table illustrates how the points would be divided following the same results as above, but with two roughly equally ranked teams, B and C, being involved:

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 90%;"
|-
| ||'''Team B'''||'''Team C'''||'''Team B'''||'''Team C'''||'''Team B'''||'''Team C'''
|-
!Score
|colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"|3–1||colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"|1–3||colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"|2–2
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'''
||20||20||20||20||20||20
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;'''
||1.5||1.5||1.5||1.5||1||1
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;'''
||1||0||0||1||0.5||0.5
|-
!'''&lt;math&gt;W_e&lt;/math&gt;'''
||0.529||0.471||0.529||0.471||0.529||0.471
|-
!Total (P)
||+14.13||-14.13||-15.87||+15.87||-0.58||+0.58
|}

Team B drops more points by losing to Team C, which has shown about the same strength, than by losing to Team A, which has been considerably better than Team B.
