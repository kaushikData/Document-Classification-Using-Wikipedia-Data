'''48FILM Project''' is an international [[short film]] festival and online competition founded in 2009. The competition is open from January to November each year. Professional and amateur filmmakers worldwide are given 48 hours to write, film, edit, produce and upload a short 4-7 minute movie.&lt;ref name=vento /&gt; The competitors' works are judged by a jury of renowned film personalities, and the films of 15 finalists are screened at the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) in [[Los Angeles]], where the grand winner receives the prize of $100,000.&lt;ref name=culture /&gt;&lt;ref name=ansa /&gt; More than 75,000 filmmakers from 130 countries actively participated in the festival by 2016.&lt;ref name=protothema /&gt;&lt;ref name=affair /&gt;

==History==

Francesco Vitali and Chris Siametis started a film festival in [[Greece]] in 2009. Originally it was a film competition only for Greek nationals to create a [[short film]] in 48 hours. 48 hour Go Green Athens was a success, and the income from the screening was given to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF). The winner’s film was screened at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]. To be able to found an international festival, they moved to [[Cyprus]], set up an online company and made an online film festival. Within 20 days, they had 330 entries from all over the world. Online events were held concurrently with live events in 10 major cities in the [[United States]]. The top 15 winning films were shown in the Short Film Corner at Cannes and [[NAB Show]] in [[Las Vegas]]. Deciding to increase the scope of the festival, they moved to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=affair&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greekaffair.gr/interviews/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BE%CE%B7-francesco-vitali-48film/|title=Αποκλειστική Συνέντευξη: Francesco Vitali του 48FILM Festival|publisher=Greek Affair|author=Κυριάκος Τσικορδάνος|language=greek|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/48-hours-in-hollywood_us_591201bfe4b0e3bb894d5b04|title=48 Film Project Takes Hollywood|publisher=The Huffington Post|author=Cole Hayes|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in [[Los Angeles]] that Vitali as executive producer and Siametis as co-executive producer, together with a team of filmmakers, writers, producers, cinematographers, directors and actors, created an online festival for short films and called it 48FILM Project.&lt;ref name=sandiego /&gt;&lt;ref name=protothema&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/culture/article/572501/48film-festival-diethnes-kinimatografiko-festival-apo-duo-ellines/|title=Διεθνές κινηματογραφικό Φεστιβαλ από δύο Ελληνες|publisher=Proto Thema|language=greek|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first few years of the competition, the films of 15 finalists were screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In 2013, the finalists' films were screened at the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]' [[Samuel Goldwyn Theater]] in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name=sandiego /&gt; For the last five years, they have been screened at the [[Directors Guild of America]].&lt;ref name=vento /&gt;

For the first time in 2014, 48FILM Project provided a budget of $48,000 for an additional prize. It was given to the best producer, best director and best writer to join forces and shoot a feature film in [[Hollywood]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=sandiego /&gt; In the same year, the competition was accompanied by ''48 Music Project'', where musicians from all over the world had to create an original song within 48 hours. The prize was a contract with a major record company in Los Angeles plus $10,000 in cash and prizes. Moreover, the 15 finalists performed in front of a music-industry audience in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/4433/20140226/48-music-project-offers-record-deal-for-creating-winning-song-in-48-hours.htm|title=48 Music Project offers record deal for creating winning song in 48 hours|publisher=Music Times|author=Angelica Catalano|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 75,000 filmmakers from 130 countries actively participated in the 48FILM Project festival by 2016.&lt;ref name=protothema /&gt;&lt;ref name=affair /&gt;

In 2017, Vitali and Siametis started ''48Film Project Hellas 2017 - Respect Greece'', a festival aimed at Greek and Cypriot filmmakers, artists, directors and producers. The 30 finalists are slated to have their films screened in Los Angeles and to compete for the grand prize of $5,000. It was announced that footage from the films would be used to rebrand Greece in the documentary ''Respect Greece'', presenting Greek culture to the world.&lt;ref name=naftemporiki&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1203348/kinimatografiki-anadeiksi-tis-xoras-mas-se-olo-ton-kosmo|title=Κινηματογραφική ανάδειξη της χώρας μας σε όλο τον κόσμο|publisher=Naftemporiki|language=greek|date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3326270/combined|title=Respect Greece (2017)|publisher=IMDb|author=Francesco Vitali|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

The competition is open to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of whether they are professionals or amateurs. The competitors keep the rights to their films and choose whatever genre they want. Everyone is eligible to enter at any point from January to November each year, as many times as they like. However, once a filmmaker has applied online, he or she has two days (48 hours) to imagine a story, shoot and edit the film. They are given additional two hours to upload it to the festival site. When  filmmakers submit their application, they are informed about the three elements that their film must contain to prove that it was really made in 48 hours: a character, a prop, and a line of dialog.&lt;ref name=brescia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giornaledibrescia.it/tempo-libero/gira-il-corto-a-sirmione-vola-a-hollywood-per-un-film-1.3059034|title=Gira il corto a Sirmione, vola a Hollywood per un film|publisher=Giornale di Brescia|language=italian|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sandiego&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegored.com/noticias/49385/The-48-Film-Project-Officially-Announced/|title=The 48 Film Project Officially Announced|publisher=San Diego Red|author=Jorge Guevara|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2016 winner ''Clara'' was required to include a character named James, a perfume bottle, and the question "Is that a dagger which I see before me?".&lt;ref name=brescia /&gt;

[[File:Daten_crash_recorder.jpg|thumb|Example of a data curve of a crash recorder that is recorded in a traffic accident.]]
The '''accident data recorder''' (ADR, German commonly abbr.: '''UDS''', also accident (data) writer),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Wolfgang Hugemann, Karl-Heinz Schimmelpfennig|Periodical=[[VKU Verkehrsunfall und Fahrzeugtechnik]]|Title=Der Unfallschreiber - Funktionsprinzipien, Genauigkeit, Auswirkung auf die Tätigkeit des Sachverständigen|Volume=30|Issue=2|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;49–59|Date=1992|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Switzerland also ''Restwegaufzeichnungsgerät'' (abbr.: RAG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragen rund um die Unfalldaten- (UDS) und Restwegaufzeichnungsgeräte (RAG) bei Feuerwehrfahrzeugen (Infoblatt der Aargauer Gebäudeversicherung)|periodical=agv-ag.ch|publisher=|url=https://www.agv-ag.ch/media/filer/pruefung_rag.pdf|deadurl=|format=PDF|accessdate=2018-09-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115045755/http://www.agv-ag.ch/fileadmin/NewsletterFeuerwehr/2010-01/Pruefung_RAG.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-15|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent electronic device that records before, during, and after a [[traffic accident]] relevant data and thus resembles a [[flight recorder]].

It can be installed in motor vehicles ([[cars]], [[trucks]], [[buses]], [[motorcycles]], [[trams]], and special vehicles) on a voluntary basis in order to obtain more accurate information about the events in an [[accident]]. In some countries there are regulations for mandatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art. 102 Datenaufzeichnungsgerät (Verordnung über die technischen Anforderungen an Strassenfahrzeuge (VTS) in der Schweiz)|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19950165/index.html#a102|accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; installation in different vehicles. The accident data recorder constantly records various data of the vehicle (such as [[speed]], direction of travel, longitudinal and transverse vehicle acceleration, status of the lights, turn signals and braking, etc.) and records them for some time before they are automatically cleared.

In the case of an accident (this is detected by a strong [[acceleration]] of the vehicle as a result of an impulse), certain periods of time (usually in the two-digit seconds range) remain permanently stored before and after an event. This makes it much easier to reconstruct events after an accident, so that if necessary the question of [[Fault (legal)|fault]] can be clarified.

Many vehicles of authorities (such as [[police]] or [[ambulance]]) are equipped with it, as it often comes to disputes with collisions during driving with blues and twos about compliance with regulations. A side effect of vehicles equipped with UDS is that drivers behave more cautiously on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfalldatenspeicher (UDS) als möglicher Beitrag zur Verkehrssicherheit im Meinungsbild Jugendlicher und Heranwachsender (Seite 48)|periodical=d-nb.info|publisher=|url=http://d-nb.info/968495222/34#page=48|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-04-20|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Dirk-Antonio Harms|date=27 February 2003|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://motorzeitung.de/news.php?newsid=482247&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey by the EU Transport Commission, UDS users experienced a 20 to 30 percent decline in traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADAC warnt vor der Blackbox fürs Auto|periodical=|publisher=PS Welt|url=https://www.welt.de/motor/article108814877/ADAC-warnt-vor-der-Blackbox-fuers-Auto.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-22|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Robert Dunker|date=27 August 2012|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident data recorder is often used by [[Expert witness|experts]] or institutions in [[crash tests]] as a measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Alexander Wiek|Periodical=[[VKU Verkehrsunfall und Fahrzeugtechnik]]|Title=Die UDS-Plattform – Ein Hilfsmittel zur schnellen und einfachen Anwendbarkeit des UDS von VDO-Kienzle als Messgerät für den Sachverständigen|Volume=37|Issue=9|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;237–239|Date=1999|language=German

The accident data recorder (older generations) has a switch with which the driver can delete the stored data immediately after an accident so as not to burden himself with the later question of guilt. However, this feature may be disabled, for example for use in company vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfalldatenspeicher (UDS) als möglicher Beitrag zur Verkehrssicherheit im Meinungsbild Jugendlicher und Heranwachsender (Abschnitt 3.9 UDS bei WKD Security, Seite 51)|periodical=d-nb.info|publisher=|url=http://d-nb.info/968495222/34#page=51|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-04-20|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Dirk-Antonio Harms|date=27 February 2003|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Accident data recorders work to measure the accelerations, depending on the equipment in two or three spatial directions, with [[Accelerometer|micromechanical sensors]]. Often several sensor systems with different resolutions are used in order to be able to log the driving dynamic processes on the one hand and the collision dynamics themselves on the other. Higher-class systems also offer a possibility for measuring the rotational movements as well as the vehicle speed. The latter can e.g. be calculated from the signal of the vehicle's [[wheel speed sensor]]. The recording of any signals that are available on the vehicle's own [[CAN bus]], is possible with higher-class devices as well as the detection of a [[GPS]] signal for position and speed determination. Depending on the manufacturer, about 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;s are recorded before and 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;s after an event.

Are known today (as of 2018) in the German-speaking countries essentially two suitable for retrofitting accident data recorder. Blacktrack Ltd. offers a low-cost solution, which is mainly used by the insurance industry (e.g. [[AXA]] Winterthur in Switzerland). By contrast, the UDS-AT developed by the company consortium Peter Systemtechnik GmbH and Kast GmbH offers extended possibilities of recording and integration into a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colliseum.net/wiki/UDS-AT&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual path recording devices (RAG) from Mobatime AG are external devices that rely on existing on-board signals (distance, speed, operating states of status inputs) and store them in a ring buffer for at least the last 12 km.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mobatime.ch/de/fahrzeuggerate/datenaufzeichnungsgeraete/restwegaufzeichnung/rag-2000&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to an accident data recorder, they do not have their own measuring sensors.

== Evaluation ==
[[File:UDS-AT_Rohdaten_Real-Beispiel.jpg|thumb|Measurement data of a real accident from an accident data recorder]]
Reading out the data of an accident data recorder requires special software.

The evaluation and interpretation of measurement data of a traffic accident require special knowledge in the areas of [[vehicle dynamics]], [[accident reconstruction]], [[metrology]] and last but not least the accident data storage technology itself. For UDS there is a separate order area for expert witnesses in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://svv.ihk.de/svv/content/home/home.ihk&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture on the right shows the (unprocessed) data curves of a real accident recorded with a UDS. The measured accelerations, the speed and various status channels are plotted over time. It can be seen, for example, that vehicle special signals were switched on prior to the collision and the driver was previously still applying the brake.

== History ==
The nowadays known accident data recorder was invented by [[Kienzle Computer|Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH]], which applied for a patent in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=EP |number=0635153 |title=ACCIDENT DATA MEMORY |pubdate= August 18, 1994 |fdate=January 21, 1994 |pridate=February 6, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE |number=4218397 |title=Device for recording a short distance of motor vehicles |pubdate=December 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development began in Germany in the early 1980s with the two companies [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] and Kienzle, who pursued different concepts. In general, the black box was taken as a model, which was developed in the early 1950s in Australia by [[David Warren (inventor)|David Warren]]. Already in 1973, General Motors applied for a patent for a "vehicle crash recorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DE2322299 - Aufprallschreiber bei Fahrzeugen|periodical=[[European Patent Organisation|register.epo.org]]|publisher=|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=DE&amp;NR=2322299A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=1&amp;date=19731108&amp;DB=&amp;locale=#|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-21|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mannesmann Kienzle delivered the first accident data recorder in early 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Unfalldatenschreiber sorgt für Klarheit im Rechtsstreit Der "Polizist im Auto" verringert auch die Kosten bei der Rekonstruktion des Unfallhergangs.|periodical=|publisher=F.A.Z.

== Motorsport ==
In [[motorsport]], accident data recorders (ADR) must be used in various series as specified by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. Starting with the 2015 season, the use of an ADR in the [[Formula 4]] championship was compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalinstitute.org/2016/02/29/accident-data-recorders/&lt;/ref&gt; In the higher series, the use has been mandatory for some time. In addition to the data of the acceleration sensors mounted on the vehicle, the loads on the driver are also measured with an in-ear accelerometer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fiafoundation.org/blog/2016/june/safety-measures&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the higher speeds in formula sports compared to road traffic, the sensors have a measuring range of ± 150&amp;nbsp;g with a resolution of 0.1&amp;nbsp;g. 2&amp;nbsp;s are recorded before an event. With an event duration of 30&amp;nbsp;s, 10 events can be stored.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motec.com.au/adr/adrfeatures/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demarcation ==
Both in a [[flight recorder]] and in a UDS, the constantly recorded data runs in a [[ring buffer]]. However, the flight recorder usually records for longer periods of 17 to 25 hours. In contrast, the UDS only saves a few seconds before and after an event is triggered (e.g. collision) permanently.

The term ''drive data recorder'' is generally understood to mean a continuous and permanently available recording of data and signals during the operation of a vehicle, independently of an accident. Such systems are often used in locomotives or trams. Often, however, an [[electronic logbook]] is referred to as drive data recorder. [[Dashcam]]s are sometimes referred to as drive data recorder or ''video event data recorder'' (VEDR).

{{Main|Event Data Recorder}}
A so-called ''Event Data Recorder'' (EDR) is not an accident data recorder in the sense of an autonomous, more or less vehicle-independent device, since an EDR is usually an additional electronic module in an existing [[Engine control unit|control device]] (e.g. from the [[Airbag]]) in a car. EDRs rely exclusively on on-board signals, while UDS have their own inertial sensors. Vehicles with airbag systems store accident-relevant data (impact accelerations, belt buckle conditions, seat positions, trip times) in the internal memory of the tripping electronics. However, the data size varies depending on the manufacturer and only extends over a few seconds or fractions. [[NHTSA]] regulations call for uniform data sets for all systems manufactured from 2010 onwards.

The '''Angels of Mons''' is a popular [[legend]] about a group of [[angel]]s who supposedly protected members of the [[British Army]] in the [[Battle of Mons]] at the outset of the [[First World War]].

==History==
On 22–23 August 1914, the first major engagement of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in the First World War occurred at the [[Battle of Mons]]. Advancing [[German Empire|German]] forces were thrown back by heavily outnumbered British troops, who suffered heavy casualties and, being outflanked, were forced into rapid retreat the next day. The retreat and the battle were rapidly perceived by the British public as being a key moment in the war. Despite the censorship going on in Britain at the time, this battle was the first indication the British public had that defeating Germany would not be as easy as some had thought.

===Arthur Machen and "The Bowmen"===
{{refimprove|date=November 2013|section}}
On 29 September 1914 Welsh author [[Arthur Machen]] published a short story entitled "The Bowmen" in the London newspaper the ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'', inspired by accounts that he had read of the fighting at Mons and an idea he had had soon after the battle.

Machen, who had already written a number of factual articles on the conflict for the paper, set his story at the time of the retreat from the Battle of Mons in August 1914. The story described phantom bowmen from the [[Battle of Agincourt]] summoned by a soldier calling on [[St. George]], destroying a German host.&lt;ref name=bowmen&gt;{{Cite book|first=Arthur|last=Machen|title=The Bowmen and Other Legends of the War|year=1915|publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/angelsmonsbowme00machgoog|accessdate=5 March 2014|id=Book digitized by Google in 2007 from the library of [[Harvard University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machen's story was not, however, labelled as fiction and the same edition of the ''Evening News'' ran a story by a different author under the heading "Our Short Story". Additionally, Machen's story was written from a first-hand perspective and was a kind of [[false document]], a technique Machen knew well. The unintended result was that Machen had a number of requests to provide evidence for his sources for the story soon after its publication, from readers who thought it was true, to which he responded that it was completely imaginary, as he had no desire to create a [[hoax]].

A month or two later Machen received requests from the editors of [[parish magazine]]s to reprint the story, which were granted.&lt;ref name=bowmen/&gt; In the introduction to ''The Bowmen and Other Legends of the War'' (1915) Machen relates that an unnamed priest, the editor of one of these magazines, subsequently wrote to him asking if he would allow the story to be reprinted in [[pamphlet]] form, and if he would write a short preface giving sources for the story. Machen replied that they were welcome to reprint but he could not give any sources for the story since he had none. The priest replied that Machen must be mistaken, that the "facts" of the story must be true, and that Machen had just elaborated on a true account. As Machen later said:
{{quote|It seemed that my light fiction had been accepted by the congregation of this particular church as the solidest of facts; and it was then that it began to dawn on me that if I had failed in the art of letters, I had succeeded, unwittingly, in the art of deceit. This happened, I should think, some time in April, and the snowball of rumour that was then set rolling has been rolling ever since, growing bigger and bigger, till it is now swollen to a monstrous size.|Arthur Machen|Introduction to ''The Bowmen and Other Legends of the War''&lt;ref name=bowmen/&gt;}}

Around that time variations of the story began to appear, told as authentic histories, including an account that told how the corpses of German soldiers had been found on the battlefield with arrow wounds.&lt;ref name=bowmen/&gt;

In "The Bowmen" Machen's soldier saw "a long line of shapes, with a shining about them." A Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]], writing in the ''Occult Review'', stated that "those who could see said they saw 'a row of shining beings' between the two armies." This led Machen to suggest that the bowmen of his story had become the Angels of Mons.&lt;ref name=bowmen/&gt; This last point was challenged by Harold Begbie in his book: ''On the Side of the Angels: A Reply to Arthur Machen'', London 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzBtU0xa69u0YVV3dG5wZU45SjQ/edit?usp=sharing Begbie, On the Side of the Angels]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angels===
{{refimprove|date=November 2013|section}}
On 24 April 1915, an account was published in the British ''[[Spiritualist]]'' magazine telling of [[vision (religion)|visions]] of a supernatural force that [[miracle|miraculously]] intervened to help the British at the decisive moment of the battle.&lt;ref name="clarke_rum"&gt;David Clarke, [http://articles.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_113/ai_95107633/ “Rumours of Angels: A Legend of the First World War – Detailed Study”,]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Folklore'', October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This rapidly resulted in a flurry of similar accounts and the spread of wild rumours. Descriptions of this force varied from it being medieval [[longbow]] archers alongside [[St. George]] to a strange luminous cloud, though eventually the most popular version came to be [[angel|angelic warriors]]. Similar tales of such battlefield visions occurred in medieval and ancient warfare. Atrocity reports like the [[Rape of Belgium]] and that of [[the Crucified Soldier]] paved the way for a belief that the Christian God would intervene directly against such an evil enemy. However, there are strong similarities between many of these accounts of visions and Machen's story published six months earlier.

In May 1915 a full-blown controversy was erupting, with the angels being used as proof of the action of [[divine providence]] on the side of the Allies in sermons across Britain, and then spreading into newspaper reports published widely across the world. Machen, bemused by all this, attempted to end the rumours by republishing the story in August in book form, with a long preface stating the rumours were false and originated in his story. It became a [[bestseller]], and resulted in a vast series of other publications claiming to provide evidence of the Angels' existence.&lt;ref name=bowmen/&gt; Machen tried to set the record straight, but any attempt to lessen the impact of such an inspiring story was seen as bordering on [[treason]] by some. These new publications included popular songs and artists' renderings of the angels. There were more reports of angels and [[vision (spirituality)|apparitions]] from the front including [[Joan of Arc]].

Kevin McClure's study describes two types of accounts circulating, some more clearly based on Machen, others with different details.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Maclure, [http://netowne.com/angels-christian/angels/index.htm/ “Visions of Bowmen and Angels”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818132117/http://netowne.com/angels-christian/angels/index.htm/ |date=August 18, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a time of intense media interest all these reports allegedly confirming sightings of supernatural activity were second-hand and some of them were [[hoax]]es created by soldiers who were not even at Mons. A careful investigation by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1915 said of the first-hand testimony, "We have received none at all, and of testimony at second-hand we have none that would justify us in assuming the occurrence of any [[supernatural|supernormal]] phenomenon". The SPR went on to say the stories relating to battlefield "visions" which circulated during the spring and summer of 1915, "prove on investigation to be founded on mere rumour, and cannot be traced to any authoritative source.”&lt;ref name="clarke_rum" /&gt; Given that the Society for Psychical Research believed in the existence of supernatural forces, the conclusions of this report are highly significant.

The sudden spread of the rumours in the spring of 1915, six months after the events and Machen's story was published, is also puzzling. The stories published then often attribute their sources to anonymous British officers. The latest and most detailed examination of the Mons story by [[David Clarke (journalist)|David Clarke]] suggests these men may have been part of a covert attempt by military intelligence to spread morale-boosting [[propaganda]] and [[disinformation]]. As it was a time of Allied problems with the [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] sinking, [[Zeppelin]] attacks and failure to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, the timing would make military sense. Some of the stories conveniently claimed that sources could not be revealed for security reasons.&lt;ref name="clarke_book"&gt;David Clarke, ''The Angel of Mons: Phantom Soldiers and Ghostly Guardians'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The only real evidence of visions from actual named serving soldiers provided during the debate stated that they saw visions of phantom cavalrymen, not angels or bowmen, and this occurred during the retreat rather than at the battle itself. Furthermore, these visions did not intervene to attack or deter German forces, a crucial element in Machen's story and in the later tales of angels. Since during the retreat many troops were exhausted and had not slept properly for days, such visions could be hallucinations.&lt;ref name="clarke_rum" /&gt;

According to the conclusion of the most detailed study of the event it seems that Machen's story provided the genesis for the vast majority of the tales. The stories themselves certainly boosted [[morale]] on the home front, as popular enthusiasm was dying down in 1915 and they demonstrate the usefulness of religion in wartime.&lt;ref name="clarke_book" /&gt;

==Post-war developments==
{{refimprove|date=November 2013|section}}
After the war the story continued to be frequently repeated  but no evidence to support the claim that the angels existed was ever given by those who were there. The best evidence provided was in Brigadier-General [[John Charteris]]' memoirs ''At G.H.Q.'', published in 1931, which said the story of the Angels of Mons was a popular rumour amongst the troops in September 1914; this was the earliest any account said the rumour was in circulation. However it appears from examination of his original letters he wrote those entries after the war and falsified the dates.&lt;ref&gt;David Clarke, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_1_115/ai_n6118622/pg_1 “Rumours of Angels: a response to Simpson”,] ''Folklore'',  April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Given his association with pieces of allied propaganda like the story of the “German Corpse-Rendering Works” (''[[Kadaververwertungsanstalt]]'') this might indicate Charteris had been behind an attempt to use the angels for propaganda purposes.

Machen was associated with the story for the rest of his life and grew sick of the connection, as he regarded “The Bowmen” as a poor piece of work. He made little money from the story then or later.

The sudden revival of interest in appearances of angels from the 1980s onwards, especially in the United States, not only amongst Christians, but those interested in the [[New Age]], has caused uncritical accounts of the story of the angels who saved the British Army to be regularly published in books and magazines. Similarly, the story is also often used by [[sceptic]]s as a good example of how believers in the supernatural can become convinced of fantastic things by slender evidence.&lt;ref&gt;James Randi, [http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Angels%20of%20Mons.html “Angels of Mons”,] ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural''.&lt;/ref&gt; References to the story can be found in World War I set novels and films like ''[[FairyTale: A True Story]]''. [[The Friends of Arthur Machen]] frequently publish articles on developments in the case.

===William Doidge hoax===
{{refimprove|date=November 2013|section}}
In 2001, an article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' claimed that a diary, film and photographic evidence proving the existence of the Angels of Mons from a World War I soldier named William Doidge had been found. The article discussed a long involved story in which Doidge was involved with an American GI and an angel seen years later in [[Woodchester Mansion]]. It was claimed [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye]] were going to spend £350,000 to buy the evidence to make a film. Other papers like ''Variety'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and television programmes soon followed up the story and a website connected to the mystery became very popular. The footage was supposedly found in a trunk in an [[antique shop]] by Danny Sullivan in [[Monmouth]], close to Machen's birthplace of [[Caerleon]]. In 2002, in a BBC Radio documentary; ''The Making of an Urban Myth'', Sullivan admitted the story was a complete hoax to drum up interest in Woodchester Mansion; the footage and soldier never existed.&lt;ref&gt;David Clarke, [http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/213/the_angel_of_mons.html “Angels on the Battlefield”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316005857/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/213/the_angel_of_mons.html |date=2008-03-16 }}, ''Fortean Times'', May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''April 2018 inter-Korean summit''' took place on April 27 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seoul proposes high-level talks about Pyongyang summit|url=http://english1.president.go.kr/korea/korea.php?srh%5Bboard_no%5D=29&amp;srh%5Bview_mode%5D=detail&amp;srh%5Bseq%5D=20313&amp;srh%5Bdetail_no%5D=290&amp;srh%5Bpage%5D=|accessdate= 21 March 2018|website=Cheong Wa Dae|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the South Korean side of the [[Joint Security Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/world/asia/kim-yo-jong-history-facts.html|title=Kim Jong-un Invites South Korean Leader to North for Summit Meeting|last=Choe|first=Sang-Hun|date=9 February 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Moon Jae-in]], [[President of South Korea]], and [[Kim Jong-un]], [[Leader of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea]], and Supreme Leader of North Korea. The summit was the third [[Inter-Korean summits|inter-Korean summit]] – and the first in eleven years. It was also the first time since the end of the [[Korean War]] in 1953 that a North Korean leader entered the South's territory; President Moon also briefly crossed into the North's territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/kim-offers-to-visit-seoul-any-time-if-you-invite-me-south-korea-10181246|title=Kim offers to visit Seoul 'any time if you invite me': South Korea|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The summit took place after the two sides held several meetings in preparation for the joint attendance at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. The idea initially was brought forward through an official invitation from the North&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-has-invited-south-koreas-moon-jae-in-to-pyongyang/2018/02/10/d7db9dde-0ddd-11e8-998c-96deb18cca19_story.html|title= North Korea's Kim Jong Un invites South Korea's president to Pyongyang |accessdate=29 March 2018|date=10 February 2018|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct a meeting. The summit was focused on the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korean nuclear weapons program]] and denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The [[Panmunjom Declaration]] was made following the summit.

==Agenda==
The two Koreas' high government officials held a working-level meeting on 4 April 2018 to discuss summit details at the [[Peace House]] in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. The agenda was planned to include denuclearization, peace establishment and improvement of inter-Korean relations for their mutual benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/north-and-south-korea-set-date-for-summit-between-leaders/9603274 |title=North and South Korea set date for historic summit |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 March 2018 |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/840335.html|title=President Moon views inter-Korean summit as opportunity to take a firm step toward peace|last=Bo-hyeop|first=Kim|last2=Ji-eun|first2=Kim|date=12 April 2018|website=The Hankyoreh|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although more than 200 [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] called for the inclusion of human rights issues in the North and Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] for its [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens|abducted citizens]] in the agenda, these were not included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/north-korea-human-rights-issues-summit-agenda-180412091005238.html |title=north-korea-human-rights-issues-summit-agenda |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=29 March 2018 |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting==
[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit square.jpg|thumb|Moon and Kim shaking hands over the [[demarcation line]]]]
The [[Peace House]] was accepted by North Korea for the meeting's location, from among the venues proposed by South Korea, located just south of the [[military demarcation line]] in the [[Joint Security Area]] of [[Panmunjeom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Taehoon|title=South Korea says North Korea agrees to hold high-level talks|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/23/asia/koreas-talks/index.html|accessdate=24 March 2018|publisher=CNN|date=24 March 2018}}

The meeting was the first visit by a North Korean leader to the territory of the [[South Korea|South Area]] after the [[Korean War]] 1950-53.&lt;ref name="Telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Nicola|last2=Graham|first2=Chris|last3=Davies|first3=Gareth|title=Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in commit to Korean 'peace regime' to end nuclear conflict at historic summit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/27/kim-jong-un-becomes-first-north-korean-leader-cross-south-65/|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This initial meeting of the two leaders, who shook hands over the [[demarcation line]], was broadcast live. Moon accepted an invitation from Kim to briefly step over to the North's side of the line, a seemingly impromptu moment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43914208|title=Kim pledges 'new history' for Koreas|date=2018-04-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, before the two walked together to the Peace House.&lt;ref name="BBC_pledge" /&gt;

As well as the talks, the two leaders conducted a tree-planting ceremony using soil and water from both sides and attended a banquet.&lt;ref name="BBC_pledge" /&gt; Many elements of the meeting were expressly designed for symbolism, including an oval meeting table measuring {{convert|2018|mm}} to represent the year.&lt;ref name="Telegraph1" /&gt;

===Other attendees===
The two leaders were accompanied by their wives, [[Kim Jung-sook]] and [[Ri Sol-ju]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph1" /&gt; and a number of other individuals were present at the meeting:&lt;ref name="ABC_delegates"&gt;{{cite news|last1=News|first1=A.

==Dokdo desserts and Japanese culinary complaint==
[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit 06.jpg|thumb|Kim and Moon dining at the summit]]
On 24 April 2018, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Foreign Ministry]] protested to the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the State of Japan, citing the appearance of desserts named "Dokdo" on the dinner menu used during the summit. Dokdo is the Korean name of [[Liancourt Rocks|a small island group]], known as Takeshima in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], midway between the Republic of Korea and Japan. It is the subject of a [[Liancourt Rocks dispute|long-standing sovereignty dispute]]. The [[mango]] [[mousse]] desserts were accompanied by Korean-style decorations and a depiction of the Korean peninsula that included the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/T3Ob3|title=首脳夕食会に竹島描いたデザート、日本政府抗議|date=25 April 2018|website=Yomiuri Shimbun|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2018, [[Tarō Kōno]], the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, said he felt it was unnecessary to have a "Dokdo" dessert and reiterated claims that the island group is a territory of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2018/04/27/0200000000AKR20180427112200073.HTML|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427145341/http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2018/04/27/0200000000AKR20180427112200073.HTML|archivedate=2018-04-27|title=日, 남북정상회담 '독도 디저트'에 또 트집…"매우 불필요" 딴지|date=27 April 2018|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complaint, the Dokdo desserts were served to both Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un during the summit.&lt;ref name=dokdo1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-s-vow-shut-punggye-ri-nuclear-site-appears-n869991|title=The nuclear site Kim Jong Un vowed to shut may already be 'useless'|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dokdo2&gt;https://www.alamy.com/moon-jae-in-and-kim-jong-un-apr-27-2018-south-korean-president-moon-jae-in-r-and-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-use-mallets-to-open-mango-mousse-decorated-with-a-flag-symbolizing-an-unified-korean-peninsula-during-a-banquet-after-the-historic-inter-korean-summit-at-the-peace-house-of-the-panmunjom-in-the-demilitarized-zone-dmz-separating-the-two-koreas-in-paju-north-of-seoul-south-korea-the-historic-summit-ended-on-april-27-with-calls-for-the-complete-denuclearization-of-the-korean-peninsula-and-an-immediate-halt-to-all-hostile-acts-local-media-reported-editorial-use-only-photo-image182486441.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dokdo3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/asean-plus/30344199|title=2018 Inter-Korean summit: Conversation between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un - The Nation|author=|date=|website=nationmultimedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both also personally cracked open their desserts with small mallets to symbolize a new relationship.&lt;ref name=dokdo1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dokdo2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dokdo3 /&gt;

==Joint press conference and agreement==
{{Main|Panmunjom Declaration}}
[[File:Korea Summit 2018 v1.jpg|thumb|Kim and Moon signing the [[Panmunjom Declaration]]]]
In a joint press conference, Kim and Moon made a number of pledges regarding co-operation and peace.&lt;ref name="BBC_pledge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Koreas make nuclear pledge after summit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43921385|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=''BBC News''|date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, these included a pledge to work towards the denuclearization of the [[Korean peninsula]], although Kim did not explicitly agree to give up the North's nuclear weapons. Additionally the two leaders agreed to, later in the year, convert the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] into a full [[peace treaty]], formally ending the [[Korean War]] after 65 years.&lt;ref name="BBC_pledge"/&gt; Additionally, the leaders pledged to end "hostile activities" between their nations, for the resumption of reunion meetings for [[Divided family#Division of the Korean peninsula|divided families]], to improve connections along their border, and for the cessation of [[Korean Demilitarized Zone#Propaganda|propaganda broadcasts]] across it.&lt;ref name="BBC_pledge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/apr/27/north-and-south-korea-summit-leaders-prepare-for-historic-inter-korean-meeting-live|title=Korea summit: Trump hails 'end of the Korean war' – as it happened|first1=Matthew Weaver|last1=(now)|first2=Hannah Ellis-Petersen|last2=(earlier)|first3=Lily|last3=Kuo|first4=Matthew|last4=Weaver|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/04/103_247427.html|title=Seoul seeks Moon-Kim joint press conference after April 27 summit|date=17 April 2018|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was known as the [[Panmunjom Declaration]] for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula and was signed by both leaders in the South Korean border village of Panmunjom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-panmmunjom-declaration-full-text-of-agreement-between-north-korea-and-south-korea/|title=The full text of North and South Korea's agreement, annotated|first=Adam|last=Taylor|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press conference was shown live on South Korean television; however, live coverage was not available in North Korea&lt;ref name=liveevents&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/why-inter-korean-summit-was-broadcast-live-everywhere-but-north-korea-2018-4/?international=true&amp;r=UK|title=Kim Jong Un's historic peace talks were broadcast everywhere except North Korea – here's why he keeps his people in the dark|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the country's policy is not to broadcast live events involving its leader.&lt;ref name=liveevents /&gt;

The leaders pledged greater communication between them, and that Moon would visit [[Pyongyang]] in late 2018.&lt;ref name="Telegraph1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

In the aftermath of the summit, it was agreed that the loudspeakers in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] were dismantled beginning on 1 May.&lt;ref name=may1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/01/607399907/north-and-south-korea-dismantle-loudspeakers-blaring-propaganda-on-the-dmz |title=North And South Korea Dismantle Loudspeakers Blaring Propaganda On The DMZ : The Two-Way |publisher=NPR |date=2018-05-01 |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment was fulfilled as planned&lt;ref name=may1 /&gt; and both sides also committed to ending their [[Balloon propaganda campaigns in Korea|balloon propaganda campaigns]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-05/south-korea-faces-decision-over-leaflets-ties-warm-north&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, North Korea agreed to realign its time with South Korea.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westcott|first1=Ben|last2=Yoonjung|first2=Seo|last3=Watkins|first3=Eli|title=North Korea will close main nuclear test site in May, South says|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/28/asia/north-korea-nuclear-site-time-zone-intl/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news_id=NB11626847|title=혼란 주던 '30분 시차' 사라진다…서울 표준시로 "통일"|date=2018-04-29|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May, North Korea changed its time zone so it would match that of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44010705|title=North Korea changes its time zone|author=|date=5 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on May 5, an attempt by North Korean defectors to continue the balloon campaign across the border from South Korea was halted by the South Korean government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/05/south-korea-sabotages-anti-north-korea-leaflet-drop/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Assistance League was established in 1919 by the philanthropic efforts of Anne Banning (daughter-in-law of [[Phineas Banning]]) and Ada Edwards Laughlin (daughter-in-law of [[Homer Laughlin]]) to form Assistance League of Southern California. Anne Banning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://societynewsla.com/assistance-league-of-southern-california-founders-day/ |title=Assistance League of Southern California Founders Day |publisher=Society News LA |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a leading philanthropist of her time, with a mission to aid families in distress as a result of World War I. Her vision to provide service to all in need, regardless of their race, religion or culture, laid the foundation for the future of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanjoaquinmagazine.com/sanjoaquin/2013/09/upfront2092.php |title=Assistance League of Stockton |publisher=San Joaquin Magazine |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Assistance League thrift shop opened as a revenue source for the philanthropic programs: Day Nursery, Girl’s Club, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll44/id/102671

 |title=Junior auxiliary members cooking for girl’s club of Assistance League party, 1951 |publisher=USC Digital Library |date=1951-12-04 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Assistance League called on daughters and granddaughters of its members to assist in various philanthropic projects. This participation developed into Assisteens, a youth focused program of volunteerism for grades seven to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scvelitemagazine.com/features/749-our-youth-leading-the-way |title=Our Youth...Leading the Way |publisher=Elite Magazine |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408230157/http://scvelitemagazine.com/features/749-our-youth-leading-the-way |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1935 neighboring communities sprouted affiliate chapters and a national representation was beginning to organize under the guidelines of Ada Laughlin. In August 1949 National Assistance League was formed.

Since its inception, the Assistance League has had the support of [[Hollywood]] celebrities participating in volunteerism and charitable events. It was not uncommon to see celebrities like [[Jean Harlow]] reading stories to children in need,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1970&amp;dat=19321226&amp;id=gSExAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MeMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4489,6302927 |title=Latest World News Pictures: Jean Harlow Brings Christmas Cheer to Kiddies |publisher=Berkeley Daily Gazette |date=1932-12-26 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudia Dell]] waiting tables for a good cause&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hollywoodheyday.blogspot.com/2009/03/march-18-1932.html

The Assistance League and its chapters have won numerous awards including being nominated and winning the All-Star Award for Make a Difference Day in 2012 and 2013, an annual recognition to individuals and organizations making the biggest impact nationally through volunteerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/weekend/living/2014/04/04/make-a-difference-day-awards-assistance-league-honored/7296763/ |title=Make a Difference Day Awards: Assistance League honored |publisher=USA Today |date=2014-04-04 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Astor Opera House''', also known as the '''Astor Place Opera House''' and later the '''Astor Place Theatre''',&lt;ref&gt;Not the same as the current [[Astor Place Theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt; was an opera house in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], located on [[Lafayette Street (Manhattan)|Lafayette Street]] between [[Astor Place]] and [[8th Street (Manhattan)|East 8th Street]].  Designed by [[Isaiah Rogers]], the theater was conceived by impresario Edward Fry, the brother of composer [[William Henry Fry]], who managed the opera house during its entire history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oks8-lgwlgC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Baltimore%22+%22Max+Maretzek%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIwofsuu3yxgIVA9SACh01QQeF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Baltimore%22%20%22Max%20Maretzek%22&amp;f=false|title=Good Music for a Free People: The Germania Musical Society in Nineteenth-century America|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2010|author=Newman, Nancy|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g724&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.724&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera House ==

Fry engaged the Sanquerico and Patti Opera Company under the management of John Sefton to perform the first season of opera at the house. The opera house opened on November 22, 1847 with a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'' with Adelino Vietti in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, p.515&lt;/ref&gt; Sefton and his company were not re-engaged by Fry, and the opera management of the house went to Cesare Lietti for the second season. During his tenure the opera house presented the United States premiere of Verdi's ''[[Nabucco]]'' on April 4, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEYA8_RARL0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Boston+Theatre%22+%22Max+Maretzek%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwjipKjEuPLGAhUN4oAKHYjAAUA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Boston%20Theatre%22%20%22Max%20Maretzek%22&amp;f=false|title=Verdi in America: Oberto Through Rigoletto|author=Martin, George Whitney|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2011|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lietti was also replaced after one season, and the Astor's third and longest lasting opera manager, [[Max Maretzek]], was hired for the third season which commenced in November 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, pp.515-543&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Maretzek founded his own opera company, the [[Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company]], with whom he continued to stage operas at the Astor Opera House through 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/11/23/89147004.pdf|title=Even the Prima Donna Blushed'|author=[[Harold C.

Lee |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Maretzek the opera house saw the New York premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' on January 7, 1850 with soprano Apollonia Bertucca (later Maretzek's wife) as the title heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMxQrkQTLHYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Astor%22+%22Maretzek%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIq_Ds5pnwxgIVBMyACh1pag2d#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Italian%20opera%22&amp;f=false|title=Strong on Music: The New York Music Scene in the Days of George Templeton|author=Lawrence, Vera Brodsky|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was built with the intention of attracting only the "best" patrons, the "[[uppertens]]" of New York society, who were increasingly turning out to see European singers who appeared at local venues such as [[Niblo's Garden]].  It was expected that an opera house would be: &lt;blockquote&gt;a substitute for a general drawing room &amp;ndash; a refined attraction which the ill-mannered would not be likely to frequent, and around which the higher classes might gather, for the easier interchange of courtesies, and for that closer view which aides the candidacy of acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Parker Willis, quoted in Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.724&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In pursuit of this agenda, the theatre was created with the comfort of the upper classes in mind: benches, the normal seating in theatres at the time, were replaced by upholstered seats, available only by subscription, as were the two tiers of boxes.  On the other hand, 500 general admission patrons were relegated to the benches of a "cockloft" reachable only by a narrow stairway, and otherwise isolated from the gentry below,&lt;ref name=g724 /&gt; and the theatre enforced a dress code which required "freshly shaven faces, evening dress, and kid gloves."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.760&lt;/ref&gt;

Limiting the attendance of the lower classes was partly intended to avoid the problems of rowdyism which plagued other theaters in the entertainment district at the time, especially in the theatres on [[the Bowery]].  Nevertheless, it was the deadly [[Astor Place riot]] in 1849 which caused the theatre to close permanently &amp;ndash; provoked by competing performances of ''[[Macbeth]]'' by English actor [[William Charles Macready]] at the Opera House (which was operating under the name "Astor Place Theatre", not being able to sustain itself on a full season of opera) and American [[Edwin Forrest]] at the nearby Broadway Theatre. 

== Clinton Hall == 

After the riot, the theater was unable to overcome the reputation of being the "Massacre Opera House" at "DisAster Place."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.765&lt;/ref&gt;  By May 1853, the interior had been dismantled and the furnishings sold off, with the shell of the building sold for $140,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/06/01/75368321.pdf "The Mercantile Library"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (June 1, 1854)&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[New York Mercantile Library]], which renamed the building "Clinton Hall".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1853/05/27/87854876.pdf "Exclusiveness"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (May 27, 1853)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1890, in need of additional space, the Association tore down the opera house building and replaced it with an 11-story building, also called Clinton Hall, which still stands on the site.&lt;ref&gt;White, Norval &amp; Willensky, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beverly Homer DeLay''' (August 12, 1891 – July 4, 1923) was an American [[aviator]], engineer and actor.

==Biography==
DeLay was born in [[Alameda, California]] on August 12, 1891. He was educated at the Engineering School of the [[University of California]] and at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany.

DeLay first worked as a gold mine manager, then became a [[racecar]] driver, and later airport manager and owner, which evolved into performing for motion pictures. DeLay's early daredevil style was theatrically demonstrated in his high-speed race moves in the domed dance pavilion on [[Pickering Pleasure Pier]] in [[Ocean Park, California]]. His theatrical family entertainment history reaches back over 100 years to Europe, including stage actors, dancers, musicians, and theatre impresarios.

He died on July 4, 1923.

==Aircraft==
DeLay tirelessly promoted aviation, while pushing the limits in the entertainment industry, especially through innovative performances. He implemented the first lighted airport in the United States on DeLay Airfield.&lt;ref&gt;''DeLay to Have the First Lighted Aviation Field,'' Venice Vanguard, May 15, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; He also initiated the first aerial police in the nation in [[Venice, Los Angeles]]. DeLay was inspired to this action after a marine rescue attempt was thwarted. He proposed that his aerial forces, equipped with flotation devices, be ready for rescue at a moments notice. This force was approved through the Board of Directors of the Venice Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice to Have First Life-Saving Aerial Patrol: Aviator De Lay to Keep Pilot and Plane Equipped With Buoys on Duty at Beach,'' Venice Vanguard, March 14, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; When DeLay took charge of Ince Airfield (Venice Airfield) he was on a mission so that “the passenger service will be advanced to a degree of perfection and safety never before attained.”

DeLay was a constant aviation promoter through staging exhibitions (including [[barnstorming]]) and through performing aviation firsts for the movies. Some of his airshow expertise included the nose dive, ghost dive, [[Immelmann turn]], barrel rolls, tail spins, multiple loop-the-loops, mock battles, racing, and flying fireworks. DeLay pioneered several aviation firsts for the motion pictures. (details in the next section)

During his ten years of flying experience, DeLay conducted aerial rides with politicians, actors, and unusual personalities, such as opera diva ([[Luisa Tetrazzini]]) and a princess (Tsianina). He threw out the game opener baseball from his plane to DeLay Field as he flew over. The semi-pro baseball team he named for Venice, was called the Highflyers.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice Players to Be Called "Highflyers",'' Venice Vanguard, May 3, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped event tickets, flew city engineers to produce aerial maps of Venice, and showered other promotional or ceremonial objects for events, such as masses of flowers over the ocean as tributes to war heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''Airship Floral Offerings for Chas. Dewey (World War Hero),'' Venice Vanguard, June 18, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; DeLay and several of his planes were also in movie aviator [[Ormer Locklear]]’s aerial funeral procession.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Tribute (B.H. DeLay Commands Six Planes in Aerial Funeral for Lieutenant Locklear),'' Venice Vanguard, August 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; In a promotion of Venice as a leading entertainment destination, DeLay flew a night loop-the-loop “fire ride” with fireworks on the back of his plane, while 20 navy destroyer ships flashed their search lights upon the horizon for his performance. DeLay was driven to advance aviation with continuous feats, such as proving that loop-the-loops could be performed at night.&lt;ref&gt;''DeLay Will Do Rare Stunt at Night, Venice Vanguard,'' May 24, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current developed site of DeLay Airfield is bordered by Venice Blvd., Abbot Kinney Blvd. and Washington Way: [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=venice+blvd+and+abbot+kinney+blvd,+venice,+ca&amp;sll=33.988478,-118.462084&amp;sspn=0.003243,0.007135&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.989052,-118.462438&amp;spn=0.003243,0.007135&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=0 GOOGLE Satellite Map of DeLay Airfield site.]

==Aviation firsts for the motion pictures==
B.H. DeLay performed at least half a dozen stunt firsts for the movies, including the first change from plane to train and train to plane. Another DeLay first was from saddle to plane, as well as auto to plane. "Daredevil" DeLay was the first to knock down a building with a plane on screen as well.

In one of DeLay's contracts he was engaged to rescue the heroine from the top of a burning building and at the same time he was to crash into the burning tower where the villain was hanging on to a flag pole, knocking over the tower and dashing the villain to his death. This scene was successfully performed with the aid of a setting constructed at the Venice Field.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

==Motion picture performing==
DeLay Field (Venice Field) was previously owned by [[Thomas Harper Ince]], the director and producer who is well known for inventing the motion picture studio system. B.H. DeLay managed Thomas Ince's field before owning it. DeLay was in numerous motion pictures, including westerns, comedies and dramas. He acted and performed aerials with [[Ruth Roland]], [[Oliver Hardy]], [[Larry Semon]], [[Milton Sills]], [[Agnes Ayres]], [[Florence Vidor]], [[Al St. John]], [[Helen Holmes]], [[Viola Dana]], [[Warner Oland]], [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]], [[Ormer Locklear]], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932957/ Al Wilson], [http://www.answers.com/topic/frank-clarke Frank Clarke], and many other notables. DeLay’s character was also well respected by the [[Warner Bros.]] Jack Warner wrote that DeLay was a "real flyer..."

B.H. DeLay conducted a movie stunt pilot training school at his airfield in Venice. DeLay worked with over 25 motion picture companies including the original [[Warner Bros.]], [[Pathé]], [[Vitagraph]], [https://www.imdb.com/company/co0037577/ Astra], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], and [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Ace Magazine "Aviation and the Moving Picture Industry: Airplanes Play Important Part in Up-to-Date Movies", November 1921. (B.H. De Lay featured)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Hugh. (1987) ''The Motion Picture Stunt Pilots &amp; Hollywoods Classic Aviation Movies'', Montana: Pictorial Histories Publishing. {{ISBN|0-933126-85-9}} De Lay Pages: 8, 20, 22, 24, 28, 30, 34)&lt;/ref&gt; (B.H. DeLay Aircraft Company advertising cites several of the following movies (below) to encourage the glamorous role of stunt aviation for the movies.)

==Unsolved mystery==
B.H. DeLay was 31 when he died (along with passenger aviator, R.I. Short, President of the Essandee Corporation) in a sabotaged plane crash performing in front of crowds of thousands at Ocean Park on July 4, 1923. He was in the middle of a loop-the-loop in his plane, the "Wasp", when the wings folded back; barreling them nose first into the earth. The plane burst into flames shortly after they were pulled from the wreckage. Pins in his wings were found to be a substandard size of only 3/8 of an inch, rather than 1/2 or 3/4, indicating wing tampering. Several headlines from Venice and other Los Angeles newspapers state that DeLay was murdered through sabotage while performing on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;''Police Investigating First Aerial Murder: B. H. De Lay'', The Coshocton Tribune, July 15, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sheriff Suspects Aerial Murder (of B. H. DeLay, Well Known Stunt Aviator),'' The Indianapolis Star, July 7, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Last Rites for De Lay Tomorrow: Services for Famous Flyer Have Been Arranged for at Los Angeles Crematory,'' Los Angeles Times, July 6, 1923. ("DeLay was nationally known for his daring stunts in the air.")&lt;/ref&gt; It remains an unsolved murder mystery.

He was also shot at in Clover Field (now [[Santa Monica Airport]]) days before his crash.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A couple of other incidents occurred before the crash as well. In 1921, DeLay and seven others (including his lawyer, [[Francis J. Heney]]), were brought into court.&lt;ref&gt;* DeLay Airfield Case &amp; Lawyer: [[Francis J. Heney]]&lt;/ref&gt; C. E. Frey, who insisted that he bought DeLay Airfield—yet he had no proof—had a couple of his thugs plant posts in DeLay's airport so that planes could not take off. After DeLay had his crew remove the posts, C. E. Frey's gang dug trenches so that the planes could not take off. C. E. Frey ended up in jail with B.H. DeLay, C. Y. DeLay (B.H.'s father), G. F. Stephenson, Howard Patterson, along with others such as stunt performers, Frank Clarke and pilots Wallace Timm and Glen Boyd. DeLay had purchased the airport from the Crawford Airplane Company in September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, 1973 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only was B. H. DeLay an innovator, he was a humanitarian who frequently organized and performed in aviation or actor benefits for individuals and organizations in need.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice to Aid Families in Distress,'' Venice Vanguard, July 15, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movies with DeLay==
DeLay was involved (acting, aviation &amp; stunt directing/coordinating) with over 50 movies including:
* ''Skin Deep'' (A.K.A. Lucky Damage) 1922 ([[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]])

* ''A Dangerous Adventure'' 1922 ([[Warner Bros.]]) Starring [[Grace Darmond]] &amp; including Jumbo the Elephant
* ''The Bell Hop'' 1921 ([[Oliver Hardy]] &amp; [[Larry Semon]] movie –including aviation footage, which is impressive by today's standards. It is also still available to the public.)

"[In 1922] DeLay dominated stunts in the motion picture industry." (Wynne 1987:28)

==DeLay's Crew==
* DeLay performed live at actor benefits with [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Tom Mix]], [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], [[Will Rogers]], [[William S. Hart]], [[Buck Jones]], [[Hoot Gibson]] and other notables.&lt;ref&gt;''Good Exhibition,'' Venice Vanguard, February 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''De Lay to Give Fire Ride for Gigantic Actors' Benefit,'' Los Angeles Times, c1922.&lt;/ref&gt;
* B. H. DeLay's daughter, Beverley De Lay, was a [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1334939/ Meglin Kiddie] dancer like [[Shirley Temple]] and was in the ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz|Land of Oz]]'' 1932 movie. His daughter, Beverley, also attended [[Hollywood High School]] at the same time as [[Judy Garland]]. Beverley also performed live at the still glorious [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)]].
* DeLay attended the famous Fly-in (only) Party of the Brand Estate, where he was nearly involved in a head-on collision with [[Anita Snook]] (Teacher of [[Amelia Earhart]].) He was aerial performing for the crowd, but Snook had to leave early and ended up in his flying path. At the last moment, DeLay dove under Snook's plane. His propellers were shaved off in the trees, but both of their lives were saved. (Underwood 1984:21)
* B. H. DeLay had various aircraft specially designed for him and he owned a set of [[Curtiss JN-4]] (JN-4D specifically) at his airport.
* Aviators who worked with or for DeLay's Venice Airfield included: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932957/ Al Wilson ], [http://www.answers.com/topic/frank-clarke Frank Clarke], [[Ormer Locklear]], [[Dick Grace]], [[Otto Timm]], Art Goebel (winner of [[Dole Air Race]]), "Fronty" Nichols, Frank Tomick, Ivan Unger, Al Johnson, Wallace Timm, Howard Patterson, Glen Boyd, Mark Campbell, Otto "Swede" Myerhoffer, Bob Lloyd, E. L. Remelin, Waldo Waterman, Fred Hoyt, Gil Budwig, Sam Greenwald, and many more.

'''Black Wednesday''' occurred in the [[United Kingdom]] on 16 September 1992, when [[John Major]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) after it was unable to keep the pound above its agreed lower limit in the ERM. In 1997, the [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]] estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dury|first1=Hélène|title=Black_Wednesday|url=http://is.muni.cz/el/1456/podzim2011/MPF_AFIN/um/27608616/27608949/Black_Wednesday.pdf|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, documents released under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] indicated that the actual cost may have been slightly less, £3.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/feb/09/freedomofinformation.uk1|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday|first=Matthew|last=Tempest|date=9 February 2005|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the United Kingdom held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Communities]].

The trading losses in August and September were estimated at £800&amp;nbsp;million, but the main loss to taxpayers arose because [[devaluation]] could have made them a profit. The Treasury papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the papers and full list of documents|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130403000951/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/foi_erm4_2005.htm|archive-date=3 April 2013|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/foi_erm4_2005.htm|publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that if the government had maintained $24&amp;nbsp;billion foreign currency reserves and the pound had fallen by the same amount, the UK would have made a £2.4&amp;nbsp;billion profit on the pound sterling's devaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Harold|title=The Cost of Black Wednesday Reconsidered|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130403000951/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Cost_Black_Weds_reconsidered.pdf|archive-date=3 April 2013|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Cost_Black_Weds_reconsidered.pdf|page=4|publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
When the ERM was set up in 1979, the United Kingdom declined to join. This was a controversial decision, as the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Geoffrey Howe]], was staunchly pro-European. His successor, [[Nigel Lawson]], a believer in a [[fixed exchange rate]], admired the low inflationary record of [[West Germany]]. He attributed it to the strength of the [[Deutsche Mark]] and the management of the [[Bundesbank]]. Thus, although the UK had not joined the ERM, from early 1987 to March 1988 the Treasury followed a semi-official policy of 'shadowing' the Deutsche Mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Not while I'm alive, he ain't – Part 4 Thatcher and Lawson|work=[[The Westminster Hour]]|publisher=BBC  Radio 4|date=15 May 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/the_westminster_hour/archive/2318013.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matters came to a head in a clash between Lawson and Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s economic adviser [[Alan Walters]], when Walters claimed that the Exchange Rate Mechanism was "half baked".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

This led to Lawson's resignation as chancellor to be replaced by his old [[protégé]] [[John Major]], who, with [[Douglas Hurd]], the then [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], convinced the Cabinet to sign Britain up to the ERM in October 1990, effectively guaranteeing that the British government would follow an economic and [[monetary policy]] preventing the [[exchange rate]] between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6%. On 8 October 1990, Thatcher entered the pound into the ERM mechanism at [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 2.95 to the pound. Hence, if the exchange rate ever neared the bottom of its permitted range, DM 2.773 (€1.4178 at the DM/Euro conversion rate), the government would be obliged to intervene. With UK inflation at three times the rate of Germany's, interest rates at 15%, it could be argued that the conditions for joining the ERM were not favourable at that time.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

From the beginning of the 1990s, high German [[interest rate]]s, set by the [[Bundesbank]] to counteract inflationary effects related to excess expenditure on [[German reunification]], caused significant stress across the whole of the ERM. The UK and Italy had additional difficulties with their [[double deficit (economics)|double deficit]]s, while the UK was also hurt by the rapid depreciation of the United States Dollar – a currency in which many British exports were priced – that summer. Issues of national prestige and the commitment to a doctrine that the fixing of exchange rates within the ERM was a pathway to a single European currency inhibited the adjustment of exchange rates. In the wake of the rejection of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] by the Danish electorate in a referendum in the spring of 1992, and announcement that there would be a referendum in France as well, those ERM currencies that were trading close to the bottom of their ERM bands came under pressure from foreign exchange traders.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In the months leading up to Black Wednesday, [[George Soros]] had been building a huge [[Position (finance)|short position]] in pounds sterling that would become immensely profitable if the pound fell below the lower band of the ERM. Soros recognized the unfavourable position at which the United Kingdom joined the ERM, believing the rate at which the UK was brought into the Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite book|title=More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite|author=Sebastian Mallaby|isbn=9781594202551|publisher=Penguin Press HC|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soros made over £1&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2773265/Billionaire-who-broke-the-Bank-of-England.html|title=Billionaire who broke the Bank of England|accessdate=24 February 2013|location=London, UK|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=David|last=Litterick|date=13 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; in profit by [[short selling]] sterling.

==The currency traders act==
{{moresources|section|date=January 2017}}
The UK government attempted to prop up the depreciating pound to avoid withdrawal from the monetary system the country had joined two years earlier. John Major raised interest rates to 10 percent and authorised the spending of billions worth of foreign currency reserves to buy up the sterling being sold on the currency markets, but the measures failed to prevent the pound falling below its minimum level in the ERM. The Treasury took the decision to defend the sterling's position, believing that to [[devalue]] would be to promote inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bootle|first=Roger|title=Pound fall is UK's get-out-of-jail-free card|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 April 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/04/28/ccom128.xml|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros' [[Quantum Fund]] began a massive sell-off of pounds on Tuesday, 15 September 1992. The Exchange Rate Mechanism stated that the Bank of England was required to accept any offers to sell pounds. However, the Bank of England only accepted orders during the trading day. When the markets opened in London the next morning, the Bank of England began their attempt to prop up their currency as per the decision made by [[Norman Lamont]] and [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton]], the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and Governor of the Bank of England respectively. They began buying orders to the amount of 300 million pounds twice before 8:30 AM to little effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Litterick|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2773265/Billionaire-who-broke-the-Bank-of-England.html|title=Billionaire who broke the Bank of England|publisher=Telegraph|date=13 September 2002|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank of England's intervention was ineffective because Soros' Quantum Fund was dumping pounds far faster. The Bank of England continued to buy and Quantum continued to sell until Lamont told Prime Minister John Major that their pound purchasing was failing to produce results.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

At 10:30 AM on 16 September, the British government announced a rise in the [[Bank base rate#Interest rates|base interest rate]] from an already high 10 to 12 percent to tempt speculators to buy pounds. Despite this and a promise later the same day to raise base rates again to 15 percent, dealers kept selling pounds, convinced that the government would not stick with its promise. By 7:00 that evening, [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]], then Chancellor, announced Britain would leave the ERM and rates would remain at the new level of 12 percent; however, on the next day the interest rate was back on 10%. 

It was later revealed that the decision to withdraw had been agreed at an emergency meeting during the day between [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]], Prime Minister [[John Major]], Foreign Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], President of the Board of Trade [[Michael Heseltine]], and Home Secretary [[Kenneth Clarke]] (the latter three all being staunch pro-[[European Union|Europeans]] as well as senior Cabinet Ministers), and that the interest rate hike to 15% had only been a temporary measure to prevent a rout in the pound that afternoon.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Aftermath==
Other ERM countries such as [[Italy]], whose currencies had breached their bands during the day, returned to the system with broadened bands or with adjusted central parities.{{cn|date=January 2017}} Even in this relaxed form, ERM-I proved vulnerable, and ten months later the rules were relaxed further to the point of imposing very little constraint on the domestic monetary policies of member states.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The effect of the high German interest rates, and high British interest rates, had arguably put Britain into recession as large numbers of businesses failed and the housing market crashed.  Some commentators, following [[Norman Tebbit]], took to referring to ERM as an "Eternal Recession Mechanism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/feb/10/freedomofinformation.economy|author=Tebbit, Norman|title=An electoral curse yet to be lifted|accessdate=30 December 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=10 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the UK fell into recession during the early 1990s.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party government]]'s image had been damaged to the extent that the electorate was more inclined to support the opposition of the time – that the economic recovery ought to be credited to external factors, as opposed to government policies implemented by the Conservatives. The Conservatives had recently won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], and the [[Gallup poll]] for September showed a small lead of 2.5% for the Conservative Party. By the October poll, following Black Wednesday, their share of the intended vote in the poll had plunged from 43% to 29%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~pnorris/datafiles/Gallup.xls|title=Gallup spreadsheet|accessdate=28 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013232132/http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~pnorris/datafiles/Gallup.xls|archivedate=13 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debacle would ultimately tarnish the Tories' reputation (leading to [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|three]] [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|consecutive]] [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|defeats]] in following national elections, all by large margins) until the late 2000s, when under [[David Cameron]]'s leadership, the Conservatives surpassed [[Gordon Brown]]'s [[Brown ministry|Labour government]] in party image for the first time since September 1992 (partly because of the effects of the [[Great Recession]]), eventually gaining the most seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].

'''Blazing Swan''' is an annual regional [[Burning Man]] event held near Jilakin Lake in the [[Shire of Kulin]], [[Western Australia]].  It is an experiment in temporary community and artistic expression, and is guided by eleven main principles, including ''radical inclusion'', ''gifting'' and ''radical self-reliance''.  The event occurs around Easter each year, usually over a period of seven days. The event location is in dry bushland adjacent to Jilakin Lake, and is referred to as Jilakin Rock City. Each year a swan-shaped wooden effigy is built and burned at the culmination of the event.

==History==
Blazing Swan was started by a collective of artists/producers whom have all attended the Burning Man Festival in the USA and were inspired to organize an official regional event in WA.

==Culture==

===Eleven Principles===
Blazing Swan is understood not as an event, but as referring to a way of life lived consistently with these 11 Principles.
They are meant to be taken as a whole, as a set of commonly-understood values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.blazingswan.com.au/10-principles/ |title=10 Principles of Blazing Swan |publisher=Blazing Swan |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Radical Inclusion''': Anyone may be a part of Blazing Swan. We welcome and respect the stranger. No pre-requisites exist for participation in our community.
* '''Gifting''': Blazing Swan is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.
* '''Decommodification''': In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.
* '''Radical Self-reliance''': Blazing Swan encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.
* '''Radical Self-expression''': Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.
* '''Communal Effort''': Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote, and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.
* '''Civic Responsibility''': We value civil society. Community members who organise events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavour to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.
* '''Leaving No Trace''': Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.
* '''Participation''': Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.
* '''Immediacy''': Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.
* '''Consent''': Compliance in or approval of what is done or proposed by another; specifically: the voluntary agreement or acquiescence by a person of age or with requisite mental capacity who is not under duress or coercion and usually who has knowledge or understanding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2384">'''The Cambridge Shakespeare Festival''' is a festival of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] held annually in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. The festival was founded in 1987 by Artistic Director Dr David Crilly.

The productions are performed in full period costume with live [[Elizabethan]] music. The festival attracts upwards of 25,000 visitors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeshakespeare.com/about/ About Cambridge Shakespeare Festival].&lt;/ref&gt; for the productions which take place over a period of eight weeks in July and August. Each performance is held outside in the private gardens of colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]], including [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] Gardens, [[Robinson College]] Gardens, [[Girton College]] Gardens, [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] Gardens, [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] Gardens and [[Downing College]] Gardens.

The ethos of the Company is to provide access to all to Shakespeare's work without any prior knowledge of the play or author, and the Artistic Director has made it a Company policy to avoid unnecessary theatrical artifice and special effects. To that end the plays are performed without staging or elaborate lighting and the action takes place in and around the space in which the audience sits. The centrepiece of any production is, therefore, the language - thus returning to Shakespeare's original mode of communication with his audience.

In 2009 The Independent on Sunday listed the Festival fourth in its 'Top 50 UK Arts Festival' and 2015 saw the publication of a book on the history, style and development of the Festival, entitled Shakespeare in Cambridge: a celebration of the Shakespeare Festival, by Andrew Muir.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">The '''Chicago Latino Film Festival''' is a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[film festival]], focusing on [[Latin America]] and [[Latinos]]. Held annually in [[Chicago]] since 1985, it is organized by the [[International Latino Cultural Center]] (ILCC) and sponsored by a number of national corporations as well as by the local Hispanic and Latino community. The Festival features the work of promising Latin American filmmakers with a special emphasis on films that showcase the enormous diversity of Latin America, and that defy commonly held stereotypes about Hispanics and Latinos.

During the majority of screenings, the audience have the opportunity to participate in discussions with local and visiting filmmakers. In an effort to highlight the importance of the artistic and educational value of all films, the '''Chicago Latino Film Festival''' is non-competitive with the exception of the coveted Audience Choice Award, as determined by the filmgoers and the Gloria Achievement Award.  Since 1999, the Gloria Award has been given as a special recognition to individuals and institutions for their outstanding contributions to the Latino arts.

The Chicago Latino Film Festival presents a series of special segments as part of the general programming: Made In USA, Women In Film, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Trans (LGBT) and Animation.

The '''Chimera House''' (also known as the "13 floor money back house") is an [[urban legend]] which consists of the usual young teens going out for a night on the town, only to stumble across a large, worn down multiple storey building where they are offered to go through a haunted attraction that consists of "real" horrors inside. In the story, the teens are asked to pay a certain amount of money (anywhere from 20-100 dollars) and told they will receive a portion back for every floor they complete. The twist is that no one has ever completed the house, and the ones who tried never came back out. Rumors state about the various horrors inside the house, from poisonous/deadly animals, to deformed humans, to the supernatural.  Accounts vary as to the exact number of floors in the house, but most accounts give the house 13 floors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/holidays/halloween/haunted.asp snopes.com: Unfinishable Haunted House]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverhauntedhouses.com/site/index.php?option=com_kunena&amp;func=view&amp;catid=36&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=81 The 13th Floor - Urban Legends - Denver Haunted Houses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402232312/http://www.denverhauntedhouses.com/site/index.php?option=com_kunena&amp;func=view&amp;catid=36&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=81 |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend is usually set in the south or midwest since there are a large amount of open and unknown areas in those parts.

A '''conspiracy''' is a [[secret]] agreement by people to commit something wrong or illegal.  Depending on the circumstances, a conspiracy may be a [[crime]], or a [[civil wrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy |title=Conspiracy |publisher=merriam-webster.com |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "[[conspiracy theory]]" is an explanation of an event or situation that invokes an unwarranted conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent, ''American Conspiracy Theories'' (2014) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0199351813/ref=rdr_ext_tmb excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of conspiracies==
* [[Conspiracy (civil)]], an agreement between people to deceive, mislead, or defraud others of their legal rights or to gain an unfair advantage
* [[Conspiracy (criminal)]], an agreement between people to break the law in the future, in some cases having committed an act to further that agreement
* [[List of conspiracies (political)|Conspiracy (political)]], an agreement between people with the goal of gaining political power or meeting a political objective
* [[Hub-and-spoke conspiracy]], a conspiracy in which one or more principal conspirators (the "hub") enter into several similar agreements with others (the "spokes") who know concerted action is contemplated, usually where the success of the concerted action depends on the participation of the other spokes

'''''Djibi, the Kitten''''' ({{lang-de|Djibi das Kätzchen}}) is the last novel of [[Felix Salten]], published originally in 1945 and translated into English in 1946. Similarly as in other Salten's late books, the [[protagonist]] is an animal, this time a young female [[cat]] called Djibi.

In ''[[Renni the Rescuer]]'', the main animal character had been a loyal servant to humans, but Djibi is an independent cat who chooses for herself where to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Beverley Driver |date=2010 |title=Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces |location=Riverside (Ca.) |publisher=Ariadne Press |page=303 |isbn=978-1-57241-169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel begins dramatically with a drowning attempt which the young kitten survives. A boy rescues her from the river and takes to his home where a dog adopts her and feeds along with other puppies. But when the boy rebuffs the cat, she leaves the farm immediately and, for a while, lives in the forest and kills [[pheasant]]s. After being wounded by a gamekeeper, she decides to take shelter with humans again, and a kind teacher, Salten's alter ego, adopts her. After that, Djibi lives with the teacher and his wife, but her strong hunting instinct finally leads Djibi to her demise.

The main theme of the book are the reciprocal interactions between men and animals, especially cats and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehness | first=Jürgen | title=Felix Saltens erzählerisches Werk: Beschreibung und Deutung | location=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Peter Lang | date=2002 | isbn=3-631-38178-6 | pages=258–259 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in Salten's earlier animal novels, for instance ''[[Bambi's Children]]'', there isn't much [[anthropomorphism]] in ''Djibi'' — there is only one short dialogue between Djibi and a [[marten]].&lt;ref&gt;''Djibi, the Kitten'' (1946), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The human characters, in contrast to the animals in the book, mostly have no personal names, but are referred to as “the teacher,” “the farmer,” etc.

The first English translation of ''Djibi'' by Raya Levin appeared in the United Kingdom in 1946, illustrated by [[Walter Linsenmaier]] as the original Swiss edition, but there is also an anonymous American translation, '''''Jibby the Cat''''', illustrated by Fritz Kredel, which was published in 1948 by [[Julian Messner]] in [[New York City]]. This edition differs greatly from Salten's original text. Not only has it a happy ending — Djibi's death is left out — but it also has a happy opening added to it: the novel begins with five pages depicting Djibi's (or Jibby's) sweet life before the attempt on her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Salten, Felix | title=Jibby the Cat | publisher=Julian Messner, Inc. | location=New York | year=1948 | pages=1–6 | others=Illustrated by Fritz Kredel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel has been largely rewritten, and new incidents have been added to the story. For instance, in the Swiss and the British edition, the boy takes the kitten from the river directly to his home, but in the American edition, he first takes it to the teacher (or “schoolmaster Victor” in this edition). The Americal edition also adds chapter numbers and chapter titles to the book,&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/993362737/04 Contents] at Deutsche Nationalbibliothek.&lt;/ref&gt; and most human characters have personal names.

For example, the episode where Djibi decides to leave the farm is very different in the two English-language editions. The British edition follows very closely Salten's original German-language text,&lt;ref&gt;''Djibi das Kätzchen'' (1945), pp. 14–15. ([http://www.mlang.name/felix/djibi-auszug.jpg Extract on-line.])&lt;/ref&gt; but the American edition has it rewritten:

The boy ran howling out of the stable. But because he was hungry, he ran into the kitchen.&lt;br&gt;
 There a decisive scene took place between him and Djibi.&lt;br&gt;
 Djibi meant no harm when she hastened to meet him and tried to jump on his shoulder as usual.&lt;br&gt;
 But the boy pushed her back: “Leave me alone!”&lt;br&gt;
 Djibi made a second attempt at re-establishing their long-standing intimacy. At the first sign of her intention, however, the boy cried:&lt;br&gt;
 “Leave me alone, you damned beast!” At the same time he slapped the cat's head with impatient indignation.&lt;br&gt;
 A slap? Djibi never accepted a slap without retaliation, never!&lt;br&gt;
 As quick as lightning, her sharp claws dug into the boy's hand, from which a few drops of blood began to trickle. He staggered back in pain, while the cat, spitting, sat up on her hind legs and raised her paws in readiness for both defence and attack.&lt;br&gt;
 The boy did not remember that he had pulled Djibi out of the water and saved her poor little life; he did not remember how often she had amused and delighted him. At the moment she appeared to him as a wild, excited enemy, and he was her exasperated, badly scratched opponent.&lt;br&gt;
 It never occurred to him that he was responsible for this sudden transformation. Embittered, he reached out for the cat, to throw her against the wall, to punish her. To show her who was master.&lt;br&gt;
 But Djibi admitted no punishment. The very notion of it, so well known to dogs, was completely alien to her.&lt;br&gt;
 She submitted to neither ill-treatment nor to punishment. Nothing of the kind!&lt;br&gt;
 She had suffered gross unfairness, never gave a thought to the past, or to her once beloved friend. She had finished with him for ever.&lt;br&gt;
 In the face of his angry attitude, she ran stealthily past him, and jumped out of the window before he had realised it.&lt;br&gt;
 Into freedom!&lt;ref&gt;''Djibi, the Kitten'' (1946), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
| style="font-size: 90%;" | 
Peter's face went suddenly white, and he turned and ran through the barn to the hayloft. His throat burned, and he held his fists clenched at his sides and his body rigid.&lt;br&gt;
 Jibby appeared at the top of the steps just as the boy threw himself down in the hay and began to cry. She ran up to her playmate, prepared as usual to settle in his lap and lay her head under his chin. Peter gave her a push, which Jibby mistook for part of a new game. She scratched his knees and sprang to her proud perch on his shoulder. But Peter, busy with his first grown-up sorrow, knocked her off with a brusk swipe that sent her sprawling.&lt;br&gt;
 “Go away, Jibby!” he said, putting his head down on his arms again. But the kitten gave a blow for a blow. Lightning fast her paw raked across the boy's hand, making the blood come. Peter sat up and stared at her, nursing his hand. Jibby did not retreat. She sat spitting at him, paws raised for defense or attack.&lt;br&gt;
 Peter forgot that he had fished her out of the cold river. He forgot Jibby was his hard-earned pet. For a moment she was a wildly excited enemy and he her wounded antagonist.&lt;br&gt;
 The kitten, still spitting, began to back away. She had seen Peter's face change. He was big and strong, and he looked as if he meant to punish her. Jibby, however, was not one to take punishment. The notion was foreign to her kind. She had seen the dogs cower and whimper under Mrs. Julius' light discipline, but Jibby was not a dog. If she could not win by scratching and spitting, she could run.&lt;br&gt;
 Peter caught up with her at the trapdoor. He lifted her roughly by the scruff of the neck and dropped her all the way to the barn floor below. Jibby landed on the planks with a thud and a cry of pain. Then she slowly rose to her feet, arching her back and half turning toward the haymow. Then she relaxed: her babyhood was over. Without a backward look toward her one-time friend and benefactor, she sailed in a graceful curve through the open barn door and took to the open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Salten, Felix | title=Jibby the Cat | publisher=Julian Messner, Inc. | location=New York | year=1948 | pages=38–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has also been translated at least into [[French language|French]] in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Salten, Felix | title=Djibi, le petit chat | location=Neuchâtel | publisher=Delachaux &amp; Niestlé | year=1946 | others=Traduction de Jacqueline Des Gouttes.

The '''Erntedankfest''' (''English:'' "harvest festival") in ''' [[Düsseldorf-Urdenbach]]''' is an annual traditional celebration, incorporating most parts of this borough and attracting thousands of tourists to thank God for the gifts of harvest. With a history of 90 years and about 40 participating groups it marks one of the biggest and most important Erntedankfest celebrations in the [[Rheinland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wz-newsline.de/lokales/duesseldorf/ein-ganzer-stadtteil-feiert-erntedank-1.181793 |title='&amp;#39;Ein ganzer Stadtteil feiert Erntedank (german)'&amp;#39;|publisher=wz-newsline.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes church services, huge parades and music in a traditional fair atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-way.com/german-thanksgiving.html |title='&amp;#39;Thanksgiving: Erntedankfest in Germany, Austria'&amp;#39;|publisher=german-way.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Erntedankfest is an important part of Urdenbach's tradition and marks one of the most
important events in the south of [[Düsseldorf]] and the Rheinland. 

It differs essentially from the Erntedankfest celebrations in Northern America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/cs/culture/a/erntedankf.htm |title='&amp;#39;Erntedankfest: Thanksgiving in Germany'&amp;#39;|publisher=www.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, Düsseldorf-Urdenbach was characterized by its agriculture and nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duesseldorf.de/bv/09/stadtteile/urdenbach.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Stadt Düsseldorf: Urdenbach (german)'&amp;#39; |publisher=www.duesseldorf.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109123306/http://www.duesseldorf.de/bv/09/stadtteile/urdenbach.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time the Erntedankfest was celebrated by actual farmers to thank God for the harvest. Later, when most of the farmers turned away from their initial business, the remaining farmers were not able to continue this tradition on their own. At that time, in the middle of the 1900s, the [[ABVU]] (Allgemeiner Bürgerverein Urdenbachs / ''engl.:'' "general citizens association of Urdenbach") overtook the management of the Erntedankfest and is still responsible for its execution. Nowadays most of the participating groups do not have an actual farming background, but a common interest for the traditions of Urdenbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abvu.de/Termine/erntedank.htm |title='&amp;#39;ABVU Urdenbach dates (german)'&amp;#39;|publisher=www.abvu.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Order of events ==
[[File:Parade erntedankfest urdenbach.jpg|thumb|right|A traditionally decorated trailer during the Erntedank parade]]
The Erntedankfest parade always takes place the first Sunday after each year's September 29, the Michaelistag (''engl.: ''[[Michaelmas]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/cs/culture/a/erntedankf_2.htm |title='&amp;#39;Erntedankfest: Thanksgiving in Germany'&amp;#39;|publisher=www.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duesseldorf-magazin.info/urdenbach.html |title='&amp;#39;Düsseldorf Magazin: Urdenbach - Verwechslung ausgeschlossen (german)'&amp;#39;|publisher=www.duesseldorf-magazin.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Erntedankfest celebration lasts from Friday to Monday. The sequence of events and their schedule is almost the same every year.

The starting point is the mass in one of the churches in Urdenbach on Friday evening.&lt;ref&gt;ABVU Urdenbach  (2010). "Ich glaub es geht schon wieder los...".  ''Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 82, 2010'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday most of the groups finalize their preparations during the day for the parade on Sunday. In the evening, people of Urdenbach come together in a big party tent at Piel's Loch (the local fairground) with a special evening's entertainment. Usually entertainment is provided by a DJ and a live band.&lt;ref&gt;ABVU Urdenbach  (2010). Und mittags ging die Sonne auf.  ''Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 80, 2010'' p. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday usually at 11am a concert takes places at Piel's Loch while people can have a traditional dish: oaf on a spit.{{clarification needed|date=October 2018}}

At 1pm the Erntedankfest groups gather to get ready for the Erntedank parade through Urdenbach, which starts at 2pm and marks the highlight of the weekend. About 40 groups present their individual contributions to the Erntedankfest in form of traditionally decorated [[tractor]]s and [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], typical farmers' tools and the traditional costumes worn by the group members. Up to 40.000 visitors line the streets of Urdenbach to get a glimpse of the parade.&lt;ref&gt;ABVU Urdenbach  (2008). Goldener Oktober zum Erntedank. ''Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 74, 2008'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right after the parade the "Schürreskarrenrennen" (''engl.:'' traditional wheelbarrow race) takes place. Members of different groups try to finish a fixed distance first with their traditionally decorated [[wheelbarrow]]s and wearing the traditional costumes, including bulky [[clogs]]. The winner of the race is announced in the [[Tent#Marquees and larger tents|party tent]] later. 

In late afternoon, citizens of Urdenbach and guests celebrate together at places all over the borough, in the party tent, pubs, and at numerous beer stalls.&lt;ref name="lokal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lokalkompass.de/duesseldorf/leute/urdenbach-feiert-erntedank-d95366.html |title='&amp;#39;Lokalkompass: Erntedankfest Düsseldorf Urdenbach (german)'&amp;#39; |publisher=www.lokalkompass.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422044440/http://www.lokalkompass.de/duesseldorf/leute/urdenbach-feiert-erntedank-d95366.html |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday the "Blotschenball" (''engl.:'' "clogs ball") takes place, where the new Blotschenkönigspaar (''engl.:'' "royal clogs couple") is announced.&lt;ref&gt;ABVU Urdenbach  (2008). Goldener Oktober zum Erntedank.  ''Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 74, 2008'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the weekend there are funfair rides and snack stalls at the fairground at Piel's Loch.&lt;ref name="lokal1"/&gt;

The '''European Robotic Arm''' ('''ERA''') is a [[robotic arm]] to be attached to the [[Russia]]n segment of the [[International Space Station]]. It will be the first robot arm able to work on the Russian space station segments, and will supplement the two Russian ''[[Strela (crane)|Strela]]'' cargo cranes that are already installed on the ''[[Pirs (ISS module)|Pirs]]'' module. The ERA is designed and assembled by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands (formerly Dutch Space).

== Major features and tasks ==
The ERA has several interesting features. Most prominent are its ability to 'walk' around the exterior of the Russian segments of the station under its own control, moving hand-over-hand between pre-fixed basepoints, and its ability to perform many tasks automatically or semi-automatically, thereby freeing its operators to do other work. Specific tasks of ERA include:
* Installation and deployment of [[solar array]]s
* Replacement of solar arrays
* Inspection of the station
* Handling of (external) payloads
* Support of [[astronaut]]s during [[space walk]]s

The International Space Station already features three robotic arms, the first being the [[Canadarm2]], but because the Russian [[Grapple Fixture|grapple fixtures]] are different, that arm and [[Dextre]] can only be used on the Zarya module of the Russian segment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/538352main_sts134_presskit_508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The third arm is fixed on the [[Japanese Experiment Module]], the [[Kibo (ISS module)#Remote Manipulator System|Remote Manipulator System]] (JEM-RMS) uses a similar grapple fixture to Canadarm2. Because all Russian and European spacecraft dock automatically there is no need to manipulate spacecraft on the Russian segment so the European arm is half the length and less powerful than Canadarm2.

Developed for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) by a number of European space companies, with [[Dutch Space]] as prime contractor and subcontractors in 8 countries, the robot arm will be launched by a [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]], along with the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module|MLM]], in 2018 (previously planned: 2015) to be put to work in space by the ISS crew. In 2010, a spare elbow joint for the arm was launched preemptively, attached to the [[Rassvet (ISS module)|Mini-Research Module 1]] (MRM-1). The [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module|MLM]] will also serve as home base for ERA; originally, the arm was going to be attached to the cancelled [[Science Power Platform]] which would have had eight solar arrays.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_nep.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control of ERA==
[[Image:European Robotic Arm IVA EVA.jpg|thumb|right|Control and data interfaces of ERA]]
[[Astronaut]]s can control the robot from both inside and outside the space station. Control from inside the space station (Intra Vehicular Activity-Man Machine Interface (IVA-MMI)) uses a [[laptop]], which shows a model of the ERA and its surroundings. Control from outside the space station (Extra Vehicular Activity-Man Machine Interface (EVA-MMI)) uses a specially-designed interface that can be used while in a [[spacesuit]].

==Arm components==
[[Image:European Robotic Arm RU new terminology.jpg|thumb|right|in-orbit replaceable units (ERUs) of ERA]]
*Two 'limbs': symmetrical arm sections made of [[carbon fibre]], approximately 5 metres long
*Two identical gripper mechanisms (End Effectors ('EE')) also capable of transferring data, power or mechanical actuation to payloads
*Two wrists with three joints each
*One elbow joint
*One central control computer within the arm ('ECC')
*Four camera and lighting units ('CLU')

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1981''' was the 26th event of its kind, and was held on 4 April 1981 at the Simmonscourt Pavilion of the [[Royal Dublin Society]] in [[Dublin]].

The presenter was [[Doireann Ní Bhriain]]. The United Kingdom's [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] were the winners of this contest with the song "[[Making Your Mind Up]]", beating second place Germany by four points.  This year is remembered for the performance of this British band, which launched the group's hugely successful international career, and included a dance-routine where the two male members ripped the skirts off the two female members only to reveal mini-skirts, and today stands as one of the defining moments in the contest's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/dublin-1981|title=Eurovision Song Contest Dublin 1981|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The RDS Simmonscourt - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|RDS Simmonscourt – host venue of the 1981 contest.]]
This year's contest took place in Dublin, the capital of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The contest took place under heavy guard at the 15,000 seat Simmonscourt Pavilion of the [[Royal Dublin Society|RDS]], which was normally used for agricultural and horse shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/festival/1429408+Eurovision+Song+Contest+1981|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1981 at RDS Simmonscourt (Dublin) on 4 Apr 1981|last=|first=|date=|website=www.last.fm|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over 250 armed soldiers and police were on hand to protect against any likely political demonstrations.

Having won the year before, Ireland hosted the 1981 contest – the second time they had done so. As in 1971, the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest was produced by the country's broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]. The presenter on this occasion was [[Doireann Ni Bhriain]], who was well known in Ireland at the time as a TV presenter and for the current affairs radio show ''Women Today''. She was chosen for her fluency in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]] as well as having studied [[French language|French]], which she spoke with some ease.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article433319.ece Sunday Times – Doireann Ni Bhriain, Keeping the faith]&lt;/ref&gt; The director was Ian McGarry, while [[Noel Kelehan]] was the chief conductor for the show.

It cost RTÉ over £300,000 to stage, although this included £110,000 from the EBU. From this, the Irish Government expected to make around £2,000,000 from tourism as a result of staging the show.&lt;ref&gt;“No Sax please, We're Irish!”, David Wigg, Daily Express, 4 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The RDS would go on to host the next Irish Eurovision production in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]].

=== Entrants ===
This year marked the début of [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Cyprus]] in the contest, who finished sixth. Returning to the contest was [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]], who did not compete the previous year, despite winning the two years previous to that. They finished seventh. [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia]] also returned to the competition after a five-year absence. [[Italy]] withdrew for the first time from the contest, due to lack of interest, while [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]] declined to take part after their sole entry the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/annual/1981/participants.php#story|title=ESCToday – 1981|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the performers, many previous contestants returned to the contest this year. Notably, [[Jean-Claude Pascal]] for Luxembourg, who had won the contest 20 years earlier, although could only manage 11th place this time. Repeated entrants [[Peter, Sue and Marc]] returned for the fourth time, after [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]]. Performing again for Switzerland, they remain the only act to sing in four different languages (French, English, German and this time, Italian). Other returnees were [[Marty Brem]] who had taken part the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|year before]] for Austria, [[Tommy Seebach]] for Denmark, and [[Björn Skifs]] for Sweden. Bucks Fizz member, [[Cheryl Baker]] had performed in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the band [[Co-Co (band)|Co-Co]] for the UK, while [[Sheeba]] member [[Maxi (singer)|Maxi]] had performed as a solo artist in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] for Ireland.

The 46-piece Irish TV orchestra didn't have a saxophone as they didn't consider it an orchestral instrument, which caused great concern with the United Kingdom entry as a saxophone appeared heavily on their song. [[Andy Hill (composer)|Andy Hill]] – the producer of the single – said that had they known, they would have dropped one of the two backing singers to be replaced by a saxophonist, there being two on the actual recording.

=== Interval ===
The interval act was traditional Irish band [[Planxty]], who performed the lengthy piece "Timedance", which depicted Irish music through the ages.  The dancers were from Dublin City Ballet with choreography by Iain Montague. This is seen as a precursor to ''[[Riverdance]]'', which became famous after its performance in [[1994 Eurovision Song Contest|1994]]. The song, which was written by [[Bill Whelan]], went on to be released as a Planxty single and became a No.3 hit in the Irish charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/artists/Planxty.html|title=Ceolas: Planxty|website=www.ceolas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement Irish chart database – search "Planxty"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFf8iFDu?url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |date=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mix of past and present was also the theme to the contest's opening montage, which featured shots of Celtic ruins, cliffs and castles, edited together with close-ups of art, aeroplanes, architecture and horse races.

=== Voting ===

[[File:Bucks Fizz making.PNG|thumb|250px|left|[[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] performing "[[Making Your Mind Up]]"]]The voting proved to be memorable for its closeness. The UK won by four points, but leading up to this, five countries took pole position at various stages: UK, Germany, France, Switzerland and Ireland. Just before the penultimate vote, three countries (UK, Germany and Switzerland) were all on equal top marks. After this, Switzerland (who had performed second last) were unable to collect points as it was their jury's results that were being announced, while Germany failed to receive votes either. The UK gained eight, which meant that when the final jury (Sweden) were about to cast their votes, the UK needed five points or more to win over either country. Switzerland were quickly eliminated by receiving just one vote. The UK passed the five-point mark and received eight votes, while Germany did indeed receive the maximum 12 points, but it was too late. France finished third, with Switzerland fourth and the hosts Ireland coming in fifth. Of these, Switzerland received the most top votes despite only finishing fourth, while the UK only received two. The UK did however receive points from every competing country. Meanwhile, at the other end of the board was Norway, who finished last with no points for the third time in Eurovision history, gaining no points in 1963 and 1978 as well.

Other memorable moments included a glitch in the scorekeeping, giving host country Ireland 310 extra points instead of the 10 designated by the Luxembourg jury. Also of note, when host Doireann Ní Bhriain attempted to collect Yugoslavia's votes, after repeated attempts to contact them, Yugoslavia's spokeswoman,  [[Helga Vlahović]], who went on to present the 1990 contest, finally answered the phone and abruptly answered "I don't have it", causing laughter to erupt from the audience.  Also during the final vote, Turkey's nine points suddenly disappeared from the scoreboard.

=== Aftermath ===
Runner-up [[Lena Valaitis]] was in good spirits while talking to the press following the contest and largely unconcerned about losing. Swedish singer [[Björn Skifs]] however was more outspoken saying; "This was not a song contest, it was a show – all these dancing girls, they take away from the songs. I also think there should be a change in the rules to allow us to sing in English. Then we would really be able to compete."&lt;ref&gt;“Reprise”, Ultan Macken, [[RTÉ Guide]]  24 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Harald Tusberg, head of light entertainment for Norwegian television was upbeat about Norway's 'nul points' result as he claimed that their entry would be remembered above many others; "Who remembers who came second or third – people will remember us!". [[Finn Kalvik]] himself conceded graciously saying that he had enjoyed the week's holiday.&lt;ref&gt;“Fizz Kids” Brian Wesley, [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]], 6 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this year's contest, France withdrew from competing the following year, with the broadcaster announcing that the songs were "a monument to drivel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurofans.free.fr/v5/telechargement/kwv3n6EnSj.pdf Eurovision 1982 (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many comments had been made regarding the quality of the winning group's performance indicating that the song had most likely won by style over substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/eurovision_contest/article/0,28804,1619252_1619506_1619235,00.html|title=A Brief History of the Eurovision Song Contest|date=11 May 2007|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] went on to have a very successful career over the next few years, and became one of the top-selling groups of the 1980s. The winning song itself reached No.1 in nine countries and became a top ten hit in nations such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, selling four million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charts.org.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Bucks+Fizz&amp;titel=Making+Your+Mind+Up&amp;cat=s New Zealand charts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian Chart Book, 1970–1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(B).html|title=South African Rock Lists Website – SA Charts 1965–1989 Acts (B)|first=Brian|last=Currin|website=www.rock.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany, who had never won the contest up to this point, were becoming increasingly frustrated with their second placings in this and the previous year's contest and made a concerted effort for the following year. This was to pay off, as in 1982 they finally clinched their first victory which was achieved in an overwhelming manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/harrogate-1982|title=Eurovision Song Contest Harrogate 1982|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's victory this year meant that the contest would take place in the UK the following year – the seventh time the country had hosted the event (a record unbeaten and later extended by an eighth UK hosting in 1998).  The [[BBC]] opted to take it to the [[North Yorkshire]] town of [[Harrogate]] at a later than usual date, 24 April. The 1981 contest was held on 4 April and up to (and including) 2018 has never been as early again.

Decades later, [[Debbie Cameron]], who represented Denmark with [[Tommy Seebach]], revealed in a book about Seebach that she was contacted by a BBC employee, who told her that Bucks Fizz's victory was planned. According to the employee, he had witnessed how BBC technicians had sabotaged the sound checks during the rehearsal of the Danish, the Israeli and the Western German performances.&lt;ref name="eriksen2"&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3313">A '''''fais do-do''''' is a [[Cajun]] [[dance]] party, originating before [[World War II]]. 

According to [[Mark A. Humphrey|Mark Humphrey]], the parties were named for "the gentle command ('go to sleep') young mothers offered bawling infants."&lt;ref name="humphr"&gt;Notes from the Roots n' Blues CD "Cajun Dance Party - Fais Do-Do" Sony, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  He quotes early Cajun musician [[Edwin Duhon]] of the Hackberry Ramblers: 
: "She'd go to the [[cry room]], give the baby a [[nipple]] and say, 'Fais do-do.' She'd want the baby to go to sleep fast, 'cause she's worried about her husband dancing with somebody else out there."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} 
"Do-do" itself is a shortening of the French verb ''dormir'' (to sleep), used primarily in speaking to small children. The phrase is comparable to the [[American English]] "beddy-bye",{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, and is embodied in an old French lullaby, a song sung to children when putting them down for the night. Its existence in Cajun culture as a source for dances, or bands, comes from an affection for the term itself.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} 

Joshua Caffery, however suggests the true derivation is more plausibly the dance call ''dos à dos'' (back to back), the ''do si do'' call of Anglo-American folk dance; and that sources such as Duhon are merely "repeating the same apocryphal explanation known by almost anyone who lives in Southern Louisiana."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joshua|first1=Caffery|title=The Folk Etymology of the Fais Do-Do: A Note|url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/lfmfaisdodo.html|website=Folklife in Louisiana|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about||the modern Fortune Theatre|Fortune Theatre|the New Zealand theatre|Fortune Theatre, Dunedin}}
[[File:Britannica Theatre 5.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the theatre, drawn by [[Walter Godfrey|Walter&amp;nbsp;Godfrey]] in 1911 based on the builder's contract]]
The '''Fortune Playhouse''' was a historic [[theatre]] in [[London]]. It was located between [[Whitecross Street, London|Whitecross Street]] and the modern [[Golden Lane, London|Golden Lane]], just outside the [[City of London]]. It was founded about 1600, and suppressed by the [[Puritan]] [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1642.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Fortune Playhouse is shown at the top centre of this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
The '''Fortune Theatre''' was contemporary with [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]] and others; it stood in the parish of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], to the west of the [[Shoreditch]] locations of [[The Theatre]] and the [[Curtain Theatre]], between Whitecross Street and Golden Lane in what is today named Fortune Street, just outside the [[City of London]]. Between 1600 and 1642, it was among the chief venues for [[English drama|drama in London]].   The site is said to have originally been occupied by a nursery for the children of [[King Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;William Pulleyn, ''The Etymological Compendium'' (London:  Thomas Tegg, 1828), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Wakefield, ''Perambulations in London'' (London: Darton, Harvey and Darton, 1814), Letter XXIV, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Fortune was erected as the second half of a substantial realignment of London's chief acting companies. In 1597, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] had left, or rather been ejected, from [[The Theatre]]; they abandoned [[Shoreditch]] and in 1599 constructed a new theatre, the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], in [[Southwark]]. The [[Admiral's Men]], then playing in the nearby and aging [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], suddenly faced stiff competition for [[Bankside]] audiences.

At this point, the Admiral's manager [[Philip Henslowe]] and his stepson-in-law, the leading actor [[Edward Alleyn]], made plans to move to Shoreditch; Alleyn appears to have funded the new theatre, later selling half-interest to his father-in-law. They paid [[pound sterling|£]]240 for a thirty-year lease on a plot of land between tenements on Golding and Whitecross Lane. They hired [[Peter Street (carpenter)|Peter Street]], who had just finished building the Globe, to make them a playhouse. Street was paid £440 for the construction job; with another £80 spent for painting and incidental expenses, the cost of the physical building was £520. The total expenses for the project, including the securing of property rights and clearances of previous leases, came to £1,320.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 435-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the theatre cost about £120 per year in the first decade of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the contract for the construction was preserved among Alleyn's papers, a good deal more is known about the Fortune than about the other outdoor theatres. The document also casts some light on the features of the Globe, since Henslowe and Alleyn planned their theatre with an eye on their rival's venue; many of the details in the contract are for sizes equal to or bigger than the Globe's equivalent.

===Design===
[[File:St Giles, Cripplegate, London EC2 - Window - geograph.org.uk - 1209172.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Fortune in a stained glass memorial to Edward Alleyn]]
The plot of land on which the theatre sat was approximately square, {{convert|127|ft|m}} across and {{convert|129|ft|m}} deep. The theatre was built on a foundation of lime and brick; square-shaped (uniquely among the period's amphitheatres), each wall measured eighty feet outside and fifty-five within. The building was three stories tall; the first-floor galleries were twelve feet high, those on the second floor eleven; those on the third, nine. Each row of galleries was twelve feet deep. Henslowe and Alleyn specified that the Fortune outdo the Globe "in every point for [[scantling]]s"; they also provided, in accordance with common practice, for two-penny rooms and gentlemen's rooms. The building was constructed of [[lath and plaster]], with wood floors in the galleries.

The stage, and [[dressing room (theater)|tiring-house]], were thrust forward into the middle of the square. The tiring-house had glazed windows; the manner of its attachment to the stage is unknown but presumably similar to that of the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan]]. The stage was forty-three feet across; it was covered with tile.

===First theatre===
[[File:FortuneTheatreBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque in Fortune Street, London]]
Henslowe and Alleyn's plans met with considerable opposition from the neighbourhood and city officials. With the aid of their patron, [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard]], the Lord Admiral, they secured permission from the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] for the venture. Henslowe seems also to have soothed his neighbors' worries by pledging substantial amounts to charity in the parish.

The theatre housed the Admiral's Men by late 1600, as revealed by correspondence of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador in London. This troupe remained as tenants for more than two decades, surviving the deaths of both Henslowe and Alleyn, and remaining fairly stable under the successive patronage of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] and [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Lord Palsgrave]]. Upon Henslowe's death, Alleyn assumed full control of the property.

Originally described as the "fairest play-house in the town," the Fortune suffered a slow decline in reputation over the decades. In 1605, notorious roisterer [[Mary Frith]] may have appeared on the boards, singing and playing a lute; it is not clear from the [[consistory court]] records in which this event is described if the players were a party to her antics. In 1612, the theatre  was mentioned by name in a city order suppressing the post-performance jigs, which authorities believed led to fist-fights and thefts. That this belief had some merit is suggested by a case the next year, in which a country farmer stabbed a city gentleman. In 1614, Thomas Tomkiss's academic play ''Albumazar'' linked the Fortune and the Red Bull Theatre as raucous places to see old-fashioned fare such as ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''. The aspersion stuck, as did the conjunction of north-side theatres.

Yet the conventional view should not be exaggerated; on one and perhaps two occasions, ambassadors visited the theatre. On the first and less certain occasion, a member of the Venetian delegation, Orazio Busino, describes a visit in December 1617 to a theatre that may have been the Fortune. On the second, the notorious [[Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, conde de Gondomar|Gondomar]] certainly visited Alleyn and the others there in 1621; after the performance the players held a banquet in his honour.

===Second theatre===
On 9 December 1621, the Fortune burned to the ground, taking with it the company's stock of plays and properties. To meet the £1000 cost of rebuilding, Alleyn formed a partnership of twelve sharers, each paying an initial amount of £83 6''[[shilling|s]]''. 8''[[old pence sterling|d]]''. By then aged and busy with [[Dulwich College]], he took only one share for himself, and leased the property to the company's sharers for £128 per year. (The shareholders paid Alleyn £10 13''s''. 10''d''. each annually, and in return split the profits of the theatre, and the expenses of running it, twelve ways.)&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre re-opened in March 1623. When Alleyn died in 1626, the College assumed control of the lease; the actor Richard Gunnell became its manager. Yet this change does not appear to have changed operations at the theatre. The new theatre appears to have been made of brick, with a lead and tile roof as fire-proofing measure. It also seems to have been round, abandoning its unconventional square shape.

The reputation of the theatre did not improve after its reconstruction. In 1626, it was the scene of a riot involving sailors, in the course of which a [[constable]] was assaulted. In 1628, a protégé of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] was assaulted by a mob after leaving a performance there.

In 1631, Palsgrave's Men moved to the playhouse at Salisbury Court; they were replaced at the Fortune by the actors of the King's Revels. The only play definitely associated with this period is a comedy, now lost, by William Heminges, son of [[John Heminges]]. In 1635, a company that had been at the [[Red Bull Theatre]] occupied the theatre, only to meet a notable run of bad fortune: [[Black Death|plague]] closed the theatres for more than a year, from May 1636 to October 1637. Since they had no income from the theatre, the twelve shareholders in the theatre fell seriously arrears in their payments to Dulwich College, by more than £165.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1639, the actors were fined £1000 for depicting a religious ceremony on stage&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; this depiction was taken as anti-Catholic, but in the late 1630s, almost any reference to religion was risky. This group returned to the Red Bull at Easter 1640, and the remnants of Palsgrave's company, now under the patronage of the young [[Charles II of England|Prince Charles]] and therefore called [[Prince Charles's Men]], returned to the Fortune.

When [[London theatre closure 1642|Parliament ordered all theatres closed]] in 1642, the Fortune entered a slow but irreversible decline. The actors at least occasionally violated the order, for they were raided and their property seized during a performance almost a year after the closure; between the expiration of the original order and the enactment of new, more stringent orders in 1649, the players returned to the theatre. In 1649, soldiers pulled down the stage and the gallery seats. By [[the Restoration]], it had partially collapsed, and the masters of Dulwich sold what remained as scrap.

==Replica theatres==
[[File:Waseda Theatre Museum Tokyo Japan 2006-03-22.jpg|thumb|The Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum in Tokyo, based on the Fortune.]]
The 1599 contract for building the Fortune Theatre was found in the papers of theatrical manager [[Philip Henslowe]] at [[Dulwich College]]. The contract&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.william-shakespeare.info/the-fortune-theatre-picture.htm Fortune Theatre Contract] accessed 13 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt; gives some overall dimensions of the Fortune but there are no plans or elevations.
*The Allen Elizabethan Theatre at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] in Ashland, Oregon, designed by Richard L. Hay, uses the dimensions from the contract but the stage's appearance and arrangements are speculation, as the original plans have never been found.
*The New Fortune Theatre is a replica at the [[University of Western Australia]] in Perth, Australia.
*The [[Waseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum]] in Tokyo, Japan, is also modelled after the playhouse.
*The [[Gdańsk Shakespeare Theatre]] in Gdańsk, Poland, is built on the site of a 17th-century theatre, known as the Gdańsk Fencing School, which is believed to have been modelled on the first Fortune Theatre. Though not an exact reproduction, the modern theatre incorporates elements from the designs of the earlier theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Limon |first=Jerzy |date=1 March 2011 |title=The city and the "problem" of theatre reconstructions: "Shakespearean" theatres in London and Gdańsk |journal=Actes des Congrès de la Société Française Shakespeare |volume=28 |issue=Shakespeare et la Cité |pages=159–183 |publisher=Société Française Shakespeare |url=http://shakespeare.revues.org/1624 |accessdate=16 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''''Ground Ceremony'''' is a [[ritual]] used in some airforces, for example the [[US Airforce]], signifying the handing off of the aircraft by the chief ground [[mechanic]] to the [[Aviator|pilot]], where the pilot is assured his aircraft is ready and safe for flight. The main goal of the customary 'ceremony' is to reinforce teamwork and -spirit between pilot and maintenance crew.

==Ground Ceremony==
The ritual (in its US version) includes the following four steps (quoting Bolman and Deal 2003):&lt;ref&gt;Bolman, L.G.; Deal, T.E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tsFj7wgczvYC&amp;pg=PA264 ''Reframing Organizations: Artistry, Choice, and Leadership'']. (2003), p. 264, quoting R. Mola, cited in Reed, 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The first salute is a courtesy greeting that signifies respect between the aircraft mechanic and his pilot.
* The handshake takes the greeting to a new level and is the personal bond between the mechanic and his pilot.
* The second salute after the pilot has operationally checked the aircraft signifies the aircraft’s airworthiness and that the aircraft is now in the hands of the pilot.
* The thumbs-up is the personal gesture wishing a good flight to the pilot."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7572">This is a '''list of air shows in Japan'''. [[Air show]]s in [[Japan]] are mostly those held at [[Japan Self-Defense Force]] and US military bases across the country. Air shows are sometimes known as festivals in Japan.

The [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]], (JASDF) [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF) and [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (MSDF) all have air shows at their bases. Air shows or open days are also held at a number of US military bases in Japan. At JASDF base air shows it is common for the [[Blue Impulse]] aerobatic team to perform. 

The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]], and [[United States Navy|US Navy]] also have events at their bases. Visitors who are not from the US or Japan may be turned away from a US base for security reasons. Prospective attendees of events at US bases who are neither Japanese or American should bring identification and also consult the [[List of Designated Third Country Nationals|Third Country National]] list to see if they require special approval to enter the base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2010/09/07/issues/u-s-navy-friendship-festival-draws-line-at-the-french/ U.S. Navy ‘Friendship Festival’ draws line at the French September 7, 2010] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved November 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lucio Silla''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈluːtʃo ˈsilla|lang}}), [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 135, is an Italian [[opera]] in three acts composed by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. The [[libretto]] was written by [[Giovanni de Gamerra]], revised by [[Pietro Metastasio]].

It was first performed on 26 December 1772 at the [[Teatro Regio Ducal]] in Milan and was regarded as "a moderate success".{{sfn|Holden|2001|pp=600–601}}

[[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s opera ''[[Silla (opera)|Silla]]'' (1713) covered the same subject. Other operas with the same title were also composed by [[Pasquale Anfossi]] (1774), and [[Johann Christian Bach]] (1776).

==Performance history==

''Lucio Silla'' premiered on 26 December 1772 in Milan at the [[Teatro Regio Ducal]]. Its UK premiere was produced by [[Camden Town Hall]] in London in 1967. Its US premiere followed in 1968 with a performance in Baltimore.{{sfn|Holden|2001|pp=600–601}}

==Synopsis==
The story concerns the Roman dictator Lucio Silla ([[Lucius Sulla]]) who lusts after Giunia, the daughter of his enemy Gaius Marius. Giunia, on the other hand, loves the exiled senator Cecilio.

===Act 1===
''Scene 1: A secluded spot on the banks of the Tiber'''

The exiled Senator Cecilio meets his friend Cinna who tells him his betrothed Giunia mourns his death, a lie by the dictator Silla so that he can win her for himself. Cinna advises Cecilio to meet Giunia by the tomb of her father (murdered hero Gaius Marius). Cecilio is filled with joy at the idea and Cinna shares his joy and predicts the freedom of Rome (aria: "Vieni ov' amor t' inita").

''Scene 2''

Cecilio excited at the prospect of meeting his betrothed sings of his love (aria: "Il tenero momento").

''Scene 3: Giunia's apartments''

Silla seeks the advice of his sister Celia on his approach with Giunia and she advises subtlety and kindness (aria: "Se lusinghiera speme").

''Scene 4''

On Silla's approach, Giunia declares her love for Cecilio and her hate for Silla, her father's enemy (aria: "Dalla sponda tenebrosa").

''Scene 5''

Alone, Silla, insulted, decides to behave as a tyrant (aria: "Il desìo di vendetta, e di morte").

''Scene 6''

Cecilio waits by the tomb for Giunia.

''Scene 7''

Giunia arrives (chorus and ariosa: "Fuor di queste urne dolente").

===Act 2===
''An archway decorated with military trophies''

Silla is joined by Celia to whom he tells of his plans to wed Giunia and for Celia to wed her beloved Cinna on this day.

''Scene 3''

Cinna restrains Cecilio who has his sword drawn trying to follow Silla, believing he has been instructed by the spirit of Gaius Marius to seek revenge. Cinna tells him to consider Giunia and his rage is controlled (aria: "Quest' improvviso trèmito").

''Scene 4''[??]

Giunia consults with Cinna who suggests she accept Silla's proposal and then murder him in their wedding bed. Giunia refuses, stating that vengeance is for Heaven alone to consider. She asks Cinna to make sure that Cecilio stays hidden from danger (aria: "Ah se il crudel periglio").

''Scene 5''

Cinna resolves to kill Silla himself (aria: "Nel fortunato istante").

''Scene 6, Hanging gardens''

Silla's love for Giunia starts to bring out his compassion.

''Scene 7''

Giunia's hateful face angers him again and he threatens her with death but not to die alone (aria: "D' ogni pieta mi spoglio").

''Scene 8''

With Cecilio, Giunia worries about Silla's words and they part.

''Scene 9''

Celia asks Giunia to accept Silla's proposal for the sake of happiness saying she is also to be married to Cinna (aria: "Quando sugl' arsi campi").

''Scene 10''

Giunia ponders her wretchedness.

''Scene 11, the Capitol''

Silla asks the Senate and the people of Rome to reward him as a hero of Rome with the marriage to Giunia.

''Scene 12''

When Cecilio appears, there is confrontation (trio: "Quell' orgoglioso sdegno").

===Act 3===
''Scene 1: Entrance to the dungeons''

Cecilio has been imprisoned. Cinna and Celia has gained access and Cinna asks Celia to convince Cecilio to repent and forget his love. Cinna promises to marry Celia if she is successful, for which she is hopeful (aria: "Strider sento la procella").

''Scene 2''

Whilst Cecilio accepts his fate Cinna tells him not to worry, Silla's heart over his head will bring about his own downfall (aria: "De' più superbi il core").

''Scene 3''

Silla has allowed Giunia one last visit to Cecilio and they say their farewells (aria: "Pupille amate").

''Scene 4''

Giunia alone with her thoughts of Cecilio's impending death thinks of her own (aria: "Frà I pensier più funesti di morte").

''Scene 5: The audience chamber''

Before the Senators and the people of Rome, to everybody's surprise, Silla declares that he wishes Cecilio to live and marry Giunia. When questioned on his silence, Cinna declares his hatred of Silla and his intention of killing him. Silla issues his "punishment" to Cinna that he should marry his beloved Celia. He further declares that he will step down as dictator and restore liberty to Rome. He explains that he has seen proof that innocence and a virtuous heart is triumphant over power and glory. The people of Rome celebrate liberty and the greatness of Silla.

'''The Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge''' is an annual navigational endurance challenge event. It is open to any road legal [[4x4]] vehicle in aid of [[Macmillan Cancer Support]]. The event has been run since 2002 over one weekend in March each year and consists of a series of on road treasure hunts interspersed with off-road challenges. The event covers up to 1,000 miles and raises up to in excess of £100,000 for [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] each year.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

No special vehicle modifications are required to enter, any sensibly equipped 4x4 should be able to complete the event.{{fact|date=April 2017}} Each team has a minimum sponsorship to raise all of which goes to Macmillan. All event costs are covered out of the entry fee except fuel which competitors pay for as they go.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Competitors only know where they are starting from, the route being kept secret till roadbooks are handed out along the way. It generally ends in Cheshire where there is a prize-giving dinner and accommodation for the night at a hotel.

== Background ==

In May 2000 a group of enthusiasts saw a gap in the 4x4 events programme and decided to introduce a new event to mark the Millennium. The objective being to provide an interesting 'Challenge' for 4x4 owners/addicts/enthusiasts over a weekend ‘somewhere’ in the UK, whilst supporting a worthy charity.

"The Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge" was 'born'. After two false starts, in November 2000 because of a petrol blockade and March 2001 due to Foot and Mouth. The inaugural run of the event eventually took place with only 8 teams in March 2002 and £8,000 was raised for Macmillan Cancer Relief.

In 2007 60 teams started (The maximum number that the organisers felt the event could maintain), and raised £110,000

The 2008 event covered approximately 800 miles and covered 5 countries - England, Wales, Southern and Northern Ireland and Scotland, the final total raised was £109,000

==Support==
The event has been supported by a number of celebrities including [[Charlie Dimmock]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carpages.co.uk/land_rover/land_rover_charlie_dimmock_to_compete_in_macmillan_challenge_16_02_03.asp Car Pages news article]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynn Bowles]], [[Sunita Shroff]], [[Julia Bradbury]], [[Charlie Webster]], [[Jaye Griffiths]] and Marisa Wayne the daughter of [[John Wayne]].

The event started on 6 March and raised £80,000 at the prize giving dinner on 8 March. With a final total of £106,115.30 in July 2009

=== 2010 Event ===

The entry form for the 2010 event went on line [http://www.mac4x4.co.uk on the Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge web site] on 1 April 2009, all entries were taken up within two days, at which point a reserve list was opened. A month later due to the extra demand entries were extended to 90 teams. One week before the event it was announced that TV sports presenter, [[Charlie Webster]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charliewebster.com/gallery/category/Editorial/ Charlie Webster feature in LRO]&lt;/ref&gt; would be the celebrity competitor for the year. Due to the cost of fuel, the event format was lower mileage than previously, with the majority of challenges being set in the [[Aberystwyth]] area. 

In May 2010 it was announced that the year's event had raised a record £123,000

=== 2011 Event ===

At the end of March 2010 it was announced that Marisa Wayne,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lro.com/news.php?sid=492&amp;page=1 Marisa Wayne in LRO News]&lt;/ref&gt; youngest daughter of the Hollywood actor  [[John Wayne]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ludlowadvertiser.co.uk/news/cravenarms/8898089.John_Wayne_s_daughter_takes_part_in_Mac_4x4_Challenge_near_Craven_Arms/ Ludlow Advertiser article]&lt;/ref&gt; would be competing as the co-driver in 'Team Duke'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justgiving.com/Mac4x4TeamDuke/ Marisa Wayne's Justgiving page]&lt;/ref&gt; for the 2011 10th anniversary run of the event which also marked the 100th anniversary of [[Macmillan Cancer Support]].

The event was extended to four days to mark the anniversary, with the longest mileage since the inaugural 2002 run. After the organising team discovered that the 2011 celebrity co-driver, Marisa Wayne had never been to [[Ireland]] and that her favourite movie was her father’s [[The Quiet Man]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cowboysindians.com/multimedia/video/2009-07/marisa-wayne-vid.jsp Marisa Wayne talks about her father and 'The Quiet Man'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918161821/http://cowboysindians.com/multimedia/video/2009-07/marisa-wayne-vid.jsp |date=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the event was engineered to give her and all the other competitors the opportunity to visit Cong in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the village where it was filmed, and see the scenery of [[County Galway]] and [[County Mayo]]. Immediately after the event a running total of £89,000 raised for Macmillan was declared, with a final total announced in August 2011 of £120,059.

=== 2012 Event ===

In April 2011 entries opened for the 2012 event from March 2 to 4. For the first time in a number of years the event was under subscribed with 63 teams taking part. The event took a similar format to the 2010 run with the majority of challenges being in the forests surrounding [[Newcastleton]] in the Scottish borders. At the prize giving dinner a running total of £63,000 raised for [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] was announced. A final total of £81,949.59 was announced later that year bringing the event's running total to £860,085

=== 2013 Event ===

In April 2012 entries opened for the 2013 event from March 1 to 3. In January 2013 it was announced that TV and stage actress [[Jaye Griffiths]] would be competing.

"'''Manhattan Project'''" is a 1985 song by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], named for the [[Manhattan Project|WWII project]] that created the first [[atomic bomb]]. The song appeared on Rush's eleventh [[Album|studio album]] ''[[Power Windows (album)|Power Windows]]'' in 1985. "Manhattan Project" is the third track on the album and clocks in at 5:07.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rush.com/albums/power-windows/|title=Power Windows {{!}} Rush.com|website=www.rush.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as a single (also in 1985) and reached #10 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.song-database.com/chhist.php?sid=29718|title=Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart History for Manhattan Project  by Rush|last=|first=|date=|website=Song://Database|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyricist [[Neil Peart]] read "a pile of books"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neilpeart.net/news/august_09_p2.html|title=NEP News|website=www.neilpeart.net|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the Manhattan Project before writing the lyrics so that he had a proper understanding of what the project was really about. The song consists of four verses, addressing the following:

1) A time, during the era of [[World War II]],&lt;br&gt;
2) A man, representing [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] and other scientists around the world who were engaged in nuclear weapons research,&lt;br&gt;
3) A place, the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] facility in New Mexico at which American scientists carried out their work,&lt;br&gt;
4) A man, [[Paul Tibbets]], pilot of the bomber ''[[Enola Gay]]'' that dropped the atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]]. 

The chorus refers to the explosion as "the big bang", in allusion to the start of a new universe following the singular event, although the absolute reference is the use of [[Fat Man]] and [[Little Boy]], America's two nuclear bombs to bring an end to the Pacific conflict with Japan ("shot down the [[rising sun flag|rising sun]]"), which only happened after both were dropped, repeating the theme of the verses marking when and/or where "it all began." The remaining lines refer to the start of the [[Atomic Age]] and the reactions of different segments of the global population ("the big shots," "the fools," "the hopeful," "the hopeless").

== Live performances ==
Rush performed the song live on their Power Windows Tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rush.com/tour/power-windows/|title=Power Windows Tour {{!}} Rush.com|website=www.rush.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hold Your Fire Tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rush.com/tour/hold-your-fire/|title=Hold Your Fire Tour {{!}} Rush.com|website=www.rush.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Presto Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rush.com/tour/presto/|title=Presto Tour {{!}} Rush.com|website=www.rush.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it was dropped. It was brought back live over twenty years later on the [[Clockwork Angels Tour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rush.com/tour/clockwork-angels/|title=Clockwork Angels Tour {{!}} Rush.com|website=www.rush.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the band played it with a string ensemble.

Live performances of the song are included on the [[A Show of Hands (video)|''A Show of Hands'']] [[concert film]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-show-of-hands-video-mw0000205219|title=A Show of Hands [Video] - Rush {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[A Show of Hands|live album of the same name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-show-of-hands-mw0000652701|title=A Show of Hands - Rush {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[Clockwork Angels Tour (album)|''Clockwork Angels Tour'']] live album and concert film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rush.com/albums/clockwork-angels-tour/|title=Clockwork Angels Tour {{!}} Rush.com|website=www.rush.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional live performance (recorded during the Presto Tour) is included in the bonus material on the home media release of ''Time Stand Still'', a 2016 documentary about the band's [[R40 Live Tour]].

A '''mining accident''' is an [[accident]] that occurs during the process of [[mining]] [[mineral]]s. Thousands of miners die from mining accidents each year, especially from [[underground mining (hard rock)|underground]] [[coal mining]], although [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]] is not immune from accidents.  Coal mining is considered much more hazardous than hard rock mining due to flat-lying rock strata, generally incompetent rock, the presence of [[methane]] gas, and [[coal dust]]. Most of the deaths these days occur in [[developing countries]], and [[rural]] parts of [[developed countries]].

Mining accidents can have a variety of causes, including leaks of [[poisonous gas]]es such as [[hydrogen sulfide]]&lt;ref&gt;Kucuker H. "Occupational fatalities among coal mine workers in Zonguldak, Turkey, 1994–2003". ''[[Occup Med (Lond)]]'' 2006 Mar;56(2):144-6. {{PMID|16490795}}&lt;/ref&gt; or explosive natural gases, especially [[firedamp]] or [[methane]],&lt;ref&gt;Terazawa K, Takatori T, Tomii S, Nakano K. ''Methane asphyxia. Coal mine accident investigation of distribution of gas.'' ''Am J Forensic Med Pathol.'' 1985 Sep;6(3):211-4. {{PMID|3870672}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dust explosions]], collapsing of mine [[Stoping (mining method)|stopes]], mining-[[induced seismicity]], [[flood]]ing, or general [[mechanical error]]s from improperly used or malfunctioning mining equipment (such as [[safety lamp]]s or [[electrical equipment]]). Use of improper [[explosive]]s underground can also cause methane and [[coal dust]] explosions.

== Worst mining disaster in history ==

On April 26, 1942, in the [[Benxihu Colliery|Benxihu (Honkeiko) Colliery (coal mine)]], what is believed to have been the world's worst mining disaster took place, killing 1,549 miners.&lt;ref name="ten worst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicdisasters.com/index.php/site/comments/the_ten_worst_worldwide_mining_disasters/ |title=Ten Worst Mining Disasters |last=Retzer |first=John |publisher=Bogey Media |accessdate=17 May 2014 |location=Michigan, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418115719/http://www.epicdisasters.com/index.php/site/comments/the_ten_worst_worldwide_mining_disasters |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disaster occurred in an area that is now within the bounds of modern-day China, but was then in a portion of China occupied by the Japanese, just north of present-day Korea.  The Japanese administrators of the mine had the actual mining work performed by forced Chinese labour under harsh conditions. The disaster first began with a mine fire, but at the time, a hasty decision was made by the Japanese mine operators to promptly cut off the ventilation and to completely seal off the mine to kill the fire.  This reportedly left many unevacuated workers still alive within the sealed-off area of the mine to eventually also suffocate. Once the fire was put out in this manner and the mine re-opened, it took 10 days to remove all of the bodies.&lt;ref name="worst mining disasters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-world-worst-coal-mining-disasters-china/|title=The world's worst coal mining disasters|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of those killed, 1,518 were Chinese, and 31 were Japanese.  Afterwards, several bodies were buried in a mass grave.  According to a follow-up investigation carried out by the Soviet Union, the majority of the fatalities were not caused by the initial fire, but instead were the result of secondary carbon monoxide poisoning and suffocation.&lt;ref name="chinazhaoge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinazhaoge Blog|url=http://chinazhaoge.blog.sohu.com/21038332.html|publisher=sohu.com|accessdate=7 August 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2017}}

The [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli Mine Disaster]] of 23 March 1887 involved a [[gas explosion]] in the mine that killed 81 men and boys, leaving 50 women widows and 150 children without fathers.

The [[Mount Kembla#Mine disaster|Mount Kembla Mine Disaster]] of 31 July 1902 was an explosion resulting in the death of 96 miners, including two engaged in rescue work. It remains the worst mining disaster in Australian history.

A coal dust explosion at the [[Mount Mulligan mine disaster|Mount Mulligan mine]] on 19 September 1921 killed 75 or 76 workers.

Tasmania's [[Beaconsfield Mine collapse]] occurred on 25 April 2006. Of the 17 people who were in the mine at the time, 14 escaped immediately following the collapse, one was killed and the remaining two were found alive after five days. The survivors were trapped in a 1.5m x 1.2m cherry picker cage, which had saved them from being crushed by rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Beaconsfield Mine Collapse, http://www.angelofoz.com/beaconsfield_miners_2006/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As it was not safe for rescuers to blast their way through, a special borer was brought in to drill an escape shaft. They were finally released on 9 May after 14&amp;nbsp;days underground.

Three mining disasters occurred at Moura in a 20-year period. The first of these was in 1975, at the Kianga Mine, where 13 men died in an underground explosion. The mine was sealed without their bodies being retrieved. In 1986 a second disaster occurred, as an underground explosion, which took the lives of 12 miners. The bodies of all those persons were retrieved. In Moura on 7 August 1994 a third major mining accident occurred with an explosion at Moura No. 2 Mine. A second explosion at the mine approximately a day and a half later saw rescue attempts abandoned, and the mine was sealed, with the bodies of the 11 miners unretrieved.

===Canada===
{{main category|Mining disasters in Canada}}

The most well-known mining accidents in [[Canada]] have all occurred within the province of [[Nova Scotia]]. The most serious of them was a series of three coal mining disasters spanning 65&amp;nbsp;years referred to collectively as the [[Springhill mining disaster]]s, which claimed in total at least 138 lives of men and boys due to coal dust explosions. The [[Westray Mine|Westray Mine disaster]] in 1992 claimed the lives of 26 miners in a methane/coal dust explosion at a recently opened mining operation. Both of these mines were subsequently permanently closed in the wake of these events.

The [[1887 Nanaimo mine explosion]] in [[Nanaimo]], [[British Columbia]] killed 150 miners at the No 1 Esplanade Mine. Explosives were laid improperly triggering a massive mine-wide explosion. Most miners were killed instantly, only 7 survived. Of the 150 workers killed, 53 of them were Chinese, the names of which are mostly unknown.

The [[Hillcrest mine disaster]], the worst coal mining disaster of Canadian history, occurred in [[Alberta]] in 1914. Deaths from the methane and coal dust-fueled explosion numbered 189; news coverage was eclipsed by the First World War. The mine remained in use until 1939.

===China===
{{main article|List of coal mining accidents in China}}

According to one source, in 2003 China accounted for the largest number of coal-mining fatalities, accounting for about 80% of the world's total, although it produced only 35% of the world's coal.&lt;ref name="Xiaohui"&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm Coal mining: Most deadly job in China] Zhao Xiaohui &amp; Jiang Xueli, Xinhua News Agency, Updated: 2004-11-13 15:01&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 2001 and October 2004, there were 188 accidents that had a death toll of more than 10, about one such accident every 7.4&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name="Xiaohui"/&gt; After the [[2005 Sunjiawan mine disaster]], which killed at least 210 miners, a meeting of the State Council was convened to work on measures to improve work safety in coal mines. The meeting's statement indicated serious problems such as violation of safety standards and overproduction in some coal mines. Three billion yuan (360&amp;nbsp;million US dollars) were dedicated for technological renovation on work safety, gas management in particular, at state-owned major coal mines. The government also promised to send safety supervision teams to 45 coal mines with serious gas problems and invite colliery safety experts to evaluate safety situations in coal mines and formulate prevention measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t184576.htm China takes steps to halt coal mine disasters] Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S.A., 02 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, according to the State Work Safety Supervision Administration, 4,749 Chinese coal miners were killed in thousands of blasts, floods, and other accidents. For example, a gas explosion at the [[Nanshan Colliery disaster|Nanshan Colliery]] killed 24 people on November 13, 2006; the mine was operating without any safety license and the [[Xinhua News Agency]] claimed the cause was incorrect usage of explosives. However, the 2006 rate was 20.1% less than 2005 despite an 8.1% increase in production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK206148.htm China sees coal mine deaths fall, but outlook grim] 11 January 2007, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that China's lack of a free press, independent trade unions, citizen watchdog groups and other checks of official power has made cover-ups of mining accidents more possible, even in the Internet age. As a result, Chinese bureaucrats habitually hide scandals (such as mine disasters, chemical spills, the 2003 SARS epidemic, and tainted milk powder) for fear of being held accountable by the ruling Communist Party or exposing their own illicit deals with companies involved. Under China's authoritarian system, superiors reward subordinates for strict compliance with goals established by authorities, like reducing mine disasters. Indeed, should a mining accident occur, the incentive to hide it is often stronger than the reward for managing it well, as any disaster is almost surely considered a liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/world/asia/11coal.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Graft in China Covers Up Toll of Coal Mines | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere | date=2009-04-11 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Courrières 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' illustration of the Courrières mine disaster]]
The [[Courrières mine disaster]] was the worst ever pit mine disaster in Europe. It caused the death of 1,099 miners (including many children) in Northern France on 10 March 1906. It seems that this disaster was surpassed only by the [[Benxihu Colliery]] accident in China on April 26, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. A dust explosion, the cause of which is not known with certainty, devastated a coal mine operated by the Compagnie des mines de houille de Courrières (founded in 1852) between the villages of Méricourt (404 killed), Sallaumines (304 killed), Billy-Montigny (114 killed), and Noyelles-sous-Lens (102 killed) about two kilometres (one mile) to the east of Lens, in the Pas-de-Calais département (about 220&amp;nbsp;km, or 140&amp;nbsp;miles, north of Paris).

A large explosion was heard shortly after 06:30 on the morning of Saturday 10 March 1906. An elevator cage at Shaft 3 was thrown to the surface, damaging pit-head workings; windows and roofs were blown out on the surface at Shaft 4; an elevator cage raised at Shaft 2 contained only dead and unconscious miners.

===Netherlands===
The twelve mines in the [[Netherlands]], four of which were [[state ownership|state owned]], were considered among the safest in the world, with only three larger accidents occurring during 70&amp;nbsp;years of mining:

-On 13 July 1928 a [[methane|methane gas]] explosion killed 13 miners in the state-owned mine [[Staatsmijn Hendrik|Hendrik]] in [[Brunssum]].

-On 24 March 1947 13 miners from [[Staatsmijn Hendrik]] were killed in a fire caused by an overheated [[conveyor belt]].

-On 3 March 1958 7 miners lost their lives when a [[cave-in]] occurred at [[Staatsmijn Maurits]] in [[Geleen]].

===New Zealand===
{{main category|Mining disasters in New Zealand}}
The most notable mining accident in [[New Zealand]] is the 1896 [[Brunner Mine disaster]], which killed all 65 miners inside. On 19 November 2010, there were four explosions over nine days at [[Pike River mine accident|Pike River mine]]; 29 miners were killed and two escaped with minor injuries.

On 19 January 1967, there was an explosion in the [[Strongman Mine]], near [[Greymouth]], on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. 19 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;retrieved from http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/strongman.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
{{Main article|List of mining disasters in Poland}}
On November 25, 2006, the worst [[2006 Halemba Coal Mine disaster|mining disaster]] occurred in modern Polish history, 23 miners lost their lives at [[Halemba Coal Mine]], a colliery in the town of [[Ruda Slaska]] in the southern industrial province of [[Silesia]]. A methane explosion at a depth of 1,030&amp;nbsp;meters caused the November 21 tragedy. The miners were attempting to retrieve €17&amp;nbsp;million ($US22&amp;nbsp;million) worth of equipment from a tunnel when a blast caused the shaft to collapse. The tunnel was supposed to have been closed in March due to dangerously high methane concentrations, but was kept active because of the value of the equipment left behind.&lt;ref&gt;retrieved from https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/11/mine-n25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{main category|Mining disasters in Russia}}

Several major mining accidents have happened in Russia, particularly the [[Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster]] of 2007, which killed at least 106 miners. On January 20, 2013, at least four miners have died and four more are missing following an accident at a Russian coal mine. The accident happened at a coal mine in the Kuznetsk Basin region of Russia, in western Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;retrieved from https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21108531&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
A number of major mining accidents happened in South Africa including the following accidents:

*53 deaths on 13 May 1993 at Middelbult colliery. Middelbult colliery was and is still one of the underground collieries of [[Sasol Mining]] situated near the town of [[Secunda, Mpumalanga]]

===Taiwan===
The three worst mining accidents in [[Taiwan]] all happened in 1984:
*On June 20, 1984, in Haishan Coal Mine in [[Tucheng District]], a runaway mining cart struck a high voltage transformer and triggered an explosion. 72 miners died from carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:海山煤礦]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On July 10, 1984, 103 miners died in Meishan Coal Mine in [[Ruifang District]] as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a fire started in the air compressor chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:台灣煤礦]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 5, 1984, an explosion occurred at Haishan Coal Mine No. 1 in [[Sanxia District]]. 93 miners died from carbon monoxide poisoning with only one survival who was rescued 93 hours after the initial explosion.

===Tanzania===
At least 56 miners were killed in April 1998 after heavy rains flooded [[tanzanite]] mine shafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/77864.stm |title=Over 50 dead in Tanzanian mining disaster |newspaper=[[BBC]] |date=April 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people were killed in July 2013 after the [[tanzanite]] quarry they were working in the Mererani mining hills collapsed above their heads.

===Turkey===
In March 1983, in the [[Armutçuk coal mine]] 103 miners died due to a methane gas explosion.&lt;ref name="armutcuk ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1332020/turkeys-worst-mining-disaster-the-latest-in-a-string-of-deadly-accidents/|title=Turkey's worst mining disaster the latest in a string of deadly accidents|last=Logan|first=Nick|date=14 May 2014|work=GlobalTv|publisher=Shaw Media|language=|accessdate=18 May 2014|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1992 at the TCC Kozla mine, 263 miners were killed due to a firedamp explosion&lt;ref name="Germany vs Turkey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Almanya-ve-Turkiye-de-maden-iscisi-olumleri.htm?ArticleID=227888|title=Mining Deaths in Germany vs: Turkey|date=14 May 2014|publisher=Istanbul Posta Gazette|language=Turkish|accessdate=18 May 2014|location=Istanbul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 there was another disaster which resulted in one person losing their life. In November 2013, 300 workers barricaded the Zonguldak mine in order to protest the working conditions.

During the year of 2009, in December killed 19 miners due to a methane gas explosion in [[Bursa Province]].

In 2010, there was a mining disaster in [[Zonguldak Province]] which resulted in the deaths of 30 workers in a coal mine. The explosion was caused by a [[firedamp]] explosion. Previous mining disasters have also occurred here, one in 1992 resulted in the deaths of 270 workers. This was the worst mining disaster until the Soma mine disaster.

In May 2014, in [[Soma, Manisa]] there was a [[Soma mine disaster|major mine collapse]] caused by an explosion. More than 302 workers lost their lives in the collapse and at least 80 workers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27415822 | title=Turkish mine disaster: Unions calls protest strike| work=BBC | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/anger-turkey-over-deadly-mine-disaster-2014514171636488610.html|title=Thousands strike over Turkish mine disaster|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/16/us-turkey-mine-minister-idUSBREA4F04A20140516|title=Death toll in Turkish mine disaster unlikely to exceed 302: minister|work=Reuters|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/world/europe/turkish-authorities-say-miners-still-missing.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, in recent years the Turkish coal mining industry has been found to have '''''the very worst safety record in the world''''', in terms of fatal accidents per million tons of coal produced.  When using the "deaths per million tons of coal production" measure, on any given day, a Turkish coal miner is 360 times more likely to be killed in a Turkish mine than an American coal miner is in an American mine, and 5 times more likely to die from the lax [[mine safety]] standards of the Turkish mines than even a Chinese coal miner, whose country places with a distant second in terms of safety related deaths per million tons of coal produced.&lt;ref name="turkish mining safety record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68370|title=Turkey: Mine Tragedy Shines Light on Workplace Safety Concerns|last=Schleifer|first=Yigal|date=14 May 2014|work=The Turko-File|publisher=EurasiaNet|accessdate=18 May 2014|location=New York, New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====England====
In England, [[The Oaks explosion]] remains overall the worst mining accident, claiming 388 lives on 12–13 December 1866 near [[Barnsley]] in [[Yorkshire]] although in the first and main explosion on 340 died, less than at the Hulton colliery but subsequent explosions claimed other lives during the night and the following day.
[[Pretoria Pit Disaster|The Hulton Colliery]] explosion at [[Westhoughton]], [[Lancashire]], in 1910 claimed the lives of 344 miners.&lt;ref name="bolton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolton.org.uk/pretoriapit.html|title=Pretoria Pit Disaster|publisher=bolton.org.uk|accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An explosion in 1878, at the Wood Pit, [[Haydock]], [[Lancashire]], killed over 200 workers, although only 189 were included in the 'official list'.&lt;ref name="genuki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Haydock/WoodPitExplosion.html|title=GENUKI: Haydock, Lancashire genealogy|publisher=genuki.org.uk|accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disaster that killed many miners was the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]], which occurred in January 1862 when the beam of the pumping engine broke suddenly and fell into the single shaft serving the pit. It blocked the shaft, and entombed hundreds of miners. The final death toll was 204, most of whom were suffocated by the lack of [[oxygen]] in the mine atmosphere.

In the [[wikt:metalliferous|metalliferous]] mines of Cornwall, some of the worst accidents were at [[East Wheal Rose]] in 1846, where 39 workers were killed by a sudden flood; at [[Levant mine]] in 1919, where 31 were killed and many injured in a failure of the [[man engine]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corin|first=John|title=Levant, A Champion Cornish Mine|publisher=The [[Trevithick Society]]|year=1992|pages=40–44|isbn=0-904040-37-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 killed at [[Wheal Agar]] in 1883 when a cage fell down a shaft;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivian|first=John|title=Tales of the Cornish Miners|publisher=H.

E. Warne Ltd|location=St. Austell|year=1970|pages=38–40|chapter=When the Bottom of Dolcoath Fell In}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
The worst mining accident in [[Scotland]] is the 1877 [[Blantyre mining disaster]] in [[Blantyre, South Lanarkshire|Blantyre]], [[Lanarkshire]], which claimed 207 lives. Other fatal incidents occurred in the town in 1878 and 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalminingmuseum.com/news/blantyre-mining-disaster/|title=Blantyre Mining Disaster|publisher=[[National Mining Museum Scotland]]|date=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another serious incident occurred in the small [[Ayrshire]] mining village of [[Knockshinnoch Disaster|Knockshinnoch]] in September 1950. For several tense days rescuers battled bravely against all odds to reach the 129 men trapped deep underground when a field above where they were working caved-in, flooding the mine workings with thick liquid peat, cutting off all means of escape. 116 were rescued but 13 died.&lt;ref name="infomine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomine.com/library/videos/2250c0/knockshinnoch_colliery_disaster,_scotland,_1950.aspx|title=Knockshinnoch Colliery Disaster, Scotland, 1950 &amp;#124; MINING.com Video|publisher=infomine.com|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film, ''[[The Brave Don't Cry]]'' was made about the distaster in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/27561|title=The Brave Don't Cry (1952) - BFI|work=BFI|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales====
[[File:Senghenydd Colliery Disaster.jpg|thumb|280px|Crowd gathering at the [[headframe|pit head]] of the Senghenydd Colliery after the explosion in October 1913]]

During the period 1850 to 1930 the [[South Wales coalfield]] had the worst disaster record. This was due to the increasing number of mines being sunk to greater depths into gas-containing strata, combined with poor safety and management practices. As a result, there were nearly forty underground explosions in the [[Glamorgan]] and [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] areas of the coalfield during this time. Each accident resulted in the deaths of twenty or more workers - either directly in the explosion or by suffocation by the poisonous gases formed. The total death toll from these disasters was 3,119 people. The four worst accidents in Wales were:
*439 deaths at the [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster]] at [[Universal Colliery]] in [[Senghenydd]], Glamorgan, in a gas explosion in 1913.
*290 deaths at the [[Albion Colliery]] in [[Cilfynydd]], Glamorgan, in a gas explosion on 25 June 1894.
*272 deaths at the [[Prince of Wales Colliery]], [[Abercarn]], Monmouthshire, in an explosion of 11 September 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/Abercarn.htm Abercarn Colliery] at welshcoalmines.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;
*266 deaths in the [[Gresford Disaster]] near [[Wrexham]] in [[North Wales]] on 22 September 1934.

Some collieries, e.g. [[Morfa Colliery]],&lt;ref name="welshcoalmines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/GlamWest/Morfa.htm|title=Morfa Colliery Port Talbot|publisher=welshcoalmines.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Port Talbot]], [[Glamorgan]], and [[Black Vein Colliery]], [[Risca]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], suffered three disasters before they were closed for being unsafe.

===United States===
The [[Fraterville mine disaster]] occurred on May 19, 1902 killing 216 miners making it one of the worst in American history. Fraterville is located in western Anderson County, Tennessee.

The [[Monongah Mining Disaster]] was the worst mining accident of American history; 362 workers were killed in an underground explosion on December 6, 1907 in [[Monongah]], [[West Virginia]].

The First Dawson Disaster was a mining accident on October 22, 1913 in [[Dawson, New Mexico]] in which 263 men died (146 were Italian and 36 were Greek).

The Second Dawson Disasters was a mining accident on February 8, 1923 in Dawson, New Mexico in which 123 men died.

The [[Speculator Mine disaster|Speculator Mine Disaster]] occurred in the copper mines of [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], [[Montana]] on June 8, 1917. An electric cable being lowered into the mine was accidentally ignited at 2,500 meters below the surface. The fire quickly climbed the cable, in turn igniting the shaft. The shaft thus became a chimney, eliminating the mine's primary source of oxygen. Nearly all of the 168 fatalities were due to asphyxia. It remains the deadliest underground hard rock mining event in American history.

The '''Cherry Mine disaster''' was a fire in the [[Cherry, Illinois]], [[coal mine]] in 1909, and surrounding events, in which 259 men and boys died.

The [[Millfield Mine Disaster]] 1930 in Ohio killed 82 men.

From 1880 to 1910, mine accidents claimed thousands of fatalities. Where annual mining deaths had numbered more than 1,000 a year during the early part of the 20th century, they decreased to an average of about 500 during the late 1950s, and to 93 during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT8.HTM Historical Data on Mine Disasters in the United States] U.S. Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deaths, many thousands more are injured (an average of 21,351 injuries per year between 1991 and 1999), but overall there has been a downward trend of deaths and injuries.

In 1959, the [[Knox Mine Disaster]] occurred in [[Port Griffith, Pennsylvania]]. The swelling [[Susquehanna River]] collapsed into a mine under it and resulted in 12 deaths. In [[Plymouth, Pennsylvania]], the [[Avondale Mine Disaster]] of 1869 resulted in the deaths of 108 miners and two rescue workers after a fire in the only shaft eliminated the oxygen in the mine. Federal laws for mining safety resulted from this disaster. Pennsylvania suffered another disaster in 2002 at [[Quecreek Mine Rescue|Quecreek]], 9 miners were trapped underground and subsequently rescued after 78&amp;nbsp;hours. During 2006, 72 miners lost their lives at work, 47 by coal mining. The majority of these fatalities occurred in [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]], including the [[Sago Mine Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msha.gov/stats/charts/allstatesnew.asp All Mining Fatalities By State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418180957/http://www.msha.gov/stats/charts/allstatesnew.asp |date=2007-04-18 }} U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, 15 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msha.gov/stats/charts/coalbystate.asp Coal Fatalities By State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221005053/http://www.msha.gov/stats/charts/coalbystate.asp |date=2007-02-21 }} U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, 15 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 5, 2010, in the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] an underground explosion caused the deaths of 29 miners.

The [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] was created in 1910 to investigate accidents, advise industry, conduct production and safety research, and teach courses in accident prevention, first aid, and [[mine rescue]]. The [[Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act]]s of 1969 and 1977 set further safety standards for the mining. Since the closure of the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1996, this research function has been carried on by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]].

===Zimbabwe===
The [[Kamandama mine disaster - Hwange]] in June 1972 was one of the worst ever mining disasters with 426 fatalities.

[[File:Nicoll Highway MRT Station, Construction site, Aug 07.jpg|thumb|600px|center|The construction site of [[Nicoll Highway MRT station]] as seen in 2007.]]

The '''Nicoll Highway collapse''' was a [[construction]] [[accident]] that occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m. Singapore Time (UTC+8:00) on 20 April 2004 in [[Kallang]], [[Singapore]] when a tunnel being constructed for use by [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] trains collapsed. The tunnel was part of the construction of the underground [[Circle MRT line|Circle line]], near [[Nicoll Highway MRT station|Nicoll Highway station]]. The supporting structure for the deep excavation work failed, resulting in a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} deep cave-in that spread across six lanes of [[Nicoll Highway]]. The collapse killed four people and injured three. The accident delayed the construction end date for the MRT station.

==Causes==
Investigations and probes into the collapse commenced immediately. It eventually was found that the most apparent cause of the collapse was that the [[retaining wall]] could not handle the stress of holding up the tunnel, forcing it to give way. This occurred near the Nicoll Highway MRT station under construction along the Circle Line and near the Merdeka Bridge.

==Consequences of the collapse==
The accident left a collapse zone 150 m wide, 100 m long, and 30 m deep ({{convert|150|x|10|x|30|m|ft|disp=out}}). Four workers were killed, with three more injured. Steel beams were twisted, with two construction cranes being swallowed up. A substantial chunk of the main highway running over the tunnel was also knocked out.

The rescue efforts were called off on 23 April 2004 because of the low chance of survival by that point, as well as danger to the rescue teams. There was also the increasing need to stabilize the ground around the accident site to reduce the risk of further collapses. All six lanes of the Nicoll Highway were heavily damaged, rendering the road unusable. The highway re-opened on 4 December 2004 after reconstruction efforts.

A committee of inquiry found main contractor Nishimatsu Construction Company ([[:ja:西松建設]]) and its officers as well as [[Land Transport Authority]] officers responsible for the collapse. Several other officers and subcontractors were reprimanded and issued warnings in connection with the accident. As a result of the accident, Stages 1 and 2 of the Circle line were delayed. Stage 3 of the line, [[Bartley MRT Station|Bartley]] to [[Marymount MRT Station|Marymount]] stations opened first on 28 May 2009. The partially built station structure was abandoned, and the affected station has been shifted about {{convert|100|m|ft}} away from the accident site. Eventually, Nicoll Highway station started operations on 17 April 2010.

===The victims===
* Vadivil s/o Nadeson, crane operator
A [[Malaysia]]n of [[India]]n descent, his body was the first to be recovered. The 44-year-old had reportedly tried to escape by jumping out from his crane when the incident occurred. He was found caught between a pick-up truck and a container.
* Liu Rong Quan ({{zh|c=刘荣权}}), construction worker
The body of the 36-year-old [[China|Chinese]] national from [[Jiangsu]] province was found wedged between the wheel and chassis of a {{convert|10|tonne|lb|adj=on}} truck. Liu had started working at the site just ten days before the incident. He left behind a wife and daughter.
* John Tan Lock Yong ({{zh|c=陈陆勇}}), [[Land Transport Authority]] engineer
The third victim to be found, Tan was due to finish his contract with LTA at the end of 2004 and had planned to migrate to [[Australia]] or [[New Zealand]] then. He leaves behind his wife, a grown-up daughter and a son.
* Heng Yeow Pheow ({{zh|c=王耀标}}), foreman
The body of the 40-year-old Singaporean was never recovered. According to survivor accounts, Heng had selflessly hurried his workers to safety but himself was trapped when the collapse occurred. Heng left behind his wife, two young children, his 70-year-old mother and nine siblings.

==Criminal trials==
Four men faced criminal charges in the wake of the Nicoll Highway Collapse.

The first man put on trial was Ng Seng Yoong who was a project director of the [[Circle MRT line]] and also monitored the excavation and design work in his other capacity as the [[Qualified Person]] on the site. He faced one charge of breaching conditions under the Building Control Act. Arguments were made that readings of instruments on site have indicated that things were not going as planned, but the warnings were not acted upon.{{ref|trialsUnderway}} On 24 November 2005, Ng was fined $8,000 ([[Singapore dollar|SGD]]) by the court.{{ref|NgFined}}

PRISM was publicly revealed when classified documents about the program were leaked to journalists of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Edward Snowden]]{{spaced ndash}} at the time an NSA contractor{{spaced ndash}} during a visit to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="WaPo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwald1" /&gt; The leaked documents included 41 [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint slides]], four of which were published in news articles.&lt;ref name="WaPo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwald1" /&gt;

The documents identified several technology companies as participants in the PRISM program, including [[Microsoft]] in 2007, [[Yahoo!]] in 2008, [[Google]] in 2009, [[Facebook]] in 2009, [[Paltalk]] in 2009, [[YouTube]] in 2010, [[AOL]] in 2011, [[Skype]] in 2011 and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="usa1"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Johnson, Kevin |author2=Martin, Scott |author3=O'Donnell, Jayne |author4=Winter, Michael | title=Reports: NSA Siphons Data from 9 Major Net Firms|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/06/nsa-surveillance-internet-companies/2398345/|accessdate=June 6, 2013|work=USA Today|date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker's notes in the briefing document reviewed by ''The Washington Post'' indicated that "98 percent of PRISM production is based on Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft".&lt;ref name="WaPo1" /&gt;

The slide presentation stated that much of the world's electronic communications pass through the U.S., because electronic communications data tend to follow the least expensive route rather than the most physically direct route, and the bulk of the world's internet infrastructure is based in the United States.&lt;ref name="wp_slides" /&gt; The presentation noted that these facts provide United States intelligence analysts with opportunities for intercepting the communications of foreign targets as their electronic data pass into or through the United States.&lt;ref name="Greenwald1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wp_slides" /&gt;

=== The slides ===
Below are a number of slides released by Edward Snowden showing the operation and processes behind the PRISM program. It should be noted that the "FAA" referred to is Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act ("FAA"), and not the Federal Aviation Administration, which is more widely known by the same FAA initialism.

== The program ==
[[File:PRISM logo.jpg|thumb|PRISM logo]]
PRISM is a program from the [[Special Source Operations]] (SSO) division of the NSA, which in the tradition of NSA's intelligence alliances, cooperates with as many as 100 trusted U.S. companies since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="WaPo1" /&gt; A prior program, the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]],&lt;ref name="SS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; was implemented in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] under the [[George W. Bush Administration]] but was widely criticized and challenged as illegal, because it did not include warrants obtained from the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]].&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Pam, Prism, and Poindexter| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/07/pam-prism-and-poindexter.html |work=Spying| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=January 4, 2014| date=7 July 2013 |location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean1"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[John Dean|Dean, John W.]] | url = http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/dean/20051230.html | title = George W.

PRISM was enabled under [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] by the [[Protect America Act of 2007]] and by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], which immunizes private companies from legal action when they cooperate with U.S. government agencies in intelligence collection. In 2012 the act was renewed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] under [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] for an additional five years, through December 2017.&lt;ref name="Greenwald1"&gt;{{cite news| author = [[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]]; MacAskill, Ewen | title=NSA Taps in to Internet Giants' Systems to Mine User Data, Secret Files Reveal –  Top-Secret Prism Program Claims Direct Access to Servers of Firms Including Google, Apple and Facebook –  Companies Deny Any Knowledge of Program in Operation Since 2007 –  Obama Orders US to Draw Up Overseas Target List for Cyber-Attacks|work=[[The Guardian]] |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |accessdate=June 15, 2013 | date = June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McAllister"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate Votes to Continue FISA Domestic Spying Through 2017 –  All Proposed Privacy Amendments Rejected | last = McAllister | first = Neil|date=December 29, 2012|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/29/senate_fisa_extension_vote/ | work = [[The Register]] |accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5949 (112th Congress): FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5949}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Register]]'', the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 "specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone, email, and other communications of U.S. citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant" when one of the parties is outside the U.S.&lt;ref name="McAllister" /&gt;

The most detailed description of the PRISM program can be found in a report about NSA's collection efforts under Section 702 FAA, that was released by the [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] (PCLOB) on July 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="pclob"&gt;Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, {{cite web|url=http://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf |title=Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|date= July 2, 2014|website=pclob.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this report, PRISM is only used to collect internet communications, not telephone conversations. These internet communications are not collected in bulk, but in a targeted way: only communications that are to or from specific selectors, like e-mail addresses, can be gathered. Under PRISM, there's no collection based upon keywords or names.&lt;ref name="pclob" /&gt;

The actual collection process is done by the [[Data Intercept Technology Unit]] (DITU) of the FBI, which on behalf of the NSA sends the selectors to the US Internet service providers, which were previously served with a Section 702 Directive. Under this directive, the provider is legally obliged to hand over (to DITU) all communications to or from the selectors provided by the government.&lt;ref name="pclob" /&gt; DITU then sends these communications to NSA, where they are stored in various databases, depending on their type.

Data, both content and metadata, that already have been collected under the PRISM program, may be searched for both US and non-US person identifiers. These kinds of queries became known as "back-door searches" and are conducted by NSA, FBI and CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=TechDirt|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140630/12101627734/fbi-cia-also-make-use-backdoor-searches-nsa-data-to-access-us-communications-without-warrant.shtml |title=FBI, CIA Use Backdoor Searches To Warrentlessly Spy On Americans' Communications|date= June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these agencies has slightly different protocols and safeguards to protect searches with a US person identifier.&lt;ref name="pclob" /&gt;

=== Extent of the program ===
Internal NSA presentation slides included in the various media disclosures show that the NSA could unilaterally access data and perform "extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information" with examples including email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP chats (such as [[Skype]]), file transfers, and social networking details.&lt;ref name="Greenwald1" /&gt; Snowden summarized that "in general, the reality is this: if an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw [[SIGINT]] [signals intelligence] databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want."&lt;ref name="ibtimes 17 june" /&gt;

According to ''The Washington Post'', the intelligence analysts search PRISM data using terms intended to identify suspicious communications of targets whom the analysts suspect with at least 51 percent confidence to not be U.S. citizens, but in the process, communication data of some U.S. citizens are also collected unintentionally.&lt;ref name="WaPo1" /&gt; Training materials for analysts tell them that while they should periodically report such accidental collection of non-foreign U.S. data, "it's nothing to worry about."&lt;ref name="WaPo1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/|title= NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program|date=July 10, 2013}} An annotated presentation of the NSA PRISM program as published by the Washington Post on 6 June 2013 and updated on 10 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', NSA had access to chats and emails on [[Hotmail.com]], Skype, because Microsoft had "developed a surveillance capability to deal" with the interception of chats, and "for Prism collection against Microsoft email services will be unaffected because Prism collects this data prior to encryption."&lt;ref name="Greenwald2"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Glenn Greenwald]], Ewen MacAskill, Laura Poitras, Spencer Ackerman and Dominic Rushe| title=Revealed: how Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft helped the NSA bypass encryption, new Snowden leak reveals|url=http://rt.com/usa/microsoft-nsa-snowden-leak-971/|publisher=Russia Today|accessdate=July 12, 2013|date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files|title=The NSA Files|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to The Guardian's [[Glenn Greenwald]] even low-level NSA analysts are allowed to search and listen to the communications of Americans and other people without court approval and supervision. Greenwald said low level Analysts can, via systems like PRISM, "listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, [[Microsoft Word]] documents.&lt;ref name="SS2"&gt;{{cite web| last=Gates|first=David Edgerley| title=Through a Glass, Darkly| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/06/through-glass-darkly.html |work=Spying| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=January 4, 2014| location=Santa Fe| date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst."&lt;ref name="ABCNews20130728" /&gt;

He added that the NSA databank, with its years of collected communications, allows analysts to search that database and listen "to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future."&lt;ref name="ABCNews20130728"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rea|first=Kari|title=Glenn Greenwald: Low-Level NSA Analysts Have 'Powerful and Invasive' Search Tool|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/glenn-greenwald-low-level-nsa-analysts-have-powerful-and-invasive-search-tool/|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald was referring in the context of the foregoing quotes to the NSA program [[X-Keyscore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data |title=Revealed: NSA program collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet' |publisher=Theguardian.com |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2013 U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], referring to the PRISM program{{Citation needed|reason=The source does not reference the PRISM program by name.|date=February 2014}} and the NSA's telephone calls logging program, said, "What you've got is two programs that were originally authorized by Congress, have been repeatedly authorized by Congress.

{{Further|Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom}}

In the United Kingdom, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), which also has its own surveillance program, [[Tempora]], had access to the PRISM program on or before June 2010 and wrote 197 reports with it in 2012 alone. The [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] reviewed the reports GCHQ produced on the basis of intelligence sought from the US. They found in each case a warrant for interception was in place in accordance with the legal safeguards contained in UK law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on GCHQ's Alleged Interception of Communications under the US PRISM Programme|url=https://sites.google.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20130717_ISC_statement_GCHQ.pdf|publisher=Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the publicity surrounding media reports of data-sharing, several companies requested permission to reveal more public information about the nature and scope of information provided in response to National Security requests.

On June 14, 2013, Facebook reported that the U.S. government had authorized the communication of "about these numbers in aggregate, and as a range." In a press release posted to its web site, the company reported, "For the six months ending December 31, 2012, the total number of user-data requests Facebook received from any and all government entities in the U.S. (including local, state, and federal, and including criminal and national security-related requests) – was between 9,000 and 10,000." The company further reported that the requests impacted "between 18,000 and 19,000" user accounts, a "tiny fraction of one percent" of more than 1.1 billion active user accounts.&lt;ref name="FB-Release"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Ted Ullyot|Ullyot, Ted]] (Facebook General Counsel) |title=Facebook Releases Data, Including All National Security Requests|url=http://newsroom.fb.com/News/636/Facebook-Releases-Data-Including-All-National-Security-Requests|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=July 4, 2013 |date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New York Times'' columnist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] defended limited government surveillance programs intended to protect the American people from terrorist acts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I worry about potential government abuse of privacy from a program designed to prevent another 9/11—abuse that, so far, does not appear to have happened. But I worry even more about another 9/11. ... If there were another 9/11, I fear that 99 percent of Americans would tell their members of Congress: "Do whatever you need to do to, privacy be damned, just make sure this does not happen again." ''That'' is what I fear most.
That is why I'll reluctantly, very reluctantly, trade off the government using data mining to look for suspicious patterns in phone numbers called and e-mail addresses—and then have to go to a judge to get a warrant to actually look at the content under guidelines set by Congress—to prevent a day where, out of fear, we give government a license to look at anyone, any e-mail, any phone call, anywhere, anytime.&lt;ref name="fried"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Thomas L.|title=Blowing a whistle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/opinion/friedman-blowing-a-whistle.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political commentator [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] similarly cautioned that government data surveillance programs are a necessary evil: "if you don't have mass data sweeps, well, then these agencies are going to want to go back to the old-fashioned eavesdropping, which is a lot more intrusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shields and Brooks on Syria, Snowden and surveillance|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june13/shieldsbrooks_06-14.html|work=PBS NewsHour|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] worried less about the legality of PRISM and other NSA surveillance tools than about the potential for their abuse without more stringent oversight. "The problem here is not constitutionality. ... We need a toughening of both congressional oversight and judicial review, perhaps even some independent outside scrutiny.

==Legal aspects==

=== Applicable law and practice ===
On June 8, 2013, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] issued a fact sheet stating that PRISM "is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program," but rather "an internal government computer system" used to facilitate the collection of foreign intelligence information "under court supervision, as authorized by Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) (50 U.S.C. § 1881a)."&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Section 702 provides that "the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and the Director of National Intelligence may authorize jointly, for a period of up to 1 year from the effective date of the authorization, the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information."&lt;ref name="Section 702"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cornell | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a | work = US Code | title = Title 50, section 1881a. Procedures for targeting certain persons outside the United States other than United States persons |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to authorize the targeting, the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence need to obtain an order from the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISA Court) pursuant to Section 702 or certify that "intelligence important to the national security of the United States may be lost or not timely acquired and time does not permit the issuance of an order."&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; When requesting an order, the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence must certify to the FISA Court that "a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information."&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; They do not need to specify which facilities or property will be targeted.&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt;

After receiving a FISA Court order or determining that there are emergency circumstances, the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence can direct an electronic communication service provider to give them access to information or facilities to carry out the targeting and keep the targeting secret.&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; The provider then has the option to: (1) comply with the directive; (2) reject it; or (3) challenge it with the FISA Court. If the provider complies with the directive, it is released from liability to its users for providing the information and is reimbursed for the cost of providing it,&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; while if the provider rejects the directive, the Attorney General may request an order from the FISA Court to enforce it.&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; A provider that fails to comply with the FISA Court's order can be punished with [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt;

Finally, a provider can petition the FISA Court to reject the directive.&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; In case the FISA Court denies the petition and orders the provider to comply with the directive, the provider risks contempt of court if it refuses to comply with the FISA Court's order.&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt; The provider can appeal the FISA Court's denial to the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] and then appeal the Court of Review's decision to the [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] by a [[writ of certiorari]] for review [[under seal]].&lt;ref name="Section 702" /&gt;

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the FISA Courts had been put in place to oversee intelligence operations in the period after the death of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Beverly Gage of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' said, "When they were created, these new mechanisms were supposed to stop the kinds of abuses that men like Hoover had engineered. Instead, it now looks as if they have come to function as [[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamps]] for the expansive ambitions of the intelligence community. J. Edgar Hoover no longer rules Washington, but it turns out we didn't need him anyway."&lt;ref&gt;Gage, Beverly (June 7, 2013).

=== Analysis of legal issues ===
Laura Donohue, a law professor at the [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and its [[Center on National Security and the Law]], has called PRISM and other NSA mass surveillance programs unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="donohue"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nsa-surveillance-may-be-legal--but-its-unconstitutional/2013/06/21/b9ddec20-d44d-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html|title=NSA Surveillance May Be Legal –  But It's Unconstitutional|first=Laura K.|last=Donohue| work = [[The Washington Post]] |date=June 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodrow Hartzog, an affiliate at [[Stanford Law School]]'s [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]] commented that "[The ACLU will] likely have to demonstrate legitimate First Amendment harms (such as [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effects]]) or Fourth Amendment harms (perhaps a violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy)... Is it a harm to merely know with certainty that you are being monitored by the government? There's certainly an argument that it is. People under surveillance act differently, experience a loss of autonomy, are less likely to engage in self exploration and reflection, and are less willing to engage in core expressive political activities such as dissenting speech and government criticism. Such interests are what First and Fourth Amendment seek to protect."&lt;ref&gt;Dwoskin, Elizabeth (June 13, 2013).

Besides the information collection program started in 2007, there are two other programs sharing the name PRISM:&lt;ref name="TLT20130726"&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA says there are three different PRISMs|url=http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/07/nsa-says-there-are-three-different.html|publisher=Top Level Telecommunications|accessdate=August 27, 2013|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel programs, known collectively as [[SIGAD]]s gather data and [[metadata]] from other sources, each SIGAD has a set of defined sources, targets, types of data collected, legal authorities, and software associated with it. Some SIGADs have the same name as the umbrella under which they sit, BLARNEY's (the SIGAD) summary, set down in the slides alongside a cartoon insignia of a shamrock and a leprechaun hat, describes it as "an ongoing collection program that leverages IC [intelligence community] and commercial partnerships to gain access and exploit foreign intelligence obtained from global networks."

Some SIGADs, like PRISM, collect data at the [[Internet service provider|ISP]] level, but others take it from the top-level infrastructure. This type of collection is known as "upstream". Upstream collection includes programs known by the blanket terms [[Blarney (code name)|BLARNEY]], FAIRVIEW, [[OAKSTAR]] and [[STORMBREW]], under each of these are individual [[SIGAD]]s. Data that is integrated into a SIGAD can be gathered in other ways besides upstream, and from the service providers, for instance it can be collected from passive sensors around embassies, or even stolen from an individual computer network in a hacking attack.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=NSA's Prism surveillance program: how it works and what it can do|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-prism-server-collection-facebook-google|accessdate=July 11, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPSlide20130710"&gt;{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Craig|title=The NSA slide you haven't seen|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-nsa-slide-you-havent-seen/2013/07/10/32801426-e8e6-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html|accessdate=July 11, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news |title=Agreements with private companies protect U.S. access to cables' data for surveillance |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/agreements-with-private-companies-protect-us-access-to-cables-data-for-surveillance/2013/07/06/aa5d017a-df77-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 July 2013 |author1=Craig Timberg  |author2=Ellen Nakashima  |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindemann|first=Todd|title=A connected world|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/business/a-connected-world/305/|accessdate=February 12, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYBookReview20130729"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bamford|first=James|title=They Know Much More Than You Think|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=July 29, 2013|date=12 July 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/nsa-they-know-much-more-you-think/?pagination=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second track of information gathering was revealed by the Guardian and the Washington Post in June and July 2013.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="WPSlide20130710" /&gt; The second track called "Upstream" is accessing "communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."&lt;ref name="WPSlide20130710" /&gt; Upstream is broad-based surveillance of fiber-optic networks and cables which are carrying torrents of data at the speed of light.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Through UPSTREAM the NSA does get direct access to fiber-optic cables and the supporting infrastructure that carries nearly all the Internet and telephone traffic in the USA.&lt;ref name="NYBookReview20130729" /&gt; The interaction between Upstream and PRISM—which could be considered "downstream" collection because the data is already processed by tech companies—is not entirely clear, but according to an NSA slide the two collection methods operate in parallel, instructing analysts that "You Should Use Both." Arrows point to both "Upstream" and "PRISM" in the NSA slide.&lt;ref name="WPSlide20130710" /&gt;
--&gt;
Not all SIGADs involve upstream collection, for instance, data could be taken directly from a service provider, either by agreement (as is the case with PRISM), by means of hacking, or other ways.&lt;ref name="Gellman6Jun13"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Barton Gellman|Gellman, Barton]]; [[Laura Poitras|Poitras, Laura]] |date=June 6, 2013 |title=Codename PRISM: Secret Government Program Mines Data from 9 U.S. Internet Companies, Including Photographs, Email and More |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' (via ''[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]]'') |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |url=http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/codename_prism_secret_program_data_mining.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slate1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/09/shifting_shadow_stormbrew_flying_pig_new_snowden_documents_show_nsa_deemed.html|title=New Snowden Documents Show NSA Deemed Google Networks a "Target"|author=Gallagher, Ryan|date= September 9, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fantastico1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/09/nsa-documents-show-united-states-spied-brazilian-oil-giant.html|title=NSA Documents Show United States Spied Brazilian Oil Giant|date=September 8, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Really screengrabs in the attached video, they are exposed for only a few frames each--&gt;

'''Robert L. Hall''' (1906&amp;ndash;1991) was an [[United States|American]] Air racing pilot and aircraft designer.

== Career ==

Robert L. Hall was born in Taunton, Massachusetts in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Michigan aviation, Volume 38, Issue 1|author=Michigan Aeronautics Commission, Michigan. Bureau of Aeronautics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating in 1927 from the University of Michigan, with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, he joined the [[Granville Brothers Aircraft]], where he was the chief engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-27/news/mn-2177_1_start-designing-gee-bee Robert L. Hall; Designed Gee Bee, Other Aircraft] Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  He designed the [[Gee Bee Model Z]] racer, the "City of Springfield," which swept the competition in every contest in the National Air Races of 1931.  On the September 5, Hall himself flew the Gee Bee Z to victory in the General Tire and Rubber Trophy race. [[Lowell Bayles]] flew the aircraft the next day to victory in the free-for-all event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man with wings: a pictorial history of aviation|author=Edward Jablonski}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hall then left the Granville Brothers, to form Hall Aircraft.  There he designed the ''[[Hall Bulldog|Bulldog]]'' racing aircraft, which he went on to race at the 1932 National Air Races, finished sixth at a speed of 215.5 mph. Afterwards there was speculation that its experimental Hamilton Standard propeller prevented the Wasp engine from running at full power. Hall was so disappointed with its performance that he dismantled and scrapped the plane after that race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerofiles.com/_h.html Hall (aka Hall-Springfield)] Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed the ''[[Hall Cicada|Cicada]]'' racer, which was scheduled to race at the 1932 National Air Races by owner Frank Lynch but did not start the race due to engine problems.

Robert Hall later joined Grumman, where he helped design and test a series of planes that proved a major force during World War II.  Serving as Chief Engineer and lead flight test pilot, he helped design and made the first flights of the [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F Wildcat]], the [[Grumman Goose|G-21 Goose]] in 1937, the [[Grumman XP-50|XP-50]] in 1941, the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]] in 1942, the [[Grumman F7F Tigercat|F7F Tigercat]] in 1943 and the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat|F8F Bearcat]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerofiles.com/_grum.html Grumman, Grumman-American] Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 1941 while flying the XP-50, it experienced an inflight turbocharger explosion while over Long Island Sound. Hall was forced to parachute to safety.  As Grumman's chief engineer and vice president, he was instrumental in the design of the [[Grumman F9F Panther|F9F Panther]], [[Grumman F9F Cougar|F9F Cougar]], [[Grumman F10F Jaguar|F10F Jaguar]] and [[Grumman F11F Tiger|F11F Tiger]] jet fighters and the [[Grumman Gulfstream I|Gulfstream I]] executive aircraft. He retired from Grumman in 1970.

His son Eric Hall is co-founder of Halls Spars, which manufacturers sailboat rigging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hallspars.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=90 Hall History] Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was such a rich prize that her sale proceeds increased the capital of the V.O.C by more than 50%.&lt;ref name="boyajian"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyajian |first=James C. |title=Portuguese Trade in Asia under the Habsburgs, 1580–1640 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0lrDYYzMyAC&amp;pg=PA151 |page=151 |publisher=JHU Press |date=2008 |isbn=0-8018-8754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the large amounts of [[Ming Chinese]] porcelain captured in this ship, Chinese pottery became known in Holland as ''[[Kraak porcelain|Kraakporselein]]'', or "carrack-porcelain" for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The capture of ''Santa Catarina''==
At dawn of 25 February 1603 three Dutch ships under the command of Admiral [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] spotted the carrack at anchor off the Eastern coast of Singapore. The Portuguese ship, captained by Sebastian Serrão, was travelling from [[Colonial Macau|Macau]] to [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], loaded with products from China and Japan, including 1200 [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]s of Chinese raw silk, worth 2.2 million [[guilders]].&lt;ref name="boyajian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Byron |title=Discovering the Great South Land |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOWLaNm6c7sC&amp;pg=PA68 |page=68 |publisher=Rosenberg |date=2005 |isbn=1-877058-31-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cargo was particularly valuable because it contained several hundred ounces of [[musk]]. After a couple of hours of fighting, the Dutch managed to subdue the crew who forfeited the cargo and the ship, in return for the safety of their lives. The [[Admiralty of Amsterdam|Amsterdam Admiralty]] Court declared the captured carrack good [[Prize (law)|prize]] on 4 September 1604.

This period marked the start of the [[Dutch–Portuguese War]] that would end the Portuguese monopoly on trade in the [[East Indies]]. The Dutch, who had learnt about the trade routes in 1596 due to another Dutchman, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], were attempting to appropriate some of that wealth for themselves.

==''Santa Catarina'' and ''Mare Clausum'' versus ''Mare Liberum'' controversy==
The Dutch were at [[Eighty Years' War|war with Spain]] and [[Dutch–Portuguese War|Portugal]] when ''Santa Catarina'' was captured. Though Heemskerk did not have authorization from the company or the government to initiate the use of force, many shareholders were eager to accept the riches that he brought back to them.  Not only was the legality of keeping the [[prize (law)|prize]] questionable under Dutch statute, but a faction of shareholders (mostly [[Mennonite]]) in the Company also objected to the forceful seizure on moral grounds, and of course, the Portuguese demanded the return of their cargo.  The scandal led to a public judicial hearing and a wider campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. It was in this wider contest that representatives of the Company called upon jurist [[Hugo Grotius]] to draft a [[polemic]]al defence of the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See Ittersum (2006), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grotius sought to ground his defense of the seizure in terms of the [[natural law|natural principles of justice]]. One chapter of his long theory-laden treatise entitled ''[[De Jure Prædæ]]'' made it to the press in the form of the influential pamphlet, ''[[Mare Liberum]]'' (''The Free Sea'').

In ''Mare Liberum'', published in 1609, Grotius adapted the principle originally formulated by [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and further developed by [[Fernando Vazquez de Menchaca]] (cf. the [[School of Salamanca]]), that the sea was international territory, against the Portuguese ''[[Mare Clausum]]'' (closed sea) policy, and all nations were free to use it for seafaring trade. Grotius, by claiming '[[free seas]]', provided suitable ideological justification for the Dutch breaking up of various trade [[monopoly|monopolies]] through its formidable naval power.

England, competing fiercely with the Dutch for domination of world trade, opposed this idea, redefining the Mare Clausum principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Selden |first=John |title=Mare Clausum. Of the Dominion, or, Ownership of the sea |volume=Book One |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As conflicting claims grew out of the controversy, maritime states came to moderate their demands and base their maritime claims on the principle that it extended seawards from land. A workable formula was found by [[Cornelius Bynkershoek]] in his ''De dominio maris'' (1702), restricting maritime dominion to the actual distance within which cannon range could effectively protect it. This became universally adopted and developed into the [[three-mile limit]].

==History==
Early Hempfests "featured blatant marijuana smoking";&lt;ref name=McNerthney /&gt; 60 people were cited for illegal marijuana use at the 1997 Hempfest, and about 20 were arrested the following year. Eventually Hempfest and the police reached a ''[[modus vivendi]]'': there was only one arrest in 2001. The political context surrounding marijuana in Seattle and Washington has changed considerably over the years. Washington legalized [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] in 1998. In 2003, Seattle passed an [[initiative]] that made adult personal use marijuana offenses the city's lowest law enforcement priority.&lt;ref name=McNerthney /&gt;

The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 16–17, set a new record for attendance, topping 310,000 people.  The volunteers of Seattle Hempfest were awarded the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) award for "Outstanding Cannabis Advocate of the Year Award" on October 17, 2008 at the National NORML Conference for their efforts.

2011 Hempfest speakers included numerous elected officials, among them Ohio congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]], Seattle Mayor [[Mike McGinn]], City Attorney Pete Holmes, a return by Councilman Licata, and Washington State Representatives [[Mary Lou Dickerson]] and [[Roger Goodman]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Brunner, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politicsnorthwest/2015969995_kucinich_joins_local_pro-pot_p.html Kucinich joins local pro-pot pols at Seattle Hempfest], ''Seattle Times'', {{date|2011-08-20}}. Retrieved online {{date|2011-08-21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 brought legalization to Washington State and Seattle Hempfest featured performances by [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], [[Hed PE]] and [[DJ Muggs]] of [[Cypress Hill]]. As of 2013, the festival has an annual budget of approximately $700,000.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Seattle Hempfest program, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sport Relief''''' is a [[wikt:biennial|biennial]] charity event from [[Comic Relief]], in association with [[BBC Sport]], which brings together the worlds of sport and entertainment to raise money to help vulnerable people in both the UK and the world's poorest countries. At the heart of the campaign is the "Sport Relief Mile", which involves members of the public doing their bit for charity.

[[Comic Relief]] teamed up with the newly established Sport Relief initiative in 2002 and alternates with Sport Relief, airing every second year in March.

==On television== 
Like [[Comic Relief]], the television programming begins in the afternoon, with [[CBBC]] having various related reports and money raising events. This is all in-between the regular programmes, but after the six o'clock news, the usual [[BBC One]] schedule is suspended at 7pm in favour of a live telethon, with a break at 10pm for the regular news programme. However, whilst the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' is aired on [[BBC One]], Sport Relief continues on [[BBC Two]], and then resumes on [[BBC One]] at 10:35pm, with each hour overseen by a different celebrity team. These celebrities do the work for free, as do the crew, with studio space and production facilities donated by the BBC.

'''''The Last Confession''''' is a stage play by [[Roger Crane]] about the [[Papal conclave|election]] and death of [[Pope John Paul I]]. The play follows [[Giovanni Benelli]] ([[David Suchet]]) who recounts, during his last [[Confession (religion)|confession]], his role in the death of John Paul and how this led him to lose his faith.

==Plot==
Disturbed by the corruption in [[Vatican City]], caused mainly by [[Paul Marcinkus]] and [[Jean-Marie Villot]], Benelli attempts to manipulate the [[Papal conclave, August 1978|August 1978 conclave]] and elect Albino Luciani as [[Pope]]. The plan succeeds and Luciani becomes [[Pope John Paul I]] but his unconventional views and actions make him enemies in the [[Roman Curia|Curia]].

Just thirty three days into his reign, John Paul dies suddenly and Benelli investigates the death, suspecting the Pope was murdered. Realising that a request for an [[autopsy]] would damage the church, Benelli decides to end the investigation and tries to become Pope himself. This time his efforts to manipulate the conclave fail and a compromise candidate, [[Karol Wojtyła]], is [[Papal conclave, October 1978|elected Pope]].

'''''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles''''' is an American television [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] following [[Lizzie Borden]] after she is acquitted of the 1892 murders of her father and stepmother. It premiered on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] on Easter Sunday, April 5, 2015, and ended on May 25, 2015. The series is a continuation of the story begun in the network's 2014 film ''[[Lizzie Borden Took an Ax]]'' and, like the film, is fictionalized and speculative.

However, an overwhelming debt by their late father to William Almy, a lawyer friend of Mr. Borden, and a greedy, unpredictable career criminal half brother, named William, threaten Lizzie and Emma's future when William finds a box in the basement of the Borden house containing the skeleton of a long-dead baby. Meanwhile, Pinkerton agent Charlie Siringo arrives in Fall River with an interest in Lizzie's case.

==Production and release==
In October 2014, Lifetime announced plans for an additional limited series based on the network's 2014 film ''Lizzie Borden Took an Ax''. Originally referred to as ''Lizzie Borden: The Fall River Chronicles'', the series would take place after Lizzie's trial, with Ricci and DuVall reprising their roles as the Borden sisters. Hauser was cast as Pinkerton detective Charlie Siringo, who investigates other strange occurrences, including murders, centered around the Bordens.&lt;ref name=Futon/&gt;&lt;ref name="EW 2014-10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/22/christina-ricci-lizzie-borden-lifetime |title=Christina Ricci to play Lizzie Borden again for Lifetime |first=Esther |last=Zuckerman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 22, 2014 |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Kay directed the first two episodes.&lt;ref name=Futon&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/10/22/lifetime-greenlights-limited-series-lizzie-borden-the-fall-river-chronicles-545310/20141022lifetime01/ |title=Lifetime Greenlights Limited Series "Lizzie Borden: The Fall River Chronicles" |date=October 22, 2014 |publisher=[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] |accessdate=April 16, 2016 |via=[[The Futon Critic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A teaser trailer calling the series ''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles'' aired on December 8, 2014, during the second part of ''[[The Red Tent (miniseries)|The Red Tent]]'' miniseries, promoting a 2015 premiere. It featured the [[tagline]], "Lizzie Borden Has an Axe to Grind".&lt;ref name="EW 2015-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/09/lizzie-borden-lifetime-video |title=Lizzie Borden has an ax to grind in trailer for Lifetime series |first=Natalie |last=Abrams |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 9, 2015 |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote in October 2014 that the series would consist of six one-hour episodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lifetime-returns-lizzie-borden-six-743039|title=Lifetime Returns to ''Lizzie Borden'' With Six-Hour Limited Series|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 22, 2014 |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |first=Lesley |last=Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by January 2015 the order was increased to eight.&lt;ref name="EW 2015-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elavsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naples.floridaweekly.com/news/2015-02-05/Arts_%28and%29_Entertainment_News/Ricci_takes_an_ax_to_her_latest_role.html|title=Ricci takes an ax to her latest role|last=Elavsky|first=Cindy|work=Florida Weekly|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221002413/http://naples.floridaweekly.com/news/2015-02-05/Arts_%28and%29_Entertainment_News/Ricci_takes_an_ax_to_her_latest_role.html|archivedate=February 21, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles'' premiered on April 5, 2015. Most - if not all - of the series was shot in Nova Scotia, Canada, using period buildings and interiors in Halifax and other nearby communities. 

Lifetime executive vice president and general manager Rob Sharenow said in 2014, “This series will take viewers further down Lizzie Borden’s dark path, revealing what many people suspected about her mysterious life."&lt;ref name="EW 2014-10"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that "while the film was inspired by real-life events, the series will take certain creative liberties, which draw from the mysterious events surrounding the deaths of those close to Borden in the years after her acquittal."&lt;ref name="EW 2015-01"/&gt; Ricci said in January 2015, "It’s an imagining of what could've happened... There are no limits of behavior. There are no rules. It's the ultimate playing a fantasy."&lt;ref name="EW 2015-01"/&gt; Director Kay added, "It's what would happen if you let this woman loose on a community."&lt;ref name="EW 2015-01"/&gt; Neil Genzlinger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "the show mixes tidbits of actual history—there really was a Charlie Siringo, for instance—with lots of fiction and speculation, so don't take anything here seriously".&lt;ref name="NYT 2015-03"/&gt;

In June 2015, Lifetime opted to not produce further episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2015/06/24/lizzie-borden-chronicles-cancelled-season-2-lifetime/ |title=''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles'' Not Returning for Season 2 |first=Andy |last=Swift |publisher=[[TVLine]] |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete series was released on DVD by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] on February 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017RR5T22?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00|title=The Lizzie Borden Chronicles: Season 1|date=2 February 2016|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The series has garnered mixed reviews despite high praise for Ricci's performance as Borden. Jane Borden of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' called the series "playful, wicked brain candy", adding that "Ricci was born to play an 19th-century ax murderer, as it turns out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/lizzie-borden-christina-ricci|title=''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles'' Is Playful, Wicked Brain Candy|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |first=Jane |last=Borden |date=April 5, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Uhlich of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote, "Christina Ricci brings us the axe!

At the time of its demise, it was {{convert|125|ft}} tall, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|17.5|ft}}.

==History==
[[File:Senator Tree, looking upward.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Looking up from the base of The Senator, 1967]]
The [[Seminole]]s and other Native American Indians who lived throughout Central Florida used this tree as a landmark. In the late 19th century, the tree attracted visitors even though much of the surrounding land was [[swamp]]; reaching the tree was done by leaping from log to log. A walkway was later constructed by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. In 1925, a [[hurricane]] destroyed the top of the tree, reducing its original height of {{convert|165|ft}} to a height of {{convert|118|ft}}. 

The Senator was named for [[Florida Senate|Florida State Senator]] Moses Overstreet, who donated the tree and surrounding land to [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]] for a park in 1927. In 1929, former US President [[Calvin Coolidge]] reportedly visited The Senator and dedicated the site with a commemorative bronze plaque. A photo that was published of Coolidge and his wife near the tree was reported by the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' to have been doctored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/seminole/orl-senator_420120116042039,0,7477910.photo "The Senator cypress tree at Big Tree Park"], OrlandoSentinel.com&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque and portions of an iron fence were stolen by vandals in 1945 and never recovered.&lt;ref name="floridata"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.floridata.com/tracks/thesenator/thesenator.cfm | title = The Senator - Florida's Big Tree | publisher = Floridata | accessdate = 2012-01-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211233658/http://www.floridata.com/tracks/thesenator/thesenator.cfm | archivedate = 2012-02-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire and collapse===
On January 16, 2012, a fire was reported at the top of the Senator tree, which burned from the inside out, "like a chimney."&lt;ref name="not arson"&gt;{{cite web | last=Pavuk | first=Amy | title=Investigator: Fire that destroyed 'The Senator' was not arson | url= http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/seminole/os-senator-cypress-tree-fire-20120116,0,6171920.story | work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] | publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=2012-01-16 | accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the blaze, but the tree collapsed. The charred remains of the tree now stand only {{convert|20|to|25|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="not arson" /&gt;

On February 28, 2012, The Florida Division of Forestry said they arrested Sara Barnes, age 26, in relation to the fire of The Senator. Barnes said she regularly went to the tree site when the park was closed.  On the night of January 16, 2012, Barnes lit a fire with debris so that she could see, but the fire got out of control. Officials said that they found images of the fire being started on Barnes' laptop and on her cellphone.&lt;ref name=arrest /&gt;

In 2014, Barnes was sentenced to 30 months in prison, with the sentence suspended if she could successfully complete five years of probation.  However, in October 2015, Barnes was arrested again on other charges, violating her probation.  Jailed in December 2015, she went to trial in March 2016.  On March 31, 2016, Barnes was found guilty, her probation was rescinded and she was ordered jailed for 30 months, with approximately 10 months credit for time previously served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-tree-burner-sara-barnes-pleads-guilty-20160331-story.html|title=Woman who burned down giant tree going to prison|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|first=Rene|last=Stutzman|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fire===
Some people believe that the tree is still alive today. They have spotted [[sapling]]s at the base of the big tree. Officials also said that the tree was [[cloned]] at one point, and they are searching to bring the clones back.&lt;ref name=arrest /&gt;  In October 2013, Seminole County officials allowed a small, select group of artists and woodworkers to create works of art for the county from the charred remains of the Senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.seminolevoice.com/news/2013/oct/17/seminole-countys-senator-tree-alive-again-art/ |title=Seminole County's 'The Senator' tree lives on in art |publisher=SeminoleVoice.com |date= 2013-10-17 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artisans have created a variety of items, including vases, pens, ornate flutes, and sculptures.  Some of the items have been made available for sale at art shows, and officials are working toward making both a permanent and traveling exhibit with some of the artifacts.

On March 2, 2014, Big Tree Park was re-opened to the public after being closed for almost a year after the fire that destroyed The Senator. A memorial was constructed which includes signage along the newly renovated boardwalk, a playground piece that mimics a bald cypress tree stump and a clone of The Senator that was planted near the playground.  The name for the clone is "The Phoenix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seminolecountyfl.gov/parksrec/PassiveParksandBoatRamps/BigTreePark.aspx |title= Big Tree Park |publisher= SeminoleCountyFL.gov |date=  |accessdate= 2014-06-05 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140713222514/http://www.seminolecountyfl.gov/parksrec/PassiveParksandBoatRamps/BigTreePark.aspx |archivedate= 2014-07-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clone of the Senator was located, and currently is growing at the entrance to Big Tree Park{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

===Statistics===
As of 1993, the Senator was estimated to be 3,500 years old, making it the 5th oldest tree in the world.&lt;ref name="floridata" /&gt; The tree's volume had previously been estimated at {{convert|4300|cuft|m3}}, but a 2006 survey by Will Blozan of the Native Tree Society has measured the volume at well over {{convert|5100|cuft|m3}}, making The Senator not only the largest Bald Cypress in the United States, but also the largest tree of any species east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name=NativeTree&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nativetreesociety.org/fieldtrips/florida/senator/senator_cypress.htm | title = The Senator Cypress is re-elected to top position in Eastern Forests | publisher = Eastern Native Tree Society | date = 2006-05-08 | accessdate = 2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Three Towers Hike''' is a Scouting-organised, [[downland]] [[hiking]] competition held annually in early spring, covering footpaths in West [[Berkshire]] and South [[Oxfordshire]]. It is organised by a team of scout leaders from Reading Central, Loddon, Taceham Hundred and Pang Valley Scout Districts, all of which are within the Scout County of [[Scouting in South East England#Royal Berkshire Scout County|Royal Berkshire]] of [[the Scout Association]].

It is a competitive event, without an overnight camp (although teams must be equipped to bivouac if the conditions are severe enough to warrant it). It was first held as a senior event (Walkers over the age of 18) but now includes three other age groups.

==Scheduling==

The hike usually takes place on the second or third Saturday in April, but this may vary depending on the timing of Easter. The event accepts registration from 1 November the previous year.

==History==

The first Three Towers Hike took place during the 1970s, when only the Senior event was available. Originally based around the North and West of Reading, the hike gets its name from the three large water towers that were passed.

In the 1980s the route was significantly altered to include more rural paths in West [[Berkshire]] and South [[Oxfordshire]].

Since its beginning, the Hike has run every year with few exceptions, the most notable being in 2001 due to [[Foot and Mouth]] concerns.

Officially not against the hike rules at the time, one team on the 2002 Junior Event swam across the [[River Thames]] during the race after finding themselves several miles up stream of the nearest bridge. The team then went on to complete the event but were later disqualified and a new hike rule was added to prohibit this in future.

==Events==

The Hike currently comprises four different competitions, each of different lengths and following a slightly different route. The competitions are identified below.

* Classic Event: This is the founding event, open to entries ages 15½  or older. The total length of the Classic Event is 70&amp;nbsp;km (43–45 miles) depending on route taken. This event was known as the Senior Event from 1995 until 2007.
* Explorer Event: Following the popularity of the Scout Event, in 2003 the Explorer Event was added.  This Event is open to any Explorer Scout or Ranger Guide aged at least 13½ but under 18 years. The Explorer Event covers a distance of 45&amp;nbsp;km, or around 28 miles.
* Scout Event: The Scout Event was introduced in the 1990s for scouts aged up to 16 years (later reduced to 14). The Scout Event covers a distance of 27&amp;nbsp;km or about 17 miles. This event was known as the Junior Event from 1995 until 2007.
* Tim's Junket Event: In 2012, in honour of the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]], a fifth event called the Jubilee event was held for one year only. This was an open event for teams aged 16 or over and covered just 15&amp;nbsp;km. This was to encourage participation, in the outdoors adventure that the hike tries to promote, for adults who didn't feel they could manage the Classic event. In 2013 a modified and extended version called the JubileePlus was held with a length of 20&amp;nbsp;km. As a memorial to the long-standing member of hike staff, Tim Jenkins, the JubileePlus was renamed Tim's Junket for future events. This event is open to all ages and particularly family groups.

===Discontinued events===
* ScoutPlus Event: The ScoutPlus Event was introduced in 2010 for Scouts aged 13 and 14. The ScoutPlus Event covered a distance of 40&amp;nbsp;km or about 24 miles. It was discontinued after 2016 due to a low level of uptake.

==Routes and checkpoints==

[[File:Three Towers Hike - route summary.jpg|thumb|Hike route summary]]

The hike does not prescribe a specific route for hikers to use. It publishes a series of checkpoints from which a navigation exercise will deduce the best route to take. In most cases there is usually one obvious path, however, there are some sections where a choice can be made by the navigator.

* Purley: This is the start location for the Classic only. It is located in [[Purley on Thames|Purley-on-Thames]]
* Pangbourne Working Men's Club: This is the start location for the Scout event and is located in the village of [[Pangbourne]].
* Gatehampton: This is the first checkpoint arrived at by Classic and Scout hikers. It is located near to the village of [[Goring-on-Thames]].
* Stitchen's Green: This is the second checkpoint arrived at by Classic and Scout hikers.
* Warren Farm: This is the third checkpoint arrived at by Classic and Scout hikers. It is also a major refreshment and first aid point. The checkpoint is on part of [[The Ridgeway]].
* Fairmile: This is an off-road checkpoint and fourth in sequence. It is visited by Classic and Scout hikers.
* Blewbury: This location was the start of the Explorer event until 2018, hikers having been transported out from Tilehurst. It is visited by Classic and Tim's Junket hikers. From 2013 it was no longer visited by Scout teams. It is located in the village of [[Blewbury]].
* Churn Bridge: This off-road location was a new checkpoint for 2013 and is only for Scout teams. The location is by an old railway bridge that was once part of the [[Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway|DNSR]].
* East Hendred: This location is visited by Classic and Explorer teams. It is located between Blewbury and Catmore on [[The Ridgeway]]
* Catmore: This location is visited by Classic and Explorer teams. It is located between East Hendred and East Ilsley in the tiny hamlet of [[Catmore]].
* East Ilsley: This location is based at the Ilsleys Primary School in [[East Ilsley]] and is visited by all hikers. Prior to 2013 it was the end for Scout and Jubilee hikers.
* Cheseridge: This off-road location was a new checkpoint from 2013 and covers Tim's Junket and Scout routes. It is located between East Ilsley and Compton.
* Compton: This was a new location from 2013 based at Compton Scout HQ in the village of [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] in West Berkshire. It provides a finish location for Scout teams as well as a start and finish for Tim's Junket, from 2018 the Explorer hike also checks-in and starts here.
* Banterwick: This location is west of Hampsread Norreys and is for Explorer and Classic hikers.
* Haw Farm: This location just east of Hampstead Norreys is for Explorer and Classic hikers.
* Ashampstead: This off-road checkpoint location is for Explorer and Classic hikers. It is located between Haw Farm and Pangbourne College.
* Pangbourne College: This checkpoint is located at [[Pangbourne College]] and is for Explorer and Classic hikers.
* Sulham: This off-road location is for Explorer and Classic hikers.
* Water Tower: This landmark location is situated next to [[Tilehurst Water Tower]] for Explorer and Classic hikers.
* 79th Reading: This is the final location of the Explorer and Classic events. It is also the check-in location for the Classic event and is the main control centre for the Three Towers Hike.

* Whisky 5 Alpha (5th Woodley Scouts) recorded a time of 04:14 in 2007, when the Scout event rules allowed for older teams.

==Marketing and branding==
The Three Towers Hike has adopted the Scout Association's branding style including the use of the SerifBlack font family in Scout Purple and Green. Its self-developed i.HIKE brand has raised the event's visibility and is now recognisable as part of the hike's identification.

==Tagline==
The Three Towers Hike's tagline is "Outdoors, Challenge, Adventure". This was created to convey the core values of the competition.

'''''Torso''''' is a [[true crime]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] [[graphic novel]] written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Marc Andreyko]], with art and lettering by Brian Michael Bendis. It is based on the true story of the [[Cleveland Torso Murderer]], and the efforts of the famous lawman [[Eliot Ness]] and his band of the "Untouchables" to capture him.

Bendis was initially inspired to write the novel after reading the files about the murders. As a [[Cleveland]] native, Bendis wrote the novel to pay homage to his hometown. Together with co-writer Andreyko, they crafted the comic with various historical photographs and clippings from the era. After its release, the graphic novel was critically well-received by the comic book community and elevated Bendis' career in the industry. The graphic novel was originally published by Image Comics and later reprinted under [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Icon Comics|Icon imprint]]. Since then, various attempts to adapt the novel into film have been proposed.

==Publication history==
''Torso'' was originally published as a six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by [[Image Comics]]. Bendis envisioned the comic as a historical true story which he turned into a graphic novel.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mulhollandbooks.com/2012/03/19/1959/|title=TORSO Revisited|publisher=''Mulholland Books''|author=}} March 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Torso'' was written during Bendis' time as a struggling writer in his hometown Cleveland. His inspiration came while working as a cartoonist in the [[Cleveland Plain Dealer]], where his editor gave him access to the Cleveland Torso Murders files. The files contained all of the visual evidences and testimonies, such as photographs, interviews and newspaper excerpts for Bendis to create the novel. His particular inspiration was that of a picture of a coroner examining a dismembered leg with a magnifying glass, which he described as "the opposite of CSI."&lt;ref name="Mull"/&gt; Besides the archives, Bendis and Mark also took information from Eliot Ness' own written interviews. He surmised their work during an interview:

{{bquote|''Torso'' was one of the biggest challenges of my career. Taking on the responsibility of a true story but abstracting it in graphic novel form is a very large mountain to climb. When Marc Andreyko  brought up the idea he was thinking of it only in movie terms, but I became obsessed with the idea of how to do the story as a graphic novel.

Once you delve into that level of reality and research on one project, it becomes the standard to which every other project, whether it is Scarlet or even Spiderman, must rise to.}}

In creating the atmosphere of the comic, Marc used historical photographs and documents combined with his [[black-and-white]] artwork to tell a unique [[Film noir|noir]]e-like story.&lt;ref name="Dill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ninthart.org/display.php?article=209|title=The Friday Review: Torso|publisher=''Ninth Art''|author=Lawrence Rider}} January 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Bendis and Andreyko presented their story in a straightforward cinematic fashion, with the occasional use of silent and repeated panels and sparse dialogue to create tension. The use of photography and clippings in the comic is also focused upon, with Marc's intention of presenting it like a film comic, creating a tone of [[Realism (arts)|realism]].&lt;ref name="Dill"/&gt; Bendis also provided the art and lettering, as well as his trademark "sharp and contrast" dialogue he would later use in his future projects.&lt;ref name="CBR"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Torso'' tells the story of the real life "Torso Murderer", a [[serial killer]] who was active during 1934 to 1938.  He received his nickname because he left only the torsos of his victims.  Without fingerprints or dental records, these victims were very difficult to identify in a time before DNA testing. The investigator on the case was [[Eliot Ness]], Cleveland Safety Director and former head of [[Untouchables (law enforcement)|the Untouchables]].

==Collected editions==
The series was collected in a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], ''Torso: A True Crime Graphic Novel'' ({{ISBN|1582406979}}), in 2001, and also published by Image. Marvel Comics reformatted and reprinted the comic book in its ''[[Icon Comics|Icon]]'' imprint in March 2012.&lt;ref name="Mull"/&gt;

==Reception and awards==
After its release, ''Torso'' was met with critical acclaim from both critics and consumers alike. The graphic novel won the 1999 [[Eisner Award]] for "Comic Book Excellence, Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsutra.com/cs/comics/awards/eisners/1999_san_diego_awards.htm Awards Presented at the 1999 Comic-Con International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5VbSwcpzv?url=http://www.comicsutra.com/cs/comics/awards/eisners/1999_san_diego_awards.htm |date=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Torso'' was nominated for an International Horror Guild award for best graphic story and for 3 International [[Eagle Award (comics)|Eagle Awards]]. The graphic novel elevated both Bendis and Marc's careers in the comic book industry, which soon led Bendis being discovered and recruited by Marvel as well as solidifying his reputation as a crime writer.&lt;ref name="CBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/from-alias-to-ultimate-spider-man-brian-michael-bendis-greatest-runs|title=From "Alias" to "Ultimates", Brian Michael Bendis' Greatest Runs|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|author=}} March 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' called it "one of the great crime comics of the late 20th Century."&lt;ref name="CBR"/&gt;

Today, the graphic novel is considered as one of the best of its genre. ''[[Comics Alliance]]'' listed the graphic novel in its "8 of the Best Noir Comics", calling it a "an engaging and — unsurprisingly — genuinely creepy story."&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/best-noir-comics/ |title=8 of the Best Noir Comics: Crime Does Pay |publisher=''Comics Alliance'' |author=Chris Sims |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074604/http://comicsalliance.com/best-noir-comics/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} May 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Top Tenz'' ranked in at #4 in its list "Top 10 Crime Comics", describing it as a "stunning and chilling examination of one of America’s great unsolved crime sprees."&lt;ref name="T10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-crime-comics.php|title=Top 10 Crime Comics|publisher=''Top Tenz''|author=Nathaniel Hood}} February 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Schedeen from [[IGN]] ranked ''Torso'' at #5 in her "9 Great Murder Mystery Comics", stating that it "used these real-world events to weave a great mystery with a dramatic climax."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/05/9-great-murder-mystery-comics?page=2|title=9 Great Murder Mystery Comics|publisher=''[[IGN]]''|author=Jesse Schedeen}} August 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
On January 12, 2006, ''Variety'' reported that director [[David Fincher]] would be directing a [[Torso (2009 film)|film version]] of ''Torso'' for [[Miramax]].  The producers are Bill Mechanic, [[Don Murphy]], [[Todd McFarlane]] and [[Terry Fitzgerald (producer)|Terry Fitzgerald]].  Screenwriter [[Ehren Kruger]] is set to adapt the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=David Fincher Helming ''Torso''|work=Coming Soon|date=|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=12668|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 27, 2009 unedited episode of Fanboy Radio, Bendis confirmed the Torso film has been canceled by [[Miramax]] and the rights have reverted to Bendis. The story of the failed attempt to make the film was told in Bendis's autobiographical graphic novel, ''[[Fortune and Glory]]''.

In 2013, new plans for an adaptation was greenlit, with [[David Lowery (director)|David Lowery]] hired to write and direct the film.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=44982|title=BENDIS &amp; ANDREYKO'S "TORSO" TO BE ADAPTED BY SUNDANCE FAVORITE LOWERY|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|author=}} April 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Bendis said that while the projects had its ups and downs over the last 15 years, he’s never lost belief in its cinematic potential.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aint-bodies-saints-filmmaker-adapt-433273 Hollywood Reporter: 'Ain't Them Bodies Saints' Filmmaker to Adapt Brian Michael Bendis' 'Torso' (Exclusive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elections to the [[United States House of Representatives]]''' for the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] were held in 1788 and 1789, coinciding with the election of [[George Washington]] as first [[President of the United States]]. The dates and methods of election were set by the states. Actual political parties did not yet exist, but new members of Congress were informally categorized as either "[[Pro-Administration Party (United States)|pro-Administration]]" (i.e., pro-Washington and pro-[[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]) or "[[Anti-Administration Party|anti-Administration]]".

The first session of the first House of Representatives came to order in [[Federal Hall]], New York City on March 4, 1789, with only thirteen members present. The requisite quorum (thirty members out of fifty-nine) was not present until April 1, 1789. The first order of business was the election of a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. On the first ballot, [[Frederick Muhlenberg]] was elected Speaker by a majority of votes. The business of the first session was largely devoted to legislative procedure rather than policy.

==Election summaries==
In the 18th and much of the 19th century, each state set its own date for elections. In many years, elections were even held after the legal start of the Congress, although typically before the start of the first session. In the elections for the 1st Congress, five states held elections in 1788, electing a total of 29 Representatives, and six held elections in 1789, electing a total of 30 Representatives. Two states, [[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]], did not ratify the Constitution until November 21, 1789 and May 29, 1790 respectively, well after the Congress had met for the first time, and, consequently, elected representatives late, in 1790, leaving North Carolina unrepresented in the 1st session and Rhode Island in the 1st and 2nd sessions of a total of 3 sessions.

Massachusetts required a majority vote, necessitating additional votes if no one won a majority. This was necessary in 4 of the districts.

In the fourth district, {{Quote|The first election in the district was in part a reflection of the rivalry between [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire]] and [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire]] counties. Berkshire was the less populous county, but four of the six candidates who received the most votes - Theodore Sedgwick, William Whiting, Thompson J. Skinner, and William Williams - were residents of the county. The two Hampshire candidates were Samuel Lyman and John Worthington. The first election did not reflect the fact that the two counties were centers of agrarian discontent and of support for [[Shays's Rebellion]]. Nor did it reflect the fact that in the state Convention the Hampshire delegates voted 32 to 19 and the Berkshire delegates voted 16 to 6 against ratification of the Constitution. Only Whiting was regarded as a Shaysite and an Anti-Federalist, while the other five men were Federalists - and two of these - Worthington and Williams - had been virtual if not actual Loyalists during the Revolution. The issue of amendments to the Constitution was not raised during the first election in the district, but it became so important in the ensuing elections that Theodore Sedgwick, who opposed amendments, publicly promised to support them before the fifth election, which he won.| {{cite book| title=The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections: 1788-1790 | volume=I | page=603}}}}

In the fifth district, {{Quote|The only problem was whether Partridge could retain his post of sheriff of Plymouth County and accept a seat in Congress, as he had done in 1779-1782 and 1783-1785. He received a certificate from Governor [[John Hancock|Hancock]] on 10 January notifying him of his election. Partridge wrote three letters to the Governor. In the first, which he apparently did not send, he refused the appointment. He accepted in the two following letters but explained that he would not take the seat if he had to give up his post as sheriff (12, 20 January, 23 February). The issue of whether or not a state officeholder could retain a state post and still serve in Congress had been and would be raised in other states. On 12 February Governor [[John Hancock|Hancock]] asked his Council for advice about Partridge and about George Leonard, judge of probate in Bristol County, who had been elected to Congress from the Bristol-Dukes-Nantucket District. The Council replied in writing the same day that it was 'inexpedient' for a man to hold the office of judge of probate and a seat in Congress, but that it did not find anything in the state constitution which prevented a sheriff from also being a member of Congress. The Council advised, however, that it would be inexpedient to introduce the practice of sheriffs being absent for long periods although Partridge 'may at present be indulged' and take a seat in Congress 'consistently with the safety of that county' (Council Proceedings, Thursday 12 February, M-Ar). The next day Governor [[John Hancock|Hancock]] sent the Council's written reply to the legislature and asked for its advice (13 February, Miscellaneous Legislative Documents, House Files, M-Ar). The two houses appointed a joint committee which wrote a report that was approved and sent to the Governor on Monday, 16 February. The legislature declared that if George Leonard continued to hold the office of judge of probate and also took a seat on Congress, any future legislature would address the Governor authorizing him and the Council to appoint another person judge of probate in Bristol County. But the legislature refused to give advice about George Partridge. It pointed out that sheriffs served during the pleasure of the governor, and (with the advice of his Council) were removable by him at any time. Sheriffs were not removable in any other way except through impeachment by the House and a trial before and conviction by the Senate. Therefore the House and Senate declared that intervention by the legislature was 'neither necessary or proper; and from the conduct and advice of your Council, they see no reason to doubt the wisdom of that constitutional provision' (House and Senate Proceedings, 13, 14, 16 February). | {{cite book| title=The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections: 1788-1790 | volume=I | page=575-76}}}}

In the eighth district, {{Quote|It was evident before the elections were completed in Worcester District that a candidate who did not support amendments to the Constitution had no chance of winning. The three leading candidates in the three Worcester District elections were Jonathan Grout, Timothy Paine, and Artemas Ward. Grout, a local leader during the Revolution, had voted against ratification of the Constitution and in 1788 was a member of the legislature. Paine, a prominent officeholder in the county for two decades before the Revolution, had been appointed to the Royal Council in 1774. Unlike most 'mandamus councillors,' he did not become a Loyalist. By 1788 he had regained much of his influence in the town of Worcester. Ward had been appointed commanding general of Massachusetts troops after Lexington and Concord, he remained in charge until George Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in July 1775. The popular Ward resigned his commission in April 1776 and returned to state politics. The past records of these three men did not become a public issue until shortly before the third and final election.&lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;AS in the two previous election, the two Worcester newspapers, with one exception, printed nothing until their last issues before the election on 2 March. The exception consisted of two items (one of which supported Timothy Paine) in the [[Massachusetts Spy]] on 19 February. Then on 26 February the [[Massachusetts Spy]] published five articles. Two of them supported Jonathan Grout, one supported Artemas Ward, one backed Timothy Paine, and the fifth did not mention any names. On the same day the American Herald published four items. One supported Grout, one opposed Paine because he had been a mandamus councillor, and the other two items urged that he be elected. The issue of Paine's appointment as a mandamus councillor by the British government in 1774 had been brought up for the first time by the Boston Independent Chronicle, 12 February, and not by the Worcester newspapers. Despite the ambivalence of the newspapers, there was a considerable increase of interest, for the vote almost doubled over the first election on 18 December 1788: from 1,886 to 3,484. Grout was elected Representative by a decisive majority. Artemas Ward, who ran a poor third in each of the three elections, finally defeated Grout in the election to the second Congress in 1791. Paine was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1789.|{{cite book| title=The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections: 1788-1790 | volume=I | page=601, 676}}}}

The election of all four representatives was contested, but the records that explained the precise grounds on which the election was contested have been lost due to the burning of Washington in the [[War of 1812]]. It is known to have related to questions of regularity and procedure. All four representatives' elections were ruled valid.&lt;ref name="roster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/bioguide-front/1.pdf |title=First Congress March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1791 [membership roster] |website=artandhistory.house.gov |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=January 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205220514/http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/bioguide-front/1.pdf |archive-date=December 5, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 '''''Verano de Escándalo''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Summer of Scandal") was the third annual ''[[Verano de Escándalo]]'' [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The show took place on September 17, 1999, in [[Mexico City]], Mexico. The Main event featured a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage Match]] ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' where the loser would have to unmask or have his hair shaved off. The team of [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]] and [[Octagón]] faced [[Jaque Mate (wrestler)|Jaque Mate]] and Kick Boxer.

==Production==
===Background===
First held during the summer of 1997 the Mexican [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] began holding a major wrestling show during the summer, most often in September, called ''[[Verano de Escándalo]]'' ("Summer of Scandal").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/verano.html | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración Verano de Escándalo | accessdate = February 19, 2009| publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Verano de Escándalo'' show was an annual event from 1997 until 2011, then AAA did not hold a show in 2012 and 2013 before bringing the show back in 2014, but this time in June, putting it at the time AAA previously held their ''[[Triplemanía]]'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://luchalibreaaa.com/carteleraaaa/item/1483-junio-7-verano-de-esc%C3%A1ndalo-plaza-de-toros-la-concordia-orizaba-veracruz.html | title = Junio 7 - Verano de Escándalo: Plaza de Toros La Concordia, Orizaba, Veracruz | accessdate=June 8, 2014 | work=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 and 2013 ''[[Triplemanía XX]]'' and ''[[Triplemanía XXI]]'' was held in August instead of the early summer.&lt;ref name=Trip20Announced&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/triplemania-xx-5-de-agosto-en-la-arena-ciudad-de-mexico/ | title= Triplemania XX: 5 de agosto en la Arena Ciudad de México. | last=Acosta | first=Carlos R. | date= May 31, 2012 | accessdate=June 18, 2012 | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show often features championship matches or ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' or bet matches where the competitors risked their [[wrestling mask]] or hair on the outcome of the match. In ''[[Lucha Libre]]'' the ''Lucha de Apuetas'' match is considered more prestigious than a championship match and a lot of the major shows feature one or more ''Apuesta'' matches. The 1999 ''Verano de Escándalo'' show was the third show in the series.

===Storylines===
The ''Verano de Escándalo'' show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

==Controversy==

In January 2018, former volunteers and employees of Wicked Faire and other events organized by Jeff Mach Events (JME) accused JME founder Jeff Mach of sexual misconduct and questionable practices surrounding volunteer and employee compensation and event safety.&lt;ref&gt;https://owleyeview.blogspot.com/2018/01/time-to-name-drop-and-protect-newbies.html?m=1&lt;/ref&gt; 

A new company, Silver Phoenix Society, attempted to purchase the intellectual property from Widdershins. Tammy Shipps, the president of Silver Phoenix and one of the panel presenters at Wicked Faire: Reborn, purchased the IP on March 13, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SilverPhoenixOrg/posts/1733603456725057|title=Silver Phoenix Society|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Willey House''' at [[Crawford Notch]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] is associated principally with a tragedy of August 28, 1826, in which seven members of the Willey family and two other people died. Out of that event came a boost to the nascent tourism industry of the area.

== Background ==
The Willey House was originally known as Old Notch House and had been built in 1793. [[Abel Crawford|Ethan Crawford]] acquired it in 1823 for use as an inn to accommodate his growing business as a mountain guide, and in 1826 it was occupied by a family headed by Samuel J. Willey Jr.&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825–1861 |editor1-first=Catherine Hoover |editor1-last=Voorsanger |editor2-first=John K. |editor2-last=Howat |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87099-957-4 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j8dzQHVdv9oC&amp;pg=PA115 |chapter=Selling the Sublime and the Beautiful: Landscape Painting and Tourism |first=Kevin J. |last=Avery |pages=115-118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book |title=This Grand &amp; Magnificent Place: The Wilderness Heritage of the White Mountains |first=Christopher |last=Johnson |publisher=UPNE |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-58465-461-2 |pages=55-58 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uzBIKlqDu74C&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1826 disaster ==
Northern [[New England]] experienced a drought in the summer of 1826, which ended with the arrival of a terrific storm on the evening of August 28. Flooding followed, with the valley at Crawford Notch being one place that suffered the consequences. All but two of the bridges on the [[Toll road|turnpike]] that ran through the notch were destroyed, trees suffered a similar fate and the high sides of the valley were gouged by swollen streams and [[landslide]]s. The Willey House was a scene of desolation due to the effects of an avalanche on a mountain behind it. The house, however, had survived in an island of calm because the surging debris split either side on a low ridge and then unified again beyond it.&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;{{cite book |title=The White Mountains: Alps of New England |first=Randall H. |last=Bennett |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-73852-433-7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xT1zt3O1kNUC&amp;pg=PA63 |pages=63-68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local residents, including [[Abel Crawford|Ethan Crawford]] and the Reverend Benjamin G. Willey, Samuel's brother, visited the house in the aftermath of the storm. It was empty, with signs that there may have been a rapid departure from it, such as unmade beds, clothes strewn around and ashes in the fireplace.&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt; There was an open Bible on the table.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; A search of the devastated area over the next few days revealed the bodies of the Willey parents, two of their daughters and two hired hands; the remains of the other three Willey children were never found.&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt; Some livestock had also been killed, including those in a now-destroyed stable.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;

There followed various theories as to what had happened, the most likely of which is that the occupants abandoned the property as the avalanche approached but in doing so, in darkness, they unwittingly put themselves in the path of it around the point where the flow reunited.&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt;

== Tourist attraction ==
News of the disaster spread, initially through many regional newspapers,&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt; and also through media such as [[Theodore Dwight (author)|Theodore Dwight's]] guidebook, ''The Northern Traveller''&lt;!--"traveller" is spelled correctly in this instance--&gt;.&lt;ref name="avery"/&gt; People began to visit the site, drawn to the scene of devastation, human tragedy and the miraculous survival of the structure itself. As well as boosting a nascent tourist industry in the area, in which the Crawford family had already been playing a significant part, it became a source of inspiration for artists and writers. The {{convert|4000|ft|m|adj=on}} peak on the western wall of the notch became known as [[Mount Willey]].&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt;

Dona Brown believes that the artist [[Thomas Cole]] and other visitors, such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], used the interest in the tragedy to further their careers, deliberately painting and writing about an area that had suddenly gained national attention. Ethan Crawford, too, exploited it by, for example, ensuring that the Willey House was well signposted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inventing New England: Regional Tourism in the Nineteenth Century |first=Dona |last=Brown |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=2014 |origyear=1995 |isbn=978-1-58834-430-4 |pages=60, 62 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eKhqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crawfords had been directly affected by the storm, with Ethan's property suffering {{USD}}1000 of damage and his father's farm being wrecked almost beyond repair, but they were also affected in a positive manner with the subsequent influx of tourists. In 1828, Ethan began construction of a new inn, called the Notch House, at the northern end of the notch, appointing his brother Thomas to run it. The business opened in 1829 and attracted many notable people, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], Hawthorne, [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Daniel Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=This Grand &amp; Magnificent Place: The Wilderness Heritage of the White Mountains |first=Christopher |last=Johnson |publisher=UPNE |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-58465-461-2 |pages=58-59 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uzBIKlqDu74C&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawthorne was inspired by the Willey tragedy to write a short story titled "[[The Ambitious Guest]]" in 1835,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sears |first=John F. |title=Hawthorne's "The Ambitious Guest" and the Significance of the Willey Disaster |journal=American Literature |volume=54 |issue=3 |date=October 1982 |pages=354–367 |jstor=2925848 |doi=10.2307/2925848 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Cole noted in his diary that "The site of the Willey House, with its little patch of green in the gloomy desolation, very naturally recalled to mind the horrors of the night when the whole family perished beneath an avalanche of rocks and earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noble |first=Louis Legrand |title=The Life and Works of Thomas Cole |publisher=Black Dome Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-883789-13-8 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace Fabyan, who was a merchant and a speculator in the emerging tourism industry, took control of the Willey House in 1845 and converted it into a 50-bed hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inventing New England: Regional Tourism in the Nineteenth Century |first=Dona |last=Brown |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=2014 |origyear=1995 |isbn=978-1-58834-430-4 |page=65|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eKhqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitor interest in the effects of the disastrous storm waned over time, despite the efforts of people such as Benjamin Willey to maintain and profit by it by offering guided tours of the house for a fee. It had become old news and nature had taken it course to cover much of the scenic damage.&lt;ref name="avery"/&gt;

The site of the house and the landslide is now an [[Interpretation centre|interpretive center]] within [[Crawford Notch State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.nhstateparks.org/visit/state-parks/crawford-notch-state-park.aspx| title=Crawford Notch State Park| publisher=NH Division of Parks and Recreation| access-date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
