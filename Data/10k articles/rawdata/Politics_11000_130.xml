The '''political crisis in Ukraine''' lasted from April to June 2007 was part of political stand off between coalition and opposition factions of [[Verkhovna Rada]] that led to the unscheduled [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007]]. It started on 2 April 2007 as a culmination of long lasting crisis and degradation of the parliamentary coalition when the [[President of Ukraine]] ([[Viktor Yushchenko]]) attempted to dissolve the parliament.  The following day, in light of impending political unrest, the [[United Nations]] [[Resident Coordinator]], [[Francis Martin O'Donnell]] following an earlier call to deepen democracy and liberalize the economy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org.ua/en/information-centre/news/352-2007-03-21]&lt;/ref&gt; exceptionally issued an advisory statement of principles on behalf of the Country Team&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727191528/http://www.un.org.ua/files/unct_ukraine_statement_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (followed by a visit by former Estonian President [[Arnold Rüütel]] on 23 April).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org.ua/en/information-centre/news/364-2007-04-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

The president signed a presidential decree based on several articles of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] ordering early parliamentary elections in [[Ukraine]] to be held on 27 May 2007,&lt;ref name="order_264/2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minjust.gov.ua/files/THE_DECREE_OF_THE_PRESIDENT_OF_UKRAINE.rtf|title=The Decree of the President of Ukraine On the Pre-Term Abatement of Authorities of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=11 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225937/http://www.minjust.gov.ua/files/THE_DECREE_OF_THE_PRESIDENT_OF_UKRAINE.rtf|archive-date=27 September 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were later postponed to 24 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6594037.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ukrainian president delays poll | date=26 April 2007 | accessdate=22 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420233944/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6594037.stm| archivedate= 20 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ordered the government of Ukraine to finance the appointed elections. [[Verkhovna Rada|The Parliament]] and the [[Alliance of National Unity|government of Yanukovych]] called this decree unconstitutional and prevented fund allocation for elections. An appeal against the President's decree was lodged in Ukraine's Constitutional Court, which was considering the appeal.&lt;ref name="appeal_CCU/2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20070402/62965464.html|title=Yushchenko interference unconstitutional - Ukraine parl. speaker|publisher=[[RIAN]]|date=2 April 2007| accessdate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Court was expected to conclude its public hearing on Wednesday, 25 April 2007, following the presentation of the Government and Parliament's submission. The Court would then retire to consider their ruling.&lt;ref name="CCU_25/04/2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11457245&amp;PageNum=0|title=Ukraine’s CC to complete questioning on early elections in 2 days|publisher=[[ITAR-TASS]]|date=21 April 2007| accessdate= 21 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viktor Yushchenko suspended the decree and postponed date of the election in order to have approved legislation on elections, the opposition, and the operation of Parliament.&lt;ref name="postponed_conditional"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11444273|title=Yushchenko doesn't rule out postponement of elections|date=18 April 2007|publisher=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR TASS]]| accessdate= 21 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dismissal of parliament and new elections==
{{Politics of Ukraine}}
{{main article|Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007}}
Leading up to the dissolution of parliament was the eight-month power struggle between the president and the parliament.&lt;ref name="president"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_14702.html|title=President dissolves parliament|publisher=Press office of President Victor Yushchenko|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=3 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901163210/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_14702.html|archive-date=1 September 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing power struggles between the [[Alliance of National Unity|Coalition of National Unity]] and the opposition supported by the president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] frequently resulted in the opposition boycotting the parliament's plenary sessions.

Prior to the President's 2 April decree dismissing Ukraine's Parliament, 11 members of the opposition supported the governing Coalition of National Unity (formerly the ''Anti-Crisis Coalition''). The President of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, claimed that the right of individual members of a parliamentary faction to support the governing coalition was contrary to the provisions of [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 83|Ukraine's Constitution]].

Article 83 clause six, in what is commonly referred to as the [[Imperative mandate (provision in the Constitution of Ukraine)|Imperative mandate]] stated ''"According to election results and on the basis of a common ground achieved between various political positions, a coalition of parliamentary factions shall be formed in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to include a majority of People’s Deputies of Ukraine within the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine"''.&lt;ref name="Yushchenko_FT_letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/11cb086c-e249-11db-af9e-000b5df10621.html |title=Ukraine's crisis needs a firm response |publisher=Financial Times |first=Viktor |last=Yushchenko |authorlink=Viktor Yushchenko |date=4 April 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506105213/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/11cb086c-e249-11db-af9e-000b5df10621.html |archivedate=6 May 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Imperative mandate" provision of Ukraine's Constitution came under strong criticism by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] as being undemocratic.&lt;ref name="PACE_report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11255.htm |title=Functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine |date=17 April 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000656/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc07%2FEDOC11255.htm |archivedate=5 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliamentary Assembly in its Explanatory memorandum dated 17 April 2007 had emphasized{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

{{quote|Although Ukraine understandably has its own historic reasons to avoid the accumulation of power into the hands of one political force, it should nevertheless consider in the course of future constitutional amendments whether it would not be better for the country to switch to a full parliamentary system with proper checks and balances and guarantees of parliamentary opposition and competition. | Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe | 2007}}

The week before the president's initial decree, on 2 April, dismissing Ukraine's Parliament, thousands of supporters of the opposition gathered in Kiev, calling on the President dissolve the parliament. A similar number of supporters of Verkhovna Rada Governing majority also gathered in Kiev supporting Ukraine's parliament.&lt;ref name="protests"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6512941.stm |title=Ukrainian rivals rally in capital |date=1 April 2007 |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]] |accessdate=3 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416123619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6512941.stm |archivedate=16 April 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April, the President, Viktor Yushchenko, following a meeting with Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and Speaker of the Parliament [[Oleksandr Moroz]], signed the first decree dismissing Ukraine's Parliament sparking another political and constitutional crisis in Ukraine.

At 11 PM the President, in a televised speech to the nation, announced his decree dismissing the parliament and ordering early parliamentary elections to be initially held on 27 May.&lt;ref name="president" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dwglMctT0|title=Yushchenko announces his dismissal of the Verkhovna Rada|publisher=[[YouTube]]|work=[[5 Kanal (Ukraine)|5 Kanal]]|date=2 April 2007|language=Ukrainian| accessdate= 26 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rada, passed a motion declaring the decree unconstitutional, in defiance of the president's decree continued to function,&lt;ref name="837-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=837-16|title=On prevention of actions that threaten constitutional law and order, civilian calmness and stability in Ukraine|work=Order of Verkhovna Rada|date=2 April 2007|language=Ukrainian| accessdate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued orders preventing funds allocation for elections,&lt;ref name="839-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=839-16|title=About political situation in Ukraine, related to order or President from 2 April 2007|work=Order of Verkhovna Rada|date=2 April 2007|language=Ukrainian| accessdate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and canceled the order assigning [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|election commission]] members.&lt;ref name="844-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=844-16|title=Cancel order of Verkhovna Rada about assignment of Central Election Commission members|work=Order of Verkhovna Rada |date=2 April 2007|language=Ukrainian| accessdate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinet, supporting the parliament, refused to allocate funds for the new election.&lt;ref name="595-2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=595-2007-%EF|title=About immediate actions on implementation of Verkhovna Rada order N 837-V|work=Order of Cabinet of Ministers|date=3 April 2007|language=Ukrainian| accessdate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality and authority of the President's determination to dismiss Ukraine's previous parliament has been the subject of a challenge in Ukraine's Constitutional Court.

On 30 April 2007 On the eve of the Court’s ruling on the legality of the President's decrees, Viktor Yushcheko intervened in the operation and independence of Ukraine's Constitutional Court by dismissing three Constitutional Court judges. The President's actions were later determined by Ukrainian courts of have been illegal and one of the judges dismissed has been reinstated; the other two judges resigned. Following the President's intervention the Constitutional Court has not ruled on the legality of the previous parliament's dismissal.

==Political crisis==
The [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] is examining an inquiry submitted by a group of 53 members of parliament who question the constitutional legitimacy of the parliament's dissolution. This inquiry is based on interpretation that the President had no authority under Ukraine's constitution to dissolve parliament under the conditions listed in Article [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 90|90]]&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDLEGAL/44a280124.pdf|format=PDF|title=Constitution of Ukraine (with 2004 amendments)|publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]|date=8 December 2004|pages=27–28| accessdate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} Unofficial translation.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="837-16"/&gt; which is the only article in Ukraine's Constitution that empowers the President to dismiss Ukraine's Parliament.&lt;ref name="Justice_expertise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minjust.gov.ua/0/9214 |title=Results of legal expertise of President order N 264 from 2 April 2007 |first=Oleksandr |last=Lavrynovych |publisher=Ministry of Justice of Ukraine |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427200213/http://www.minjust.gov.ua/0/9214 |archivedate=27 April 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the decree mentions Articles [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 5|5]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 69|69]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 77|77]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 83|83]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 102|102]], and [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 106|106]].&lt;ref name="order_264/2007"/&gt;

On 4 April, [[Ivan Dombrovskyy]], the Chairman of the Constitutional Court, filed for resignation, stating that he is under pressure. However, the judges rejected it.

On 5 April, Yanukovych has announced that during telephone conversation asked the [[Austria]]n [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] to mediate in the dispute.&lt;ref name="PM_mediate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6529851.stm |title=Ukraine PM asks Austria to help |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=5 April 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426235017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6529851.stm |archivedate=26 April 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no immediate response from Gusenbauer's office, and Austrian diplomats were surprised by the news about his help request.&lt;ref name="mediate_response"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070406/wl_afp/ukrainepolitics|title=Rival Ukraine leaders hold crisis talks as deadlock persists|first=Olga|last=Nedbayeva|publisher=Yahoo News|date=6 April 2007| accessdate= 8 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April, the [[Alliance of National Unity]] tried to compromise by dismissing the individuals from opposition fractions who had joined them and ratifying a parliamentary law banning individual membership in coalitions.&lt;ref name="individuals_compromise"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-04/07/content_5945535.htm|title=Ukrainian parliament makes compromise with president|date=7 April 2007|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]| accessdate= 8 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four members of Central Election Commission - Yuriy Donchenko, Ihor Kachur, Bronislav Raykovskyy, and Oleksandr Chupakhin (reportedly affiliated with the Anti-Crisis Coalition) took sickness leave - thus effectively blocked work of commission as there is no [[quorum]].&lt;ref name="sick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=757551|title=Listing clocks|date=10 April 2007|author=Vycheslav Sirman|author2=Mustafa Naiem|publisher=[[Kommersant|Kommersant-Ukraine]]| accessdate= 10 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 6 April in Constitutional Court, there are constitutional legitimacy questions from the President on an order of the Cabinet Ministers supporting the Verkhovna Rada and from 102 deputies on changes done to constitution in 2004.&lt;ref name="court_status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccu.gov.ua/pls/wccu/p004?lang=0&amp;rej=0&amp;pf6031=134|title=Status of 72 questions asked|work=Official Constitutional Court of Ukraine website|date=6 April 2007|format=DOC|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717074854/http://www.ccu.gov.ua/pls/wccu/p004?lang=0&amp;rej=0&amp;pf6031=134|archive-date=17 July 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April, the Rada has passed a declaration, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.rada.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article/news_left?art_id=91250&amp;cat_id=37486|title=To the Heads of States, Governments and Parliaments of the European countries, Guarantor-States of the security of Ukraine, inter-State and inter-Parliamentary organizations|publisher=Verkhovna Rada official website|date=9 April 2007| accessdate= 10 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Rada called upon the heads of European states, governments, and parliaments to send its representatives to mediate the political crisis.

Ukraine's parliament on 9 April, raising the stakes in the country's ongoing political confrontation, stated &lt;ref name="simultaneous-presidential-parliament-elections "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/09/europe/EU-POL-Ukraine-Politics.php|title=parliament calls for early presidential elections|date=9 April 2007|publisher=[[internatal Herald Tribune|IHT]]| accessdate= 22 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would only support early parliamentary elections a presidential vote is held at the same time.

On 10 April, a [[Luhansk]] municipal courts' ruling, dated 6 April, banning all preparations for the election was publicly announced.

{{Cquote|The Assembly deplores the fact that the judicial system of Ukraine has been systematically misused by other branches of power and that top officials do not execute the courts’ decisions, which is a sign of erosion of this crucial democratic institution. An independent and impartial judiciary is a precondition for the existence of a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Hence the urgent necessity to carry out comprehensive judicial reform, including through amendments to the constitution.
The Assembly reiterates that the authority of the sole body responsible for constitutional justice – the Constitutional Court of Ukraine – should be guaranteed and respected. Any form of pressure on the judges is intolerable and should be investigated and criminally prosecuted. On the other hand, it is regrettable that in the eight months of its new full composition, the Constitutional Court has failed to produce judgments, thus failing to fulfill its constitutional role and to contribute to resolving the crisis in its earlier stages, which undermines the credibility of the court. There is an urgent need for all pending judgments, and in particular the judgment concerning the constitutionality of the Presidential Decree of 2 April 2007, to be delivered. If delivered, the latter should be accepted as binding by all sides.}}

Yushchenko cited Constitution Article [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 78|78]] which states "Where there emerge circumstances infringing requirements concerning the incompatibility of the deputy’s mandate with other types of activity, the People’s Deputy of Ukraine shall within twenty days from the date of the emergence of such circumstances discontinue such activity or lodge a personal application for divesting of People’s Deputy authority" and Item 1 of Article 3 of Law № 2783-IV&lt;ref name="2783-IV"&gt;{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=Presidential Decree|law=357/2007|name= On peculiarities of firing the persons who combine deputy mandate with other types of activity|date=8 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; when issuing his decree on the dismissal of the Prosecutor General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_16063.html|title=President comments on Piskun's sacking|date=24 May 2006|work=[[President of Ukraine]]|accessdate=25 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108133917/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_16063.html|archive-date=8 January 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President appointed Viktor Shemchuk, the Prosecutor General of Crimea, as a replacement to Svyatoslav Piskun.&lt;ref name="kommersant-05-24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p768566/Ukraine_crisis|title=Ukrainian State in Meltdown|date=24 May 2006|work=[[Kommersant]]| accessdate= 25 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After Piskun's dismissal, thousands of protesters marched to his office in Kiev protesting his dismissal.

After over seven hours of discussions, Yushchenko, Yanukovych, and the Verkhovna Rada [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] have come to an agreement by setting the date for [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|new parliamentary elections]] on 30 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.korrespondent.net/main/191968|title=Results of Yushchenko's meeting: new parliamentary elections will be held on September 30|publisher=[[Korrespondent]]|date=27 May 2007|language=Russian| accessdate= 27 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. food regulations, an '''Acceptable Market Name''' is a set of guidelines for names of [[seafood]] sold in [[interstate commerce]].

The Acceptable Market Names are recommendations, and not legally enforceable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7408">The '''Accountability and Justice Act''' ({{lang-ar-at|على قانون المساءلة والعدالة|qanun al-musa' ala wa al-adala}}) of 2008 is a legislative act passed by the [[Iraq]]i [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Council of Representatives]] in January 2008.

The law reformed the practice of [[de-Baathification]], extending de-Baathification to the judiciary, while reinstating jobs and pensions to low-ranking members of the ousted [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Baath Party]]. The [[Higher National De-Ba'athification Council|De-Ba'athification Council]] was made permanent though renamed to ''Accountability and Justice Commission'' and reformed in scope and policy.

The law was passed by the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Council of Representatives]] on 12 January 2008, with only 140 out of 275 members being present. After Vice President [[Tariq al-Hashimi]] refused to sign, the controversial law was passed by a majority vote by the [[Presidency Council of Iraq|Presidency Council]].

== Details ==

The law defines [[de-Baathification]] as "The procedures… to intellectually, administratively, politically, culturally and economically dismantle the Ba’ath Party system in Iraqi society, state institutions, and civil society institutions."  The Ba'ath Party is recognized as the party "which took power on 17/07/1968 and [was] prohibited by article (7) of the Iraqi constitution."  A member of the Ba'ath Party, subject to the penalties of the law is defined as, "any individual who joined the Ba'ath Party and gave an oath of allegiance to it."{{sfn|ICTJ|2008|p=1}}  Collaborators are defined as any individual who worked with or benefited from the Ba'ath Party.{{sfn|ICTJ|2008|p=2}}

The next sections of the law detail the composition and qualifications of the members of the Commission, and the purposes of the Commission.  The stated goal of the Commission is similar to the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]'s (CPA) goal of eliminating any and all traces of Ba'ath Party ideology, in any manifestation, from the political, social, and economic life of Iraq.{{sfn|ICTJ|2008|pp=3 f.}} Additionally, the Commission has the duty of compiling the names and information about members to be maintained in archives that document the Ba'athist period in Iraqi history.{{sfn|ICTJ|2008|pp=4 f.}} Iraqis allowed to return to work in the government are those who held low level positions in the Ba'ath Party are allowed to return to work in some public sector jobs.  However, several key positions and ministries are still barred from these individuals.  Additionally, anyone who profited from being a member of the Ba'ath Party, is barred from additional posts in the public sector.  There is also the possibility that certain individuals will be eligible for pensions, and the law also creates an appeals process for those deemed subject to its penalties.{{sfn|ICTJ|2008|pp=6–8}} Finally, the end of the law provides the Commission’s composition, and the justifications for the law.{{sfn|ICTJ|2008|pp=10–12}}

According to the [[International Centre for Transitional Justice]], the new Justice and Accountability Act is not exactly the reconciliatory reform envisioned. It maintains most of the structures of the [[Higher National De-Ba'athification Council]] (or Independent Iraqi De-Ba'athification Council), and in some cases expands the power of the council to previously immune ministries.  However, the ability for some previously excluded Iraqis to obtain some form of public sector work, and the extension of pensions to some Ba'ath Party members are considered positive developments by the International Centre for Transitional Justice. In reality, the law provides for some protections previously withheld from affected Iraqis while maintaining the structure of CPA Order Nos. 1 and 2, and in some cases expanding upon the powers within those Orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |editor=[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] |title=Briefing Paper: Iraq’s New “Accountability and Justice” Law |url=https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Iraq-Accountability-Briefing-2008-English.pdf |format=PDF |date=22 January 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}

Iraqi diplomat [[Feisal al-Istrabadi]], lead drafter of the 2004 [[Transitional Administrative Law]], praised the law as correcting the overreach of [[Paul Bremer]]'s original [[De-Ba'athification]] decrees, which "captured a large number of people who were innocent of any wrongdoing by any objective measure and were deprived of the ability to earn a living and support their families," thereby feeding the insurgency. Furthermore, though the majority of Ba'ath members were Shia, it was the Sunnis who were disproportionately removed from offices, to the extent that the latter called it "de-Sunnification". Whether the new was a positive step toward [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]], depended on how the law would be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=[[Feisal al-Istrabadi]] |title=Seven Questions: The De-Bremerification of Iraq |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2008/01/16/seven-questions-the-de-bremerification-of-iraq/ |date=16 January 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Freedom Campaign''' is an organization that has as its goal to put restoration of the Constitution on the agenda for Democratic presidential candidates, roughly parallel to the goal of the [[American Freedom Agenda]] for Republican candidates, although Democratic and Republican candidates could sign on to both pledges. It was launched in July 2007 by the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[MoveOn]]. [https://news.yahoo.com/s/thenation/20070727/cm_thenation/1217965]

The group urges presidential candidates to sign its "American Freedom Pledge", which reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are Americans, and in our America we do not torture, we do not imprison people without charge or [[legal recourse]], allow our phones and emails to be tapped without a court order, and above all we do not give any President unchecked power. I pledge to fight to protect and defend the Constitution from assault by any President.

The Constitution protects American Freedom. With checks and balances, and basic legal rights, it has prevented tyranny and safeguarded our liberty. Yet today, under the pretense of the "war on terror," the White House is dismantling the Constitution, concentrating power in the President and undermining the rule of law. THIS IS UN-AMERICAN.

I hereby join the American Freedom Campaign to educate my neighbors about the threat and urge my representatives to confront and correct these abuses of our America.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

AFC was co-founded by [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Wes Boyd]] and [[Human Genome Sciences|William Haseltine]].[http://www.frugalmarketing.com/dtb/2007bea-wolf.shtml]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">'''Angary''' ([[Latin|Lat.]] ''jus angariae''; [[French language|Fr.]] ''droit d'angarie''; [[German language|Ger.]] ''Angarie''; from the [[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] {{lang|grc|ἀγγαρεία}}, ''angareia'', "the office of an {{lang|grc|ἄγγαρος}} ([[courier]] or messenger)") is the name given to the right of a belligerent (most commonly, a [[government]] or other party in conflict) to seize and apply for the purposes of [[war]] (or to prevent the enemy from doing so) any kind of property on belligerent territory, including that which may belong to subjects or citizens of a neutral state.

Article 53 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, annexed to the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] of 1899 on the same subject, provides that railway plant, land [[telegraph]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[Steamboat|steamers]] and other ships (other than such as are governed by [[maritime law]]), though belonging to companies or private persons, ''may be used'' for military operations, but "must be restored at the conclusion of peace ''and'' indemnities paid for them." Article 54 adds that "the plant of [[railway]]s coming from neutral states, whether the property of those states or of companies or private persons, shall be sent back to them as soon as possible."

These articles seem to sanction the right of angary against neutral property, while limiting it as against both belligerent and neutral property. It may be considered, however, that the right to use implies as wide a range of contingencies as the "necessity of war" can be made to cover.

'''''Assassination of Russia''''' ({{lang-ru|Покушение на Россию}}) is a 2002 documentary film that describes the September 1999 [[Russian apartment bombings]] as a terrorism act committed by [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Russian state security services]].&lt;ref name="dissident"&gt;[[Alexander Goldfarb (author)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko. "[[Death of a Dissident|Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB.]]" Free Press, New York, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5165-2}}, pages 249-252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p313379/r_1/Boris_Berezovsky_organized_Assassination_of_Russia/ Boris Berezovsky organized "Assassination of Russia"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was created in 2001 by French producers [[:fr:Jean-Charles Deniau|Jean-Charles Deniau]] and Charles Gazelle. [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] and [[Alexander Litvinenko]] worked as consultants for the film; the film was made on the basis of their book ''[[Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within]]''.

The French producers initially worked for Russian TV company [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] to expand their program "Sugar of Ryazan" and later to [[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]]. When TV-6 channel was closed by Russian authorities, the film was 70% completed. The remaining funds were provided by [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]].&lt;ref name="dissident"/&gt;&lt;ref name="David Levy"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A chapter from David Levy's work in progress "From Chaguanas to Jerusalem: Tribal Conflict in the Global Mosaic" |first=David |last= Levy |journal=The Montréal Review |date=April 2012 |url=http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Post-Soviet-Russia-Chechens-KGB-Khodorkovsky.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader of party ''Liberal Russia'', [[Sergei Yushenkov]] flew to the premier on March 5, 2002, in London, to announce that his party is going to distribute copies of the film around the country to demonstrate "how the secret services deceived Russian citizens".

This film was broadcast by the main TV channels of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="dissident"/&gt;  Russian [[State Duma]] Deputy [[Yuli Rybakov]] brought a hundred copies to St. Petersburg, but the copies were confiscated at customs in violation of his [[parliamentary immunity]].  No TV station in Russia was able to show the film.  Tens of thousands of copies were sold in Russia in 2002.&lt;ref name="dissident"/&gt; Sergei Yushenkov presented the film at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in 2002, decrying lack of civilian control over the Russian armed forces including the secret services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/assassination-russia-film-screening-and-panel-discussion "Assassination of Russia"- Film Screening and Panel Discussion], [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], April 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  A staffer in [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] said, ''"We just cannot go out and say that the president of Russia is a mass murderer. But it is important that we know it."''&lt;ref name="dissident"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">'''Bob Sang''' (27 March 1948 - 5 June 2009) was appointed by [[London South Bank University]] as the UK's first professor of Patient and Public Involvement in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=407188&amp;sectioncode=26&lt;/ref&gt; He had also been a Visiting Fellow at [[CENTRIM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://centrim.mis.brighton.ac.uk/news/sang-memorial&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at the [[University of East Anglia]] but failed his chemistry degree there. He later returned to studying and completed a public administration degree at the [[University of Sussex]].

He was a pioneer of the idea of involving patients, service users and the public in health and social care, describing himself as a 'constructive subversive'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthpolicyinsight.com/?q=node/298&lt;/ref&gt;

Sang was a prolific networker and writer, contributing articles&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;as_epq=bob+sang&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Bob+Sang&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_sdt=1&amp;as_subj=bio&amp;as_subj=med&amp;as_subj=bus&amp;as_subj=soc&amp;as_sdts=5&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; to journals including ''Health Policy Insight'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthpolicyinsight.com/?q=node/304&lt;/ref&gt; ''British Journal of Healthcare Management'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bjhcm.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Journal of Integrated Care''&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cluster=6670628938121356481&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Health Service Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsj.co.uk/bob-sang/1240.contributor&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a career which combined academia, research and working in mental health, he established his own independent consultancy, Sang Jacobsson. His work through Sang Jacobsson included mentoring, training, policy work, facilitation and analysis, and was mainly for clients in the NHS and the UK health economy.

Sang was the co-founder with Jane Keep of the Engaging Communities Learning Network&lt;ref&gt;http://www.networks.nhs.uk/networks.php?pid=19&lt;/ref&gt; for the National Association of Primary and Care Trusts (NatPaCT), which was part of the now-closed [[NHS Modernisation Agency]]. The Engaging Communities Learning Network was designed to help NHS [[primary care trust]]s (PCTs) share good practice and learning about patient and public involvement and engagement.

He provided professional supervision to the ground-breaking Health Foundation Leadership Fellows Scheme which over five years directly involved patients and users in the leadership development of 64 NHS clinicians and managers.

He died of [[acute pancreatitis]] on 5 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jul/02/bob-sang-obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breakthrough Collaborative''' (formerly Summerbridge National) is the umbrella organization of a collaborative of programs across the United States and in Hong Kong that aim to effect positive change in [[Urban area|urban]] schools.  Breakthrough offers high-potential, under-served [[middle school]] students the opportunity to participate in rigorous academic enrichment programs throughout the summer and school year. Students make a commitment to participate in the program through middle school and high school and in turn, Breakthrough provides many services to students and their families, ranging from academic enrichment to one-on-one tutoring to [[high school]] and [[college]] preparation.  Additionally, all Breakthrough classes are taught by talented, high-achieving high school and college students from around the country who are interested in the field of education. Through the teacher development program offered by Breakthrough, these young educators become potential candidates for professional teaching and educational leadership positions after college. Teaching at Breakthrough has been named a Top Ten Internship in America by the [[Princeton Review]], as well as other prestigious national organizations, and a 1999 [[Stanford University]] report stated that "72% [of Breakthrough teachers] went on to work in other educationally related careers or internships after teaching at a Breakthrough site."

Breakthrough was founded in 1978 by Lois Loofbourrow at [[San Francisco University High School]]. Since then, numerous sites have opened, all in various sized urban areas.  The sites are joined together under the umbrella organization, Breakthrough Collaborative, based in San Francisco.  Sites function either through [[public-private partnership]]s with an independent educational institution or maintain their own 501(c)3 status.

Since its inception in 1978, Breakthrough programs around the world have generated thousands of student and teacher alums.  In 2003, the Summerbridge/Breakthrough Alumni Network or SBAN was formed through the efforts of alumni.  SBAN is based out of Atlanta, but holds annual conferences around the United States.

In March 2006, the 22 host schools of Breakthrough programs were awarded the Klingenstein Leadership Award by the Klingenstein Center at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]].  Breaking from the tradition of giving this prestigious award to an individual, 26 independent schools received the 2006 award.  Past recipients include [[William Durden]], [[Diane Ravitch]], [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]], and [[Howard Gardner]].  In 2007, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Summer Learning awarded Breakthrough Collaborative and its affiliate site in Pittsburgh, with the Excellence in Summer Learning Award for exemplary mission, performance, and infrastructure in out-of-school academic support.

'''Breakthrough''' at Hong Kong is called '''Summerbridge Hong Kong'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Summerbridge Hong Kong|url = http://www.summerbridge.org.hk|website = www.summerbridge.org.hk|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerbridge Hong Kong is the only site outside of the United States. A key difference is that at Summerbridge Hong Kong, teachers teach self-designed topics with support from the Dean of Faculty. A typical day for a Summerbridge Hong Kong student consists of morning all-school meeting (ASM), classes in the morning, lunch with teachers, and extracurricular time.

'''British Parliamentary approval for the invasion of Iraq''' was given by the elected members of the [[British House of Commons]] to [[Tony Blair]]'s government on the eve of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], in a series of two votes, on 18 March 2003.

==Constitutional background==
There is no constitutional requirement for the government to seek any explicit form of Parliamentary approval before committing British forces to military action. The [[Royal Prerogative]] permits the government, in the Sovereign's name, to give the order to begin military action.

However the political controversy over whether to participate in military action, which covered the [[legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|legal legitimacy]] as well as foreign policy questions, had been under discussion for many years. As early as 1999, the anti-war MP [[Tam Dalyell]] had proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] Bill called [[Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill]] to "require the prior approval, by a simple majority of the House of Commons, of military action by British forces against Iraq". Dalyell was given leave to bring in his Bill,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990126/debtext/90126-06.htm#90126-06_head1]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}} but it could not be debated and voted upon because as a Bill that affected the [[Royal Prerogative]], the consent of [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]] was needed before it could be debated in Parliament (known as [[Queen's Consent]]). The Government advised Queen Elizabeth II to refuse to grant consent, which she did, as constitutional convention requires.

==Debates in 2003 before 18 March==
The deployments of UK forces to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, along with forces of the United States, were a clear precursor to military action. Several debates were held on Britain's Iraq policy. Finally, on 17 March 2003, US [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] gave an ultimatum to [[Saddam Hussein]] to leave power within 48 hours or face military action. Previous votes had endorsed government policy of confronting Iraq through the UN.

==Debate of 18 March==
The Prime Minister has the power to declare war, as an exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative]], without the approval of Parliament. Before or after the start of previous wars, there had normally been debate in Parliament; however for the first time a vote was held, apparently allowing Parliament to block the declaration of war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/19/iraq.houseofcommons |title=History's verdict |work=The Guardian  |date=19 March 2003 |accessdate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm72/7239/7239.pdf |title=The Governance of Britain – War powers and treaties: Limiting Executive powers |publisher=The Stationery Office |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was, "purely symbolic" and "not binding on the government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/11/houseofcommons.uk |title=Inquiry to look at MPs' role in declaring war |work=The Guardian  |date=11 August 2005 |accessdate=11 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate was held on 18 March 2003, and lasted from midday to 10&amp;nbsp;pm, at which time the two Parliamentary votes were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?d=2003-03-18 |title=Debates on 18 March 2003 |accessdate=27 May 2010 |publisher=TheyWorkForYou |work=[[Hansard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour and Conservative parties, the two largest parties, were both committed to approving the invasion, but a quarter&lt;ref name="pw118"/&gt; of Labour Party MPs rebelled and voted against the invasion. The Liberal Democrats, who had one in twelve of the MPs in parliament, also opposed the invasion.

If the vote had been lost, many Labour ministers would have resigned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/apr/26/uk.iraq |title=When Blair stood on the brink |first=Patrick |last=Wintour |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 April 2003 |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], who suggested in his speech that he would resign if the vote was not passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1121239.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |work=The Times  |location=London |date=19 March 2003 |title=Blair plays not to the gallery but to the heart |first=Ben |last=Macintyre |quote=Blair explicitly nailed his political fate to personal principle. If the House voted to withdraw troops from the coming conflict, he said, they would also remove him. |accessdate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frontbench members of a party by tradition must resign from that position before they can vote against their party. The expected{{Who|date=May 2010}} mass of resignations from among some of the ranks of these parties did not materialise beyond the resignation of [[Robin Cook]].

The government proposed a motion in Parliament, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This House notes its decisions of  25 November 2002 and  26 February 2003 to endorse  UN Security Council Resolution 1441; recognises that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles, and its continuing non-compliance with Security Council Resolutions, pose a threat to international peace and security; notes that in the 130 days since Resolution 1441 was adopted Iraq has not co-operated actively, unconditionally and immediately with the weapons inspectors, and has rejected the final opportunity to comply and is in further material breach of its obligations under successive mandatory UN Security Council Resolutions; regrets that despite sustained diplomatic effort by Her Majesty's Government it has not proved possible to secure a second Resolution in the UN because one Permanent Member of the Security Council made plain in public its intention to use its veto whatever the circumstances; notes the opinion of the Attorney General that, Iraq having failed to comply and Iraq being at the time of Resolution 1441 and continuing to be in material breach, the authority to use force under Resolution 678 has revived and so continues today; believes that the United Kingdom must uphold the authority of the United Nations as set out in Resolution 1441 and many Resolutions preceding it, and therefore supports the decision of Her Majesty's Government that the United Kingdom should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction; offers wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty's Armed Forces now on duty in the Middle East; in the event of military operations requires that, on an urgent basis, the United Kingdom should seek a new Security Council Resolution that would affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief, allow for the earliest possible lifting of UN sanctions, an international reconstruction programme, and the use of all oil revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq, leading to a representative government which upholds human rights and the rule of law for all Iraqis; and also welcomes the imminent publication of the Quartet's roadmap as a significant step to bringing a just and lasting peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians and for the wider Middle East region, and endorses the role of Her Majesty's Government in actively working for peace between Israel and Palestine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An amendment was proposed urging the government to wait for further UN approval. It removed the text "recognises that Iraq's weapons&amp;nbsp;... in the Middle East" and replaced it with:

This House... believes that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established, especially given the absence of specific United Nations authorisation; but, in the event that hostilities do commence, pledges its total support for the British forces engaged in the Middle East, expresses its admiration for their courage, skill and devotion to duty, and hopes that their tasks will be swiftly concluded with minimal casualties on all sides...

'''Ceresco,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|1572338|Ripon, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Wisconsin Phalanx''', was a [[commune]] founded in [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac County]], [[Wisconsin]] in 1844 by followers of the [[communitarianism|communitarian]] socialist ideas of [[Charles Fourier]]. About 180 people lived in the Association at its peak, farming nearly 2,000 acres. It was one of the three longest-lived [[List of Fourierist Associations in the United States|Fourierist Associations in the United States]], dissolving in 1850, and was unique for having assets which exceeded liabilities at the time of its termination.

Since the Fourierist Association had registered their community under state law, the village of '''Ceresco, Wisconsin''' survived the collapse of the [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] experiment of the 1840s. Remaining members of the Wisconsin Phalanx later formed a living cooperative and study group called the [[Ceresco Union]] in 1855, espousing the doctrines of religious [[freethought]] and interpersonal [[free love]] until disbursed by a mob of outraged citizens.

In 1858 the remaining inhabitants of Ceresco were annexed by the nearby town of [[Ripon, Wisconsin]].

==History==

===Background===
[[File:AlbertBrisbane.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Albert Brisbane (1809-1890), regarded as the intellectual founder of the American Fourierist movement of the 1840s.]]

In 1832 the son of a wealthy New York landowner, [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890), a student of philosophy in search of ideas for the betterment of humanity, was introduced to a newly published short work by philosopher [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) entitled ''Treatise on Domestic and Agricultural Association.''&lt;ref name=Hoagland496&gt;Henry E. Hoagland, "Humanitarianism (1840-1860)" in John R. Commons, et al., ''History of Labour in the United States: Volume 1.'' New York: Macmillan, 1918; pp. 496-497.&lt;/ref&gt; Brisbane was an immediate convert to the French thinker's ideas, which Fourier somewhat grandiosely ascribed to universal laws governing the development of society, the understanding of which allowed productive enterprise to be reorganized on a rational basis, production expanded, and human needs more readily fulfilled.&lt;ref name=Hoagland496 /&gt;

In 1832 Brisbane left for Paris to spend two years studying Fourier's system, taking personal tutelage from the 60-year-old theorist himself.&lt;ref name=Hillquit80&gt;Morris Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States.'' [1903] Revised 5th Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1910; pg. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Brisbane would make the acquaintance of other devotees of Fourier's ideas during this initial phase of the Fourierist movement, returning to the United States a committed believer and proselytizer of the Fourier's idea of "Association."&lt;ref name=Hillquit80 /&gt; Brisbane would soon begin work translating and expounding upon the ideas of Fourier for an American audience, with his first and most famous book, ''Social Destiny of Man,'' seeing print in 1840.&lt;ref name=Hillquit80 /&gt;

Brisbane's book was well-received and it enjoyed immediate success, gaining a broad readership among those concerned with the problems of society and helping to launch the Fourierist movement in the United States.&lt;ref name=Hillquit81&gt;Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who read Brisbane's book and was thereby converted to the ideas of socialism was a young New York newspaper publisher, [[Horace Greeley]], later elected to the [[US House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=Hillquit81 /&gt; Greeley would provide valuable service to the Fourierist movement by advancing its ideas in the pages of his newspaper of that day, ''The New Yorker,'' throughout 1840 and 1841, and offering Brisbane a column in his successor publication, the ''[[New York Tribune]],'' from the time of its establishment in March 1842.&lt;ref name=Hoagland501&gt;Hoagland, "Humanitarianism," pg. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further book by Brisbane adapting Fourier's ideas to American conditions, entitled ''Association: Or, A Concise Exposition of the Practical Part of Fourier's Social Science,'' would be published in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Hoagland, "Humanitarianism," pg. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; A faddish [[boom and bust|boom]] seeking to test Fourier's ideas on "Association" in practice soon followed, and from 1843 to 1845 more than 30 Fourierian "phalanxes" were established in a number of northern and midwestern states.&lt;ref&gt;The word "phalanx" (plural: phalanstries) was Fourierist jargon for an organized and structured community, also known as an "association."&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Wisconsin Phalanx, known to its participants as Ceresco, was one of these practical experiments which attempted to put into practice the Fourierian ideas.

=== Establishment ===
[[File:Studio portrait of Warren Chase.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Warren Chase (1813-1891), a founder of Ceresco, later a State Senator and [[Free Soil Party]] gubernatorial candidate.]]

The Upper Midwest was not immune to the Fourierist hubbub that had begun to percolate in the United States in 1843. In the fall of that year the Franklin [[lyceum movement|Lyceum]] of [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Southport]] (today known as Kenosha) began taking up discussion of Fourier's ideas in a series of public discussions.&lt;ref&gt;* Samuel M. Pedrick, [https://archive.org/details/SketchOfTheWisconsinPhalanx "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx,"] ''Proceedings of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin at its 50th Annual Meeting held Dec. 11, 1902.'' Madison, WI: Wisconsin Historical Society, 1903; pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21 the society debated the proposition "Does the system of Fourier present a practicable plan for such a reorganization of society as will guard against our present social ills?"&lt;ref name=Pedrick192&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; After a week's pause, two more successive weekly meetings of the lyceum were dedicated to the Fourier program.&lt;ref name=Pedrick192 /&gt;

One of those Southport residents most interested in the Fourier system was a 30-year-old named [[Warren Chase]], a future  Wisconsin and California [[State senate|State Senator]].&lt;ref name=Pedrick192 /&gt; Convinced of the applicability of Fourier's "Associationist" prescription, Chase committed himself to the emerging movement without reservation, organizing a series of preliminary meetings to draft a constitution for a local "phalanx."&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pp. 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 1844, a formal meeting of phalanx supporters was held at the Southport village schoolhouse and officers were elected in accordance with the constitution previously drafted.&lt;ref name=Pedrick193&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Five hundred copies of the group's constitution and bylaws were printed for public distribution and a group of three, including Warren Chase, were tapped as trustees of the phalanx, to serve as legal title-holders to all the property of the nascent community.&lt;ref name=Pedrick193 /&gt; A bond sale of $10,000 was approved and stock in the new enterprise began to be sold.&lt;ref name=Pedrick193 /&gt; Shares of stock were sold for $25 each, payable in cash or property.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of May 1844, membership in the forthcoming phalanx stood at 71.&lt;ref name=Pedrick193 /&gt;

A domain for the phalanx had been located in the spring, and on May 8, 1844, the decision made to purchase 1.25 [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]] (800 acres) of attractive government land,&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pp. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; located in a valley between two gentle hills. By that fall a total of 1.5 sections (960 acres) were purchased.&lt;ref name=Pedrick194&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructions were issued to participants to obtain a tent to provide temporary shelter until permanent housing could be constructed, and details for provisioning the settling party arranged.&lt;ref name=Pedrick194 /&gt;

The group arrived on the site on Saturday May 25, 1844 at 5 pm,&lt;ref name=Stebbins&gt;Letter of George Stebbins to the''Southport Telegraph,'' May 27, 1844. Published in John Humphrey Noyes, [https://archive.org/details/historyofamerica00innoye ''History of American Socialisms.''] Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co., 1880; pp. 412-414.&lt;/ref&gt; naming their community "Ceresco" after [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], Roman goddess of the harvest. A total of 19 men and a 7-year-old boy were on hand for the launch,&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; immediately dividing themselves into agricultural and mechanical series, with the former assigned the immediate task of beginning plowing while the latter began digging a cellar for the group's first frame building, intended as the central wing of a structure planned to be extended to 120 feet in length.&lt;ref name=Stebbins /&gt; Upon completion in 1845, the finished "long building" for collective housing would measure 208 feet long by 32 feet wide.&lt;ref name=Chase451201&gt;Warren Chase, "Annual Statement on the Condition and progress of the Wisconsin Phalanx, for the Fiscal Year Ending December 1, 1845." Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 418-421.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===
[[File:Ground plan of the edifice of an association.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Brisbane's 1843 rendition of Fourier's grandiose ''Phalanstère.'' &lt;br /&gt;Members of each Association were to live collectively in a gargantuan "edifice" of a distinctive shape. This vast, slender building was to itself constitute "walls" of a large common area. A church (C), meeting hall (H), and storehouses and other buildings (B, C, D, F) were to be constructed beyond the edifice's wallls.]]
According to the constitution of the Association, decisions were to be made by an elected group including four executive officers — a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer — as well as a nine-person board of managers.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt;  It was specified that these officers could be removed from their positions for neglect of duty, absence, or incompetence.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt; Three trustees were to hold title to the organization's property.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt; The board of managers and officers were prohibited from entering into any contract without the unanimous approval of the community's stockholders.&lt;ref name=Pedrick196&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Fourierist [[joint-stock]] system, individuals could participate either as stockholders or as members or as both.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt; No person could be admitted to membership without approval of the board of managers, however, with the board given latitude to set conditions of membership.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt; Membership could be terminated upon two weeks' notice, with those withdrawing from the Association to receive their pro rated share of profits of the enterprise up to that date.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt;

Stockholders were to meet twice yearly.&lt;ref name=Pedrick195 /&gt; Stockholders received one vote for their first share and an additional vote for each five shares thereafter, the total of votes per individual not to exceed ten.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pp. 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women were allowed to hold stock and granted the voting rights associated with stock ownership.&lt;ref name=Pedrick196 /&gt;

Every December the cash value of the phalanx's real estate was to be estimated and any increase declared as payments for labor, divided according to hours worked, or shareholder profits, divided according to the number of shares held.&lt;ref name=Pedrick196 /&gt; Necessary products and board were to be furnished to the phalanx's members at cost and rent collected for living in the group's collective housing.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were permitted to keep their own horse and carriage on the association's land, with payment to be made to cover the actual cost of animal maintenance.&lt;ref name=Pedrick197&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elected board of managers was to make the business decisions of the phalanx and to differentiate and assess the various types of work.&lt;ref name=Pedrick197 /&gt; Whenever five or more individuals engaged in a similar branch of industry, these were to organize as a "group" and to elect a foreman, who would be charged with keeping an account of the work performed by each member of that unit.&lt;ref name=Pedrick197 /&gt;

Multiple groups in similar pursuits were to in turn organize themselves as a "series" and to elect a "superintendent," who would assess the productiveness of each group in the series.&lt;ref name=Pedrick197 /&gt; Under the theoretical Fourierist scheme once a community grew to sufficient scale, these superintendents were to constitute themselves as a "council of industry."&lt;ref name=Pedrick197 /&gt; This elaborate bureaucratic apparatus above the level of groups and foremen remained in the distant mists of Fourierian fantasy due to the small scale of the Wisconsin experiment, it should be noted.

Disagreements were to be settled by arbitration, in which each involved party was to select an arbitrator, with the two arbitrators selecting a third.&lt;ref name=Pedrick198&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions of the arbitrators could be appealed to the board, whose decision would be final.&lt;ref name=Pedrick198 /&gt; This system seems to have been effective, as no lawsuits ever took place between members of the phalanx, or between departing parties and the organized association, for the entire time of Ceresco's existence.

===Daily life===
[[File:Ceresco-LongHouse-1840s.jpg|thumb|right|420px|The "edifice" of the Wisconsin Phalanx for collective dwelling was this "long house" more than 200 feet in length. As of 2014 the building was still in existence in its original location, used as an apartment building.]]

The "domain" of the Wisconsin Phalanx was obtained without the incurrence of mortgage debt.&lt;ref name=Stebbins /&gt; A stream called Crystal Creek ran through the property, with sufficient elevation to allow for installment of a water-driven mill.&lt;ref name=Stebbins /&gt; Quantities of [[limestone]] were on hand for the needs of construction and the land selected included a suitable mix of tillable prairie and timbler.&lt;ref name=Stebbins /&gt;

Upon arrival late in the spring of 1844 the Ceresco colonists immediately planted 20 acres to spring crops, including potatoes, [[buckwheat]], and [[turnip]]s before turning to sowing 100 acres [[winter wheat]].&lt;ref name=Chase440912&gt;Warren Chase, letter to the ''Southport Telegram'' of Sept. 12, 1844. Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 414-415.&lt;/ref&gt; Three buildings were constructed by fall, enough to house about 80 men, women, and children.&lt;ref name=Chase440912 /&gt; In accord with the Fourierist scheme, which placed emphasis on collective living, cooking was done in a single kitchen and meals served on a single table.&lt;ref name=Chase440912 /&gt;

Tents remained in use for much of the first year, with sufficient accommodations finally constructed by the middle of September 1844 to allow their return to Southport.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family unit was retained, with division expressing itself among the members of the Association over the system of collective living and eating.&lt;ref name=Chase451201 /&gt; Permission was eventually given for individual families to be provided with foodstuffs for their own preparation, although the great majority of participants remained committed to Fourier's collectivist model through 1845.&lt;ref name=Chase451201 /&gt;

Regular meetings were held for the discussion of business, and social gatherings were frequent.&lt;ref name=Chase440912 /&gt;

Liquor was banished from the premises and Chase noting in his December 1845 annual report that "the four great evils with which the world is afflicted — intoxication, lawsuits, quarreling, and profane swearing — never have, and with the present character and prevailing habits of our members, never can, find admittance into our society."&lt;ref name=Chase451201 /&gt;

This moral code was enforced by the threat of expulsion, which could be enacted by a simple majority vote of residents.&lt;ref name=Pedrick197198&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; The list of specified offenses for which expulsion could result was extensive, including "rude and indecent behavior, drunkenness, trafficking in intoxicating drinks, profane swearing, lying, stealing or defrauding another, protracted idleness, willfully injuring the property of the association, knowingly consenting to the injury of the association or any individual member thereof, gambling, [or] habitually engaging in censoriousness and faultfinding..."&lt;ref name=Pedrick197198 /&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Phalanstère.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Elevated view of Fourier's concept of the edifice of a phalanstry, illuminating his architectural utopianism. Fourier sought construction of a massive longhouse connecting 1800 residents in a single dwelling, which enclosed common area.]]

The Wisconsin Phalanx's deep concern with profanity, honesty, and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] was not accidental. Although nominally secular, American Fourierism was marked with strong religious overtones. American popularizer Albert Brisbane was emphatic in this regard, quoting Fourier's assertion that "The Love of God will become in this new Order the most ardent Love among Men."&lt;ref&gt;Brisbane, ''A Concise Exposition of the Doctrine of Association,'' pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only would the fidelity of marital union be preserved, Brisbane promised, but Association would "respect sacredly the Religious Sentiment, and preserve religious Worship, which is the external manifestation of that Sentiment in the human soul."&lt;ref name=Concise10&gt;Brisbane, ''A Concise Exposition of the Doctrine of Association,'' pg. 10. Italics removed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brisbane expanded this perspective at some length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The horrors perpetrated in religious wars and persecutions, the atrocities of the [[Inquisition]] and other outrages committed in the name of Religion are certainly appalling to contemplate. Struck with these abuses and believing them inherent in Religion, some reformers have wished to abolish it; they have not had the perspicuity to separate the abuses of Religion from Religion itself — to separate the effect of sectarian Fanaticism, acting upon ignorant and deluded minds, from true Religion and the high and exalted sentiments connected with it..."&lt;ref name=Concise10 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unsurprisingly, Brisbane's Christian reformationism found sympathetic ears among Wisconsin's Fourier enthusiasts living at Ceresco, who "were rather religious rather than irreligious," the ranks of which included Methodist preacher Uriel Farmin and Baptist minister George H. Stebbins.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Mapes, ''History of the city of Ripon, and of its founder, David P. Mapes with his opinion of men and manners of the day.'' Milwaukee: Cramer, Aikens &amp; Cramer, 1873; pg. 83 ff. Cited in Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 199, from whom the quotation is taken.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunday school]] and Bible study classes were conducted, with various religious denominations making use of the main hall for their services in sequence.&lt;ref name=Chase440912 /&gt; De facto leader of the community Warren Chase emphasized the religious harmony of members of the phalanx, noting in a letter that "although we have many members of different religious societies, they all seem determined to lay aside [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] differences, and make a united social effort, founded on the fundamental principles of religion."&lt;ref name=Chase440912 /&gt;

Outside suspicions that the Wisconsin Phalanx was irreligious were hotly denied. In June 1848 one member replied to such a charge with a published letter in ''The Investigator,'' which declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Some of us are and have been Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, etc. Others have never been members of any church, but with very few exceptions very readily admit the authenticity and moral value of the Scriptures. The [[ten commandments]] are the sum, substance, and foundation of all true law. Add to this the gospel of love, and you have a code of laws worthy of adoption and practice by any set of men, and upon which associationists must base themselves, or they never can succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pedrick, ''Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx,'' pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This assessment was confirmed by a Methodist circuit rider who visited the community, who noted that "though a few of the men were professed infidels, they always received ministers gladly and treated them with consideration."&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Miller, ''Thirty years in the Itineracy.'' Milwaukee: 1875; pg. 146. Quoted in Pedrick, ''Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx,'' pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers contended that religious observation declined in the enterprise's final years.&lt;ref&gt;Cutting Marsh, ''Milwaukee Journal,'' May 23-June 17, 1850. Quoted in Quoted in Pedrick, ''Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx,'' pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
[[File:08-Fourierites-postcard.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Colorized postcard showing the residential edifice of the Wisconsin Phalanx.]]

Ceresco continued to grow through 1846, boosting its debt-free acreage to 1,633 — of which about 800 acres were to be committed to crops.&lt;ref name=Chase460303&gt;Warren Chase, letter of March 3, 1846. Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 421-422.&lt;/ref&gt; The board was extremely selective with the admission of new members, accepting only one new family between December 1845 and March 1846, despite a plethora of applications.&lt;ref name=Chase460303 /&gt;

Warren Chase was ebullient about the phalanx's prospects and spoke of the Fourier system in almost mystical terms, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Success with us is no longer a matter of doubt.... We feel and known that our condition and prospects are truly cheering, and to the friends of the cause we can say, Come on, not to join us, but to form other Associations; for we can not receive one-tenth of those who apply for admission. Nothing but the general principles of Association are lawful tender with us. Money will not buy admission for those who have no faith in the principles, but who merely believe, as most of our neighbors do, that we shall get rich... With our material, our means, and the principles of eternal truth on our side, success is neither doubtful nor surprising."&lt;ref name=Chase460303 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unsurprisingly, educational and cultural projects proceeded at a slower pace than basic construction and agriculture, with a stone schoolhouse eventually constructed in 1845 and a reading room for adult members unveiled towards the start of 1846.&lt;ref name=Chase451201 /&gt; A 60-foot long washhouse, a henhouse, and a sawmill during the commune's first 18 months, and a [[blacksmith]] and a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] practiced their respective crafts.&lt;ref name=Chase451201 /&gt; Agriculture remained the chief preoccupation of most members of the phalanx, with a total of 1,553 acres obtained for Ceresco through 1845.&lt;ref name=Chase451201 /&gt;

By the end of 1846 the settlement had grown to 180 residents — 56 men, 37 women, and 87 children and youth under age 21.&lt;ref name=Chase461207&gt;Warren Chase, "Annual Statement of the Condition and Progress of the Wisconsin Phalanx, for the Fiscal Year Ending December 7, 1846.'' Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 422-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, there were 36 families and 30 single adults.&lt;ref name=Chase461207 /&gt; This would mark the peak membership for the Ceresco association. Ominously for the fate of the collective enterprise, only a minority of Ceresco associationists were eating together at the general table by this date, with 100 people part of the 21 families which prepared their meals and ate as traditional nuclear units.&lt;ref name=Chase461207 /&gt;

Despite the loss of four families over 1846, applicants still far surpassed the available space, with fewer than one-quarter of prospective associationists admitted to membership in the phalanx.&lt;ref name=Chase461207 /&gt;

===Decline===

With the Fourierist movement in rapid decline on a national basis in 1846 and 1847, the Wisconsin Phalanx's place became even more prominent in the pages of ''The Harbinger,'' the national organ of the Associationists. Ceresco was not immune to the general malaise, however, and its own membership began to slowly decline. Moreover, even the ever-optimistic Warren Chase was forced to admit that "three or four" of the remaining families were "restless, discontented spirits" who were not "contented and happy."&lt;ref name=Chase470628&gt;Warren Chase, Letter of June 28, 1847. Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 425-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality of collective living was a disrupting influence. The merging of family units into one great household and the consequent formation of humanitarian bonds was a fundamental tenet of Fourierism, with Albert Brisbane describing the shattering of familial isolation in enthusiastic terms in his short 1843 book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...[A]s man is by nature a social being, he requires, and should form, the largest social unions possible, and numerous and various social ties with his fellow-men. The present system of society is based upon the smallest possible social union — that of a single family in a separate house by themselves. A true Social Order should be based upon large Associations of about eighteen hundred persons or three hundred families, and not upon small Associations of six or eight individuals, or single families."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Brisbane, [https://archive.org/details/conciseexpositio00brisrich ''A Concise Exposition of the Doctrine of Association.''] New York: J.S. Redfield, 1843; pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reality of tightly shared accommodations, with numerous families occupying rooms in a single crowded "long house," proved less than compelling for many members of the phalanx's resident community. The community was sharply divided over the matter of the construction of new collective living quarters as opposed to comfortable accommodation for individual families, while an increasing number of committed [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] made common dining increasingly impractical.&lt;ref name=Cooke&gt;Joseph J. Cooke, Letter to the ''New York Tribune,'' Aug. 28, 1847. Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 428-429. See also: Warren Chase, ''The Harbinger,'' Jan. 8, 1848. Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 430-431.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the lack of a proper reading room galled many of the intellectual members of the group.&lt;ref name=Cooke /&gt;

As land values escalated and the phalanx's financial status seemed more secure, the board began requiring larger and larger cash investments for admission to membership.&lt;ref name=Chase470628 /&gt; Consequently, few new members were gained; energetic workers committed to the associationist ideal without sufficient financial means were turned away.&lt;ref name=Chase470628 /&gt; Stagnation was the result.

By the end of 1847 resident membership at Ceresco had fallen to 157 people — 52 men and 34 women and 71 children and youths under age 21.&lt;ref name=Wright471206&gt;Benjamin Wright, "Annual Statement of the Condition and Progress of the Wisconsin Phalanx, for the Fiscal Year Ending December 6, 1847." Published in Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pp. 434-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-two families were in residence, with four families bought out of their investment by the community during the course of the year.&lt;ref name=Wright471206 /&gt; The community's flour mill had finally begun operation in June and increased property values helped to keep the Association solvent and a total of 1,713 acres were owned by the Phalanx.&lt;ref name=Wright471206 /&gt; Nevertheless, indications of stagnation and decline had begun to make themselves evident.

Those departing were bought out of their original investments by the Wisconsin Phalanx corporation. As the phalanx was heavily invested in land and infrastructure and available cash was in short supply, these payments generally took the form of orders on the treasury payable at some future date, usually bearing 10 or 12 percent interest.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership continued to slide in 1848, with only 29 families with 120 people remaining to be counted in the annual report prepared each December.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Six families had left during the year and only three had been gained; in addition there had been seven deaths, mostly of young children.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt;

===Dissolution===

By the summer of 1849 it had become clear that dissolution of the Wisconsin Phalanx was imminent.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt; Many of those who had not departed Ceresco were interested in obtaining pieces of the communal lands and forming a traditional village on the site.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt;  At the association's request, the [[Marquette County, Wisconsin|Marquette County]] surveyor was employed to survey communal lands into discrete parcels.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt;

Determined to avoid legal action, the community began to liquidate its movable assets to cover the redemption of stock held by departing members.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt; From a high point of $33,000 in stock, by the first of 1850 the total had been whittled down to $23,000 outstanding.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt; The sale of land was blocked by the Wisconsin Phalanx's legal charter, however, which required unanimous consent of stockholders or a legislative act to allow land sale.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt; The latter course of action was followed and on January 29, 1850, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] passed a bill allowing the association's 9-member council "to sell and convey real estate by their official act; also to lay out and have recorded a village plat with streets and squares and public lots."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public sale of the phalanx's lands began in April 1850.&lt;ref name=Pedrick216 /&gt; By the end of the summer most of the land had been sold, with the money received used to buy back outstanding shares of stock, with the formal understanding that any surplus generated over [[par value]] would be split by the corporation's former stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pp. 216-217.&lt;/ref&gt; A surplus of approximately 8 percent over par was accumulated during the sell-off and distributed to former members according to this formula.&lt;ref name=Pedrick217&gt;Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ledger books were finally closed on the community in 1852, with all assets sold and the proceeds distributed.&lt;ref name=Pedrick217 /&gt;

The actual cause of the dissolution remained a matter of some mystery among contemporary observers, with Everett Chamberlain declaring that ''"Human nature'' was the rock on which this fine ship split, as did all other argosies bearing the banner of [[Robert Owen|Owen]] or Fourier."&lt;ref&gt;Mapes, ''History of Ripon,'' pg. 89. Quoted in Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have shared the view that it was the escalation of property value and a desire to "cash out" profitably which made liquidation of the Wisconsin Phalanx inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first attributed to a certain Mr. Daniels, quoted in an 1880 book by [[John Humphrey Noyes]]. S.M. Pedrick, the best historian of Ceresco, shares this opinion. See Pedrick, "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx," pg. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

On April 2, 1853, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] passed a statute merging the [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Village|villages]] of Ceresco and Ripon and naming the resultant village "Morena." The remaining inhabitants ignored the new name, incorporating as the [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] of Ripon in 1858.

A new radical living cooperative and study group called the [[Ceresco Union]] was established in Ceresco, Wisconsin in 1855.&lt;ref name=Guarneri363&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; This group promoted the controversial doctrines of religious [[free thinking]] and interpersonal [[free love]], offending the conservative moral values of others in the area.&lt;ref name=Guarneri363 /&gt; This last experimental communal enclave was disbursed by an angry mob one night, which broke windows and doors and caused those being attacked to flee the area.&lt;ref name=Guarneri363 /&gt;

The papers of the Wisconsin Phalanx were donated to the [[Ripon Historical Society]] by Robert D. Mason, the last president of the group, shortly before his death in 1901.&lt;ref name=Pedrick190&gt;Samuel M. Pedrick, [https://archive.org/details/SketchOfTheWisconsinPhalanx "Sketch of the Wisconsin Phalanx,"] ''Proceedings of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin at its 50th Annual Meeting held Dec. 11, 1902.'' Madison, WI: Wisconsin Historical Society, 1903; pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Included were membership records, financial records, correspondence, and legal documents such as deeds and mortgages.&lt;ref name=Pedrick190 /&gt;

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''collective intentionality''' characterizes the [[intentionality]] that occurs when two or more individuals undertake a task together. Examples include two individuals carrying a heavy table up a flight of stairs or dancing a tango.

This phenomenon is approached from [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[normative]] perspectives, among others. Prominent philosophers working in the psychological manner are [[Raimo Tuomela]], Kaarlo Miller, [[John Searle|John R. Searle]], and [[Michael Bratman|Michael E. Bratman]]. [[Margaret Gilbert]] takes a normative approach dealing specifically with group formation. [[J. David Velleman|David Velleman]] is also concerned with how groups are formed, but his account lacks the normative element present in Gilbert.

The notion that collectives are capable of forming [[intention]]s can be found, whether implicitly or explicitly, in literature going back thousands of years. For example, ancient texts such as [[Plato]]'s [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]&lt;ref name="The Republic"&gt;Allen, R.E. 2006. Plato, ''The Republic''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the cooperative determination of laws and social order by the group composed of society as a whole. This theme was later expanded into [[social contract]] theory by Enlightenment-era philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]]&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;Shapiro, Ian. 2010. ''Leviathan: Or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref name= "Two Treatises of Government"&gt;Laslett, Peter. 1988. ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the likes of [[Wilfrid Sellars]]&lt;ref name="Ought"&gt;Sellars, Wilfrid. 1963. "Imperatives, Intentions, and the Logic of 'Ought," ''Morality and the Language of Conduct.'' Detroit: Wayne State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anthony Quinton]]&lt;ref name="Social Objects"&gt;Quinton, Anthony. 1975. "Social Objects." ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', Vol. 75, 67–87.&lt;/ref&gt; noted the existence of "We-Intentions" amid broader discussion of the concept of [[intentionality]], and thus laid the groundwork for the focused philosophical analysis of collective intentionality that began in the late 1980s.

==Raimo Tuomela and Kaarlo Miller==

Contemporary philosophical discussion of collective intentionality was initiated by [[Raimo Tuomela]] and Kaarlo Miller's "We-Intentions".&lt;ref name="Tuomela"&gt;Tuomela, Raimo and K. Miller. 1988. "We-Intentions," ''Philosophical Studies,'' Vol. 53, 367-389.&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Tuomela and Miller assert three conditions necessary for a collective [[intention]], highlighting the importance of beliefs among the agents of the group. After citing examples that are commonly accepted as requiring more than one member to participate (carrying a table upstairs, playing tennis, toasting to a friend, conversing, etc.), they state their criteria:

:A member (A) of a [[collective]] (G) we-intends to do a group action (X) if and only if:

::1) (A) intends to do his or her part of X
::2) (A) believes that accomplishing X is possible, and that all members of G intend to do their part towards accomplishing X
::3) (A) believes that all the members of G also believe that accomplishing X is possible.&lt;ref name="Tuomela" /&gt;

To illustrate this idea, imagine Anne and Bob intend to carry a table (that is far too heavy for one person to carry) upstairs. In order for this action to qualify as a we-intention, Anne first needs to intend to do her part in carrying the table. Next, Anne needs to believe that carrying the table upstairs is possible, and that Bob intends to do his part in carrying. Finally, Anne needs to believe that Bob also believes that carrying the table upstairs is possible. If all of these conditions are met, then Anne and Bob have collective intentions under Tuomela and Miller's criteria.

==John Searle==
[[John Searle|John Searle's]] 1990 paper, "Collective Intentions and Actions" offers another interpretation of collective action. In contrast to Tuomela and Miller, Searle claims that collective intentionality is a "primitive phenomenon, which cannot be analyzed as the summation of individual intentional behavior".&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. 1990. "Collective Intentions and Actions," ''Intentions in Communication.'' Cambridge: MIT Press, 401-415.&lt;/ref&gt; He exemplifies the fundamental distinction between "I-intentions" and "We-intentions" by comparing the hypothetical case of a set of picnickers and a dance troupe. During a rainstorm, each picnicker ''spontaneously'' runs for cover. On the other hand, the members of the dance troupe run for cover ''as part of a preconceived routine''. Searle claims that the picnickers, whose intentions are individually oriented and simply happen to coincide, do not display collective intentionality, while members of the dance troupe do, because they deliberately cooperate with one another.

Searle's rebuttal to Tuomela and Miller's account begins with a counterexample involving a group of business school graduates who intend to pursue their own selfish interests, but believe that by doing so, they will indirectly serve humanity. These young businessmen believe that their fellow graduates will do likewise, but do not actively ''cooperate'' with one another in pursuing their goals. Searle holds that this example fulfills all of Tuomela and Miller's criteria for collective intentionality. However, he claims that collective intentionality does not actually exist in such a situation unless the graduates have organized and formed an explicit ''pact'' with one another to serve humanity through self-interested action.

:He proceeds to specify two criteria that must be satisfied by any proper account of collective intentionality:

::(1) It "must be consistent with the fact that society consists of nothing but individuals."
::(2) It must take into account that any individual's intentions are independent of "the fact of whether or not he is getting things right."&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

Although a "we-intention" is always held by an individual, it must make fundamental reference to a collective formed in conjunction with the other individual(s). For instance, two individuals who, while sharing the labor of hollandaise-sauce production, each believe the proposition "''We'' are making hollandaise sauce", have formed a collective intention. This would not exist if they only held beliefs to the effect of "''I'' am stirring", or "''I'' am pouring". It is thus, Searle claims, that collective intentionality is not reducible to individual intentionality.

==Michael Bratman==

[[Michael Bratman|Michael Bratman's]] 1992 paper "Shared Cooperative Activity",&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, Michael. 1992. "Shared Cooperative Activity," ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 101, No. 2, 327-341.&lt;/ref&gt; contends that shared cooperative activity (SCA) can be reduced to "I-intentions". In other words, just as an individual can plan to act by him or herself, that same individual can also plan for a group to act. With this in mind, he presents three characteristics of shared cooperative activity:

::(1) Each participant must be mutually responsive to the intentions and actions of the others,
::(2) The participants must each be committed to the joint activity,
::(3) The participants must each be committed to supporting the efforts of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of Bratman's argument that supports these criteria is the idea of meshing subplans. Bratman claims that in a shared cooperative activity, individuals' secondary plans do not need to be the same, but they cannot conflict. For example, consider his example of two people who intend to paint a house together.&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, 330&lt;/ref&gt; Let us call these two people Alice and Bill. Suppose Alice wants to paint the house red and Bill wants to paint the house blue. Both are aware that their subplans conflict, and that the other is aware of it as well. Bratman argues that even if Alice and Bill do end up painting the house together, they do not have a shared cooperative activity, because their subplans are in conflict. Furthermore, each participant must also be committed to having subplans that mesh. Without this commitment, participants might disregard others' subplans, leading to a lack of cooperation. However, he additionally claims that their subplans need not be identical. For instance, suppose Alice wants to use an inexpensive paint and Bill wants paint from a specific hardware store. In this case, there is a way that both subplans can achieved: they could buy an inexpensive paint from Bill's store of choice. The details of Bratman's view are as follows:

:For a cooperatively neutral action, our doing an action J is an SCA if and only if:

::1) We do J (in a way that could involve cooperation, but does not have to)
::2) It is common knowledge between us that we are both committed to meshing subplans and
::3) (B) leads to (A) by way of mutual responsiveness (in the pursuit of completing our action) of intention and in action.&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, 334-339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to Bratman===

One work associated with Bratman is Facundo Alonso's "Shared Intention, Reliance, and Interpersonal Obligations".&lt;ref name="AlonsoShared"&gt;Alonso, Facundo M. 2009. "Shared Intention, Reliance, and Interpersonal Obligation," ''Ethics'', Vol. 119, No. 3, 444-475.&lt;/ref&gt; Alonso contends that shared intention is a basis for interpersonal obligation. He begins the paper by asserting characteristics of joint action, which do not include multiple agents acting individually or factors of body movements, but instead are shared or collective intentions to act. Alonso distinguishes the normative theory supplied by Gilbert and the descriptive theory supplied by Bratman. Whereas Bratman focuses on intents, Alonso is also careful to point out Tuomela and Miller's focus on action to describe the roots of joint action. Alonso attempts to compromise both views by taking a path where joint action is not necessarily a normative or descriptive case. He argues for a system built off Bratman's that can take place in a descriptive nature addressed by Margaret Gilbert.

Stephen Butterfill offers another response to Bratman's view. He argues that Bratman's account is unable to explain simple interactions between agents.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfill, Stephen. 2012. "Joint Action and Development," ''The Philosophical Quarterly,'' Vol. 62, No. 246, 23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Butterfill states that Bratman cannot explain cooperative actions between very young children, who do not yet have an understanding of other minds.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfill, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Margaret Gilbert==

Whereas Bratman argues for a descriptive account of collective intentionality, other authors have taken a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] approach. [[Margaret Gilbert]] in "Walking Together: A Paradigmatic Social Phenomena",&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Margaret. 1990. "Walking Together: A Paradigmatic Social Phenomena," ''Midwest Studies in Philosophy'', Vol. 15, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; sets the conditions for people entering, enduring, and exiting acts of collective intentionality. Gilbert asserts that social groups in general can be defined by something as simple as two people walking together. In her analysis the basic conditions for collective intentions that must be satisfied are as follows:

::(1) People must know they are entering into an agreement by communicating it clearly (even if they are coerced). Gilbert states that this act of agreement is sufficient to set a goal for a group. Furthermore, the agreement groups the agents who comprise the group into a plural subject.
::(2) The agreement implies that each member is [[Obligation|obligated]] to completing the final goal.
::(3) Because of this implied obligation, any and all members may rebuke any one else who fails to do their part towards the completion of the goal. The "[[Rights|right]] to rebuke" is stated as a necessary feature of the group arrangement. This functions as a tool for each member of the group to ensure the goal is accomplished.
::(4) In order to break the agreement there has to be joint consent among all members of the group.

[[File:A Mother Daughter team (presumably) walk barefoot together on the beach.jpg|thumb|A paradigmatic social phenomenon: two people walking together]]

===Responses to Gilbert===

A number of philosophers have responded to the normative theory of Gilbert with papers that consider obligations, promises and commitments. One of these, Christopher McMahon, argues that Gilbert has observed crucial behavioral phenomena involved in acts of collective intentionality, but has misidentified the psychological dynamics underlying these phenomena. Specifically, he holds that the behaviors characterizing collective intentionality arise not from a set of mutual obligations which facilitate a "right to rebuke" but from the existence of de facto authority, or some kind of social decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Christopher. 2005. "Shared Agency and Rational Cooperation," ''Nous'', Vol. 39, No. 2, 284-308.&lt;/ref&gt; This de facto authority gives one party a right to partially determine another's intentions.

Facundo M. Alonso sets conditions for how the normative phenomenon of shared intention can arise. Alonso claims that shared intention involves mutual reliance between participants. He further argues for a cognitive requirement that each member publicly intends the joint activity. Thus, Alonso states, "[R]elations of mutual reliance generate...interpersonal obligations between the participants".&lt;ref name="AlonsoShared" /&gt; As a result, shared intentions generate normative promises that are enforced by mutual reliance and relevant obligation.

A. S. Roth offers his own modifications to Gilbert's account of intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Abraham Sesshu. 2004. "Shared Agency and Contralateral Commitments," ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol.113, No. 3, 359-410.&lt;/ref&gt; He, too, relies on a normative notion to explain collective intentions. Rather than obligations, however, Roth is interested in commitments. Roth enumerates four different types of commitment: participatory, contralateral, executive, and ipsilateral commitments. Roth claims that the contralateral commitments are necessary for joint actions to occur, and that they may have a moral component (though not necessarily). This opposes Gilbert's claim that the obligations found in joint activity have no moral component.

Christopher Kutz's work "Acting Together" contests the basis for what is considered a group.  When speaking of a group, it becomes common to say "they" did whatever action the group is seen as doing.  However, Kutz explains that each person may have varying levels of involvement in their group or their group efforts.  He also questions what obligations each member is considered to have to the group and what binds those individuals to their group.  To illustrate his objections, Kutz describes two group types: executive and participatory.  An "executive" commitment would extend to those members of a group who participate with others of a group only superficially but still carry the name of the group as a title. This includes people working in an office or an assembly line. A "participatory" group is involved directly with the process and end results of an action.  Each member is assumed to have at least some knowledge of all of the plans and sub-plans for the actions taken by the group.  This opens Kutz to a discussion about who, within the group, may be considered responsible for the actions of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kutz, Christopher. 2000. "Acting Together" Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. 61, No. 1 (Jul., 2000), pp. 1-31 Published by: International Phenomenological Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==J. David Velleman==

[[J. David Velleman]] provides a reaction to [[Margaret Gilbert|Gilbert]] as well as [[John Searle|Searle]]. Velleman is concerned with explaining how a group is capable of making a decision, or, as he puts it, "how... several different minds (can) submit themselves to a single making up".&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, J. David. 1997. "How to Share an Intention," ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 57, No. 1, 29-50, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, he picks up Gilbert's notion of the 'pool of wills', that is, "a single will forged from the wills of different individuals". However, according to Velleman, Gilbert does not explain how such a thing can be formed. To solve this problem, he turns to a portion of Searle's theory of intentions, namely that an "intention is a [[mental representation]] that causes behavior by representing itself as causing it".&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Velleman explains that, since a representation is capable of causing behavior, and [[speech acts]] are a form of representation, it is possible for a speech act to cause a behavior. That is, saying a thing can cause one to do that thing. Thus, a speech act can, in itself, be an intention. This is critical for him to make the case that an agent, having made a decision or an intending speech act, can "remain decided".&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, 42&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that agent can continue to intend after the speech act has been accomplished. With this, Velleman shows how an agent can make a decision for a group. If an agent utters a conditional intention, and another agent utters an intention that fulfills the conditions present in the previous utterance, then the second agent has effectively decided the question for the first agent. Thus, a single collective will has been formed from multiple individual wills.

Therefore, Velleman argues that collective intention is not the summation of multiple individual intentions, but rather one shared intention. This is accomplished by perceiving intentions as existing outside the mind of an individual and within a verbal statement. The verbal statements have causal power because of the desire to not speak falsely.

==Natalie Gold and Robert Sugden==

Collective intentionality has also been approached in light of economic theories, including [[game theory]]. According to Natalie Gold and [[Robert Sugden (economist)|Robert Sugden]], efforts to define collective intentions as individual intentions and related beliefs (such as those of [[Raimo Tuomela|Tuomela]] &amp; Miller and [[Michael Bratman]]) fail because they allow obviously non-cooperative actions to be counted as cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Natalie and R. Sugden. 2007. "Collective Intentions and Team Agency," ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 104, No. 3, 109-137.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in many simple games analyzed by game theory, the players are counted as acting jointly when they achieve the [[Nash equilibrium]], even though that equilibrium state is neither optimal nor achieved cooperatively. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], the Nash equilibrium occurs when each player defects against the other, even though they would both do better if they cooperated.

The normal game for prisoners' dilemma is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Prisoner B stays silent (''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays (''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent (''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 month|| Prisoner A: 12 months&lt;br/&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays (''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br/&gt;Prisoner B: 12 months || Each serves 3 months
|}

Standard [[game theory]] bases [[rationality]] in [[Self-interest|individual self-interest]], and thus predicts that all [[rational agent]]s will choose ''defect''. However, as Gold and Sugden note, between 40 and 50 percent of participants in prisoner's dilemma trials instead choose ''cooperate''.&lt;ref name="GS118"&gt;Gold and Sugden, 118&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that by employing we-reasoning, a team of people can intend and act in rational ways to achieve the outcome they, as a group, desire. Members of a group reason with the goal of achieving not "what is best for me", but "what is best for us".&lt;ref name="GS118" /&gt; This distinction draws on Searle's claim that "the notion of a we-intention...implies the notion of ''cooperation''".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, 406&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, if each prisoner recognizes that he or she belongs to a team, he or she will conclude that cooperation is in the best interest of the group.

In [[political science]], a  '''constitutional crisis''' is a problem or conflict in the function of a government that the [[constitution|political constitution]] or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve. There are several variations to this definition. For instance, one describes it as the crisis that arises out of the failure, or at least a strong risk of failure, of a constitution to perform its central functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constitutions in the Global Financial Crisis: A Comparative Analysis|last=Contiades|first=Xenophon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409466314|location=Oxon|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis may arise from a variety of possible causes. For example, a government may want to pass a law contrary to its constitution; the constitution may fail to provide a clear answer for a specific situation; the constitution may be clear but it may be politically infeasible to follow it; the government institutions themselves may falter or fail to live up to what the law prescribes them to be; or officials in the government may justify avoiding dealing with a serious problem based on narrow interpretations of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 4 Types Of Constitutional Crises | author=Azari, Julia; Masket, Seth | date=February 9, 2017 | url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/constitutional-crisis/ | website=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graber (2015), p. 244"&gt;{{cite book | title=A New Introduction to American Constitutionalism | author=Graber, Mark A. | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHYRDAAAQBAJ | page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific examples include the South African [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s, the [[Secession in the United States|secession of the southern U.S. states]] in 1860 and 1861, and the [[2007 Ukrainian political crisis|2007 Ukrainian crisis]]. 

Constitutional crises may arise from conflicts between different branches of government, conflicts between central and local governments, or simply conflicts among various factions within society. In the course of government, the crisis results when one or more of the parties to a [[Controversy|political dispute]] willfully chooses to violate a law of the [[constitution]]; or to flout an unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]; or to dispute the correct, legal interpretation of the violated constitutional law or of the flouted political custom. This was demonstrated by the so-called [[XYZ Affair]], which involved the bribery of French officials by a contingent of American commissioners who were sent to preserve peace between [[France]] and the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Many, One: Readings in American Political and Social Thought|last=Sinopoli|first=Richard|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1996|isbn=0878406263|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was published in the American press and created a foreign policy crisis, which precipitated the passage of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Opposition to these acts in the form of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] cited that they violated the right to free speech and exhorted states to refuse their enforcement since they violated the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Moreover, if the crisis arises because the constitution is legally ambiguous, the ultimate politico-legal resolution usually establishes the legal precedent to resolve future crises of constitutional administration. In the U.S. system of government, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not explicitly address the matter of whether or not a state can legally [[Secession in the United States|secede]] from the Union; however, after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) thwarted the secession of the [[Southern United States]], the accepted doctrine of constitutional law is that a state cannot legally leave the Union.{{Citation needed|reason=What specific doctrine?|date=June 2018}}

Politically, a constitutional crisis can lead to administrative paralysis and eventual collapse of the government, the loss of [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]], or to [[civil war]]. A constitutional crisis is distinct from a [[rebellion]], which occurs when political factions ''outside'' a government challenge the government's sovereignty, as in a ''[[coup d'état]]'' or a [[revolution]] led by the military or by civilians.

===Republic of The Gambia===
* Following the victory of [[Adama Barrow]] in the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[President of the Gambia|president]] [[Yahya Jammeh]] rejected the results and [[2016–2017 Gambian constitutional crisis|refused to step down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/10/gambian-president-rejects-election-results-yahya-jammeh-adama-barrow|title=Gambian president Yahya Jammeh rejects election result |last= |first= |date=9 December 2016 |work= |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=19 January 2017 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January, Jammeh declared a 90-day state of emergency in an attempt to extend his term of office.

===Rhodesia===
* Amid demands from [[United Kingdom]] politicians to enfranchise the black majority population, the white minority government [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965. The UK rejected the declaration and continued to claim sovereignty over Rhodesia until a framework for independence and black enfranchisement was negotiated in the 1979 [[Lancaster House Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Barber|year=2012|title=The Constitutional State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
* The [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] (1951–55): The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government disputed a court decision overturning its act to disenfranchise Coloured voters. Its attempt to reverse the decision in an ''ad hoc'' court was also overturned, after which the party used reforms to the Senate to pass the measure legally.

==Asia==

===Iran===
*[[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s 1953 dismissal of Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] and Mossadegh's subsequent refusal to quit the office

===Malaysia===
* [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]]'s leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966.
* The [[1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] saw [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Mahathir]] pushing forward an amendment of Article 66 of the Federal Constitution, which set the time limit of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaysian monarch]] to veto a law within 30 days. The proposals generated a great deal of controversy between the government and the monarchy, of which the former had to launch a public campaign to pressure the monarchy to assent to the amendments..{{clarify|date=November 2010}}
* The [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began with the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of [[Lord President of the Supreme Court]] [[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] [[Salleh Abas]] from his seat.
* The [[1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia]] (by some interpretations a constitutional crisis) involved the limitation of monarchs' [[sovereign immunity|legal immunity]] in Malaysia. Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] successfully amended the constitution to make the monarchies more accountable to their actions.
*The [[2009 Perak constitutional crisis]] occurred in the Malaysian state of [[Perak]] when [[party switching|party defections]] caused the state ruling coalition, [[Pakatan Rakyat]], to lose its majority in the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state assembly]]. The [[Sultan of Perak]] refused to dissolve the state assembly when requested and dismissed the [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) in the absence of a [[motion of no confidence|no confidence]] vote.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}

===Pakistan===
*Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] in late 1997, accusing him of undermining the court's independence. After Ali Shah suspended a constitutional amendment that prevented dismissal of the prime minister, Sharif ordered President [[Farooq Leghari]] to appoint a new chief justice. When Leghari refused, Sharif considered [[impeach]]ing him, but backed down after a warning from the armed forces. Faced with a choice of accepting Sharif's demands or dismissing him, Leghari resigned. Ali Shah resigned shortly afterward, establishing Sharif's dominance.

===Thailand===
*In March 2006, 60 seats of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] could not be elected, and Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] refused to resign. The judicial system did not lead up to Supreme Court as the top arbitrator so there were inconsistent rulings from the civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional Courts.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

===Sri Lanka===
{{main|2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis}}
*On the 26th of October 2018, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] appointed former President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as Prime Minister and dismissed incumbent Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]]. Ranil Wickremesinghe refused to accepted the dismissal while stating its unconstitutional and undemocratic.

==Europe==

===Belgium===
*The [[Royal Question]] over the status of king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] began when he acted against [[advice (constitutional)|ministerial advice]] during the [[Battle of Belgium|1940 Nazi invasion]] and refused to join [[Belgian government in exile|the government in exile]]. Deported to Germany before [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium's 1944 liberation]], Leopold's return was narrowly approved in [[Belgian monarchy referendum, 1950|a 1950 referendum]] but a subsequent general strike prompted him to abdicate the following year.
*In 1990, [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] refused routine [[Royal Assent]] to the law on [[abortion in Belgium]].  The issue was resolved by (constitutionally but controversially) having Baudouin temporarily declared incapable of reigning, the Council of Ministers giving assent as provided for in the [[Belgian Constitution]], and Baudouin declared capable again.

===Denmark===
*The [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], when [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] of [[Denmark]] dismissed the country's cabinet.

*The succession crisis following the death of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1066, settled by the invasion by [[William the Conqueror]]
*The  ''[[White Ship]]'' tragedy of 1120, which led to the succession crisis called [[The Anarchy]].
*The 1215 Barons' revolt against the rule of [[John of England|King John]], which led to the [[Magna Carta]].  Immediately, John repudiated Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]]
*The [[History of the Church of England#Separation from Papal authority|Break with Rome]], in which [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] repudiated [[papal authority]] and created himself [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], leading to the [[English Reformation]]
*[[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s insistence on the [[Divine Right of Kings]], manifest in his [[Personal Rule]] from 1629 to 1640, and leading directly to the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]
*The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688–89: The flight of [[James II of England|King James II/VII]] from the country left no king in his place to rule England or Scotland or to summon a [[Parliament]].  When [[William III of England|King William]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] jointly replaced him there was therefore no legally recognised Parliament to legitimise their irregular succession to the throne. This led to the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]].

===Estonia===
*The early 1930s political crisis in [[Estonia]] as two constitutional reforms had been rejected by the electorate and only the [[Estonian constitutional referendum, October 1933|third referendum]] in 1933 succeeded in replacing the [[parliamentary republic]] with the [[presidential republic]]. The succeeding constitutional reform was proposed by the [[Vaps Movement]], who were however kept from power by the [[self-coup]] of [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]] [[Konstantin Päts]], who was supported by the [[Riigikogu]].

===France===
*The [[16 May 1877 crisis]]: President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Jules Simon]] and named [[Albert de Broglie]] to replace him. The [[National Assembly]] refused to recognize the new government and a crisis, which ended with the dissolution of the Assembly and new elections, ensued.

===Germany===
* In the [[Weimar Republic]], for several years the country was governed with the help of [[enabling act]]s and emergency decrees. The crisis became dramatic in 1932, when the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Communist Party of Germany]] had together a majority in the parliament. Any government, installed by the [[President of Germany (1919–45)|Reich President]], was likely to be dismissed by the parliament. The crisis ended in a Nazi and conservative coalition government and then Nazi dictatorship. The [[Weimar Constitution|Weimar constitution]] was not abolished but made obsolete.

===Malta===
*The [[Maltese general election, 1981|1981 election]], when, due to a quirk in that country's [[Single Transferrable Vote]] system, the party winning more than half the votes won fewer than half the seats in parliament.

===Norway===
*[[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] of prime minister Selmer's cabinet in 1883/1884 regarding the king's right to veto changes to the constitution, and establishment of an ad-hoc parliamentary practice until amended to the constitution in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monarchy of Norway#Council of State]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Storting]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberaleren.no/2007/02/20/parlamentarismen-inn-i-grunnloven/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905]]{{Elucidate|date=November 2018}}

===Rome===
*The crossing of the [[Rubicon]] by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49 BC with his legions. This action, which had no precedent, precipitated a crisis only fully resolved in 31 BC, when [[Augustus|Octavian]] defeated all his enemies to become the sole master of the Roman world.

===Russia===
*The [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of 1993]]: a conflict between [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the Russian parliament led by [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]]. It emerged due to disagreements regarding the demarcation of political authority. Russian leaders agreed to hold a referendum in April 1993 that would determine whether the presidency or the parliament would be the dominant institution in the Russian political system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Presidential Power in Russia|last=Huskey|first=Eugene|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315482194|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament temporarily reneged on its commitment to a referendum and it prompted Yeltsin to issue a decree giving the president more authority. This was met with resistance even from among figures within the executive department such as Yurii Shokov, chair of the president's Security Council and [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]], Yeltsin's Vice President.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anticipating impeachment, Yeltsin dissolved the parliament in September 21, 1993 and called for fresh elections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and the Russian Army: Civil-Military Relations, 1689-2000|last=Taylor|first=Brian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0521816742|location=Cambridge|pages=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president did not have the constitutional authority to do this and the Constitutional Court promptly ruled that the decree was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This resulted to ten days of street fighting between the police, pro-parliamentary demonstrators, and groups loyal to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation|last=Saunders|first=Robert|last2=Strukov|first2=Vlad|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksandr Rutskoy was sworn as the acting President of Russia for a few days. The crisis ended after a military siege of the parliament building, which claimed 187 lives. 

===Scotland===
This covers the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], which became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] after 1707. For constitutional crises since then, see [[Constitutional crisis#Constitutional Crises in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below.
*The succession crisis resulting from the death of [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Queen Margaret]] in 1290. [[Edward I of England]], whose [[Edward II of England|son Edward]] was to marry Margaret, was asked to arbitrate, and chose [[John Balliol]], who swore an [[oath of fealty]] to Edward, turning Scotland into an English vassal in 1292.  Soon, Balliol and the [[Scottish nobility]] revolted, leading to the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].

===Spain===
[[File:President_Puigdemont,_"Ciutadans_de_Catalunya,_vénen_hores_en_què_a_tots_ens_pertocarà_de_mantenir_el_pols_del_nostre_país"_02.jpg|thumb|[[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan president]], [[Carles Puigdemont]], addresses the crowd following the unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October]]
*The [[2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Government of Spain]] and the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] clashing over the latter's planning of an [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|independence referendum]] on 1 October 2017, leading to the Catalan government openly defying instructions from the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] and in state prosecutors filling criminal charges on Catalan leading officials for rebellion, disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions. General strikes and tense demonstrations took place during these weeks. On 27 October, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] tried to found a Catalan republic with a [[Catalan declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]]. At the same time, the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] approved the application of [[Constitution of Spain#Article 155|Article 155]] of the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution]], which led to the cessation of the Catalan Government, the dissolution of parliament, the call for [[Catalan regional election, 2017|elections]] for 21 December and the direct rule over Catalonia. The [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] imprisoned a large part of the Puigdemont executive, the [[Carme Forcadell|Speaker of the Parliament]] and the two leaders of the two major independentists civil associations, as well as the flight to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Scotland of President [[Puigdemont]], four regional ex-regional ministers and two political leaders. For July 2018, the direct rule ended and the prisoners are still in preventive jail in Catalan prisons.

===United Kingdom===
*The rejection of the 1909 [[People's Budget]] by the [[House of Lords]]. This caused a two-year impasse, leading to the [[Parliament Act 1911]].&lt;ref name="bogdanor"&gt;{{cite book|first=Vernon|last=Bogdanor|year=1997|title=The Monarchy and the Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.

==North America==

===Canada===
*In the [[King-Byng Affair]] of 1926, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Viscount Byng of Vimy]] refused the request of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve Parliament]] and call new elections after King had, months before, refused to resign.  Instead, Byng dismissed King and appointed [[Arthur Meighen]] as Prime Minister, after which Meighen found himself unable to retain [[confidence (politics)|confidence]], triggering his own resignation and an election.  Reaction to the affair was reflected in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], the resulting separation of [[British Dominions|Dominion]] [[Governors General]] from the British government, and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] that made each realm of the Crown independent.
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The 1982 [[patriation]] of the [[British North America Act]] was contentious, as there were conflicting opinions from the federal government, provincial governments, and [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] over what exactly the procedure was whereby Canada could request a [[constitutional amendment]] from [[the United Kingdom]].  The Supreme Court's decision in the [[Quebec Veto Reference]] found that [[Quebec]] did not have a veto on patriation, and the process was legitimate and binding.  The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] symbolically refuses to ratify the Constitution Act in its current form.&lt;!-- Is this a crisis?  The government seems to have continued operating since 1982. --&gt;{{cn|date=January 2017}}
*The [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], in which [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], [[New Democratic Party|NDP]], and [[Bloc Québécois]] Members of Parliament attempted to have a vote of non-confidence against the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government and replace it with a coalition government, was unprecedented in the Canadian constitutional system, as formal party-based co-operation was rare. [[Stephen Harper|Prime Minister Stephen Harper]] controversially advised the Governor General to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue]] Parliament. The coalition effort subsequently fell apart, leaving the key questions around the dispute unanswered.

===Honduras===
*The [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]] saw President [[Manuel Zelaya]] attempting to hold a non-binding referendum which [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Supreme Court]] deemed unconstitutional. The military, following orders from the Supreme Court, arrested President Zelaya.

===United States===
[[File:Electoral Commission (United States).jpg|right|thumb|220px|The Electoral Commission was a panel that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876.]]

*The [[Stamp Act 1765]], by which the British Parliament sought to tax the [[Thirteen Colonies]], set off protests from colonial politicians against [[taxation without representation]]. Parliament continued to assert its authority in subsequent acts, throwing colonial governments into chaos and eventually leading the colonists to declare total independence from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H. T.|last=Dickinson|year=2014|title=Britain and the American Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1832, in which [[South Carolina]] declared that it would not permit collection of a federal tariff.  The United States Congress eventually passed a law to authorize the President to use military force in South Carolina to enforce federal laws, as well as a revised tariff law with lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard E.|last=Ellis|year=1989|title=The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights and the Nullification Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1841 the death of President [[William Henry Harrison]] resulted in Vice-President [[John Tyler]] becoming President, the first vice-president to succeed to the presidency. He assumed full presidential powers, although there was doubt whether the actual office of President "devolved" upon the Vice President or merely its powers and duties. The "Tyler Precedent" governed future successions and eventually became codified in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]]. Some opposition Whig members of Congress, including [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]], held that Tyler should be a [[Caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]] under the title of [[Acting President of the United States|"Acting President"]]. He was referred to as "His Accidency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unsuccessful amendments had been proposed in both houses to strike out the word "President" in favor of language including the term "Vice President" for such cases. Tyler had correspondence from his political opponents to the White House addressed to the "Vice President" or "Acting President" returned unopened.&lt;ref name="Abbott2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Abbott|title=Accidental Presidents: Death, Assassination, Resignation, and Democratic Succession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdzGAAAAQBAJ|date=23 June 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-61303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayes]], who damped Southern fury by withdrawing federal troops from the South, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].
* In the [[Watergate scandal]] (1972–74), President [[Richard Nixon]] and his staff obstructed investigations into their political activities. Nixon resigned, under threat of impeachment, after the release of an audio tape showing that he had personally approved the obstruction. Congressional moves to restrain presidential authority continued for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harry|last=Pohlman|year=2005|title=Constitutional Debate in Action: Governmental Powers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schudson|year=1992|title=Watergate in American Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saturday Night Massacre|dismissal of independent special prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]], and the resignations of [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Elliot Richardson]] and Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]] on October 20, 1973, led to the [[Independent Counsel Act]] for a more impartial way of investigating high-level public integrity cases in the executive branch without interference from the President or other executive branch leaders. Prior to the Independent Counsel Act a Special Prosecutor was still under the authority of the President and any investigations into the executive branch could be stopped by the President by simply firing the Special Prosecutor.

===Australia===
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] and his government dismissed by the nation's [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], in response to a prolonged budget deadlock in Parliament.  This occurred even though Whitlam's government had the [[confidence (politics)|confidence]] of the lower house, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In the [[Australian Constitution]], the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] has equal powers with the House of Representatives, except it may not initiate or amend a [[supply bill]]. It can, however, reject or defer consideration of such a bill, and that is what it did on this occasion.
*In 2017, the [[2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|eligibility of certain Australian parliamentarians]] to sit in the [[Parliament of Australia]] was called into question because of their actual or possible [[dual citizenship]].

===Fiji===
*In the [[1977 Fijian constitutional crisis|Fiji constitutional crisis of 1977]], the winning party in a general election failed to name a government due to internal conflicts. The [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] intervened, appointing a prime minister from the opposition party.

*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The [[New Zealand constitutional crisis, 1984|New Zealand constitutional crisis of 1984]] was caused by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Rob Muldoon|Sir Rob Muldoon]]'s refusal to devalue the [[New Zealand dollar|dollar]] as per the instructions of the Prime Minister-elect, [[David Lange]].  The outgoing cabinet rebelled against Muldoon, who relented.  The upshot was the passage of the [[Constitution Act 1986 (NZ)|Constitution Act]], which patriated the constitution from the United Kingdom.

===Papua New Guinea===
*The [[2011–2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis of 2011–2012]] was caused by a disagreement, involving every branch of government including the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea|Supreme Court]], as to who the legitimate [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] was. Specifically, whether Prime Minister [[Michael Somare]]'s dismissal by the Speaker of the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] while he was in hospital had been lawful. After ten months, the crisis was resolved peacefully by [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2012|a general election]].

===Tuvalu===
*The [[Tuvaluan constitutional crisis|Tuvaluan constitutional crisis of 2013]] occurred when Prime Minister [[Willy Telavi]] sought to continue governing after having lost his parliamentary majority. He deferred allowing Parliament to sit, and his ally Speaker [[Kamuta Latasi]] did not allow a [[motion of no confidence]] to be tabled when it finally did sit. The Opposition accused the government of acting unconstitutionally, and [[Governor General of Tuvalu|Governor General]] Sir [[Iakoba Italeli]] intervened, removing the Prime Minister from office so that Parliament could decide who should form the government. Telavi sought in vain to ask the [[monarchy of Tuvalu|Queen of Tuvalu]], [[Elizabeth II]], to remove the Governor General. Parliament elected Opposition Leader [[Enele Sopoaga]] to the premiership.

There are several methods for measuring the prevalence of crime. Public surveys are sometimes conducted to estimate the amount of crime not reported to police. Such surveys are usually more reliable for assessing trends. However, they also have their limitations and generally don't procure statistics useful for local crime prevention, often ignore offenses against children and do not count offenders brought before the criminal justice system.

Law enforcement agencies in some countries offer compilations of statistics for various types of crime.

Two major methods for collecting crime data are law enforcement reports, which only reflect crimes that are reported, recorded, and not subsequently canceled; and [[victim study]] (victimization [[statistical survey]]s), which rely on individual memory and honesty. For less frequent crimes such as intentional homicide and armed robbery, reported incidences are generally more reliable, but suffer from under-recording; for example, [[no criming]] in the United Kingdom sees over one third of reported violent crimes being not recorded by the police.&lt;ref name="hmic-victims"&gt;[http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/news/news-feed/victims-let-down-by-poor-crime-recording/ Victims let down by poor crime-recording] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304145307/http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/news/news-feed/victims-let-down-by-poor-crime-recording/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because laws and practices vary between jurisdictions, comparing crime statistics between and even within countries can be difficult: typically only violent deaths (homicide or manslaughter) can reliably be compared, due to consistent and high reporting and relative clear definition.

The U.S. has two major data collection programs, the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] from the FBI and the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, the U.S. has no comprehensive infrastructure to monitor crime trends and report the information to related parties such as law enforcement.&lt;ref name=NRCUnderstanding&gt;{{cite web |work=Committee on Understanding Crime Trends, [[U.S. National Research Council]] |year=2008 |title=Understanding Crime Trends: Workshop Report |publisher=National Academies Press |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12472#toc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219193853/http://nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12472#toc |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research using a series of victim surveys in 18 countries of the [[European Union]], funded by the [[European Commission]], has reported (2005) that the level of crime in Europe has fallen back to the levels of 1990, and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other industrialized countries as well. The European researchers say a general consensus identifies demographic change as the leading cause for this international trend. Although homicide and robbery rates rose in the U.S. in the 1980s, by the end of the century they had declined by 40%.&lt;ref name=NRCUnderstanding/&gt;

However, the European research suggests that "increased use of [[crime prevention]] measures may indeed be the common factor behind the near universal decrease in overall levels of crime in the Western world", since decreases have been most pronounced in property crime and less so, if at all, in contact crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Van Dijk, J.

==Counting rules==
Relatively few standards exist and none that permit international comparability beyond a very limited range of offences. However, many jurisdictions accept the following:
* There must be a ''[[prima facie]]'' case that an offence has been committed before it is recorded. That is either police find evidence of an offence or receive a believable allegation of an offense being committed. Some jurisdictions count offending only when certain processes happen, such as an arrest is made, ticket issued, charges laid in Court or only upon securing a conviction.
* Multiple reports of the same offence usually count as one offence. Some jurisdictions count each report separately, others count each victim of offending separately.
* Where several offences are committed at the same time, in one act of offending, only the most serious offense is counted. Some jurisdictions record and count each and every offense separately, others count cases, or offenders, that can be prosecuted.
* Where multiple offenders are involved in the same act of offending only one act is counted when counting offenses but each offender is counted when apprehended.
* Offending is counted at the time it comes to the attention of a law enforcement officer. Some jurisdictions record and count offending at the time it occurs.
* As "only causing pain" is counted as assault in some countries, it let higher assault rates except in Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. But there are exceptions, like Czech Republic and Latvia. France was the contrasting exception having a high assault ration without counting minor assaults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeansourcebook.org/ob285_full.pdf European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics – 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215512/http://www.europeansourcebook.org/ob285_full.pdf |date=March 3, 2016 }}, fourth edition, p30.&lt;/ref&gt;
Offending that is a breach of the law but for which no punishment exists is often not counted. For example: Suicide, which is technically illegal in most countries, may not be counted as a crime, although attempted suicide and assisting suicide are.

Also traffic offending and other minor offending that might be dealt with by using fines, rather than imprisonment, is often not counted as ''crime''. However separate statistics may be kept for this sort of offending.

==Surveys==
Because of the difficulties in quantifying how much crime actually occurs, researchers generally take two approaches to gathering statistics about crime.

However, as officers can only record crime that comes to their attention and might not record a matter as a crime if the matter is considered minor and is not perceived as a crime by the officer concerned.

For example, when faced with a domestic violence dispute between a couple, a law enforcement officer may decide it is far less trouble to arrest the male party to the dispute, because the female may have children to care for, despite both parties being equally culpable for the dispute. This sort of pragmatic decisionmaking asked if they are victims of crime, without needing to provide any supporting evidence. In these surveys it is the participant's perception, or opinion, that a crime occurred, or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured.

As a consequence differing methodologies may make comparisons with other surveys difficult.

One way in which, while other types of crime are under reported. These surveys also give insights as to why crime is reported, or not. The surveys show that the need to make an insurance claim, seek medical assistance, and the seriousness of an offence tend to increase the level of reporting, while the inconvenience of reporting, the involvement of intimate partners and the nature of the offending tend to decrease reporting.

This allows degrees of confidence to be assigned to various crime statistics. For example: Motor vehicle thefts are generally well reported because the victim may need to make the report for an insurance claim, while domestic violence, domestic child abuse and sexual offences are frequently significantly under-reported because of the intimate relationships involved, embarrassment and other factors that make it difficult for the victim to make a report.

Attempts to use victimisation surveys from different countries for international comparison had failed in the past. A standardised survey project called ''the International Crime Victims Survey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rechten.uvt.nl/icvs |title=The 5th round of International Crime Victims Surveys |publisher=rechten.uvt.nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201125851/http://rechten.uvt.nl/icvs/ |archivedate=2013-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from this project have been briefly discussed earlier in this article.

==Classification==
While most jurisdictions could probably agree about what constitutes a [[murder]], what constitutes a [[homicide]] may be more problematic, while a crime against the person could vary widely. Legislation differences often means the ingredients of offences vary between jurisdictions.

The International Crime victims Survey has been done in over 70 countries to date and has become the 'de facto' standard for defining common crimes.

==Measures==
More complex measures involve measuring the numbers of discrete victims and offenders as well as repeat victimisation rates and recidivism. Repeat victimisation involves measuring how often the same victim is subjected to a repeat occurrence of an offence, often by the same offender. Repetition rate measures are often used to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

'''David P. Schmitt''' is a personality [[psychologist]] who founded the International Sexuality Description Project (ISDP). The ISDP is the largest-ever cross-cultural research study on [[Human sexuality|sex]] and [[Personality psychology|personality]]. Over 100 psychologists simultaneously administered an anonymous self-report survey to 17,837 individuals representing 56 different nations, 6 continents, 13 islands, and 30 languages. Direct assessments of people's personality traits and sexual behaviors have led to innovative tests of [[evolutionary psychology]] and social role theory. A second wave of the ISDP is currently underway and includes measures of subjective well-being, [[social dominance orientation|social dominance]], sexual aggression, [[rape]] attitudes, [[HIV]] risk, and [[psychopathy]].

David Schmitt also blogs in [[Psychology Today]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/david-p-schmitt-phd&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Conference to Promote the Resolution of the Conflict in the Basque Country''' — more widely known as the '''Donostia-San Sebastián International Peace Conference''' — was a conference aimed at promoting a resolution to the [[Basque conflict]],&lt;ref name=EITB20111017&gt;{{cite news|title=Annan and Adams top list of experts at Donostia Peace Conference|url=http://www.eitb.com/en/news/politics/detail/757117/annan-adams-top-list-experts-donostia-peace-conference/|accessdate=18 October 2011|publisher=EITB.com|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took place in [[Donostia-San Sebastián]] ([[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]) on October 17, 2011, at [[Aiete Palace]].

[[Tony Blair]] — former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom — could not be present due to commitments in the Middle East,&lt;ref name=EITB20111017/&gt; but he supported the final declaration. The former US President [[Jimmy Carter]] (2002 Nobel Peace Prize) and the former US senator [[George J.

[[File:Konferentzia.ogv|thumb|400px|The final declaration, read by [[Bertie Ahern]], with Basque language subtitles.]]

The Final declaration has five points, and it's written as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basquepeaceprocess.info/?p=3375 Declaration of the International Conference to Promote the resolution conflict in the Basque Country]&lt;/ref&gt;
#We call upon ETA to make a public declaration of the definitive cessation of all armed action and to request talks with the governments of Spain and France to address exclusively the consequences of the conflict.
#If such a declaration is made we urge the governments of Spain and France to welcome it and agree to talks exclusively to deal with the consequences of the conflict.
#We urge that major steps be taken to promote reconciliation, recognize, compensate and assist all victims, recognize the harm that has been done and seek to heal personal and social wounds.
#In our experience of resolving conflicts there are often other issues that, if addressed, can assist in the attainment of lasting peace. We suggest that non violent actors and political representatives meet and discuss political and other related issues, in consultation with the citizenry, that could contribute to a new era without conflict. In our experience third party observers or facilitators help such dialogue. Here, such dialogue could also be assisted by international facilitators, if that were desired by those involved.
#We are willing to form a committee to follow up these recommendations.

==Aftermath==
Three days after the conference — on October 20 — ETA announced "definitive cessation of its armed activity".&lt;ref name=EITB20111020a/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20111020/&gt; They said they were ending their 43-year armed campaign for independence and called on Spain and France to open talks.&lt;ref name=EITB20111020a/&gt; The Spanish government insisted that it will not negotiate on demands for Basque self-determination until ETA disbands.&lt;ref name=BBC20111020/&gt; Spanish prime minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]] described ETA's announcement as "a victory for democracy, law and reason".&lt;ref name=BBC20111020/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10513">'''[[Energy policy]] in [[Scotland]]''' is a matter that has been specifically [[reserved matters|reserved]] to the [[UK parliament]] under the terms of the [[Scotland Act 1998]] that created the [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2003/rp03-084.pdf House of Commons Library Research Paper 03/84] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910042038/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2003/rp03-084.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }} p21&lt;/ref&gt; However, since [[planning]] is a matter that has been devolved, the [[Scottish government]] has the ability to shape the direction of energy generation in [[Scotland]] by approving or refusing new projects.

In 2004, the Enterprise Committee of the Scottish Parliament called for the development of a 'fully fledged' Scottish energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-comm-04/cent04-005.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Committee News Release June 30 2004 |access-date=2008-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129112301/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-comm-04/cent04-005.htm |archive-date=2006-11-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|SNP Government]] that took power in May 2007 specifically included the word 'energy' in a portfolio title when the junior ministerial position of [[Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism]] was created to replace the position of '[[Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning]]'.

==Overview==

==Fossil fuels==
The closure of the [[Longannet power station]] in March 2016 ended coal-fired power production in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-35882883&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==
{{main|Renewable energy in Scotland}}
[[File:Windmills and Ailsa Craig aka Paddy's Milestone rotated.jpg|thumb|right|Wind, wave and tide make up more than 80% of Scotland's renewable energy potential.]]

The production of renewable energy in Scotland is an issue that has come to the fore in technical, economic, and political terms during the opening years of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Scottish Executive (2005) ''Choosing Our Future: Scotland's Sustainable Development Strategy.'' Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural resource base for [[renewable energy]] is extraordinary by [[Renewable energy in the European Union|European]], and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being [[wind power|wind]], [[wave power|wave]], and [[tidal power|tide]].

At the end of 2011, there was 4,796 [[megawatts]] (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 9.5 per cent (416 MW) on the end of 2010. Renewable electricity generation in 2011 was a record high at 13,750 GWh - an increase of 44.5 per cent on 2010. Around 35 per cent of Scotland’s electricity came from renewables in 2011, exceeding the Scottish Government’s target of 31 per cent. Scotland contributed almost 40 per cent of the UK’s renewables output in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/geenenergytargets29032012 |title=Scotland beats 2011 green energy target |author= |date=29 March 2012 |work=The Scottish Government |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing improvements in engineering and economics are enabling more of the [[renewable resource]]s to be utilised. Fears regarding "[[peak oil]]" and [[climate change]] have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various [[biofuel]]s. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, it is probable that there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.&lt;ref name=Monbiot&gt;Monbiot, George (2006) ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning''. London. Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to planned increases in both large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] are being researched.&lt;ref name=BPPH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterheadhydrogenpower.com/|title=Peterhead hydrogen project|publisher=[[BP]]|accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.&lt;ref&gt;HICEC. (2006) [http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-Annual_review.pdf ''Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company Annual Review'']. (PDF). Inverness. Retrieved on 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuing political debate surrounds the uptake and the incentivisation schemes available for renewable technologies in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-use-of-low-carbon-technologies/supporting-pages/renewable-heat-incentive-rhi&lt;/ref&gt; There are tensions over the disparity in costs between renewable installations in Scotland compared to those in England with suggestion that this should be recognised by the UK government.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Nuclear power==
When the [[UK Government]] announced an energy review in early 2006, the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and others made clear their view that Scotland did not need new nuclear power stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4634878.stm Call to halt nuclear power plans] BBC January 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2008, when the UK Government gave the go-ahead for a new generation of nuclear power stations to be built across the UK, the SNP formed the [[Scottish Government]] and [[First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] made clear there was "no chance" of more nuclear power stations being built in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7179579.stm New nuclear plants get go-ahead]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government's stance was backed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] which voted 63-58 to support the Scottish Government's policy of opposing new nuclear power stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/nuclearenergy/MSPs-vote-No-to-new.3686900.jp MSPs vote No to new nuclear stations] [[The Scotsman]] January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauly-Denny power line==
A proposed 400 kV upgrade to the existing 132 kV transmission network,&lt;ref name=sseBD&gt;https://www.ssepd.co.uk/BeaulyDenny/&lt;/ref&gt; seen as key to future expansion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwea.com/media/news/070205.html BWEA position on Beauly Denny] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720183006/http://www.bwea.com/media/news/070205.html |date=2012-07-20 }} Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was held up in planning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaulydenny.co.uk/ Beauly Denny Public Inquiry website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912065954/http://www.beaulydenny.co.uk/ |date=2012-09-12 }}, Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; for three years. There was vocal opposition from some sectors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pylonpressure.com/more-powerlines-g.asp Pylon Pressure website - Beauly Denny] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025104952/http://www.pylonpressure.com/More-Powerlines-g.asp |date=2010-10-25 }} Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and strong support from other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaulydenny.org/bdfriends.pdf Friends of the Beauly Denny Power Line Upgrade]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Objections were principally on the basis of the visual impact of the pylons running through the edge of the [[Cairngorms National Park]]. 53km of the 132kV line inside the park was taken down and not replaced.&lt;ref name=sseBD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ssen-transmission.co.uk/news-views/articles/2017/1/cairngorms-capers-and-the-disappearing-towers/ |title=Cairngorms capers and the disappearing towers|publisher=SSE |date=24 January 2017 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 220&amp;nbsp;km circuit will run from [[Beauly]], west of Inverness to [[Denny, Falkirk|Denny]], west of [[Falkirk]] near [[Edinburgh]].

In 2008, the first major independent study associated with the Scottish Government’s renewable energy targets concluded that the upgrade of the Beauly-Denny power line will be a key to future development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/978401?UserKey= Power-line opponents dealt blow by independent study]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the Scottish Government approved the upgrade to the Beauly to Denny transmission line,&lt;ref name="news"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8447317.stm New offshore wind farm contracts announced] ''BBC News'', 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which was energized by Christmas 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ssepd.co.uk/ProjectNews/BeaulyDenny/7131/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ssen-transmission.co.uk/projects/beauly-denny/ |title=Beauly Denny Line|publisher=SSE |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vrtizer3090.jpg|thumb|Bank protection made with mattresses in Vrtižer, Slovakia]]
A '''gabion''' (from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gabbione'' meaning "big cage"; from Italian ''gabbia'' and Latin ''cavea'' meaning "cage") is a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], or box filled with rocks, concrete, or sometimes sand and soil for use in civil engineering, road building, military applications and [[landscaping]].

For erosion control, caged [[riprap]] is used. For dams or in foundation construction, cylindrical metal structures are used. In a military context, earth- or sand-filled gabions are used to protect [[Sapper|sappers]], infantry, and [[artillery]]men from enemy fire.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed a type of gabion called a ''Corbeille Leonard'' ("Leonard[o] basket") for the foundations of the San Marco Castle in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gabiondesign.be/gabion.html gabiondesign.be]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106053216/http://gabiondesign.be/gabion.html |date=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gabion 040.jpg|thumb|left|Bridge abutment with gabions]]

==Civil engineering==
The most common civil engineering use of gabions was refined and [[patent]]ed by Gaetano [[Maccaferri]] in the late 19th century in Sacerno, Emilia Romagna and used to stabilize shorelines, stream banks or slopes against [[erosion]]. Other uses include retaining walls, [[noise barrier]]s, temporary [[flood wall]]s, [[silt]] filtration from runoff, for small or temporary/permanent dams, river training, or channel lining. They may be used to direct the force of a flow of flood water around a vulnerable structure.

Gabions are also used as [[fish screen]]s on small streams. Gabion stepped [[weir]]s are commonly used for river training and flood control; the stepped design enhances the rate of energy dissipation in the channel, and it is particularly well suited to the construction of gabion stepped weirs.&lt;ref name="Wuthrich_Chanson2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wuthrich, D. and [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]]  |title= Hydraulics, Air Entrainment and Energy Dissipation on Gabion Stepped Weir |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:337198  |journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE |volume=140 |issue=9 |pages= Paper 04014046, 10 pages |doi= 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000919 |issn= 0733-9429 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gabion wall is a [[retaining wall]] made of stacked stone-filled gabions tied together with wire. Gabion walls are usually [[Batter (walls)|''battered'']] (angled back towards the slope), or stepped back with the slope, rather than stacked vertically.

The life expectancy of gabions depends on the lifespan of the wire, not on the contents of the basket. The structure will fail when the wire fails. Galvanized steel wire is most common, but [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-coated and stainless steel wire are also used. PVC-coated galvanized gabions have been estimated to survive for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maccaferri-northamerica.com/files/USA028_FallsRoadMD.pdf maccaferri-northamerica.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311001454/http://www.maccaferri-northamerica.com/files/USA028_FallsRoadMD.pdf |date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some gabion manufacturers guarantee a structural consistency of 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gabions.net/featured_projects_2.html |title=Feature Projects - Project 2 |work=gabions.net |accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, gabion use within streams first began with projects completed from 1957 to 1965 on North River, Virginia and Zealand River, New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Toblaski, R.A., and N.K. Tripp, 1961. ''Gabions for stream and erosion control.'' Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 16: 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 150 grade-control structures, bank revetments and channel deflectors were constructed on the two U.S. Forest Service sites. Eventually, a large portion of the in-stream structures failed due to undermining and lack of structural integrity of the baskets. In particular, corrosion and abrasion of wires by bedload movement compromised the structures, which then sagged and collapsed into the channels. Other gabions were toppled into channels as trees grew and enlarged on top of gabion revetments, leveraging them toward the river channels.

Gabions have also been used in building, as in the [[Dominus Estate|Dominus Winery]] in the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]], [[California]], by architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], constructed between 1995 and 1997. The exterior is formed by modular wire mesh gabions containing locally quarried stone; this construction allows air movement through the building and creates an environment of moderate temperatures inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floornature.com/projects-commerce/project-herzog-de-meuron-dominus-winery-california-4025/ |title=Dominus Winery in Napa Valley, California, USA. |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=floornature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Dominus_Winery |title=Dominus Winery |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=Archiplanet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014215250/http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Dominus_Winery |archivedate=2008-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations in design==
There are various special designs of gabions to meet particular functional requirements and some special terms for particular forms have come into use. For example:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridgeway-online.com/MM/assets/CPD/GabionCPD.pdf ridgeway-online.com]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bastion: a gabion lined internally with a membrane, typically of nonwoven [[geotextile]] to permit use of a granular soil fill, instead of rock.
* Mattress: a form of gabion with relatively small height relative to the lateral dimensions; commonly very wide. For protecting surfaces from wave erosion and similar attack, rather than building or supporting high structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foraas.no/wp.../4.Gabion_-_Spesifikasjoner_og_guide_-_030209.pdf foraas.no]{{dead link |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trapion: a form of gabion with a [[trapezoid]]al cross section, designed for stacking to give a face that is sloping rather than stepped. The term is in wide usage, but in contexts related to gabions at least, appears to be a trademark registered by Betafence Limited.

==Military use==
[[File:Virginia, Fort Stedman. View of the interior of - NARA - 533357.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[Fort Stedman]] in 1865, showing a parapet constructed with gabions to protect gun positions]]
Early gabions were round cages with open tops and bottoms, made from [[wicker]]work and filled with earth for use as military [[fortification]]s.&lt;ref name=Mahan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahan|first1=Dennis Hart|title=An elementary course of military engineering|date=1870|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101027165289;view=1up;seq=84|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} These early military gabions were most often used to protect [[sappers]] and siege [[artillery]] gunners. &lt;ref name=Mahan/&gt;{{rp|39}} The wickerwork cylinders were light and could be carried relatively conveniently in the [[ammunition]] train, particularly if they were made in several [[diameter]]s to fit one inside another. At the site of use in the field, they could be stood on end, staked in position, and filled with soil to form an effective wall around the [[gun]], or rapidly construct a bulletproof parapet along a sap.  During the [[Crimean War]], local shortages of brushwood led to use of scrap hoop-iron from hay bales in its stead; this in turn led to purpose-built sheet-iron gabions.&lt;ref name=Mahan/&gt;{{rp|182}}  

Today, gabions are often used to protect [[forward operating base]]s (FOBs) against explosive, fragmentary, indirect fires such as mortar or artillery fire. Examples of areas within a FOB that make extensive use of gabions are sleeping quarters, mess halls, or any place where there would be a large concentration of unprotected soldiers. Gabions are also used for aircraft revetments, blast walls, and similar structures.

'''''Go Nawaz Go''''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|گو نواز گو}}}}) is a [[political slogan]] in Pakistan, popularised during the [[Azadi March]] and [[Inqilab March]] protests against the former Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], led by the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI) and [[Pakistan Awami Tehrik]] (PAT) respectively. The movements aimed for the resignation of Sharif, over claims of governmental manipulations in the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Go-Nawaz-Go’ goes viral|url=http://nation.com.pk/lahore/30-Sep-2014/go-nawaz-go-goes-viral|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Nation|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad]], the leader of [[Awami Muslim League (Pakistan)]] initially introduced the anti-government chant after Nawaz Sharif refused to step down as Prime Minister in September 2014. The slogan was later popularised by [[Imran Khan]], the leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf who ran a protest movement simultaneously. This chant was also used by [[Tahir ul Qadri|Tahir-ul-Qadri,]] the leader of Pakistan Awami Tehreek. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan Protests: Tahirul Qadri Launches 'Go Nawaz Go' Campaign on Currency Bills|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pakistan-protests-tahirul-qadri-launches-go-nawaz-go-campaign-currency-bills-1465424|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=International Business Times|date=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balochistan University professor chants 'Go Nawaz Go' at laptop distribution event|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/794795/balochistan-university-professor-chants-go-nawaz-go-at-laptop-distribution-event/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Express Tribune|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arynews.tv/en/along-former-pmln-lawmaker-tmo-also-fired-pti-rally/|title=Do what you can, I am coming to Larkana on Nov 21|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=ARY News|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Imran declares ‘decisive battle’ on Nov 30|url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/16-Nov-2014/imran-predicts-decisive-battle-on-nov-30|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=Samaa TV|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Go Nawaz Go’ slogans to be heard in Raiwind soon: Imran|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/795494/go-nawaz-go-slogans-to-ring-out-in-raiwind-soon-imran/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Express Tribune|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Go Imran go', 'go Nawaz go' in KP Assembly|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/30-Oct-2014/kp-assembly-echoes-with-go-imran-go-and-go-nawaz-go-chants|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Daily Times|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan became vastly popular, receiving circulation in a short span of time, and its use has been extended into protests, public demonstrations, while also gaining popularity in non-political situations.

Over time, the chant "Go Nawaz Go" became hugely popular and had been used many times at different events. On some occasions, the controversial slogan was chanted where members, and ministers of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML(N)]] were present which caused the members and ministers as well relatives of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif to hurriedly leave the area to avoid the embarrassing situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shahbaz gets 'Go Nawaz Go' welcome in Bhawana|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/14-Nov-2014/shahbaz-gets-go-nawaz-go-welcome-in-bhawana|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=The Nations|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wazirabad scuffle|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1135800/|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Dawn|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balochistan University professor chants 'Go Nawaz Go' at laptop distribution event|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/794795/balochistan-university-professor-chants-go-nawaz-go-at-laptop-distribution-event/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Express Tribune|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Locals boo Abid Sher with chants of ‘Go Nawaz Go’|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/24-Nov-2014/go-nawaz-go-makes-abid-sher-ali-leave-venue|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=Pakistan Today|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Go Nawaz Go' makes Abid Sher Ali leave venue|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/24-Nov-2014/go-nawaz-go-makes-abid-sher-ali-leave-venue|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Nation|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the other notable incidents where the chant caused chaos was during a graduation ceremony in [[University of Peshawar]], when a student refused to receive the graduation certificate from the governor of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and chanted "Go Nawaz Go" causing a major embarrassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crowds chant 'Go Nawaz Go' forcing Hamza Shahbaz to cut short his speech|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/768022/crowds-chant-go-nawaz-go-forcing-hamza-shahbaz-to-cut-short-his-speech/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Express Tribune|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UoP graduate shouts ‘go Nawaz go’ at convocation|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1141547|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Dawn|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student refuses to receive degree from KP governor|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-33820-Student-refuses-to-receive-degree-from-KP-governor|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The News|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Karachi University]] also cancelled a ceremony in which laptops were to have been distributed amongst students, amid fears of slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Karachi University shut for fear of 'Go Nawaz Go' slogans|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2014/11/11/karachi-university-shut-for-fear-of-go-nawaz-go-slogans/|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=The News Tribe|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fearing 'Go Nawaz Go', KU shuts down campus for laptop distribution ceremony|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/788852/fearing-go-nawaz-go-ku-shuts-down-campus-for-laptop-distribution-ceremony/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Express Tribune|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gullu Butt]] also chanted "Go Nawaz Go" when he was sentenced to 11 years in jail but later got out by order of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gullu Butt sentenced to 11 years in jail|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-33811-Gullu-Butt-sentenced-to-11-years-in-jail|accessdate=4 December 2014|work=The News|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Nawaz's visit to [[United States of America]] in order to attend [[Sixty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly|69th session of United Nation's General Assembly]], a large number of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf protestants gathered outside the UN office and chanted "Go Nawaz Go".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM’s UN address meets ‘Go Nawaz Go’ protest|url=http://arynews.tv/en/pms-un-address-meets-go-nawaz-go-protest-in-us/|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=ARY News|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made some international tours to [[China]], [[Germany]] and [[United Kingdom]], Imran Khan said that Nawaz Sharif has misunderstood the meaning of "Go Nawaz Go", clarifying that, "Go Nawaz Go" does not mean going on international tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attack on PTV building: Arrest warrants of Imran Khan, Tahirul Qadri issued|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/244997-Attack-on-PTV-building-Arrest-warrants-of-Imran-K|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=Dunya News|date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burn ‘em all: Sheikh Rashid gives mutiny call from PTI stage|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/11/12/national/burn-em-all-sheikh-rashid-gives-mutiny-call-from-pti-stage/|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=Pakistan Today|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imran also announced to mark a day as "Go Nawaz Go Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friday to be ‘Go Nawaz Go’ Day: Imran|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1132338|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Dawn|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The slogan has also been used by spectators during sports events and matches, such as [[cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1362580/go-nawaz-go-sign-pops-wwe-raw/|title='Go Nawaz Go' sign pops up at WWE Raw|work=The Express Tribune|date=22 March 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017|first=Rahul|last=Aijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sochnews.tv/tag/go-nawaz-go-slogans-in-pakistan-vs-australia-cricket-match-at-dubai/|title=Go Nawaz Go Slogans in Pakistan vs Australia Cricket Match At Dubai|work=Soch News|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The Government became aware of this slogan and raised a challenged in the Lahore High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Updates: 'Go Nawaz Go' slogan challenged in Lahore High Court|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/769685/lawyers-chant-go-nawaz-go-at-lhcba/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Express Tribune|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Go Nawaz Go" challenged in Lahore High Court|url=http://nation.com.pk/lahore/04-Oct-2014/go-nawaz-go-challenged-in-lahore-high-court|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Nation|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Government also started a crackdown against those chanting the anti-Nawaz slogan and made numerous arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan government cracks down on anti-Sharif slogans|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-10-03/news/54599816_1_pakistan-awami-tehreek-pakistan-tehreek-i-insaf-imran-khan|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=The Economic Times|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan Telecommunication Authority]] also instructed mobile phone operators to stop and curb the SMS's which included "Go Nawaz Go" characters.

==Cultural influence==
Inspired by the slogan, a game named ''Go Nawaz Go'' was released on the [[Google Play]] Store featuring a bat-wielding [[Imran Khan]] chasing a [[Nawaz Sharif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Khan chases Sharif with a bat in Go Nawaz Go app|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/11/15/national/khan-chases-sharif-with-a-bat-in-go-nawaz-go-app/|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=Pakistan Today|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Imran runs after PM in ‘Go Nawaz Go’ game|url=http://arynews.tv/en/imran-runs-pm-go-nawaz-go-game/|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=ARY News|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many songs have been written dedicating the slogan which are regularly played in rallies. One such official song of Go Nawaz Go which is sung by [http://www.songshd.pk/2014/12/go-nawaz-go-official-song-noora-by-axis.html Axis band Pakistan] break the record of most viewed song for the Go Nawaz Go Campaign.

The official website of Indian Prime Minister Modi was hacked by Pakistani hackers and put "Go Nawaz Go" slogan on the main page to protest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team Modi website hacked, displays 'Go Nawaz Go'|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/244355--Team-Modi-website-hacked-displays-Go-Nawaz-Go|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=Dunya News|date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in another major website hack of Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, Nawaz Sharif was shown as [[Shrek]] and balled as "Go Ganja Go", "Go Tind Go" and "Go Kadu Go".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nawaz Sharif as Shrek: Pak hackers deface nation's Foreign Min site|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/nawaz-sharif-shrek-pakistan-hacks-foreign-min-website-1799181.html|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=First Post|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan also became one of the most used hashtags of the year on social media in Pakistan.

The '''Greek People's Liberation Army''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνικός Λαϊκός Απελευθερωτικός Στρατός|Ellinikós Laïkós Apeleftherotikós Stratós}}), commonly known by its acronym '''ELAS''' (ΕΛΑΣ), and often mistakenly called the '''National People's Liberation Army''' (Εθνικός Λαϊκός Απελευθερωτικός Στρατός, ''Ethnikós Laïkós Apeleftherotikós Stratós''), was the military arm of the [[left-wing]] [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM) during the period of the [[Greek Resistance]] until February 1945, when, following the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' clashes and the [[Varkiza Agreement]], it was disarmed and disbanded.

==Birth of ELAS==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

After [[Nazi Germany]] attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with the initiation of [[Operation Barbarossa]] (June 22, 1941 — with most of Greece having fallen under [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]] since April and the [[Battle of Crete]] having ended on June 1 — the [[Greek Communist Party]] (KKE) called for national resistance. The KKE together with minor parties of the Left formed a political structure called [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]]. They were joined by other, center-left or non-politicised Greek resistance militants.

On February 16, 1942, EAM gave permission to a communist veteran, called Athanasios (Thanasis) Klaras (later known as [[Aris Velouchiotis]]) to examine the possibilities of a victorious armed resistance movement. It was the birth of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). ELAS initiated actions against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] forces of occupation in Greece on 7 June 1942. [[Aris Velouchiotis]] with a small group of 10–15 [[guerrilla]]s entered the village of [[Domnista]] in [[Evrytania]] and proclaimed in front of the surprised villagers that they had set off to "''start the war against the forces of [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis]] and their local collaborators''". Initially, Velouchiotis collected also the traditional local mountain living [[Banditry|bandits]], like Karalivanos, in order to create a small group of experts in guerilla fighting.

==Consolidation of strength==

===Gorgopotamos===
{{main|Operation Harling}}
[[File:Povik za ELAS.jpg|thumb|Call to become part of ELAS]]
On a night in September 1942, a small group of British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] officers parachuted into Greece near Mt. Giona. This group, led by Brigadier [[E. C. W. "Eddie" Myers|Eddie Myers]], had been tasked to blow up one of three bridges ([[Gorgopotamos]], Papadia or Asopos) of the country's main railway line, and to get the two main, but competing, guerrilla groups of ELAS and [[National Republican Greek League|EDES]] to cooperate.

After much deliberation, the Gorgopotamos bridge was chosen due to the difficulty of making repairs to the structure. But, for the mission to succeed, it was important to meet the guerrillas. Dimos Karalivanos, an ELAS guerrilla, was the first guerrilla the British found. At the end of October a second group of British officers were parachuted into the Greek mountains. Their leaders were [[Themis Marinos]] and Colonel [[Montague Woodhouse, 5th Baron Terrington|Christopher Woodhouse]]. Their mission was to locate the guerrillas of EDES and their leader [[Napoleon Zervas]], who were friendlier to the British Headquarters of the Middle-East than ELAS, and co-operate with them. The resulting mission was a challenge for the two guerrilla groups, EDES and ELAS. Finally, they agreed to collaborate. The British did not favour the participation of ELAS, because it was a pro-communist group, but the forces of ELAS were larger and better organised, and without their participation, the mission was likely to fail{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. So, in a rare and unique event, ELAS and EDES-EOEA joined forces.

On November 14, the 12 British saboteurs, the forces of ELAS (150 men) and those of EDES (60-65 men) met in the village [[Viniani]] in [[Evrytania]] and the operation started. Ten days later, the forces were at Gorgopotamos. On the night of November 25, at 23:00, the guerrillas started the attack against the Italian garrison. The Italians were startled, and after little resistance, they were defeated. After the defeat of the Italians, the saboteurs set the explosives. ELAS forces also had placed ambushes on the routes towards the bridge, to block the approach of Italian reinforcements. The explosion occurred at 03:00. Afterwards, the guerrillas' forces returned to [[Viniani]], to celebrate the success of the mission.

The destruction of the Gorgopotamos bridge was, along with the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]] in Rjukan, one of the two biggest guerrilla acts in occupied Europe{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. The blowing up of the bridge disrupted the German transportation of ammunition via Greece to [[Rommel]]'s forces for several weeks, taking place at a time where the German forces in North Africa, retreating after the defeat of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], were in absolute necessity of provisions{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

===From 1942 to 1943: the turning point===
{{Communist Party of Greece}}
[[File:ELAS, oficeri.jpg|thumb|Officers of ELAS]]
[[File:Brodovi na ELAN.jpg|thumb|Ships of Greek People's Liberation Navy, WWII]]
The blowing up of Gorgopotamos bridge favored ELAS.&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, M. ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-1944'' (2001); Yale Nota Bene Books; p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, lots of the inhabitants of the villages of [[Central Greece]] became members of ELAS. Furthermore, people sympathised with the ELAS guerrillas because they weren't helped by the British in contrast with EDES. When 25 guerrillas deserted from ELAS, [[Aris Velouchiotis]] went to Epirus to threaten [[Napoleon Zervas]] not to come in touch with them. Later, the 25 deserters were arrested and executed in the village of Sperhiada. The winter of 1942, ELAS groups were formed in other Greek regions, like [[Thessaly]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. In Central Greece, [[Aris Velouchiotis]] succeeded to form a powerful semi-conventional army which could attack German and Italian forces. Aris became a legendary figure who imposed an iron discipline in ELAS. At the same time, some members of ELAS (Periklis, Tasos Leuterias, Diamantis, Nikiforos, Thiseas, Dimos Karalivanos, and Belis) have been distinguished during the battles. Aris Velouchiotis formed a group of 30–35 men, called "Mavroskoufides" (the "black caps"), who were his personal guards. During the winter of 1942–1943, new units of ELAS were composed in many regions of Greece. Some areas in the mountains of Central Greece passed from the control of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces to that of ELAS.

The leadership of ELAS followed a triadic form, from its top down to platoon level: the captain (''kapetánios''), elected by the men and the overall leader of the unit, the military specialist (''stratiotikós''), usually a regular Army officer, responsible for tactical planning and training, and the political leader (''politikós''), usually a KKE member, as EAM's representative. At its top, the General Headquarters of ELAS, these positions were filled by Aris Velouchiotis, Stefanos Sarafis and [[Andreas Tzimas]] (''[[nom-de-guerre]]'': Vasilis Samariniotis).

Two events of great importance took place in this period. KKE, after passing great difficulties, succeeded in reorganizing its groups destroyed by Metaxas. Lots of members were recruited and with the help of ELAS, which became the largest partisan army in Greece, EAM became the largest mass political organization in Greek history, claiming over 1.5 million members, enlisted in organizations that covered every neighborhood in every village. The second great event was the foundation of the [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth|United Panhellenic Organization of Youth (EPON)]] ({{lang-el|Ενιαία Πανελλαδική Οργάνωση Νέων}}). In 1943, a small naval auxiliary navy, the [[Greek People's Liberation Navy|Greek People's Liberation Navy (ELAN)]] was also founded.

Two years after its foundation, ELAS' military strength had grown from the small group of fighters in Domnitsa to a force of some 50,000 partisans (estimates of the British government) or even as many as 85,000, according to EAM sources; EAM itself, and its associated organizations, had grown to a membership of anywhere from 500,000–750,000 (according to [[Anthony Eden]]) up to two million, in a country of 7.5 million inhabitants.{{sfn|Stavrianos|1952|p=44}} ELAS was thus one of the largest resistance groups formed in Europe, similar to the French [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian Resistance]] and the Yugoslavian [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], but smaller than the Polish resistance.

==The "Mountain Government"==
{{main|Political Committee of National Liberation}}
On 10 March 1944 the EAM-ELAS, now in control of most of the country, established the ''[[Political Committee of National Liberation]]'' (PEEA), widely known as the "Mountain Government" ({{lang-el|Κυβέρνηση του βουνού|translit=Kyvérnisi tou vounoú}}), in effect a third Greek government to rival the collaboration one in Athens and the government-in-exile in Cairo. Its aims, according to its founding Act, were, "''to intensify the struggle against the conquerors (...) for full national liberation, for the consolidation of the independence and integrity of our country (...) and for the annihilation of domestic fascism and armed traitor formations.''"

PEEA was elected in liberated territories and in occupied ones by 2,000,000 Greek citizens. It was historically the first time that women could vote.
PEEA ministers covered a wide political spectrum from left to center.

==First Civil War==
{{see also|Greek Civil War}}
ELAS became the strongest of all resistance armed organizations, controlling by 1944 military three-fifths of the country (mainly the mountains) having in its ranks more than 800 military officers of the former National Army. ELAS engaged in battles against other resistance groups, besides the [[Security Battalions|para-military forces of the collaborationist government]]. ELAS initially began to attack the [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES) on accusations of collaboration with the Germans. ELAS attacked also the Panhellenic Liberation Organization (PAO), another resistance organization, concentrated in Northern Greece, in the area of Macedonia with accusations of collaboration. The armed power of the two major organizations was not comparable as EDES had approx. 12,000 guerrillas, while ELAS' power was much stronger. Small battles were taking place in Epirus where EDES had its main force. This situation led to triangular battles among ELAS, EDES and the Germans. Given the support of the British and the Greek Cairo Government for EDES, these conflicts precipitated a civil war. In October 1943 ELAS launched major attacks against EDES and the guerrilla group of Tsaous Anton in Northern Greece, precipitating a civil war across many parts of Greece which continued until February 1944, when the British agents in Greece negotiated a ceasefire (the [[Plaka agreement]]); ELAS broke the agreement by attacking the [[5/42 Evzone Regiment]], murdering the [[National and Social Liberation|EKKA]] resistance group leader, [[Dimitrios Psarros]], in as yet unclear and hotly debated circumstances and executing all the captives.

==Αftermath==
In autumn 1944, after the liberation, ELAS was the dominant force in the country and had captured all the major Greek cities, except [[Athens]] (after an agreement in Caserta with the Greek government in exile).

After the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' events, ELAS was disarmed, though later some of its fighters (mostly KKE members) joined the Democratic Army during the civil war.

==Hymn==
The hymn of ELAS was written in March 1944 by Sofia Mavroeidi-Papadaki and music by Nikos Tsakonas.

Με το τουφέκι μου στον ώμο,
σε πόλεις κάμπους και χωριά,
της Λευτεριάς ανοίγω δρόμο;
της στρώνω βάγια και περνά.

Εμπρός Ε.Λ.Α.Σ. για την Ελλάδα,
το Δίκιο και τη Λευτεριά;
σ’ ακροβουνό και σε κοιλάδα,
πέτα! πολέμα με καρδιά.

Ένα τραγούδι είν’ η πνοή σου,
καθώς στη ράχη ροβολάς,
και αντιλαλούν απ’ τη φωνή σου
καρδιές και κάμποι: ΕΛΑΣ! ΕΛΑΣ!

Παντού η Πατρίδα μ’ έχει στείλει,
φρουρό μαζί κι εκδικητή,
κι απ’ την ορμή μου θ’ ανατείλει
καινούργια λεύτερη ζωή.

Με χίλια ονόματα, μία χάρη,

I clear the road for Freedom;
I lay for Her bay-leaves and She passes.

March E.L.A.S. for Hellas,
the Right and Freedom;
in mountainpeaks and in valleys, 
fly! fight with your heart.

A song is your breath,
while in the ridge you walk,
and from your voice resound 
hearts and plains: ELAS! ELAS!

Everywhere the Homeland has sent me,
guard and a revenger too,
and from my impetus rises 
a new free life.

With thousand names one charm,

it's always the People itself.

==Constitutional guarantees==
{{see also|Constitution of Thailand}}

The 1997 constitution was abrogated in September 2006 following the [[2006 Thailand coup|military coup]]. The military regime imposed an interim constitution which was in effect until the 2007 version was approved a year later by referendum. The 2007 constitution was partially abrogated by the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|military regime that came to power in May 2014]] and replaced by an interim constitution in effect until the [[Constitution of Thailand#2016 constitution|new constitution]] was approved in 2016.

Many new rights were introduced in the 1997 constitution. These included the right to [[free education]], the rights of traditional communities, and the right to peacefully protest coups and other extra-constitutional means of acquiring power, the rights of children, the elderly, rights of the handicapped, and equality of the genders.

== Infringement of human rights ==
The [[U.S. Department of State]] has registered concerns in several areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dlid%3D186310#wrapper |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002154300/http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dlid=186310 |archivedate=2016-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human trafficking===
{{Main|Human trafficking in Thailand|Child prostitution in Thailand}}
Human trafficking is a major issue in Thailand.  This includes misleading and kidnapping men from [[Cambodia]] by traffickers and selling them into illegal fishing boats that trawl the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and the [[South China Sea]].  These men are promised better paid jobs but instead forced to work as sea slaves as much as 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=913&amp;catID=6 "Forced to Fish: Cambodia's sea slaves"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118165406/http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=913&amp;catID=6 |date=November 18, 2007 }}. ''The Guardian Weekly'', Jan. 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous international news organizations including [[The Guardian]], [[Associated Press|AP]], and [[The New York Times]] have extensively covered the topic; [[The Associated Press]], in particular, has won prominent [[George Polk Awards|awards]] for their coverage (although not without controversy for overstating their role in combating trafficking). 
Children trafficking is also another major issue in Thailand forcing kidnapped children as young as four to use as sex slaves in major cities like [[Bangkok]] and [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]].{{CN|date=January 2015}} Such activities are especially rife in rural areas of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;" New York Review", 25 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Instances of [[forced labor]] in the fish and shrimp industry as well as [[child labour]] in the pornography industry are still observed in Thailand and have been reported in the 2013 [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s report on the worst forms of child labor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/thailand.htm Thailand, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405161955/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/thailand.htm |date=April 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.

===Rights of the press and right to assembly===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2013}}
In the wake of the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006]] and [[2014 Thai coup d'état|2014 ''coup d'états'']], the right to free speech, association, and freedom of movement were seriously eroded. The military governments implemented a ban on political meetings and prohibited media criticism. Political activities of all types were banned.

The [[Southeast Asian Press Alliance]] ([http://www.seapa.wordpress.com SEAPA]) noted that Thailand's media environment—prior to the coup considered one of the freest and most vibrant in Asia—had quickly deteriorated following the military ousting of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. It noted the closure of around 300 community radio stations in Thai provinces, the intermittent blocking of cable news channels (particularly whenever news on Thaksin and criticism of the coup came up), and the suspension of some Thai websites devoted to discussing the implications of military intervention to Thai democracy. [http://www.seapa.wordpress.com SEAPA] also noted that while there seemed to be no crackdown on journalists, and while foreign and local reporters seemed free to roam, interview, and report on the coup as they saw fit, self-censorship was a certain issue in Thai newsrooms.

British journalist, Suzanne Buchanan, has reported on the recent string of tourist deaths and sexual assaults in [[Ko Tao]]. Though she has not been to Thailand in over two years, she is wanted by police who say she is peddling fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/world/asia/thailand-koh-tao-death-island.html|title=Thai Paradise Gains Reputation as ‘Death Island’|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Thailand insurgency===
Problems have been reported in the southern provinces related to the [[South Thailand insurgency]].  Some 180 persons are reported to have died there while in custody in 2004. In a particularly high-profile case, Muslim human rights lawyer [[Somchai Neelaphaijit]] was reportedly harassed, threatened, and finally [[forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]] in March 2004 following his allegations of torture by state security forces.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4134512.stm |title=Missing Thai lawyer 'harassed' |author= |date=9 August 2005 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] stated that he believed that Somchai was dead and that state security forces appeared to be responsible.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4608594.stm |title=Missing Thai lawyer 'harassed' |author= |date=13 January 2006 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five policemen were eventually charged in Somchai's death, though the trial only resulted in one conviction that was overturned on appeal in March 2011.&lt;ref name="BP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/226311/policeman-acquitted-insomchai-case |title=Policeman acquitted in Somchai case|author= |date=12 March 2011 |work= |publisher=''Bangkok Post'' |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was denounced by the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]],&lt;ref name="AHCR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/urgent-appeals/AHRC-UAU-017-2011 |title=THAILAND: Verdict on Somchai's case--his wife, daughter could not be plaintiffs; not enough evidence to convict accused |author= |date=17 March 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Asian Human Rights Commission]] |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Somchai's wife [[Angkhana Neelaphaijit|Angkhana]] declared her intention to continue to appeal the case to the Thai Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="BP" /&gt;

''[[The Economist]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Prison conditions and some provincial immigration detention facilities are characterized as poor. In 2004 more than 1,600 persons died in prison or police custody, 131 as a result of police actions.

[[The Nation (Thailand)|''The Nation'']] reported on 27 November 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Of 2,500 deaths in the government's war on drugs in 2003, a fact-finding panel has found that more than half was not involved in drug at all. At a brainstorming session, a representative from the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) Tuesday disclosed that as many as 1,400 people were killed and labelled as drug suspects despite the fact that they had no link to drugs....Senior public prosecutor Kunlapon Ponlawan said it was not difficult to investigate [[extra-judicial killings]] carried out by police officers as the trigger-pullers usually confessed.''"&lt;ref name="nation27nov2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle30nov2007"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 24 January 2008 edition of ''[[The Economist]]'' reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''...a panel set up last year by the outgoing junta recently concluded the opposite: over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, [[Surayud Chulanont]], took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for [[Human Rights Watch]], a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|PPP]] won last month's elections, those names were omitted.''&lt;ref name="economist24jan08"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported on 8 April 2003:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Since the death of 9-year-old Chakraphan, there have been frequent reports in the Thai press of summary executions and their innocent victims. There was the 16-month-old girl who was shot dead along with her mother, Raiwan Khwanthongyen. There was the pregnant woman, Daranee Tasanawadee, who was killed in front of her two young sons. There was the 8-year-old boy, Jirasak Unthong, who was the only witness to the killing of his parents as they headed home from a temple fair. There was Suwit Baison, 23, a cameraman for a local television station, who fell to his knees in tears in front of Mr. Thaksin and begged for an investigation into the killing of his parents. His stepfather had once been arrested for smoking marijuana, Mr. Suwit said. When the police offered to drop the charge if he would admit to using methamphetamines, he opted instead to pay the $100 fine for marijuana use. Both parents were shot dead as they returned home from the police station on a motorbike. Mr. Suwit said 10 other people in his neighborhood had also been killed after surrendering to the police.''&lt;ref name="NYtimes2003april8"/&gt;

Thailand has been a signatory to the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]] since 2 October 2007. Section 28 of the Thai 2016 constitution states, "A torture, [sic] brutal act or punishment by cruel or inhumane means shall be prohibited."&lt;ref name="OUNRC-2016" /&gt;

==Burmese refugees==

Burmese refugees in Thailand can stay in one of the refugee camps along the border with Burma, which protect them from arrest and summary removal to Burma but they lack freedom to move or work. Or, they can live and work outside the camps, but typically without recognized legal status of any kind, leaving them at risk of arrest and deportation. From 2005 to 2011, more than 76,000 Burmese refugees were resettled from the border camps to third countries, though the total number of camp residents has remained at about 140,000.

Camp refugees who venture out of the camps are regarded by the Thai government as illegal aliens and are subject to arrest. Thai police or paramilitaries regularly apprehend camp residents and either return them to camp if the refugees pay sufficient bribes, or send them to one of Thailand’s Immigration Detention Centers and then deport them to Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand refugees|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/109633/section/4|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand |url=http://www.arcrelief.org/site/PageServer?pagename=programs_Thailand# |work=American Refugee Committee |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814044255/http://www.arcrelief.org/site/PageServer?pagename=programs_Thailand |archivedate=August 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees in the camps find themselves subject to abuse and exploitation at the hands of other refugees.

One of Rhodesia's most important governmental departments, it was responsible for the welfare and development of the black African rural population. It played a significant role maintaining control of rural African villages during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].

Established by the [[British South Africa Company]] in 1894 as the Native Affairs Department, it was reconstituted in 1962 as the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It established administrative districts throughout Rhodesia. Each district was led by a white uniformed District Commissioner, who was assisted by a multiracial staff and security forces. As the Rhodesian Bush War began in the early 1970s, INTAF significantly expanded its security operations. It established a [[paramilitary]] force, the [[Guard Force]], which patrolled the rural areas. It also began [[intelligence-gathering]] and maintained the protected villages program. Upon [[Zimbabwe]]'s internationally recognised independence in 1980, INTAF was disestablished and was succeeded by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwean Ministry of Home Affairs]].

INTAF was led by the [[Minister of Internal Affairs (Rhodesia)|Minister of Internal Affairs]], who was appointed by [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia]] [[Ian Smith]]. [[William Harper (Rhodesian politician)|William Harper]] was the first Minister of Internal Affairs, and [[Rollo Hayman]] was the last.

==History==

=== Native Affairs Department, 1894-1962 ===
In 1894 the [[British South Africa Company]] established the Native Affairs Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodesianforces.org/InternalAffiars.htm |title=Ministry of Internal Affairs, Rhodesia |publisher=Rhodesianforces.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be responsible for the welfare of black Africans living on tribal trust lands in the colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]]. The Head of the Department was the Administrator in Council; beneath him was the Secretary for Native Affairs. Under the Secretary were the two Chief Native Commissioners of [[Matabeleland]] and [[Mashonaland]]. Under the Chief Native Commissioners were Native Commissioners, who were responsible for the administration of their tribal districts and sub-districts. They were assisted by Assistant Native Commissioners.&lt;ref name="whiteconquest"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe, 1884–1902|last1=Keppel-Jones|first1=Arthur|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ministry of Internal Affairs, 1962-1979 ===
In 1962, the Native Affairs Department was abolished by the [[Southern Rhodesia]]n government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YI3LDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1012&amp;dq=rhodesia+minister+of+internal+affairs+1978&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE_8-plfjVAhWH4IMKHZEyCpMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhodesia%20minister%20of%20internal%20affairs%201978&amp;f=false|title=The Statesman's Year-Book 1978-79|last=Paxton|first=J.|date=|publisher=Springer|year=1979|isbn=9780230271074|location=|pages=1012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of its duties were designated to the newly established Ministry of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exceptions were agricultural responsibilities, which were designated to the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Zimbabwe)|Ministry of Agriculture]], the administration of Native Purchase Areas, which was taken over by the [[Ministry of Mines and Lands (Rhodesia)|Ministry of Mines and Lands]], and local judicial functions, which were taken over by the [[Ministry of Justice (Zimbabwe)|Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following the [[Colonial Service#Ranks|ranks of the Colonial Service]], the ministry's Native Commissioners were renamed District Commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chiefs and Councils in Rhodesia: Transition from Patriarchal to Bureaucratic Power Heinemann|last=Weinrich|first=A. K. H.|publisher=|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the areas formerly known as Native Reserves and Special Native Areas were reclassified as Tribal Trust Land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[William Harper (Rhodesian politician)|William Harper]] was the first Minister of Internal Affairs beginning in 1964. In October of that year, he oversaw the ''[[indaba]]'' (conference) of chiefs and headmen at [[Domboshawa]] in October 1964, at the end of which the tribal leaders unanimously announced their support for Southern Rhodesia's independence, which was [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared]] on 11 November 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=So Far and No Further!

Harper was replaced as Minister of Internal Affairs by [[Lance Smith (politician)|Lance Smith]], another member of Ian Smith's ruling [[Rhodesian Front]] party. In 1970, he oversaw the implementation of the [[Land Tenure Act]], which divided Rhodesia's land into equal halves for the black and white populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law was controversial as Rhodesia's white population of around 200,000 was dwarfed by the black population of over four million. Smith also introduced plans for black Rhodesians to be required to carry identity cards when working outside of designated areas.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} These plans were defeated at the [[Rhodesian Front Congress]] in October 1971.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After the May 1972 [[Pearce Commission]] verdict against the provisional independence proposal, Smith advised black Rhodesians in June 1972 that they would have to rely on themselves to improve their position, and that external assistance would not be available.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His "provincialisation" plans, announced on 13 July 1972, were intended to shift control of tribal areas from the white government to African chiefs, thus trending towards separate development for blacks and whites.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} He also established the Tribal Trust Land Development Corporation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhodesianforces.org/IntafHonoursAwards.htm|title=INTERNAL AFFAIRS Honours and Awards 1967 - 1980|website=rhodesianforces.org|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith stepped down as INTAF minister in 1974.

Upon the dissolution of Rhodesia and the independence of [[Zimbabwe]] in 1980 through the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], INTAF was dissolved and replaced with the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwean Ministry of Home Affairs]].

== Organizational structure ==
INTAF was headed by the [[Minister of Internal Affairs (Rhodesia)|Minister of Internal Affairs]], who was assisted by the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eycdAQAAMAAJ|title=Nada: The Rhodesia Ministry of Internal Affairs Annual|last=|first=|date=1974|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=452|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personnel===
District Commissioners, Assistant District Commissioners and District Assistants were expected to be qualified in Rhodesian law, the customary law of the tribe they dealt with, and the tribal language (i.e. [[Shona language|Shona]] or [[Sindebele]]). As the Bush War placed pressure on Intaf, new District Assistants were recruited to serve for the duration of the war - these were called District Security Assistants. The security force of Intaf was known as the [[Guard Force]]. This was the descendant of the Matabele Native Police raised in 1894.

In 1975, with the security situation increasingly volatile, a training depot was set up at [[Chikurubi]] to ensure all new District Assistants and all members of the Guard Force had full military training. Training instructors were recruited from the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]]. Members of the Guard Force were mainly black volunteers, but also included white conscripts. The mainstay of National Servicmen were regular officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Administration cadet national servicemen were Cadet 1 and 2, District Officers and Assistant District Commissioners. Agricultural Officers and African Development Fund men were also National Servicemen trained at Chikurubi. Their training included drill, weapons, map reading, African Custmons and African Languages.

As well as providing security at villages, Guard Force personnel patrolled the surrounding area. According to the local situation and resources, this was done on foot, on bicycles, in motor vehicles, or on horseback. The utility of INTAF horse-mounted units led to the formation of [[Grey's Scouts]], an army horse-mounted unit, in 1975.

As the war progressed, Intaf formed an elite military branch called the Administrative Reinforcement Units (ARU); these consisted of eight troops (one for each province). The ARU were reinforced with volunteers seconded from the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]], [[Rhodesian Defence Regiment]], and [[Selous Scouts]].

Reservists called up for service with Intaf were generally allotted to units known as "echelons". There was one INTAF echelon for each province.

Intaf maintained light aircraft for transport and reconnaissance, of which one was shot down during the Bush War.

Members of INTAF initially wore a [[khaki]] uniform formerly worn by the Rhodesian Army with a [[red beret]] or a [[slouch hat]] with red puggaree, but later wore [[camouflage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Dudley|authorlink1=Dudley Wall|url=http://www.freewebs.com/dudleywall/intafrankinsignia.htm|website=Intaf Rank Insignia - Rhodesia|title=Intaf Rank Insignia - Rhodesia|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RhodInsignia&gt;{{Cite book|title = Insignia and History of the Rhodesian Armed Forces. 1890-1980.|edition=4th|last1 = Wall|first1 = Dudley|authorlink1=Dudley Wall|publisher = Just Done Productions Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-920315-53-5|location = Durban, South Africa|url = http://www.justdone.co.za/shop/index.php?id_product=18&amp;controller=product|publication-date=25 November 2009|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protected villages===
{{main|Rhodesian Bush War}}
Internal Affairs personnel played a prominent role in the war. They served at [[Joint Operations Command (Zimbabwe)|Joint Operational Centres]] and were involved in setting up the protected villages program. The paramilitary "Guard Force" later became responsible for security of the protected villages INTAF controlled this force.

== Budget ==
INTAF's expanded duties during the Rhodesian Bush War corresponded with a great increase in its budget. From the 1971–72 and 1977-78 budgets, the Rhodesian government's allocations to INTAF grew by 305%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaplAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|title=From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe: Behind and Beyond Lancaster House|last=Morris-Jones|first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">The '''Day of the African Child''' has been celebrated on June 16 every year since 1991,when it was first initiated by the OAU [[Organisation of African Unity]]. It honors those who participated in the [[Soweto uprising|Soweto Uprising]] in 1976 on that day. It also [[raising awareness|raises awareness]] of the continuing need for improvement of the education provided to African children.

In [[Soweto]], [[South Africa]], on June 16, 1976, about ten thousand black school children marched in a column more than half a mile long, protesting the poor [[educational equity|quality of their education]] and demanding their right to be taught in their [[mother language|own language]]. Hundreds of young students were shot, the most famous of which being [[Hector Pieterson]] (see image). More than a hundred people were killed in the protests of the following two weeks, and more than a thousand were injured.

On June 16 every year, governments, NGOs, international organisations and other stakeholders gather to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the full realization of the [[children's rights|rights of children]] Africa. For 2014, the theme chosen returns to the roots of the movement: ''A child-friendly, quality, [[free education|free]], and [[compulsory education]] for all children in Africa''

'''Kenneth Brian Mehlman''' (born August 21, 1966) is an American [[Social entrepreneurship|social entrepreneur]] and businessman. He serves as a member and global head of public affairs at global investment firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], and oversees the firm's responsible investment efforts, leading the firm's Environmental Social Governance programs. Prior to joining KKR, Mehlman spent a year as an attorney and partner at law firm [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld]].

Mehlman held several national posts in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[George W. Bush Administration]]. In 2000 he was appointed director of the White House Office of Political Affairs. Mehlman managed [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush's 2004 re-election campaign]], and was 62nd Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] from 2005–07. In 2007, Bush appointed Mehlman to a five-year term on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Scott|title=Mehlman to Join Holocaust Memorial Council|url=http://washingtonnote.com/mehlman_to_join/|accessdate=May 7, 2013|newspaper=Washington Note|date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 Mehlman announced that he would act as chairman of the [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]] Policy Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="CZI Facebook Post"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehlman|first1=Kenneth|title=Announcement of Chairmanship of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Policy Advisory Board|url=https://www.facebook.com/ken.mehlman/posts/10211770871571270|website=Facebook|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Mehlman [[Coming out|came out]] as [[gay]] in an interview with journalist [[Marc Ambinder]], making him one of the few prominent openly gay figures in the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Republican Leader Ken Mehlman Discloses That He Is Gay|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/us/politics/26mehlman.html|date=August 26, 2010|accessdate=August 26, 2010|first=Michael|last=Luo}}&lt;/ref&gt; After coming out, Mehlman advocated for the recognition of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="nyt-stolberg"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2013|first=Sheryl|last=Stolberg|title=Strategist Out of Closet and Into Fray, This Time for Gay Marriage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/us/strategist-out-of-closet-and-into-fray-this-time-for-gay-marriage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Mehlman was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He is one of two sons born to Judith and Arthur Mehlman. His father was director of MuniMae and a former partner at [[KPMG]], for which he was the head of the firm's auditing department in the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munimae.com/aboutMuniMae/directors.html |title=MuniMae: About MuniMae: Directors and Officers |publisher= |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021062341/http://www.munimae.com/aboutMuniMae/directors.html |archivedate=October 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehlman's brother, Bruce, works as a [[lobbyist]] at Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Justice|first=Glen|last2=Kornblut|first2=Anne|authorlink2=Anne Kornblut|title=For Lobbyists, the Hottest Parties Fall Outside the Official Lineup|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 17, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/17/politics/17lobbyists.html|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mvc-dc.com/index.php/the-team/108-bruce-mehlman |title=Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti: Bruce Mehlman |publisher=Mvc-dc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222205720/http://www.mvc-dc.com/index.php/the-team/108-bruce-mehlman |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehlman received his undergraduate degree in 1988 from [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], where he became a member of [[Phi Kappa Tau]]'s Xi chapter. He received his  [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1991, where he was a classmate of future President [[Barack Obama]].

==Career==
Mehlman practiced [[environmental law]] at [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1991 to 1994, when he became [[legislative director]] to Representative [[Lamar S. Smith]] of [[Texas's 21st congressional district]]. Mehlman served as Smith's legislative director from 1994 to 1996, and then as [[Chief of staff (United States Congress)|chief of staff]] to Representative [[Kay Granger]] of [[Texas's 12th congressional district]] from 1996 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former RNC Chair Ken Mehlman Returns to Akin Gump|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-rnc-chair-ken-mehlman-returns-to-akin-gump-52117847.html|website=PR Newswire|publisher=Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaller|first1=Thomas|title=All the President's Man|url=http://www.baltimoremagazine.net/2004/6/1/profile-on-ken-mehlman|work=Baltimore Magazine|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehlman served as field director for the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush]]. When Bush became president, Mehlman became director of the [[White House]] Office of Political Affairs. He managed the Bush re-election campaign in 2004. In January 2005, the [[American Association of Political Consultants]] gave Mehlman the "Campaign Manager of the Year" award for his management of the Bush/Cheney presidential ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Green (journalist)|title=The Pollies|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=March 7, 2005|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/07/050307ta_talk_green|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehlman joined [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co]] in 2008. He is KKR's Global Head of Public Affairs, helping assess and improve the companies in which KKR invests by engaging stakeholders &amp; leveraging geopolitical &amp; public policy trends. Mehlman also oversees the firm's global external affairs, including corporate marketing, regulatory affairs &amp; public policy, and communications. Mehlman leads KKR's [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|Environmental Social Governance]] (ESG) programs for the firm and its portfolio companies.&lt;ref name="KKR Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kkr.com/our-firm/leadership/ken-mehlman |title=KKR Senior Executives: Kenneth B. Mehlman |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his role at [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]], Mehlman is a trustee of New York's [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]], and Teach for America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trustees of The Mount Sinai Medical Center|url=http://www.mountsinai.org/about-us/leadership/boards-of-trustees|publisher=Mount Sinai Hospital|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], serves as chairman of the [[American Investment Council]] (previously the Private Equity Growth Capital Council), and is co-Chairman of the American Enterprise Institute's National Council. He is also a trustee and board member of [[Sponsors for Educational Opportunity]] (SEO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegcc.org/the-council/about-the-council/board-of-directors/ |title=PEGCC Board of Directors |publisher= |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seo-usa.org/about-seo/board-of-directors/ |title=SEO Board of Directors |publisher= |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehlman was appointed to the board of directors of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board in June, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alan-beller-and-ken-mehlman-join-sasb-board-of-directors-300278582.html |title=Alan Beller and Ken Mehlman Join SASB Board of Directors |publisher= PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2017, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] announced on [[Facebook]] that Mehlman and [[David Plouffe]] would be joining the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Mehlman will chair the philanthropy's public policy advisory board, which he stated in his official Facebook post will consist of "a diverse group of advisors and experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isaac|first1=Mike|title=Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Builds Political Muscle for Philanthropic Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/technology/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-builds-political-muscle-for-philanthropic-work.html|work=The New York Times|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ponnuru|first1=Ramesh|title=Ken Mehlman and David Plouffe Team Up at Chan Zuckerberg Initiative|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/443732/ken-mehlman-and-david-plouffe-team-chan-zuckerberg-initiative|work=National Review|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CZI Facebook Post" /&gt;

==Republican National Committee chairmanship==
Mehlman was Bush's choice to replace [[Ed Gillespie]] as the chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] and was elected to the post on January 19, 2005. Mehlman announced after the November 2006 general election that he would not seek re-election to another term as Republican National Chairman. One of his top deputies, RNC political Director [[Michael DuHaime]], announced in December 2006 that he would become campaign manager for [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign]].

Mehlman addressed the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) a full year before Bush addressed  the [[civil rights]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Texeira|first=Erin|title=Republican gains with minority voters threatened by offensive comments, missteps|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his address to the NAACP on July 14, 2005 in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Mehlman apologized for his party's failure to reach out to the black community in the aftermath of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], stating, "Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization... I am here as Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/07/15/gop_ignored_black_vote_chairman_says/ GOP ignored black vote, chairman says] – John Rundy, ''[[Boston Globe]]'', July 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/08/05/gop_presses_black_voters_for_a_chance/ GOP presses black voters for 'a chance'] – Joseph Williams, ''[[Boston Globe]]'', August 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mehlman's speech seemed to suggest a new approach towards the African-American community, most have considered the approach to be unsuccessful, with several polls indicating that Republicans have not improved in terms of African-American approval.  A ''[[Washington Post]]'' poll shows that Bush's approval rating among African Americans fell to two percent at one point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2005/10/13/BL2005101300885.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Polling Free-Fall Among Blacks | first=Dan | last=Froomkin | date=October 13, 2005 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a report card issued by the NAACP gave "F's" to a majority of Republicans in the [[109th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.naacp.org/page/-/washington%20bureau/109thCongress.pdf |title=NAACP Legislative Report Card, 109th Congress |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the head of the RNC, Mehlman played a key role, along with [[Karl Rove]], in executing the Republican Party's long-term, yet ultimately unsuccessful, plan for electoral dominance. This is discussed at length in [[Peter Wallsten]] and Tom Hamburger's book, ''[[One Party Country]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wallsten and Tom Hamburger, [http://www.onepartycountry.com One Party Country: The Republican Plan for Dominance in the 21st Century] (Wiley, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Mehlman voluntarily stepped down as chairman of the RNC at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|last=Balz|first=Dan|title=Mehlman Won't Seek Another Term as Republican Party Chief|date=November 10, 2006|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110901815.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Mike Duncan]] and [[Mel Martinez]].

== Phone jamming scandal==
{{main|2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal}}
A Democratic analysis of phone records introduced at the 2005 criminal trial of [[James Tobin (political operative)|James Tobin]], the Northeast political director for the RNC in 2002, shows that Mehlman made 115 outgoing calls – mostly to the same number in the White House office of political affairs – between September 17 and November 22, 2002, when the office of political affairs was headed by Mehlman. Two dozen calls were made from 9:28 a.m. the day before the election through 2:17 a.m. on the night after the voting, a three-day period. Virtually all the calls to the White House went to the same phone number. In April 2006, Mehlman issued a statement on the matter, noting that his deputy for the Northeast states routinely discussed election business with [[Republican National Committee|RNC]] officials, and categorically stated that "none of my conversations nor the conversations of my staff, involved discussion of the phone-jamming incident."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Granite+Status:+Meridian+to+guide+Coburn+race+for+governor&amp;articleId=1a0f8a86-a086-40a6-8963-65395f7767fc "Granite Status: Meridian to guide Coburn race for governor"] by John Distaso, UnionLeader.com, March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gop.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=6237 Statement From RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003828/http://www.gop.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=6237 |date=2007-09-28 }}, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] website, April 11, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; Tobin was convicted on December 15, 2005 "for his part in a plot to jam the Democratic Party's phones on Election Day 2002"; however, this conviction was later overturned by a federal appeals court and Tobin was acquitted on all charges.

==Coming out==
In August 2010, Mehlman [[coming out|revealed]] that he is [[gay]]. Prior to this revelation, rumors about Mehlman's [[sexual orientation]] had circulated since at least 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out and About to Get Ugly:How many closet cases does it take to reelect a president?|publisher=[[New York Press]]|url=http://www.nypress.com/article-10567-out-and-about-to-get-ugly.html|date=November 30, 2004|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, Mehlman denied he was gay, telling the ''[[New York Daily News]]'': "I'm not gay, but those stories did a number on my dating life for six months."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arktimes.com/Articles/ArticleViewer.aspx?ArticleID=6e81b5b3-7dc3-4847-9756-1ee8cee7c71b "Six appeal; plus: Is 'gay' a dirty word?"] by David Koon, ''[[Arkansas Times]]'', November 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2006, comedian [[Bill Maher]] made an appearance on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', during which he referred to Mehlman as a [[closeted]] gay man. The incident became controversial because CNN edited out Maher's comments in later taped editions and removed the reference to Mehlman's sexual orientation from the transcript of the show. The day after Maher's comments, Mehlman announced he would step down as chairman of the RNC (although reports said that his resignation had been expected for some time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/09/mehlman.steppingdown|work=CNN|title=Mehlman stepping down as Republican Committee Chair – CNN.com|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost four years later, in an article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Mehlman stated that he is in fact gay, and that he planned to be an advocate for legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Mehlman's "announcement makes him apparently the most prominent Republican official to come out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Republican Leader Ken Mehlman Discloses That He Is Gay|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/us/politics/26mehlman.html|date=August 26, 2010|accessdate=August 26, 2010|first=Michael|last=Luo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disclosure followed years of him avoiding and denying inquiries about his sexual orientation. During his RNC chairmanship, Mehlman supported certain positions of the Republican Party, including opposition to same-sex marriage. Mehlman stated he could not have gone against party consensus, but acknowledged that, had he come out of the closet earlier, he might have been able to impact Republican efforts to pass state initiatives and referenda banning same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|authorlink=Marc Ambinder|title=Bush Campaign Chief and Former RNC Chair Ken Mehlman: I'm Gay|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=August 25, 2010|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/08/bush-campaign-chief-and-former-rnc-chair-ken-mehlman-im-gay/62065/|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
Marc Ambinder, who interviewed Mehlman and wrote ''The Atlantic'' article, said that Mehlman's roles with the RNC and the Bush campaign "coincided with the Republican Party's attempts to exploit anti-gay prejudices and cement the allegiance of social conservatives".&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; A few commentators, such as [[Cenk Uygur]] and [[Michael Rogers (blogger)|Michael Rogers]], criticized Mehlman on ''[[The Ed Show]]'', for having remained closeted about his sexuality while active in politics. Rogers has long advocated for the forced [[outing]] of closeted gay politicians who vote or advocate against LGBT interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&amp;orgId=574&amp;topicId=100007220&amp;docId=l:1249827687&amp;start=1|title=THE ED SHOW for August 26, 2010 (transcript)|publisher=MSNBC (via LexisNexis)|date=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some segments of the LGBT community expressed support for Mehlman. [[Dustin Lance Black]], the Academy Award-winning writer of ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]],'' said, "Ken represents an incredible coup for the American Foundation for Equal Rights ... As a victorious former presidential campaign manager and head of the Republican Party, Ken has the proven experience and expertise to help us communicate with people across each of the 50 states."&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; Stephen Petrow, former president of the National Lesbian &amp; Gay Journalists Association, wrote in a Huffington Post column, "... the 43-year old Mehlman found the courage to be honest about his identity with family,  friends, former colleagues and current colleagues [who have] been wonderful and supportive." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-petrow/in-defense-of-ken-mehlman_b_695409.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Steven|last=Petrow|title=In Defense of Ken Mehlman: Former GOP Chair Is No Roy Cohn|date=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund]] President and CEO Chuck Wolfe said in a public statement, "We hope the fact that Ken Mehlman has reached this level of honesty will now encourage other political leaders to reject divisive anti-gay campaign tactics..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaypolitics.com/2010/08/25/breaking-victory-fund-responds-to-former-rnc-chairmans-coming-out/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909104249/http://www.gaypolitics.com/2010/08/25/breaking-victory-fund-responds-to-former-rnc-chairmans-coming-out/ |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex marriage advocacy==
In June 2011, Mehlman lobbied Republican members of the New York state legislature to support the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York and reached out to conservative donors and operatives.&lt;ref name=Beast&gt;Samuel P. Jacobs, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/25/bush-republican-party-leader-ken-mehlman-unlikely-hero-of-new-york-s-gay-marriage-vote.html "Gay Marriage's Unlikely Hero"], ''The Daily Beast'', June 22, 2011; accessed July 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehlman often spoke with undecided GOP senators, including three of the four who eventually voted in favor of the bill.&lt;ref name=Beast/&gt; Mehlman, who gained the support of many gay-rights backers, discussed the political and ideological reasons why lawmakers should vote for the bill. He said, "Letting two adults who love each other get married strengthens and promotes families."&lt;ref name=nydaily&gt;Celeste Katz. [http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/06/former-rnc-chairman-ken-mehlman-pushes-legalization-of-same-sex-marriage-in-al "Former RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman Pushes Legalization Of Same-Sex Marriage In Albany"], ''New York Daily News'', June 25, 2011; accessed July 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Mehlman told GOP senators that legalizing same-sex marriage aligned with Republican interests and principles. He emphasized that polls showed a significant shift toward voter support of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=nydaily/&gt; Four Republican senators voted for the [[Marriage Equality Act (New York)|Marriage Equality Act]].&lt;ref name=Beast/&gt;

Several gay rights leaders and bloggers recognized Mehlman's role.&lt;ref&gt;David Mixner [http://www.davidmixner.com/2011/06/the-daily-beast-gay-marriages-unlikely-hero.html "The Daily Beast: Gay Marriage's Unlikely Hero" at DavidMixner.com], June 26, 2011; accessed July 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Aravosis [http://gay.americablog.com/2011/06/republicans-including-ken-mehlman.html "Republicans, including Ken Mehlman, played key role in NY marriage victory – Dems beware"], AmericaBlog.com, June 27, 2011; accessed July 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mehlman was honored in ''[[Out Magazine]]''{{'s}} 2011's Out100 list partially because of his work on the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;''Out Magazine'' [http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100/2011/12/11/17th-annual-out100#slide-6 "17th Annual Out100: Ken Mehlman, Politician"], November 7, 2011; accessed March 12, 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt; Mehlman has been active in Maryland, New Hampshire and Washington State, helping to raise almost $3 million for these campaigns between August 2010 (when he "came out") and March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Nagourney and Brook Barnes.

Windsor]]'', the 2013 [[SCOTUS|United States Supreme Court]] decision which held that same-sex marriage is constitutional, by aiming to show GOP leaders why same-sex marriage "is consistent with Republican and conservative principles", and speaking on that topic throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Garrahan. [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/df0a0d86-d5b5-11e1-a5f3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz21aQjYji3 "Rich donors back gay marriage"], ''Financial Times'', July 24, 2012; accessed July 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Mehlman launched a non-profit organization called Project Right Side &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/21/ken-mehlman-marriage-equality_n_2170864.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Ken Mehlman Launches Project To Build Conservative Support For Marriage Equality | date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on convincing more Republicans to support marriage equality. The organization also conducts research and analysis in an effort to improve political conditions for LGBTQ issues. He stated that "Conservatives don't need to change core convictions to embrace the growing support for equal rights for gay Americans. It is sufficient to recognize the inherent conservatism in citizens' desire to marry, to be judged on their work, and not to be singled out for higher taxes or bullying at school. These objectives can be achieved while also protecting religious liberty, as demonstrated by states enacting civil marriage with exemptions for religious institutions."

In January 2013, also before ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', Mehlman spoke with political activist David Kochel{{Who|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- updated July 2015, Kochel is an Iowa activist who is campaign-chair of the Jeb Bush 2016 nationwide effort, but does not yet have a wikipedia article --&gt; in Iowa about how supporting same-sex marriage is a conservative value. He stated that, "I'm a conservative because I believe in more freedom and I believe in less government. I think that we are endowed by our Creator, not by politicians, not by government, not by bureaucrats, with inalienable rights, including the pursuit of happiness. If you believe that, what could be more central to the pursuit of happiness than choosing the person that you love, that you have the right to marry?"&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Hall [http://theiowarepublican.com/2013/mehlman-kochel-support-of-same-sex-marriage-is-conservative/ "Mehlman, Kochel: Support of Same-Sex Marriage is Conservative"], ''The Iowa Republican'', January 29, 2013; accessed January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Mehlman was a keynote speaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard LGBTQ Conference Speakers|url=http://www.lgbtqconferenceatharvard.org/speakers.html|publisher=Harvard LGBTQ Conference|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222132342/http://www.lgbtqconferenceatharvard.org/speakers.html|archivedate=2014-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the first campus-wide [[Harvard]] LGTBQ conference on the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots where he was interviewed by [[Baruch Shemtov]]. He spoke during the closing remarks of the conference, stating "there's nothing more powerful than coming out and being who you are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=EdLuna|author=Ed|number=430095755635085313|date=2 February 2014|title="There's nothing more powerful than coming out and being who you are"  -Ken Mehlman #HarvardLGBTQConf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don't Ask, Don't Tell legislation===
Mehlman supported the repeal of the  "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" military policy introduced during [[POTUS|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]'s tenure. In 2010, Mehlman lobbied ten U.S. Senators to repeal the policy.&lt;ref name=Beast/&gt;

===Amicus brief===
In February 2013, Mehlman helped organize an [[amicus curiae]] brief to the Supreme Court in the case of [[California Proposition 8]] signed by dozens of prominent socially moderate Republicans, including [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]], [[Meg Whitman]], [[Ken Duberstein]], [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]], and others, explaining that they supported a Constitutional right to same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Socarides [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/ken-mehlmans-republican-gay-marriage-mission.html "Ken Mehlman's Gay-Marriage Mission"], ''The New Yorker'', February 26, 2013; accessed February 27 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', Ken Mehlman spent "months in quiet conversations with fellow Republicans to gather signatures for the brief." "We are trying to say to the court that we are judicial and political conservatives, and it is consistent with our values and philosophy for you to overturn Proposition 8," said Ken Mehlman according to the New York Times report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sheryl|last=Stolberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/us/politics/prominent-republicans-sign-brief-in-support-of-gay-marriage.html|title=Republicans Sign Brief in Support of Gay Marriage|work=New York Times|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 legislative elections ===
{{main|French legislative election, 2017}}
[[File:Emmanuel Macron in July 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emmanuel Macron]]]]
La République En Marche! ran candidates in most constituencies. At least half its candidates came from civil society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Législatives dans le Gers : rapidité, efficacité ?! |url=https://www.lepetitjournal.net/32-gers/2017/05/23/rapidite-efficacite/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other half having previously held political office and half were women. No double investitures were permitted, though Macron waived the original requirement of prospective candidates to leave their previous political party on 5 May 2017.&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite news |title=Législatives: les candidats de "La République en marche" investis d'ici à jeudi |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/elections/legislatives-les-candidats-de-la-republique-en-marche-investis-d-ici-a-jeudi_1906237.html |newspaper=L'Express |date=8 May 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to those parameters, Macron specified in his initial press conference on 19 January that he would require that candidates demonstrate probity (disqualifying any prospective candidates with a [[criminal record]]), political plurality (representing the threads of the movement) and efficacy. Those wishing to seek the endorsement of République En Marche! had to sign up online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nathalie Raulin |title=Macron lance un appel à ses "marcheurs" pour les investitures aux législatives |url=http://www.liberation.fr/elections-presidentielle-legislatives-2017/2017/01/19/macron-lance-un-appel-a-ses-marcheurs-pour-les-investitures-aux-legislatives_1542650 |newspaper=Libération |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement received nearly 15,000 applications.

When dealing with nominations sought by those in the political world, the party considered the popularity, establishment and media skills of applicants, with the most difficult cases adjudicated by Macron himself. To present themselves under the label of La République En Marche!, outgoing deputies had to leave the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) or [[the Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] (LR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=William Galibert |title=Élections législatives : un comité d'investiture déjà à l'oeuvre dans le camp d'En Marche! |url=http://www.europe1.fr/politique/elections-legislatives-un-comite-dinvestiture-deja-a-loeuvre-dans-le-camp-den-marche-3311846 |publisher=Europe 1 |date=26 April 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macron previously said the legislative candidates would have to leave the PS before they could join République En Marche! in the election.&lt;ref name="valeursactuellesdejafaceases"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.valeursactuelles.com/politique/emmanuel-macron-deja-face-ses-incoherences-82921 |title=Emmanuel Macron déjà face à ses incohérences |date=8 May 2017 |work=Valeurs actuelles |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, then La République En Marche! spokesperson [[Christophe Castaner]] later said they could stay in the PS as long as they supported Macron.&lt;ref name="valeursactuellesdejafaceases" /&gt; Moreover, spokesperson [[Jean-Paul Delevoye]] said the members of civil society could be mayors or members of [[Regional council (France)|regional councils]] and [[Departmental councils (France)|departmental councils]].&lt;ref name="valeursactuellesdejafaceases" /&gt;

After [[François Bayrou]] endorsed Macron in February, the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] (MoDem), which he leads, reserved 90 constituencies for MoDem candidates (running under the label of La République En Marche!), of which 50 were considered{{by whom|date=June 2017}} winnable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Législatives: accord MoDem-En marche! |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2017/05/05/97001-20170505FILWWW00222-legislatives-accord-entre-modem-et-en-marche.php |newspaper=Le Figaro |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2017, the secretary general of the presidency announced the appointment of [[Édouard Philippe]], a member of LR, as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-edouard-philippe-french-pm-20170515-story.html |title=Day 1 for French President Macron: visit to Germany and naming of prime minister |date=15 May 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=15 May 2017 |issn=0458-3035 |quote=[...] the announcement of Philippe's appointment, delivered by the presidency's new secretary general, took just eight seconds.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By winning an absolute majority in the National Assembly in the second round of the elections on 18 June 2017, La République En Marche! became France's [[party of power]] in support of the President.

== Finance ==
Christian Dargnat, former general director of [[BNP Paribas]] Asset Management, leads the La République En Marche! financial association.&lt;ref name="Point0516"&gt;{{cite web |title=Macron en marche ?

In 2016, Georges Fenech, a deputy of [[The Republicans group (National Assembly)|The Republicans]], alerted the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] that the association had continued fund raising even during Macron's trip to London. This led Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] to issue an official denial even though En Marche! had already done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manuel Valls recadre sèchement Emmanuel Macron en direct sur les bancs de l'Assemblée nationale |url=http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/manuel-valls-recadre-sechement-emmanuel-macron-en-direct-sur-les-bancs-de-l-assemblee-nationale-7783178598 |website=rtl.fr |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macron declared in May 2016 that 2,000 donors had already contributed financially to En Marche!.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4091">== Cassius and Verginius ==
The first attempted land reforms in the Roman Republic occurred in 486 BC under the consulships of [[Spurius Cassius Viscellinus]], and [[Proculus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus]]. After winning a war against the [[Hernici]] to the south, the consul Cassius attempted to pass a bill granting two-thirds of the Hernicians' land to the plebs, and Latin allies, with one half going to each. This bill would take some land owned by patricians and place it under public domain. The patricians immediately opposed this bill. Livy states this was the first and only proposal of land reform which did not immediately throw Rome into violence. The consul Verginius opposed this bill, and subsequently backed by the Patricians. &lt;ref&gt;Livy 2.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Now both consuls, backed by plebeian and patrician alike, vied for the neutral body of Romans. Verginius hurled accusations that Cassius was a secret ally of the Hernicians by allowing them to keep 1/3 of their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 2.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Verginius proposed the land be distributed only among the Roman citizens, and none should go to the Latin allies who assisted in taking it. Cassius replied by promising to give the Romans whatever Sicilian corn they received for free, yet this was seen as a bribe and only raised their suspicions of him. This move ruined his reputation and marked him for death. &lt;ref&gt;Livy 2.41&lt;/ref&gt;

In 485 BC Cassius' and Verginius' terms ended as consul. Cassius was put to death. He was charged with treason by two quaestors Caeso Fabius and Lucius Valerius. He was found guilty of this charge by the people and his house was burned to the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Livy 2.41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outcomes ===
The plebeians quickly forgot about the land they had yet to receive when the patrician senate halted payment to the soldiers who fought in the following war against the Volscians and Æquans. The land was sold off by the consul Quintus Fabius and most likely bought up by the wealthier patrician class.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 2.42&lt;/ref&gt; This event planted the seeds for hundreds of years of plebeian-patrician antagonism.

== Gracchus Reforms ==
The '''Gracchus reforms''' were [[land reform]]s attempted in the [[Roman Republic]] in the 2nd century BC. They are explained in detail in the following pages:

* [[Tiberius Gracchus]] - the tribune who initiated the reforms in 133 BC, but was murdered by the Senate.
* [[Gaius Gracchus]] - his brother - who tried to resume Tiberius' reforms in 123 BC, but was also murdered in 121.

=== Outcomes ===

The Gracchian reform had no permanent effect, for they did nothing to change the conditions giving rise to land concentration in the first place. Some of the reform laws were soon repealed, while others continued but with weakened effects over time. Land problems plagued the Romans for all times thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0899462189 | title = The Story of Land - | trans-title = A World History of Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform | last1 = Powelson | first1 = John | year = 1987 | publisher = [[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]] | location = Cambridge, MA, USA | page = 37  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appian adds that within 15 years, all of the progress  done under the Gracchi had been overturned and the poor were in a much worse position than ever before, many reduced to unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars, 1.27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Servilius Rullus ==
Under [[Cicero]]'s term as Consul in 63 BC, [[Servilius Rullus]] proposed a land reform bill. Cicero opposed this and the Senate voted it down.

== Caesar ==
During [[Julius Caesar]]'s first day as Consul in 59 BC, he proposed a bill similar to Rullus'. This is detailed in the article about the [[First Triumvirate#Caesar’s consulship (59 BC)|First Triumvirate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

The free meal is always vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; People sit on the floor, eat together, and the kitchen is maintained and serviced by Sikh community volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark McWilliams|title=Food &amp; Material Culture: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yj8QDgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-909248-40-3|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the langar, all people eat a vegetarian meal as equals. The exception to vegetarian langar is when Nihang Sikhs (such as those at the Chhauni of [[Akali Phula Singh]]) serve meat (called ''mahaprasad'') on special occasions.&lt;ref name="Mahaprasad"&gt;"The most special occasion of the Chhauni is the festival of Diwali which is celebrated for ten days. This is the only Sikh shrine at Amritsar where Maha Prasad (meat) is served on special occasions in Langar."

==Etymology==
''Langar'' is a Persian word and came into Punjabi from it.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Seidel, ''[http://www.superluminal.com/cookbook/essay_serving_love.html Serving Love]'', ''Serving the Guest: A Sufi Cookbook", September 2000.

==Origins==
[[Langar (Sufism)|Langar]], as an institution, was first started by [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Baba Farid]], a Muslim of the [[Chishti Order|Chishti]] [[Sufi]] order.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=L2l56GzQ7d0C&amp;pg=PA45|title=Epilogue, Vol 4, Issue 1 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBQgAAAAMAAJ|title=Baba Sheikh Farid: His Life and Teaching|page=7|last1=Talib|first1=Gurbachan Singh|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of the langar was already popular in the 12th and 13th century among [[Sufi|Sufis]] (Muslim mystics) of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The practice grew and is documented in the ''Jawahir al-Faridi'' compiled in 1623 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara D Metcalf|title=Moral Conduct and Authority: The Place of Adab in South Asian Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5-vzVq8hdkC  |year=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04660-3|pages=336–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later, both the institution and term, adopted by Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6fI7AQAAIAAJ|title=Transactions, Volume 4|publisher=Indian Institute of Advanced Study|author=R.

==History==
In Sikhism, the practice of the ''langar'', or free kitchen, is believed to have been started by the first Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]]. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status. The second Guru of Sikhism, [[Guru Angad]] is remembered in Sikh tradition for systematizing the institution of langar in all Sikh temple premises, where visitors from near and far, could get a free simple meal in a communal seating.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ|date=March 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p35"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=8 August 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the third Guru, [[Amar Das]], who established langar as a prominent institution, and required people to dine together irrespective of their caste and social rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eleanor Nesbitt |title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD8SDAAAQBAJ |date=28 April 2016 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-106277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged the practice of langar and made all those who visited him attend laṅgar before they could speak to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duggal|first=Kartar Singh|authorlink=Kartar Singh Duggal|year=1988|title=Philosophy and Faith of Sikhism|publisher=Himalayan Institute Press|isbn = 978-0-89389-109-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally a [[Vaishnavite]] (and thus vegetarian), and is said to have accompanied [[Guru Angad]] to a langar that served meat. When Guru Angad saw that Amar Das was nervous and sat aloof, he ordered the server to give Amar Das only cereals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal |title=The History of Sikh Gurus|publisher=Lotus Press|location=New Delhi|year=2006|page=38|chapter=3 Guru Amar Das |isbn=978-81-8382-075-2 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhGkVkhUuqoC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Sikh langars serve vegetarian food though the [[nihang]]s of [[Anandpur Sahib]] do serve meat on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Holla Mohalla | website=singhsabha.com | date=2009-04-12 | url=http://www.singhsabha.com/holla_mohalla.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412033124/http://www.singhsabha.com/holla_mohalla.htm | archive-date=2009-04-12 | dead-url=yes | access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[libertarianism|Libertarian]] perspectives on [[affirmative action]]''' consistently coincide with the way that libertarians view the state as a coercive power. Many libertarians believe that the state should not be used as an instrument of power in enforcing what they call positive discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adamsmith.org/research/think-pieces/good-and-bad-objections-to-positive-discrimination/ | title=Good and bad objections to positive discrimination | publisher=Adam Smith Institute | date=26 June 2013 | accessdate=16 February 2015 | author=Southwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
One point of view considers libertarianism as being compatible with affirmative action. [[Associate professor]] of [[political science]] Andrew Valls from [[Oregon State University]] writes in a paper titled "The Libertarian Case for Affirmative Action" that "libertarianism underwrites calls for black reparations, and that affirmative action policies can be seen as a partial payment on reparations that are owed African Americans", in what Valls references as "the principle of justice in rectification", a term originally created by [[Robert Nozick]] in his book, [[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2217833/The_libertarian_case_for_affirmative_action | title=The Libertarian Case for Affirmative Action | accessdate=16 February 2015 | author=Valls, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view contradicts the mainstream view of many libertarian think tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Discrimination, Affirmative Action, and Equal Opportunity | publisher=The Fraser Institute | author=[[Gary Becker|Becker, Gary]]; [[Thomas Sowell|Sowell, Thomas]]; [[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut, Kurt, Jr.]] | year=1982 | pages=156 | isbn=0-88975-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of view that coincides with mainstream views that many libertarians share is "the use of racial classifications in public policies, including in affirmative action policy, pose[s] a great threat to individual liberties." &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron Raymond. "Affirmative Action at Work: Law, Politics, and Ethics" University of Pittsburgh, 1991. pp. 188-190. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many libertarians claim that restrictions placed on private sectors violate certain individual rights and liberties. Libertarians often oppose intervention, especially by governments, of any kind in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lp.org/platform/ | title=2016 Platform | publisher=Libertarian Party | date=May 2016 |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Bernstein, a Foundation Professor at [[George Mason University]], argues that [[anti-discrimination law]] should at the very least be scrutinized, a main reason being that "...Antidiscrimination laws are unlikely to provide much protection to a minority group when the majority of the voting population is hostile to that group." &lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David. "Context Matters: A Better Libertarian Approach to Antidiscrimination Law." Cato Institute, 2010. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Bernstein, even with anti-discrimination laws in place, the majority population is no more inclined to change previously held perceptions of the minority population, eliciting little to no change.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David. "Context Matters: A Better Libertarian Approach to Antidiscrimination Law." Cato Institute, 2010. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another main reason why libertarians tend to oppose affirmative action is due to the [[macroeconomics]] issues the policy presents. Llewellyn Rockwell, a libertarian author and editor, references Steven Yates' book, "Civil Wrongs: What Went Wrong With Affirmative Action" &lt;ref&gt;Yates, Steven. "Civil Wrongs: What Went Wrong With Affirmative Action." ICS Press, 1995. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as an example as to why affirmative action is a policy that libertarians tend to not support. Additionally, Rockwell argues that anti-discrimination laws such as affirmative action is "an inefficient use of labor and intellectual resources." Rockwell reasons that individuals should be hired or accepted to a university based on merit rather than having to be subjected to affirmative action laws. Because affirmative action laws tend to require a certain quota of majority versus minority individuals being hired or accepted, Rockwell argues that it is possible for an individual belonging to a majority would be rejected in favor of another individual belonging to a minority.

Marie Gryphon argues that affirmative action can cause more harm to minority groups than good. "A phenomenon called the "ratchet effect" means that preferences at a handful of top schools, including state flagship institutions, can worsen racial disparities in academic preparation at all other American colleges and universities, including those that do not use admissions preferences." &lt;ref&gt;Gryphon, Marie. "The Affirmative Action Myth." Cato Institute, 2005. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this "ratchet effect", Gryphon argues that the disparity between the majority and minority populations are only worsened due to affirmative action policies. Often, advocates of affirmative action argue that "college has helped many minority students achieve middle-class lives" &lt;ref&gt;Gryphon, Marie. "The Affirmative Action Myth." Cato Institute, 2005. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "without preferences colleges would become "re-segregated," depriving American students of the educational benefits of a diverse student body." &lt;ref&gt;Gryphon, Marie. "The Affirmative Action Myth." Cato Institute, 2005. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas. "Affirmative Action around the World: An Empirical Study." New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004. p. 159. Retrieved December 05, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Gryphon also argues that preferences, especially racial, harms "students of all races by impeding learning and generating unnecessary suspicion and distrust between groups."

This is a '''list of the''' 30 '''constituencies''' currently represented in the '''[[Parliament of Barbados|Parliament]]''' of [[Barbados]], as at the February 2013 [[Barbadian general election, 2013|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/members_of_parliament.php |title=List of members of the Parliament |accessdate=2012-01-13 |year=2008 |work=The website of the Parliament of Barbados |publisher=Parliament of Barbados |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204131910/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/members_of_parliament.php |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2018}} From 1971, each constituency has been represented by a single [[Member of Parliament]] (MP). The number of seats were increased from 28 to 30 just ahead of the [[Barbadian general election, 2003|2003]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/the_house_of_assembly.php |title=The House of Assembly |accessdate=2012-01-13 |date=2009-12-30 |work=The Parliament of Barbados |publisher=The Parliament of Barbados |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109040432/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/the_house_of_assembly.php |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After Barbados was settled by the [[Kingdom of England]], a House of Burgesses was established to conduct the business of governance in the colony along with the Governor.  From an early date, if not the beginning, there were two members of the House of Assembly for each parish; in 1843 two members were added for Bridgetown, bringing the total to 24 Members. In 1971 dual representatives for each constituency were abolished in favour of single seat ridings and the entire island was divided into 24 constituencies.  In 1981 three more constituencies were created; thus bring the total to 27.  By the election of 1991 a 28th was added, and finally ahead of the 2003 general election two more were added bringing the national total to 30.  As of 2011 the Electoral and Boundaries Commission decided that no new constituencies would be needed.[https://web.archive.org/web/20111129035339/http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/no-new-constituency-seat/] However, there was a subsequent call made by the media that St. Philip-South's population was now too large and was disproportionate to all other constituencies.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120108101207/http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/too-many-st-philip-south-voters] Despite the call, Barbados held the 2013 elections without adding any new constituencies.

'''Magic Lantern''' is [[keystroke logging]] [[software]] developed by the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).  Magic Lantern was first reported in a column by [[Bob Sullivan (journalist)|Bob Sullivan]] of [[MSNBC]] on 20 November 2001&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341694/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/fbi-software-cracks-encryption-wall/ | title = FBI software cracks encryption wall | first = Bob | last = Sullivan | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = 2001-11-20 | accessdate = 2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Ted Bridis of the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ted Bridis. "FBI Develops Eavesdropping Tools," ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
Magic Lantern can reportedly be installed remotely, via an [[e-mail attachment]] or by exploiting common [[operating system]] [[Vulnerability (computer science)|vulnerabilities]], unlike previous [[Keystroke logging|keystroke]] logger programs used by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/07/fbi_spyware?currentPage=all FBI's Secret Spyware Tracks Down Teen Who Made Bomb Threats] July 18, 2007 ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525010032/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/07/fbi_spyware?currentPage=all |date=May 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E6DF1430F932A05751C1A9679C8B63 |title=Threat of Terrorism On U.S. Infrastructure |date=December 31, 2001 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been variously described as a [[Computer virus|virus]] and a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]].  It is not known how the program might store or communicate the recorded keystrokes.

==Purpose==
In response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request filed in 2000 by the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], the FBI released a series of [[Classified information|unclassified]] documents relating to [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], which included the "Enhanced Carnivore Project Plan".  Sullivan's confidential source said that redacted portions of that document mention "Cyber Knight", 

{{quote|a [[database]] that sorts and matches data gathered using various Carnivore-like methods from [[e-mail]], [[chat room]]s, [[instant messages]], and [[Internet phone]] calls. It also matches files with captured [[encryption]] [[Key (cryptography)|keys]].}}

==Example deployment method==
The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an [[e-mail attachment]]. When the attachment is opened, it installs a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa121401a.htm |title=FBI Has a Magic Lantern |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spokesmen for the FBI soon confirmed the existence of a program called Magic Lantern.  They denied that it had been deployed, and they declined to comment further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0222,hentoff,35142,6.html Article in] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512042648/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0222%2Chentoff%2C35142%2C6.html |date=2006-05-12 }} the ''[[Village Voice]]'', 24 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antivirus vendor cooperation ==
The public disclosure of the existence of Magic Lantern sparked a debate as to whether anti-virus companies could or should detect the FBI's keystroke logger.

Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utopia.csis.pace.edu/dps/2007/jkile/2005%20-%20Spring/DCS823/Spyware/01016895.pdf |title=Invasive Software: Who's Inside Your Computer? |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=George Lawton |publisher= |date=July 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024630/http://utopia.csis.pace.edu/dps/2007/jkile/2005%20-%20Spring/DCS823/Spyware/01016895.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=266 |title=The FBI's "Magic Lantern" Shines Bright |publisher=kaspersky.com |date=2001-12-11 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridis reported that [[Network Associates]] (maker of [[McAfee]] anti-virus products), had contacted the FBI following the press reports about Magic Lantern to ensure their anti-virus software would not detect the program.{{citation needed|reason=Provided link is dead|date=March 2015}} Network Associates issued a denial, fueling speculation as to which anti-virus products might or might not detect government trojans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,48648,00.html Article in] ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', 29 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

CNET News has surveyed 13 security companies about their contacts with and level of cooperation with law enforcement authorities. None of them confirmed that their products cover up gov-installed malware.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://archive.is/20130119143114/http://news.com.com/Security+firms+on+police+spyware,+in+their+own+words/2100-7348_3-6196990.html CNET News - Security firms on police spyware, in their own words], 17 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from [[Sophos]], said "We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn't know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=William |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/17572-1.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910214651/http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/17572-1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-10 |title=Antivirus vendors are wary of FBI's Magic Lantern&amp;nbsp;– Government Computer News |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2001-12-06 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reaction from this came from Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security who states: "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh |first=Declan |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-7348-6197020.html?tag=tb |title=Will security firms detect police spyware?&amp;nbsp;– CNET News |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if Magic Lantern would need a court order to deploy, FBI spokesman Paul Bresson would not comment, stating: "Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/~rfrost/courses/SI110/readings/Privacy/Magic_Lantern.pdf |title=FBI Confirms 'Magic Lantern' Project Exists |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=Elinor Mills Abreu |publisher=At Home Corporation |date=December 31, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091820/http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu/courses/SI110/readings/Privacy/Magic_Lantern.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v15/15HarvJLTech521.pdf |title=THE CASE FOR MAGIC LANTERN: SEPTEMBER 11 HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR INCREASED SURVEILLANCE  |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=Christopher Woo &amp; Miranda So |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, unlike [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]], a predecessor to Magic Lantern, since physical access to a computer would require a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/other/Etzioni.doc |title=IMPLICATIONS OF SELECT NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=Amitai Etzioni |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology|year=2002 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the media coverage of Magic Lantern, [[F-Secure]] (a Finnish anti-virus company), announced their policy on detecting government spying programs: "F-Secure Corporation would like to make known that we will not leave such backdoors to our F-Secure Anti-Virus products, regardless of the source of such tools. We have to draw a line with every sample we get regarding whether to detect it or not. This decision-making is influenced only by technical factors, and nothing else, but within the applicable laws and regulations, in our case meaning EU laws.

We will also be adding detection of any program we see that might be used for terrorist activity or to benefit organized crime. We would like to state this for the record, as we have received queries regarding whether we would have the guts to detect something obviously made by a known violent mafia or terrorist organization. Yes we would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F-Secure Corporation's policy on detecting spying programs developed by various governments|url=http://www.f-secure.com/virus-info/bdtp.shtml|publisher=F-Secure|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marta Salgado''' (born 1947) is an [[Afro-Chilean]] activist who focuses on promoting cultural preservation and civil rights protections for the African diaspora. She has founded several non-governmental organizations to promote women's and minority rights and served as a government advisor in these areas. Trained as a teacher and public administrator, she has written books and articles on the legacy of Africans in Chile.

==Early life==
Marta Victoria Salgado Henríquez was born on 23 March 1947 in [[Arica, Chile]]{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}} to Marta Henríquez Corvacho and Santiago Salgado Cano. Her family, which includes her brother, Santiago, and sister, Sonia{{sfn|May|2014}}{{sfn|''University of Tarapacá News''|2013}} were of [[African diaspora|African descent]].{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}} She grew up in Arica, an area in which the majority of descendants of African slaves who arrived during the colonial period lived. Her [[mulatto]] parents experienced the government's objectives to "Chileanize" the region which had previously been part of [[Peru]]. Those residents who refused to nationalize as Chileans, were pushed out through forced emigration and those who remained, attempted to hide their ancestry to blend into the larger society.{{sfn|May|2014}} 

After completing her secondary education, Salgado earned a degree in preschool education from the [[Universidad de Chile]] (UC). She furthered her education at the [[Universidad de Tarapacá]] (UTA), acquiring a degree in [[public administration]] and completed postgraduate studies at UC earning certificates in [[community organization]], gender, and planning and development.{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}}

==Career==
Salgado began her career as a teacher in the in state universities of the [[Arica y Parinacota Region|Arica-Parinacota region]]{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}} and spent forty-one years as a professor at UTA.{{sfn|''University of Tarapacá News''|2013}} During her time at the university, Salgado was active in the creation of the Women’s Movement of the North and the founding of the National Women’s Service ({{lang-es|Servicio Nacional de la Mujer}}) to address domestic violence, and civil protections for women. Work with these organizations has resulted in legislation for the protection of women. She was a co-founder, and served as president for four terms, of the Universidad de Tarapacá' workers' union, as well as a similar organization, Federation of State University Employees of the North ({{lang-es|Federación de Trabajadores de las Universidades Estatales del Norte}}) for employees at other state institutions. Salgado was a participant in the twenty-four commissions held during 1994 and 2000 by the government of Arica to create the administrative region of Arica-Parinacota.{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}} 

In 2001, Salgado founded the [[non-governmental organization]] Oro Negro (Black Gold), the first in the country to advocate for the inclusion of populations of African descent in public policies, which include both anti-discrimination and official recognition as an ethnic group with the legal protections that entails.{{sfn|May|2014}}{{sfn|Duconge|Guizardi|2014}} From the founding of the organization, she coordinated folklore group of Oro Negro, attending conventions and meetings regarding the African diaspora throughout the Caribbean and [[Latin America]].{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}} By creating networks with activists in places as far flung as [[Bolivia]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Ecuador]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Honduras]], [[Morocco]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]], Salgado recognized that the problems of recognition were similar. Governments recognize the "Slave Route" as an educational and tourist-worthy part of the cultural heritage, but not the people themselves.{{sfn|Duconge|Guizardi|2014}} Salgado pressed for the government to take a census of the Afro-Chilean population, as well as to sponsor programs to destigmatize participation in events designed to promote their culture, sensitizing the public to their right to have their ethnic identity protected.{{sfn|Duconge|Guizardi|2014}}{{sfn|Castillo|2015}} Between 2004 and 2008, Salgado was a member of the consulting committee of the Chilean Advisory Panel on Culture and the Arts ({{lang-es|Consejo de la Cultura y las Artes}}), as a representative of the Afro-Chilean community.{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}}  

After more than a decade of pressuring the government, to prepare a statistical analysis of the Afro-Chilean community, Salgado and other activists were successful in obtaining a regional survey in 2011, but not in gaining national inclusion in the federal census as an ethnic minority.{{sfn|Castillo|2015}} Her chapter "El legado africano en Chile" was published in the book ''Conocimiento desde adentro: Los afrosudamericanos hablando de sus pueblos y sus historias'' (2010), edited by Sheila Walker and her own publication ''Afrochilenos: Una historia oculta'' occurred in 2013.{{sfn|Navarrete|Cussen|2016}}{{sfn|Duconge|Guizardi|2014}} In 2016, Salgado was recognized with the governmental award from the Department of Cultural Heritage of the National Council for Culture and the Arts as Best Cultural Heritage Manager in the Region of Arica and Parinacota.{{sfn|Portal Patrimonio|2016}}

The '''murder of Ann Ogilby''', also known as the "Romper Room murder",&lt;ref name="anthology1507"/&gt; took place in [[Sandy Row]], south [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] on 24 July 1974. It was a punishment killing, carried out by members of the Sandy Row women's [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) unit. At the time the UDA was a legal [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] paramilitary organisation. The victim, Ann Ogilby,&lt;ref name="simpson29"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wood59"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Protestant]] single mother of four, was beaten to death by two teenaged girls after being sentenced to a "rompering" (UDA slang term for a torture session followed by a fatal beating) at a [[kangaroo court]]. Ogilby had been having an affair with a married UDA commander, William Young, who prior to his [[internment]], had made her pregnant. His wife, Elizabeth Young, was a member of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit. Ogilby had made defamatory remarks against Elizabeth Young in public regarding food parcels. Eight weeks after Ogilby had given birth to Young's son, the women's unit decided that Ogilby would pay for both the affair and remarks with her life. The day following the kangaroo court "trial", they arranged for the kidnapping of Ogilby and her six-year-old daughter, Sharlene, outside a Social Services office by UDA man Albert "Bumper" Graham.

A group of UDA women then followed the minibus which brought Ogilby and Sharlene to a disused bakery in Hunter Street, Sandy Row; this empty building had been converted into a UDA club and "romper room". After Sharlene was sent by Graham to a shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was made to sit on a bench and a hood placed over her head. Two teenagers, Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith, acting on the orders previously given them by the unit's leader, Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas, proceeded to savagely beat Ogilby to death with bricks and sticks. As Ogilby screamed and pleaded for her life, Sharlene, who had already returned from the shop, overheard her mother being beaten and killed. A later autopsy report revealed that Ogilby had sustained 24 blows to the head and body, 14 of which caused a "severe fracture to the bulk of the skull".

Within weeks of the killing, ten women and one man were arrested in connection with the murder. They were convicted in February 1975. All but one, a minor whose sentence was suspended, went to prison. The murder caused widespread revulsion, shock and horror throughout Northern Ireland and remained long in the public psyche even at a time when bombings and killings were daily occurrences. The Ann Ogilby murder was investigated by the [[Historical Enquiries Team]] (HET) which was established by the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) to investigate the most controversial killings carried out during [[the Troubles]].

==Events leading to the murder==

It was structured along military lines with brigades, battalions, companies, platoons and sections.

Peter Taylor. p.199]. The UDA remained legal until 10 August 1992 when it was proscribed by the British Government.&lt;/ref&gt; Young came from the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Ormeau Road|Donegall Pass]] area and was a local UDA commander.&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beltel2013"&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/debateni/blogs/ann-ogilby-was-beaten-to-death-by-a-gang-of-uda-women-why-would-they-come-forward-and-tell-all-now-29834789.html "Ann Ogilby was beaten to death by a gang of UDA women - why would they come forward and tell all now?"

When Young was [[Operation Demetrius|interned]] inside the [[Maze Prison]] in 1973,&lt;ref name="kiely106" /&gt; she often visited him. He complained that his estranged wife, Elizabeth never sent him food parcels, despite her having been provided with money by the [[Loyalist Prisoners' Association]] (LPA).&lt;ref name="simpson37"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LPA was unaware of the Young couple's estrangement.&lt;ref name="kiely106"/&gt; The delivery of food parcels by women to imprisoned members was a long-established practice by the UDA and a "particular source of pride for the organisation".&lt;ref name="mcevoy14"&gt;McEvoy, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilby was required to make up and send him the food parcels herself which she felt was an imposition as these had to come out of her own money, although she was almost destitute.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt; When Ogilby mistakenly repeated Young's complaint in a [[Sandy Row]] pub, the local Sandy Row women's UDA unit (of which Elizabeth was a member) overheard her words and became violently angry, especially as Elizabeth was able to prove that she had been sending her husband food parcels.&lt;ref name="simpson37"/&gt; Ogilby's comments were regarded by the women's UDA as a grievous insult to its integrity, as the unit was responsible for the assembly and distribution of the parcels. The group was already antagonistic due to Ogilby's affair with Young, and her defamatory remarks only added fuel to their wrath.&lt;ref name="simpson37" /&gt; The women considered her behaviour in public immoral, ostentatious, and extremely unconventional because she frequented clubs and pubs on her own instead of with female friends which was the custom in Sandy Row. Furthermore, they believed her loud, outspoken and maverick personality, status as an unmarried mother, and habit of what was described by a local as "flaunting herself" was a cultural infraction that brought shame upon their community.&lt;ref name="mcevoy16"/&gt;

[[File:Loyalist mural south Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandy Row]], south Belfast, where loyalist paramilitaries have always had a strong presence since the early days of [[the Troubles]]]]

===Social milieu===
Sandy Row is an [[Ulster Protestant]] working class enclave just south of [[Belfast city centre]] closely affiliated with the [[Orange Order]] whose [[The Twelfth|12 July]] parades are gaudy, elaborate events made notable by the traditional Orange Arches erected for the occasion.&lt;ref name="murphy288"&gt;Murphy, Dervla (1979). ''A Place Apart''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. p.288 {{ISBN|0 140050302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to late 20th-century urban redevelopment beginning in the 1980s, rows of 19th-century terraced houses lined the streets and backstreets that branched off the main commercial thoroughfare. Loyalist paramilitaries have had an active presence there since the early days of [[the Troubles]]. By 1974, the violent ethno-political conflict waged between the Protestant [[Ulster Unionism|unionists]] and Catholic [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] was six years old and showed no sign of abating; bombings, shootings, sectarian murders, intimidation, security alerts and military patrols were a daily feature of life in Belfast and the rest of Northern Ireland. There was no family in working-class areas of Belfast that remained unscathed by the Troubles or insusceptible to the effects of the disorder, tension and carnage.&lt;ref name="mcevoy13"&gt;McEvoy, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s bombing campaign had escalated sharply in 1972 and began to increasingly target [[Belfast city centre]], often with lethal consequences such as on [[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]] on 21 July 1972, when the Provisional IRA exploded 22 bombs across the city, killing nine people and injuring over 100. This led to the erection of steel gates, manned by the British Army, thus effectively putting a security cordon or "ring of steel" around the city centre,&lt;ref name="clarke171"&gt;Clarke, R.V.G; Newman, Graham R. (2006). ''Outsmarting the Terrorists''. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Publishing Group.171 {{ISBN|0-275-99230-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in both Protestants and Catholics retreating further into segregated neighbourhoods, which rapidly fell under the sway of local paramilitary groups who exerted a strong influence in their respective districts.&lt;ref name="nelson126"&gt;Nelson, Sarah (1984). ''Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict''. Belfast: Appletree Press. p.126&lt;/ref&gt; These groups also assumed the role of policing their communities and rooting out what they described as anti-social elements. In the February 1974 edition of ''Ulster Loyalist'', a UDA publication, the UDA warned that it intended to take firm action against teenaged criminals and vandals in the Sandy Row and [[Donegall Road|Village]] areas.&lt;ref name="wood13"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fisk]], Belfast correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' between the years 1972-75, regarded the Sandy Row UDA as having been one of the most truculent of all paramilitary outfits in Belfast.  Their bellicose stance over the street barricades they erected during the [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] in May 1974 almost led them into direct confrontation with the British Army and they had even made preparations to fight if the latter had smashed the UDA roadblocks. The Sandy Row UDA's commander during this volatile period was Sammy Murphy who used as his headquarters the local Orange Hall.&lt;ref name="fisk145148"/&gt; In addition to Sandy Row, Murphy had overall command of the [[UDA South Belfast Brigade|South Belfast UDA]] and was referred to as a community leader in the British Army's press releases although his name and paramilitary affiliation were not mentioned.&lt;ref name="mcdonald31"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Cusack|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wood32"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; To defuse the explosive situation, Murphy engaged in talks with the Army which proved successful.&lt;ref name="fisk145148"&gt;Fisk, Robert (1975). ''The Point of No Return: the strike which broke the British in Ulster''. London: Times Books. pp.145-148&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalists [[Henry McDonald (writer)|Henry McDonald]] and Jim Cusack, the Sandy Row and Donegall Pass UDA were almost completely out of control by this time; both the male and female members were caught up in violence and drunkenness and already inured to beatings and killings. Drinking clubs or [[shebeens]] where alcohol was obtained cheaply were common features in the area.&lt;ref name="mcdonald5758"/&gt;  Author [[David M. Kiely]] suggested that by this stage the women's unit was more about gangsterism and mob rule than adhering to a political cause.&lt;ref name="kiely103"&gt;{{harvnb|Kiely|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandy Row unit was not the only women's unit within the UDA. There was a particularly active women's group on the [[Shankill Road]] which had been established by [[Wendy Millar (loyalist)|Wendy "Bucket" Millar]] as the first UDA women's unit.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Iain|title=Plea for calm as UDA faction heads south; The 40 loyalists forced out of Belfast for Scotland have decided it is time to move on|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23527846.html|publisher=''The Herald'' via [[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=14 February 2003 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the members were highly visible due to the [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairstyles]] they typically wore.&lt;ref name="taylor136"&gt;Taylor, Peter (1999). ''Loyalists''. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, Plc. p.136 {{ISBN|0-7475-4519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although  each unit was independent of the others,&lt;ref name="mcevoy12"/&gt; Jean Moore and later [[Hester Dunn]] served as the overall leaders of the UDA's women's department at the UDA headquarters in Gawn Street, east Belfast.&lt;ref name="dillon232"&gt;Dillon, Martin; Lehane, Denis (1973). ''Political murder in Northern Ireland''. Penguin. p.232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wood94"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanya Higgins and Nancy Brown Diggs observed in their book ''Women Living in Conflict'' that the loyalist paramilitary women were "angrier and more militant" than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="higgins2060"&gt;Higgins, Tanya; Diggs, Nancy Brown (2000). ''Women Living in Conflict''. ''Women's Studies28''. pp-20-60&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis was provided by Sandra McEvoy in her report ''Women Loyalist Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland: Duty, Agency and Empowerment - a Report from the Field'' in which she suggested that by joining paramilitary groups like the UDA, loyalist women were provided with a sense of freedom and personal and political power that had previously been denied them in the domestic sphere; furthermore by taking up "the gun", the women proved they were willing to go to prison for their beliefs and the loyalist cause.&lt;ref name="mcevoy10"&gt;McEvoy, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The commander of the Sandy Row women's unit was Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas, described by Kiely as having revered power above everything else in her life. As leader of that particular unit she exerted a great deal of control over the lives of other women within the area that included intimidation and moral policing. The middle of three daughters, Douglas was born and raised in an impoverished working-class family. She married at the age of 17 and had four children.&lt;ref name="kiely108"&gt;{{harvnb|Kiely|2005|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974, Douglas (aged 40) who lived in a terraced house in Sandy Row's City Street had a criminal record dating back over ten years for various offences which included smuggling, forgery, assault, inflicting bodily harm and running a brothel. When Ogilby had publicly denounced the women's UDA over the food parcels, she was not fully aware of Douglas' violent character and the considerable amount of authority she wielded in Sandy Row.&lt;ref name="kiely108"/&gt;

===Kangaroo court===
On 23 July 1974, eight weeks after Ogilby gave birth to a premature son, Derek, fathered by Young,&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; five UDA women, including her lover's wife Elizabeth Young (32), Kathleen Whitla (49, the second-in-command), Josephine Brown (18), Elizabeth Douglas (19), led by the latter's mother, commander Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas, abducted Ogilby from a friend's house in the Suffolk housing estate. They took her back to Sandy Row and put her before a [[kangaroo court]] held inside the disused Warwick's Bakery in 114 Hunter Street between Felt Street and Oswald Street, which had been converted into a UDA club.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson36"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilby had often frequented the club with Young on previous occasions prior to his internment; according to Kiely she had enjoyed the company of the other patrons and being part of the camaraderie of loyalists "against the Fenians".&lt;ref name="kiely111"&gt;{{harvnb|Kiely|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of eight women and two men presided over this "trial"; Elizabeth Young, however, had by then absented herself as she was not part of Douglas' "Heavy Squad". The "Heavy Squad" were the members of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit who meted out [[punishment beating]]s by Douglas' orders. Ogilby was grilled for an hour over her affair with Young and regarding her calumnies over the food parcels. At some stage, Douglas told her, "We have rules here. We all stick to them and I expect anybody new to do the same".&lt;ref name="kiely109"&gt;{{harvnb|Kiely|2005|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilby, by now frightened at the predicament in which she found herself, was additionally informed that if found guilty, she would be subjected to a "rompering". The notorious UDA "romper rooms" had been invented in the early 1970s by UDA North Belfast Brigadier [[Davy Payne]].&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/death_in_details_1_654840 "Death in Details". ''The Scotsman''. Simon Pia. 10 July 2003] Retrieved 26 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Named after the [[Romper Room|children's television programme]], these "romper rooms" were located inside vacant buildings, warehouses, lock-up garages, and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. Once inside, a victim would be "rompered" (beaten and tortured) before being killed. Although most of the victims were Catholics, many Protestants were also consigned to the "romper rooms".&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;Nelson, Sarah (1984). ''Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict''. Belfast: Appletree Press. pp. 26, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the UDA women having found Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men present at the "trial" couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where she got on a bus headed for the [[YWCA]] hostel she had moved to on the [[Malone Road]]. The women then "rearrested" her. It was alleged that this decision came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, "Who does she think she is? The Queen?" which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson37"/&gt; Blocking the bus as it pulled out of the station into the street, Douglas and her "Heavy Squad" then boarded the bus and dragged her off into the waiting car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). Although Douglas claimed they were on their way to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas,&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt; Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that "It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around".&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt; The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas came from City Street, Henrietta Piper Cowan came from Teutonic Street, Josephine Agnes Brown from Blythe Street; located in Sandy Row. The others had Sandy Row addresses as well with the exception of Christine Kathleen Smith who lived in Tates Avenue, which  is in the neighbouring Village area and Kathleen Whitla of Howard Street South in Donegall Pass. [ref: Ciaran Barnes. ''Andersonstown News'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt; Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiely110"&gt;{{harvnb|Kiely|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Romper room" beating==
That same Wednesday 24 July 1974 at 3:30 pm, outside the Social Services office in [[Donegall Road|Shaftesbury Square]], Ogilby and her daughter were kidnapped by 25-year-old UDA man Albert "Bumper" Graham, while members of Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas' "Heavy Squad" waited at the nearby Regency Hotel lounge bar overlooking the office. They knew beforehand that Ogilby had an appointment that afternoon at the Shaftesbury Square office. Using the pretext that a UDA commander wished to speak with her, Graham was able to abduct Ogilby and her daughter Sharlene as they left the office; Ogilby, taken in by Graham's words, willingly got into his blue minibus.&lt;ref name="simpson38"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having made a pre-arranged signal to the watching women, Graham drove the two females away to the UDA club in Hunter Street, Sandy Row, which had been turned into a "romper room". When the UDA women, led by Douglas, arrived on the scene, Ogilby tried to escape, but was grabbed and forcibly detained. After Graham sent Sharlene to a corner shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was ordered by Douglas to be dragged inside the former bakery and forced upstairs to the first floor where she was made to sit on a wooden bench, blindfolded and a hood placed over her head.&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mckittrick468"&gt;McKittrick, David (1999).''Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children Who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles''. Mainstream. p.468&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, Ogilby was so intimidated and terrorised by the "Heavy Squad", she no longer put up any resistance.&lt;ref name="simpson41"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="richards134"&gt;Richards; A. P. (2003). ''Irish Murders''. Geddes &amp; Grosset. p.134&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunday Life'' newspaper suggested that she was bound to a chair instead of a bench. Ciarán Barnes, a journalist writing for the paper, had conducted an interview with Sharlene Ogilby in 2010.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; Retired RUC detective, Alan Simpson, who devoted a chapter to the Ann Ogilby murder in his 1999 book ''Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles'', instead affirmed that Ogilby was forced by her captors to sit on a wooden bench. Although hooded and blindfolded, her hands remained untied.&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt;

Acting under earlier instructions by Douglas, who had remained downstairs, to give Ogilby a "good rompering",&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiely111"/&gt; two members of the "Heavy Squad", teenagers Henrietta Piper Cowan (17) and Christine Smith (16),&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiely111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt; both of whom were wearing masks, proceeded to attack Ogilby. Cowan punched her forcefully in the face, knocking her to the floor.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt; Ogilby was then kicked in the face, head, and stomach by both girls before blows from sticks were rained down upon her. When the two teenagers began battering Ogilby's face and head with bricks,&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mckittrick468"/&gt; Albert Graham and "Heavy Squad" member Josephine Brown (who was also masked), saw Ogilby's blood staining the hood and realising things had gone too far, started to panic and remonstrated with the girls to discontinue the beating.&lt;ref name="simpson38" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kiely112"&gt;{{harvnb|Kiely|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan and Smith did stop, to smoke cigarettes and make plans to attend a disco that evening.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcdonald57"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Cusack|2003|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson suggested that during the attack, Ogilby had placed her hands inside the hood in a futile attempt to protect her face from the force of the bricks.&lt;ref name="simpson38"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Ogilby's daughter, Sharlene, had returned from the shops; she entered the club, climbed the stairs to the first floor and began banging on the door and crying for her mother. Although by this stage Ogilby had sustained severe head injuries from the brutal assault, Sharlene heard her screaming and pleading with her assailants for mercy while they danced to blaring disco music.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt; Ignoring the injured woman's pleas for her life and Sharlene's cries,  Henrietta Cowan, once again wielding a brick, resumed beating Ogilby on the head with renewed vigour until she lay dead on the floor.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiely112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson39"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beating session had lasted for over an hour.&lt;ref name="kiely112"/&gt; Ogilby received (according to the later autopsy report) a total of 24 blows to the head and body with a blunt object, 14 of which had caused "a severe fracture to the bulk of the skull".&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;

Albert Graham took Sharlene out of the building and drove her back to the YWCA hostel; as he left her on the doorstep he reassured the little girl that her mother was inside waiting for her. Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead;&lt;ref name="kiely112"/&gt; the body was then wrapped up in a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to have a drink with Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time.&lt;ref name="simpson39"/&gt; Afterwards, Cowan and Smith got dressed up and went out to the disco as planned.&lt;ref name="kiely112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcdonald57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson40"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immediate aftermath===
[[File:The M1 at Stockman's Lane, Belfast (8) - geograph.org.uk - 1346810.jpg|thumb|left|The [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] at Stockman's Lane close to where Ann Ogilby's body was found]]
Douglas arranged for the body's disposal and unnamed UDA men later loaded it onto a van and dumped it in a ditch in Stockman's Lane near the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]].&lt;ref name="simpson39"/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Although Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas admitted to the CID that she made the necessary arrangements for the disposal of Ann Ogilby's body, she refused to give the names of the men who carried out the removal. Ciaran Barnes alleged that Sandy Row UDA commander Sammy Murphy (now deceased) was involved. [ref="Sunday Life''. Ciaran Barnes]&lt;/ref&gt;   It was discovered five days later on 29 July by motorway maintenance men. The RUC were immediately called to the scene which was then photographed and mapped. Ogilby, clad in a red jumper, grey trousers and wearing just one shoe, was lying on her back partly submerged in 18&amp;nbsp;inches of stagnant water with her blackened and battered face visible and her arms outstretched. Her missing shoe and a large brown sack were discovered not far away from her body at the top of the ditch.&lt;ref name="simpson3233"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no identifying documents found on her. The press, along with local television and radio news bulletins, released details regarding her physical appearance and the distinctive rings on her fingers. Hours later, a social worker from the Shaftesbury Square Social Services office, who had been scheduled to meet with Ann Ogilby on 24 July, contacted the RUC telling them that Ogilby and her daughter Sharlene had arrived at the office late for the appointment but left without explanation before the social worker could speak with Ann. She informed the RUC that Ogilby had not been seen since that afternoon.&lt;ref name="simpson33"/&gt; The social worker was then taken to the mortuary where she confirmed that the dead woman inside was Ann Ogilby. One of Ogilby's brothers later positively identified her.&lt;ref name="simpson34"/&gt; The police were told Sharlene was in the care of Social Services.&lt;ref name="simpson33"/&gt;

Due to the location of the body, the murder investigation was allocated to the RUC B Division (West Belfast), based at the [[Springfield Road, Belfast|Springfield Road]] station where [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] Detective Alan Simpson served. He formed part of the CID team set up to investigate the Ogilby killing.&lt;ref name="simpson32"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sharlene was located in a children's home, she was interviewed by a female detective; she clearly remembered the events of 24 July. It was arranged for Sharlene to accompany three CID detectives in a car to Sandy Row and she was able to direct them to the disused bakery in Hunter Street. A [[Scenes of Crime Officer]] was sent to the scene to examine the building's interior and collect the evidence. Forensics later showed that the bloodstains police detectives found on the floor and on the items retrieved from inside the UDA club matched Ogilby's blood group.&lt;ref name="simpson3637"&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1999|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents were also found on the premises bearing William Young's name. By that time the suspects had already been rounded up and taken in for interrogation. These were the eight women who had been inside the car with Ogilby on the evening of 23 July following the fracas outside the Glengall Street bus station.&lt;ref name="simpson36"/&gt;
[[File:Ann Ogilby grave.jpg|thumb|right|Ann Ogilby's grave at Umgall Cemetery]]

Ogilby, aged 31 or 32 at the time of her death,&lt;ref name="wood59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt; was buried in Umgall Cemetery, [[Templepatrick]], [[County Antrim]]. Her children Sharlene and Derek were put into care. The Ogilby family received only £149 compensation from the State to cover her funeral expenses.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; It was later revealed that Ogilby had planned to relocate to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland as soon as her infant son, Derek, was released from hospital (on account of his premature birth).&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

===Reactions===
Ogilby's murder caused widespread revulsion and shock throughout Northern Ireland, even though it had taken place during the most turbulent period of the Troubles when bombings and sectarian killings had become commonplace.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; Protestants were especially appalled that Ogilby, herself a Protestant, had become a victim of loyalist violence and angrily denounced the UDA.&lt;ref name="wood59"/&gt; Journalist Ciarán Barnes described it as being one of the most brutal murders of the Troubles; adding that its sheer savagery and the fact that it was carried out by women against another woman within earshot of her child left a lasting impression upon the public psyche.&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt; The UDA leadership had not sanctioned the killing;&lt;ref name="wood59"/&gt; and there was general condemnation from the UDA prisoners inside the [[Maze Prison]].&lt;ref name="wood59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sales71"&gt;{{harvnb|Sales|1997|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ian S. Wood, the UDA's commander [[Andy Tyrie]] had not sufficient control over the many units that comprised the UDA to have been able to prevent the punishment beating from being carried out.&lt;ref name="wood59"/&gt; A spokesman for the UDA released a statement condemning the killing and the women's unit that carried it out which was first published in the ''Irish Times'' on 8 February 1975:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have completely disowned them [Sandy Row women's UDA]. We think the whole affair was foul and sickening. Ogilby was cleared by the UDA of an allegation about her private life long before she was killed. The killing was an act of jealousy by a group of women.&lt;ref name="mcevoy16"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the Ogilby attack, the Sandy Row women's UDA unit was permanently disbanded by the UDA leadership.&lt;ref name="sales71"/&gt; None of the other UDA women's units had consented to or been aware of the fatal punishment beating until it was reported in the news. Additionally, the Sandy Row women's unit notwithstanding, UDA "romper rooms" were more commonly used by male members of the organisation than by their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="mcevoy12"&gt;McEvoy, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Journalists Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack described Ogilby's death as typical of the "brutish ...  culture" that dominated the UDA and other paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. In reference to this attack and other cases of "rompering", the authors argue that "rape and the beating and humiliation of women in working-class Belfast was as routine as gunfire but was subsumed in the maelstrom of violence engulfing the North".&lt;ref name="mcdonald5758"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Cusack|2003|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convictions===
[[File:ArmaghPrison.jpg|thumb|right|Former [[Armagh (HM Prison)|Armagh Women's Prison]]. Ann Ogilby's killers were imprisoned here after being convicted of her murder. Albert Graham was sent to the [[Maze Prison]].]]
Within weeks of the killing, the RUC had arrested ten women and one man in connection with the murder; this group contained Douglas' entire "Heavy Squad".&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; Most of the women were unemployed and at least three had male relatives imprisoned for paramilitary offences.&lt;ref name="mcevoy18"&gt;McEvoy, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 1975 at the Belfast City Commission, teenagers Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith pleaded guilty to murder. They were now aged 18 and 17 respectively. Characterised as having been "without feeling or remorse", they were convicted of carrying out the murder and sentenced to be detained at [[Armagh (HM Prison)|Armagh Women's Prison]] for life at the pleasure of the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson40"/&gt; Smith was not the only member of her family to be involved in loyalist paramilitary activity. Her elder brother, prominent South Belfast UDA member Francis "Hatchet" Smith (28), was shot dead in Rodney Parade, off [[Donegall Road]], by the IRA in January 1973 after he, as part of a UDA unit, gunned down Peter Watterson, a 15-year-old Catholic boy, in a drive-by sectarian shooting at the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]]/Donegall Road junction.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcdonald53"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Cusack|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; A roofer by trade who was married with one child&lt;ref name="mckittrick320"&gt;McKittrick, David (1999). ''Lost Lives''. UK: Mainstream. p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; he was (despite his wife having been Catholic),&lt;ref name="dillonlehane179"&gt;Dillon, Martin; Lehane, Denis (1973). ''Political Murder in Northern Ireland''. Penguin. p.179&lt;/ref&gt; the local UDA commander in the Village area where he lived.&lt;ref name="mcdonald53"/&gt;

Described to the court as the leader of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit, Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas who had ordered the fatal punishment beating, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The charge of murder was withdrawn on the grounds that she had not actually intended for her "Heavy Squad" to kill Ogilby and she was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in Armagh Prison.&lt;ref name="simpson39"/&gt; She received two further sentences (which were to run concurrently with her 10 years) of three years each, for intimidation and detaining Ogilby against her will.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;  The exact motive for the murder was not established in court.&lt;ref name="wood59"/&gt; During police interrogation, Douglas maintained that Ogilby's killing was the result of a personal vendetta, stating "It was not a UDA operation, they had nothing to do with it. It was just a move between a lot of women, a personal thing".&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; In his book ''The Protestants of Ulster'' which was published in 1976, Geoffrey Bell stated that the women murdered her as punishment for her affair with William Young.&lt;ref name="bell55"&gt;Bell, Geoffrey (1976). ''The Protestants of Ulster''. Pluto Press. p.55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry McDonald (writer)|Henry McDonald]] and [[Jim Cusack]] suggested that jealousy and bloodlust were the motives for the murder.&lt;ref name="mcdonald5758"/&gt; The others received lesser sentences: Albert Graham and Josephine Brown, after pleading guilty, were sentenced to three years imprisonment on charges of being accessories after the fact and causing grievous bodily harm to Ann Ogilby; [[the Crown]] withdrew the murder charge against the pair after recognising their attempt to prevent Cowan and Smith from continuing with the fatal beating.&lt;ref name="simpson39"/&gt; The unit's second-in-command, Kathleen Whitla was given two years for intimidation; Maud Tait (21), Anne Gracey (28), Elizabeth Douglas, Jr (19) and Marie Lendrum (23), were all sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for intimidation, and an unnamed 16-year-old was given an 18-months suspended sentence for intimidation. The convictions resulted in the largest single ingress of loyalist women into a Northern Ireland prison.&lt;ref name="corcoran136"&gt;Corcoran, Mary S. (2006). ''Out of Order: the political imprisonment of women in Northern Ireland, 1972-98''. Willan. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Denouncing the UDA, the trial judge, Mr. Justice McGonigle stated, "What appears before me today under the name of the UDA is gun law, a vicious, brutalising organisation of persons who take the law into their own hands and who, by kangaroo courts and the infliction of physical brutality, terrorise a neighbourhood through intimidation".&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;"Battered and dumped in Stockman's Lane, murder still has power to shock". ''Andersonstown News''. Ciarán Barnes. 24 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court "trial".&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; Eluzabeth "Lily" Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, "You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. When you heard what had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. Your concern was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; your responsibility was great. You are no stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character."&lt;ref name="simpson40"/&gt; The Northern Irish press dubbed Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas "the Sandy Row executioner".&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Sharlene Ogilby later married and has three children of her own. After her mother's murder, she was taken to live in Sion Mills by an uncle and aunt. For a while she kept in touch with her brother Gary but has since lost contact; she has no knowledge of what happened to her other brothers Stephen and Derek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/2015/02/13/the-appalling-murder-of-ann-ogilby-in-belfast "The appalling murder of Ann Ogilby in Belfast". ''The Carlow Nationalist''. 11 February 2015] Retrieved 21 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth "Lily" Douglas died shortly after being released from Armagh Prison on compassionate grounds in 1979; Kathleen Whitla is also deceased. Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith were both released from Armagh in December 1983 after serving nine years. They returned to the Sandy Row area. Loyalist sources claimed Smith "deeply regretted" the part she played in Ogilby's murder. Graham, following his release from prison, also returned to south Belfast. To the present day he has steadfastly refused to discuss the murder.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; The rest of the women involved in Ogilby's murder are to date living in Sandy Row or the Village. William Young died in 2007.

The disused bakery in Hunter Street has since been demolished.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

Belfast poet Linda Anderson wrote a poem, ''Gang-Bang Ulster Style'', based on the Ogilby killing. It was published in the August 1989, no. 204 edition of ''Spare Rib''.&lt;ref name="anthology1507"&gt;Deane, Seamus; Carpenter, Andrew; Williams, Jonathan (2002). ''The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing Vol. 5: Irish Women's Writing and Traditions''. New York: New York University Press. p. The 'Romper Room'1507&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Ogilby's murder also featured in a [[Gavin Ewart]] poem entitled, ''The Gentle Sex'' (1974).&lt;ref name="ewart"&gt;Ewart, Gavin (2012). ''Selected Poems 1933-1993''. Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; The murder was investigated by the [[Historical Enquiries Team]] (HET), which was established by the [[PSNI]] to inquire into the most controversial killings perpetrated during the Troubles.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

The '''National Security Act of 1947''' was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following [[World War II]]. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed [[James Forrestal]] as the first [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/images/forrestal-letter.jpg |title=Letter from James Forrestal to Chan Gurney |date=March 4, 1947 |series=Committee on Armed Services, Records of the U.S. Senate |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act merged the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] (renamed as the [[Department of the Army]]) and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[National Military Establishment]] (NME), headed by the Secretary of Defense. It also created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]], which separated the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] into its own service.  It also protected the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] as an independent service, under the Department of the Navy. 

Aside from the military reorganization, the act established the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the U.S.'s first peacetime non-military [[intelligence agency]].

== History ==
The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following [[World War II]]. The act and its changes, along with the [[Truman Doctrine]] and the [[Marshall Plan]], were major components of the Truman administration's [[Cold War]] strategy. The bill signing took place aboard Truman's [[VC-54]]C presidential aircraft ''Sacred Cow'', the first aircraft used for the role of [[Air Force One]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1845 Fact Sheets : National Security Act of 1947 : National Security Act of 1947&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114142445/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1845 |date=2012-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed [[James Forrestal]] as the first [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His power was initially limited and it was difficult for him to exercise the authority to make his office effective. This was later changed in the amendment to the act in 1949, creating what was to be the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinnard, Douglas.

== Actions ==

=== Military ===
The Act merged the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] (renamed as the [[Department of the Army]]) and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[National Military Establishment]] (NME), headed by the Secretary of Defense. It also created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]], which separated the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] into its own service.  It also protected the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] as an independent service, under the Department of the Navy. Initially, each of the three service secretaries maintained quasi-cabinet status, but the act was amended on August 10, 1949, to ensure their subordination to the Secretary of Defense. At the same time, the NME was renamed as the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The purpose was to unify the Army, Navy, and Air Force into a federated structure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1947"&gt;Cambone, Stephen A. "The National Security Act of 1947– 26 July 1947."

=== Intelligence ===
Aside from the military reorganization, the act established the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], a central place of coordination for [[national security]] policy in the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the U.S.'s first peacetime [[intelligence agency]]. The council's function was to advise the president on domestic, foreign, and military policies,  and to ensure cooperation between the various military and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1947"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3745">'''Peace, Retrenchment and Reform''' was a political slogan used in early-19th-century [[United Kingdom|British]] politics by [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].

The historian [[R. B. McCallum]] in his history of the Liberal Party defined the meaning of the slogan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The critical, conscience-searching attitude to foreign and imperial affairs, the willingness to see the right triumph over national sentiment... was sheer idealism, the belief that war was wrong and that in the new world of great inventions and world-wide trade civilised nations should not require to settle difference by war.... Retrenchment... meant the saving of the resources of the individual from the grasp of the state taxation system. It was held as a general truth that wealth left in the hands of private persons would be more fruitfully used than if used by the state....[Liberals] had most vigorously attacked sinecures and abuses; it was they who had established free trade which seemed the best guarantee of economic development and it was they who more than any others discouraged expense on armaments, the most wasteful and unproductive of all expenditure.... Reform... had a particular and narrower use as meaning reform of the franchise.... More broadly it meant improvement in the method and art of government and the removal of any restriction or disqualification that fell on any particular class or sect.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. McCallum, ''The Liberal Party from Earl Grey to Asquith'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1963), pp. 68-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1794, the Radical [[Daniel Stuart]] published his pamphlet ''Peace and Reform, Against War and Corruption'' and in 1796, the Whig [[George Tierney]] stood for election a platform of "Peace and Reform". The relentless campaign by the Radical MP [[Joseph Hume]] against what he considered wasteful and extravagant government expenditure in the 1820s caused the word "retrenchment" to be added to "peace and reform".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Hume, Joseph (DNB00)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/enc/bri/view.cgi?n=18187]&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig government of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] was elected to office on the slogan "Peace, Retrenchment and Reform" in [[United Kingdom general election, 1830|1830]].&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Smith, ''Lord Grey. 1764-1845'' (Alan Sutton, 1996), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals under [[William Ewart Gladstone]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]] on the slogan,&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Biagini, ''Liberty, Retrenchment and Reform. Popular Liberalism in the Age of Gladstone, 1860–1880'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 130, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; as did the Liberals under Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. A. Morris, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32275 Bannerman, Sir Henry Campbell- (1836–1908)]’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 30 Jan 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Radical MP [[John Bright]] said in 1859, "I am for 'Peace, retrenchment, and reform', the watchword of the great Liberal party 30 years ago. Whosoever may abandon the cause I shall never pronounce another Shibboleth, but as long as the old flag floats in the air I shall be found a steadfast soldier in the foremost ranks".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (29 April 1859), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19043">'''Physical security information management''' ('''PSIM''') is a category of software that provides a platform and applications created by [[middleware]] developers, designed to integrate multiple unconnected security applications and devices and control them through one comprehensive [[user interface]]. It collects and correlates events from existing disparate security devices and information systems (video, access control, sensors, analytics, networks, building systems, etc.) to empower personnel to identify and proactively resolve situations.  PSIM integration enables numerous organizational benefits, including increased control, improved [[situation awareness]] and management reporting. 
Ultimately, these solutions allow organizations to reduce costs through improved efficiency and to improve security through increased intelligence.

A complete PSIM software system has six key capabilities:  
# Collection: Device management independent software collects data from any number of disparate security devices or systems.  
# Analysis: The system analyzes and correlates the data, events, and alarms, to identify the real situations and their priority.  
# Verification: PSIM software presents the relevant situation information in a quick and easily  digestible format for an operator to verify the situation. 
# Resolution: The system provides [[standard operating procedure]]s (SOPs), step-by-step instructions based on best practices and an organization’s policies, and tools to resolve the situation.  
# Reporting: The PSIM software tracks all the information and steps for compliance reporting, training and potentially, in-depth investigative analysis.
# Audit trail: The PSIM also monitors how each operator interacts with the system, tracks any manual changes to security systems and calculates reaction times for each event.

==PSIM-based integration==
A key differential between PSIM based integration and other forms of [[physical security]] system integration is the ability for a PSIM platform to connect systems at a data level, contrasting other forms of integration which interface a limited number of products.  PSIM allows use of open technologies which are compatible with a large number of manufacturers. These PSIM products offer more opportunities for expansion and can reduce implementation costs through greater use of existing equipment. 
PSIM solutions in general are deployed to centralize information to single or multiple control hubs. These are referred to as [[control room]]s or command and control centres (CCC, C4I, etc.).
To be connected with other technologies, is an important feature of any basic PSIM as is the capability to integrate with Open Industry Standards such as ([[Physical Security Interoperability Alliance|PSIA]], [[ONVIF]], [[ODBC]], etc.)

Security systems typically integrated into a PSIM solution include:
* [[Access control]] systems
* Automated barriers and [[bollards]]
* [[Building management systems]] like Heating, HVAC, lifts/elevators control, etc.
* [[CCTV]] (closed circuit TV)
* [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] systems
* [[Electronic article surveillance]] (EAS)
* [[Fire detection]]
* [[GIS]] mapping systems
* [[Intercom]] and [[IP phone]]
* [[Intrusion detection system]]
* [[Intrusion]] systems
* [[Lighting control system]]
* Perimeter Intrusion detection system
* Power monitoring system
* [[Radar]]-based detection and [[perimeter surveillance radar]]
* [[Security alarm]]
* [[Video content analysis]]
* [[Video wall]]

==Operator guidance==
PSIM solutions manage all of the data produced by the various security applications (where the security application manufacturers API or SDK allows), and aggregates them to produce meaningful intelligence. This in turn is converted to create graphical situation management content; combining relevant visual intelligence, [[workflow]] based on on-screen guidance and automated tasks (also referred to as a Common Operating Interface). This is used for both event management and for day to day security operations. Some of the more advanced PSIM products offer dynamic guidance, which can be changed according to the perceived [[Threat level (disambiguation)|threat level]]. This threat level is governed by both external intelligence, such as [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] advice and internal intelligence, such as the number of attempted breaches. This level of dynamic guidance again relies on the level of integration achieved with any given manufacturers API or SDK.

==Typical deployments==
PSIM solutions can be found in a wide range of industry and government sectors across the globe. The following are industries where PSIM deployments can be found;

* Corporate enterprise
* Critical national infrastructure protection
* Education
* Energy, oil &amp; gas
* Healthcare
* Homeland defense
* Industrial &amp; manufacturing
* Law enforcement
* Retail &amp; distribution
* Safe Cities
* Travel &amp; transportation

==IT convergence==
A key reason for the increased deployment of this technology has been its ability to bridge the gap between the security and [[information technology]] functions within organisations.  Security applications and devices have until very recently been only available on proprietary technologies, which reduce the ability to use multiple vendors and have created [[vendor lock in]] pricing strategies.  This opposes IT standards, where [[plug and play]] technology has allowed a greater choice of hardware and has helped reduce hardware costs. PSIM enables a greater degree of this type of interoperability, and comes at a time when security applications and devices are moving from analogue to network based connectivity. The combined effect has seen PSIM solutions score highly with IT departments globally, especially those that are database independent and simple to update with new devices and users.

==Security at board level==
The function of security departments has traditionally been to secure people and buildings, and has been slow to absorb new technology, relying more on manned guards and physical barriers. As [[Enterprise Risk Management]] (ERM) evolves to address all security and legislative risks across all stakeholders, physical security departments have come under increased scrutiny. 
Numerous examples of physical security breaches leading to major organizational losses, both in terms of assets and brand damage have led to physical security reporting to board level. Globally, new roles have been created within large organizations where [[Chief Information Security Officer]]s (CISO), have responsibility for ERM, including physical security. Subsequently, management reporting, policy compliance and KPIs have entered the physical security function, requiring more efficient working practices and monitoring tools.  Again PSIM software addresses these organizational requirements, and is therefore being stipulated by CISOs.

'''Police legitimacy''' is the extent to which members of the public view the [[police]] as legitimate, often measured in terms of the public's willingness to obey and cooperate with the police. Police legitimacy is linked to the degree of public support for, and cooperation with, the police's efforts to fight crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199843886.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199843886-e-017 | title=Police Legitimacy | work=The Oxford Handbook of Police and Policing | date=April 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2017 | author=Tankebe, Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler|first1=Tom R.|title=Enhancing Police Legitimacy|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1 May 2004|volume=593|issue=1|pages=84–99|doi=10.1177/0002716203262627}}&lt;/ref&gt; If police lose their legitimacy, it can compromise their ability and authority to work effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/Pages/welcome.aspx | title=Race, Trust and Police Legitimacy|publisher=[[National Institute of Justice]]| accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communism in the Kingdom of Romania|Repression}}

The '''Repression of communists in the Kingdom of Romania''' was [[political repression]] against people who held [[communism|communist]] views in the [[Kingdom of Romania]] between 1921 and 1944. In 1921, a number of 271 members of the [[Socialist-Communist Party]] who voted for the affiliation of the party into the [[Comintern|Third International]] were arrested and the following year they were tried and convicted by a military court to various terms of [[forced labour]]. 

The 1924 [[Mârzescu Law]] banned the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and provided the [[Capital punishment in Romania|death penalty]] for communist agitators, forcing the party to go underground for the following decades. Members of the Communist Party were routinely arrested by the police and [[Siguranța]], the secret police. During this period, most leaders of the Communist Party were either in exile in the Soviet Union (the Moscow wing) or in prison (known as the prison wing).

==Dealul Spirii Trial==
{{main|Dealul Spirii Trial}}
In May 1921, as the members of the Socialist-Communist Party voted on the inclusion of the party into the Third International, the authorities stormed the assembly hall and arrested 271 members of the party. They were held for eight months, during which they were held in very tough conditions, some of them being tortured. In 1922, they were joined with anarchist [[Max Goldstein]] in a trial by [[military court]] in which they faced the charges of crimes against the [[state security]], [[terrorism]], collaboration with the enemy and instigation to riot.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=Autoritatile pierd procesul |author= |url=http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/istoria-comunismului/autoritatile-pierd-procesul-59114.html |newspaper=[[Jurnalul Național]] |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of politicians and intellectuals, including historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Dem I. Dobrescu]] and [[Iuliu Maniu]] voiced their discontent over the lack of constitutional basis for the trial.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

All but 37 of the prisoners were found guilty&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; and sentenced between one month in prison and 10 months of [[forced labour]]. Goldstein was sentenced to forced labour for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La Terreur Blanche en Roumanie |author= |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k400444x/f3.image.r=L'Humanité.langEN# |newspaper=[[L'Humanité]] |date=29 June 1922 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Goldstein, the communists were pardoned June 1922 by King Ferdinand I.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

==Ban of the communist ideology==
[[File:Raport Curtea Marțială Ianuarie 1944.jpg|thumb|January 1944 report of the Romanian [[Court-martial]] showing 5 communists sentenced to death during the month]]
The 1924 Mârzescu Law banned the Romanian Communist Party and made communist agitation [[death penalty in Romania|punishable by death]], despite the fact that the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] banned death penalty during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislaw Frankowski, "Post-Communist Europe", in Hodgkinson, Peter and Rutherford, Andrew. ''Capital Punishment: Global Issues and Prospects''. Waterside Press (1996), {{ISBN|1-872870-32-5}}, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The official reason given for the banning of the party was [[disloyalty]] to the state and lack of patriotism, as it supported the territorial claims of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu56"&gt;Tismăneanu, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ban was followed with a wave of arrests: approximately 600 communists being arrested, including many of its leaders.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu56"/&gt; They were held in the [[Doftana prison]], which was notoriously one of the harshest prisons in Europe, according to contemporary human rights and civic rights organizations.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu58"&gt;Tismăneanu, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Only after mid-1930s, when the prisoners gained the status of "[[political prisoner]]", the conditions improved and the inmates were allowed to have access to books.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu58"/&gt;

The ban and repression took their toll on the Communist Party and by 1944, after two decades of underground activity, the party had only about 1000 members.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu59"&gt;Tismăneanu, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Lucian Boia]] argues that if the party were legal, the number of "visible" communists would have been certainly greater, as there was a significant number of intellectuals with left-wing views.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

==1936 Craiova Trial==
{{main|1936 Craiova Trial}}
In July 1935, 19 communists were arrested, including leaders such as [[Ana Pauker]] and accused of "activity against the Romanian state" and [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]]. Their trial was originally supposed to be held in Bucharest, but following large pro-communist rallies in the city, the authorities decided to hold it in some heavily guarded barracks 7&amp;nbsp;km outside the city of [[Craiova]]. The widely publicized trial ended with the conviction of Ana Pauker and other communist leaders to 20 years in prison, while the rest of the defendants to between 4 and 9 years in prison.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2005"&gt;{{cite news |title=Procesul de la Craiova |author=Rodion Iutis |url=http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/jurnalul-national/procesul-de-la-craiova-print-44453.html |newspaper=[[Jurnalul Național]] |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''royalty trust''' is a type of [[corporation]], mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in [[petroleum|oil and gas]] production or [[mining]]. However, unlike most corporations, its profits are not taxed at the corporate level provided a certain high percentage (e.g. 90%) of profits are distributed to [[shareholder]]s as [[dividend]]s. The dividends are then taxed as personal income. This system, similar to [[real estate investment trust]]s, effectively avoids the [[double taxation]] of corporate income.

==Characteristics of royalty trusts==
Royalty trusts typically own [[petroleum|oil]] or [[natural gas]] wells, the mineral rights of wells, or mineral rights on other types of properties. An outside company must perform the actual operation of the oil or gas field, or mine, and the trust itself, in the United States, may{{ambiguous|date=September 2015}} have no employees. Shares of the trust generally trade on the public stock markets, but the trust itself is typically overseen by a trust officer in a bank.

They are a powerful investment tool for people who wish to invest directly in extraction of petroleum or mining of other materials, but who do not have the resources or risk tolerance to buy their own well or mine. Additionally, since trusts often own numerous individual wells, oil fields, or mines, they represent a convenient way for the average investor to diversify investments across a number of properties. Also, since commodities are considered a hedge against inflation, the popularity of royalty trusts as investments rises as interest rates rise, and their shares often rise as a result.&lt;ref name="NYT 2004 RTs"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mcdep.com/cosinnyt41017.htm | title=Kurt Wulff quoted in NY Times on Royalty Trusts: Not an Oil Baron? You Can Still Get Oil Royalties | publisher=New York Times | date=17 October 2004 | accessdate=3 September 2015 | author=Alex Tarquinio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These trusts often attract investors with their relatively high yields;&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/royaltyincometrust.asp | title=Royalty Income Trust | date=nd | accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007, their distributions were often in the 10 to 15 percent annual range. This makes the [[share (finance)|share]]s sensitive to [[interest rate]]s, as share prices are likely to decline in periods of rising interest rates, and to rise when interest rates fall. Additionally, royalty trusts in the United States and Canada usually involve oil and gas fields or mines which are at or past their production peak, and will gradually decline in output as well as revenue; however, the infrastructure to develop them has already been built, so that an investor can expect a reasonably steady income stream.&lt;ref name="streetauthority.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.streetauthority.com/p/hy/2009/06-hy-moser.asp | title=Who Cares How Stocks Are Doing When You're Pulling in $28,900 a Year in Dividends? High-Yield Investing Special Report | publisher=Street Authority | date=October 2009 | accessdate=3 September 2015 | author=Paul Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to allowing investors to achieve high distribution returns, especially during periods of low interest rates, royalty trusts allow investors to speculate directly on commodities such as gas, oil, or iron ore without having to buy futures contracts, or use the other investment vehicles traditionally associated with commodities—since the trusts trade like stocks. During times when a commodity price is rising, the share value as well as the dividend return of a trust engaging in production of that commodity will rise as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/course.asp?docId=145579&amp;page=6&amp;CN=COM Morningstar article on royalty trust advantages and disadvantages]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian royalty trusts (CanRoy)==
Royalty trusts are found mainly in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]; there is also one in Germany. Canadian royalty trusts, called "Canroys" or "CanRoys", typically trade on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]], while some of the larger trusts also trade on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Canroys usually offer higher yields than U.S. trusts; for non-Canadian investors, this higher yield is reduced by the 15% foreign tax withholding that is absent in the U.S. trusts.

The most significant difference between Canadian and U.S. royalty trusts involves their legal status in their respective countries. In the U.S., trusts are not allowed to acquire additional properties, once they are formed. Since they are restricted to their original properties – for example, a group of oil fields or natural-gas-bearing rock formations—they can be expected to be depleted over time, the royalties they pay out will correspondingly decline, and eventually the trust will be dissolved. In Canada, trusts may be actively managed, and run as businesses. They may have employees, issue new shares, borrow money, acquire additional properties, and may manage the resources themselves.&lt;ref name="NYT 2004 RTs" /&gt;

Bell Canada Enterprises corporate unit Yellow Pages Group converted to Yellow Pages Income Fund on June 25, 2003, making it the "first high-profile conversion to the trust structure." Their income fund raised "$1-billion in the process."{{rp|20}}&lt;ref name="PIAC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.piac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/piac_income_trust_report.pdf | title=Income Trusts: A Challenge for Regulators | publisher=Public Interest Advocacy Centre | date=June 2007 | accessdate=3 September 2015 | author=Amanda Tait, John Lawford | pages=83 | location=Ottawa, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 article in ''Canadian Energy Law,''&lt;ref name="Canadian Energy Law"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canadianenergylaw.com/2012/04/articles/regulatory/foreign-asset-income-trusts-revive-interest-in-income-trust-market/ | title=Foreign asset income trusts revive interest in income trust market | work=Canadian Energy Law | date=13 April 2012 | accessdate=3 September 2015 | author=Doug Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The royalty trust and income trust markets trace their origins to 1986 and 1995, respectively. As interest rates declined during the period and beyond these trusts became popular, since they provided lofty yields well in excess of the prevailing interest rate payable by corporations with similar credit ratings. The reason for the discrepancy was primarily due to the fact that royalty trusts and income trusts were flow-through vehicles that avoided the payment of corporate level tax. The yields payable by these trusts varied, but were typically in the 8 – 10% range."|Doug Richardson 2012}}

Richardson argued that by 2012 [[foreign asset income trusts]] (FAITs) had revived interest regarding income trusts in Canada.&lt;ref name="Canadian Energy Law" /&gt; Because FAITs involve assets outside Canadian borders, they are "not subject to traditional Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules."&lt;ref name="Canadian Energy Law" /&gt;

===Hallowe'en massacre===

In 2006 $70 billion of new trust conversions were announced.&lt;ref name="Halloween massacre 2006" /&gt; The largest was proposed in September 2006 when [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprise]] BCE announced its intention to convert its Bell Canada subsidiary to a CanRoy trust thereby saving the corporation $800 million in tax by 2008.&lt;ref name="Halloween massacre 2006" /&gt; The royalty trusts were increasingly popular because they do not pay corporate tax, rather they "pay out most of their income in distributions to unit holders, who then pay tax on those distributions."&lt;ref name="Halloween massacre 2006" /&gt; On October 31, 2006 then-Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]] made his now famous proposal to introduce new rules —  later known as [[Specified Investment Flow-Through]]&lt;ref name="Canadian Energy Law" /&gt;(SIFT) rules —  nicknamed the "Halloween Massacre."&lt;ref name="Halloween massacre 2006"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/flaherty-imposes-new-tax-on-income-trusts-1.573751 | title=Flaherty imposes new tax on income trusts | work=CBC News | date=31 October 2006 | accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] — who was sworn into office February 6, 2006 after winning against the incumbent [[Paul Martin]] —  the Canadian federal government announced the elimination of the loophole that placed over 250 income trusts at a tax advantage over other corporations. Starting in 2011 "income trusts, with the exception of those focused on real estate, would be subject to a tax on trust distributions"&lt;ref name="former-energy-trusts" /&gt; at the full 31.5% rate. Existing trusts would have a four-year transition period (2007 to 2011) whereas newer trusts such as the proposed Bell Canada trust would be applicable in 2007. What prompted the move was that the trusts were costing the Canadian government upwards of $500,000,000 each year in lost revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawyersweekly.ca/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=538 Lawyer's Weekly: article on Canadian royalty trusts and the "Halloween massacre"]&lt;/ref&gt; Flaherty described the conversion of corporations into royalty trusts as "a growing trend to corporate tax avoidance" which was hurting the Canadian economy and defended his response as "measured."&lt;ref name="Halloween massacre 2006" /&gt; If the trend of trusts conversions was not stopped, it was estimated that the Canadian federal and provincial governments would lose "$1 billion annually in tax revenue."&lt;ref name="Halloween massacre 2006" /&gt;

Immediately after the announcement share prices of the trusts dropped. [[Penn West Exploration]]. then- Penn West Energy Trust) — still referred to as known as Penn West Petroleum in the media — &lt;ref name="former-energy-trusts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/former-energy-trusts-struggle-to-keep-yield?__lsa=a20f-ee61 | title=Former energy trusts struggle to keep yield | work=Financial Post | date=18 January 2013 | accessdate=3 September 2015 | author=David Pett}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview in January, 2013 Matt Donohue, an analyst at UBS AG in Calgary, argued that the growth-and-income model was "bruised" not "broken" with income trusts converting back into a corporate structure. With the increased use of [[horizontal drilling]] in the energy industry, energy trust adopt a hybrid policy that promised both "per-share growth and sustainable income for their shareholders."&lt;ref name="former-energy-trusts" /&gt; This model is least lucrative in periods of weak commodity prices.&lt;ref name="former-energy-trusts" /&gt;

Since the announcement of the Canadian "Tax Fairness Plan' approximately 90%{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} of Canadian Royalty Trusts (CANROY's) have either converted to corporations, merged with other companies, or simply liquidated.  While the Tax Fairness Plan did not require a conversion to corporate status most companies found it beneficial to do so.  After conversion most companies were required to slash their dividend payouts to reflect the new level of taxation they would be required to pay.&lt;ref name="yieldhunter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dividendyieldhunter.com The Yield Hunter |deadurl=yes |title=no title |series=The Yield Hunter |date=nd |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135600/http://www.dividendyieldhunter.com/ |archivedate=25 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 98''' (s. 98) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] of [[Canada]] was a law enacted after the Winnipeg General Strike banning "unlawful associations." It was used in the 1930s against the [[Communist Party of Canada]].

After the [[Winnipeg General Strike of 1919]], [[Arthur Meighen]], [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] in [[Robert Borden]]'s government, introduced an amendment to the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] that was passed by Parliament, which read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any association...whose professed purpose...is to bring about any governmental, industrial or economic change within Canada by use of force, violence or physical injury to person or property, or by threats of such injury, or which teaches, advocates, advises or defends the use of force, violence, terrorism, or physical injury to person or property...in order to accomplish such change, or for any other such purpose..., or which shall by any means prosecute or pursue such purpose...or shall so teach, advocate, advise or defend, shall be an unlawful association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Berger| first =Thomas| title =Fragile Freedoms: Human Rights and Dissent in Canada| publisher =Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company| date =1981| location =Toronto| pages =132–133| isbn = 0-7720-1358-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The law was extremely broad and carried a penalty of up to 20 years in prison. It was used throughout the 1920s and early half of the 1930s to harass Communists, other left parties and organizations, and [[labour unions]] generally.&lt;ref name="fragile_freedoms"&gt;{{cite book| last =Berger| first =Thomas| title =Fragile Freedoms: Human Rights and Dissent in Canada| publisher =Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company| date =1981| location =Toronto| pages =135| isbn = 0-7720-1358-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous use of Section 98 was in a crackdown designed to "strike a death blow at the Communist Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =1931 Communist Party Trial| publisher = Socialist History Project| url =http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/TrotOrigin/1931Trial/Trial%201.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] rounded up eight leaders of the Communist Party on 11 August 1931, who were subsequently convicted under the law and sentenced for up to five-year prison terms. In the years after the conviction, public opinion turned in favour of the Communists and against the law, which was opposed by [[liberalism|liberals]] and moderate leftists as well as far-left organizations like the [[Canadian Labour Defence League]], a Communist legal defence committee. As a result of public opposition, the Communists were released early from jail and the law was repealed in 1936 following the election of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] in 1935.

Opposition to Section 98 was an important campaign for crystallizing an early civil rights movement within an otherwise fractured [[left-wing]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Clément | first =Dominique | title ="'It is Not the Beliefs but the Crime that Matters': Post-War Civil Liberties Debates in Canada and Australia," | journal =Labour History | issue =86 | date =May 2004 | url =http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/clement.html | accessdate =2007-01-26 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070811225229/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/clement.html | archivedate =2007-08-11 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the law was repealed, it served as the model for the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] under the [[War Measures Act]] to suppress aliens and dissenters during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and during the [[October Crisis]] of 1970.&lt;ref name="fragile_freedoms" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72844">'''Serbian historiography''' ({{lang-sr|Српска историографија/Srpska istoriografija}}) refers to the historiography (methodology of history studies) of the [[Serb people]] since the founding of Serbian statehood. The development can be divided into four main stages: traditional historiography, Ruvarac's critical school, Communist–Marxist legacy, and the renewed Serbian national movement.{{sfn|Woolf|2014|p=825}}

== Modern Serbian historiography ==

[[Jovan Rajić]] (1726–1801) was the forerunner to modern Serbian historiography,&lt;ref name="Boia1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucian Boia|title=Great Historians from Antiquity to 1800: An International Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrENAAAAIAAJ|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-24517-6|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been compared to the importance of [[Nikolay Karamzin]] to [[Russian historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|title=Journal of Central European Affairs|volume=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u049AAAAIAAJ|year=1956|publisher=University of Colorado|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations of Serbian ecclesiastical historiography were laid by Bishop [[Nikodim Milaš]] (1845–1915).&lt;ref name="Perica72"/&gt; [[Ilarion Ruvarac]] (1832–1905) is regarded the founder of the critical school of Serbian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serbian Studies|volume=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnVpAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=North American Society for Serbian Studies|page=180|quote=Among these historians he points out the significance of Jovan Rajic (1726–1801) and Ilarion Ruvarac (1832–1905).

Serbian ecclesiastical historiography has coincided with nationalist perspectives contained within secular Serbian historiography.&lt;ref name="Perica72"&gt;{{harvnb|Perica|2002|p=72.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Church tradition and early Serbian historiography through folk poetry based upon the Battle of Kosovo assisted in overcoming gaps and linking the old with the then new Serbian state.&lt;ref name="Velikonja95"&gt;{{cite book|last=Velikonja|first=Mitja|title=Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rqjLgtYDKQ0C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Serbian+historiography+Islam#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian%20historiography%20Islam&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-1-60344-724-9|page=95|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett160"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Matthew|chapter=The Kosovo Liberation Army|editor1-last=Bennett|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Latawski|editor2-first=Paul|title=Exile armies|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-52245-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OPhZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Serbian+historians+Balkan+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian%20historians%20Balkan%20wars&amp;f=false|page=160|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation and religion were closely connected within nationalist Serbian history in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Deringil6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deringil|first=Selim|title=Conversion and apostasy in the late Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z0wgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Serbian+historiography+Islam#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian%20historiography%20Islam&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-51048-6|page=6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriotic historiography viewed the Serbs as liberators from foreign oppression of their South Slavic brothers in the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]]. Serbian nationalists claim that in Communist historiography, Serbs were transformed into oppressors, the [[Chetniks]] of World War II branded as collaborationist as the [[Ustaše]], and the massacres of Serbs were downplayed.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Throughout the post war era, though Tito denounced nationalist sentiments in historiography, those trends continued with Croat and Serbian academics at times accusing each other of misrepresenting each other's histories, especially in relation to the Croat-Nazi alliance.&lt;ref name="Kolander267"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolander|first=Patricia|chapter=

# Serbian ethno-nationalist ideology
# Nationalism that originated from Church historiography and the Orthodox Church 
# Serbian émigré propaganda and myths 
# Genocide and Holocaust studies (due to Serbs identifying with Jews as crimes against Serbs were viewed alongside the Holocaust as being equivalent)

Using ideas and concepts from Holocaust historiography, Serbian historians alongside church leaders applied it to World War Two Yugoslavia and equated the Serbs with Jews and Croats with Nazi Germans.&lt;ref name="Perica150"&gt;{{harvnb|Perica|2002|p=150.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to World War Two Serb casualties, during the Milošević era Serbian historians and the regime saw it as important to secure support from prominent Yugoslav Jewish individuals and organisations regarding the idea relating to a common Serbian-Jewish martyrdom.&lt;ref name="Perica151"&gt;{{harvnb|Perica|2002|p=151.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a few Yugoslav Jews gave their assistance for the new Serbian historiography.&lt;ref name="Perica151"/&gt; In the 1980s, Serbian historians produced many works about the forced conversion during World War Two of Serbs to Catholicism in Ustaša Croatia.&lt;ref name="Aleksov106"&gt;{{harvnb|Aleksov|2007|p=106.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These debates between historians openly became nationalistic and also entered the wider media.&lt;ref name="Brunnbauer364"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunnbauer|first=Ulf|chapter=Historical Writing in the Balkans|editor1-last=Woolf|editor1-first=Daniel|editor2-last=Schneider|editor2-first=Axel|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 5: Historical Writing Since 1945|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-922599-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eJ4SDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=Serbian+historians+debates#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian%20historians%20debates&amp;f=false|page=364|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians in Belgrade during the 1980s who had close government connections often went on television during the evenings to discuss invented or real details about the Ustaša genocide against Serbs during World War Two.&lt;ref name="Stojanovic221"/&gt; These discussions had the effect of being theoretical deductions that served as a precursor for the eventual ethno-demographic engineering that took place in Croatia.&lt;ref name="Stojanovic221"&gt;{{harvnb|Stojanović|2011|p=221.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time some well known Serbian historians such as [[Vasilije Krestić]] and [[Milorad Ekmečić]] were at the vanguard of the nationalist movement.&lt;ref name="Armourxvii"/&gt; In 1986, Vasilije Krestić alongside historian [[Radovan Samardžić]] were members of a commission that later drafted the ''[[SANU Memorandum|Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]'' which referred to a "genocide" being committed against Serbs by Albanians and Croats in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Armourxvii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armour|first=Ian D.|title=Apple of Discord: The" Hungarian Factor" in Austro-Serbian Relations, 1867–1881|year=2014|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-683-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kVncAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=Serbian+historiography+tito#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian%20historiography%20tito&amp;f=false|pages=xvii|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramet1920"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2002|pp=19–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, the main focus of nationalist history was Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Anscombe761"/&gt; Serbian academics such as [[Dušan Bataković]] obtained generous support for publishing nationalist works which were translated into other languages and other Serbian historians [[Dimitrije Bogdanović]], Radovan Samardžić and [[Atanasije Urošević]] also produced similar works on Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Anscombe761"/&gt; Though some Serb historians did not promote nationalistic views, the practice of history within Serbia has been influenced by limitations placed upon it from state-sponsored nationalism.&lt;ref name="Anscombe761"/&gt; The focus of research for Serbian historians has been restricted to the Serbian experience of life under "the Turks" and only a few Serb historians can read Ottoman documents.&lt;ref name="Anscombe761"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=761.}} "Even if some Serbian historians have not promoted a consciously nationalistic view, history as practised in Serbia has observed the constraints imposed by state-sponsored nationalism.  As suggested in Part I, nation-building states in former Ottoman territories have used their influence over education, support for and dissemination of research, and the media to draw implicit, and sometimes explicit, boundaries for acceptable historical interpretation. Minor variations on the established narrative may be allowed, but even less overtly ideological historians remain chroniclers of the nation. As in most other post-Ottoman states, few historians in Serbia are able to read Ottoman texts: the focus of their research is confined to Serbs and Serbian lands under 'the Turks'. In the 1980s and 1990s, overtly nationalist Serbian scholars such as Dušan Bataković received the most generous support for the publication of their work. [2] The focus of much of such nationalist history was Kosovo. Footnote: [2] Bataković wrote a series of nationalist works on Kosovo, of which several (''The Kosovo Chronicles'' [Belgrade, 1992] and ''Kosovo, la spirals de la haine'' [Paris, 1993]) have been translated into other languages. Many similar works have not been translated: e.g., ''Kosovo i Metohija u srpskoj istoriji'', ed. R. Samardžic (Belgrade, 1989); D. Bogdanović, ''Knjiga o Kosovu'' (Belgrade, 1985); and A. Urošević, ''Etnički procesi na Kosovu tokom turske vladavine'' (Belgrade, 1987)."&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Hapsburg documents have been used though Serbian historians sideline the corpus of local and important evidence based in Ottoman documents when compiling national history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=771.}} "Malcolm, like the historians of Serbia and Yugoslavia who ignore his findings, overlooks the most valuable indigenous evidence. Unwillingness to consider Ottoman evidence when constructing national history is exemplified by the Serbian historians who commemorated the three-hundredth anniversary of the great migration by compiling a compendium of previously unpublished references to Serbs in contemporary documents, all of them Habsburg in origin and none of them Ottoman."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
Serbian historiography (19th century - present) has through its historians developed various histriographical positions, views and conclusions on subjects and topics that relates to the study of Serbian history and the Serb people. Of those are:

=== Medieval and pre-independence periods ===

In Serbian historiography there is a divergence of positions regarding [[Byzantine culture|Byzantine cultural]] influence on Serbia with some Serbian historians supporting the view that there was and others seeing it as being minimal.&lt;ref name="Mishkova200"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishkova|first=Diana|chapter=The afterlife of a Commonwealth: Narratives of Byzantium in the National Historiographies of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania|editor1-last=Daskalov|editor1-first=Roumen|editor2-last=Vezenkov|editor2-first=Alexander |title=Entangled Histories of the Balkans-Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies|year=2015|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-29036-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDRzBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Serb+historians+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=Serb%20historians%20controversy&amp;f=false|page=200|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian historians have contended that [[Vlachs]] in [[Dalmatia]] during the early [[Middle Ages]] were thoroughly Slavonicised and hence to be really Serbs.&lt;ref name="Judah11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|title=The Serbs: History, myth, and the destruction of Yugoslavia|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08507-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B4YbP0fPcMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Serbian+historians+Islam#v=snippet&amp;q=Serbian%20historians%20vlachs%20dalmatia&amp;f=false|page=11|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry between [[Branimir of Croatia|Prince Branimir]] (ruled 879–887) who chose (Catholic) Rome over (Orthodox) Constantinople and Duke Sedeslav (ruled 878–879) who favoured Constantinople ended in execution of the latter by the former.&lt;ref name="Perica65"/&gt; In Serbian church historiography, Sedeslav is viewed as a martyr of the Orthodox church and Branimir's rise to power is interpreted as disastrous that divided two Slavic peoples who both until that time leaned toward the Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="Perica65"/&gt; [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|King Zvonimir]] (ruled 1075–1089) a figure who consolidated Catholicism and rejected Orthodoxy in Croatia is viewed by Serbian Church historians as an enemy of the Orthodox Christian religion.&lt;ref name="Perica65"&gt;{{harvnb|Perica|2002|p=65.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian historians contend that the medieval [[Bosnian Church]] was part of the Orthodox church and not heretical.&lt;ref name="Bringa15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bringa|first=Tone|title=Being Muslim the Bosnian way: Identity and community in a central Bosnian village|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00175-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iqtVESaJUgkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Serbian+historiography+Islamization#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian%20historiography%20Islamization&amp;f=false|page=15|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian history often emphasizes that the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć|Patriarchate of Peć]] was reestablished (1557) by [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], a grand vizier from Bosnia who by origin was of Orthodox Christian heritage and thus claimed as a Serb in Serbian history, while a relative of his became the first patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=765.}} "Serbian history makes much of the fact that the re-establishment of the patriarchate of Peć in 1557 was attributable to Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, by origin an Orthodox Christian from Bosnia (and thus claimed as a member of the nation in Serbian history), and grand vizier late in the reign of Sultan Suleyman I ('The Magnificent') and early in that of his successor, Selim II.

When the Habsburg army withdrew, 37,000 Serbian families left with them, or fled ahead of the reconquering Ottoman horde, in answer to an 'invitation' from the Emperor Leopold I to settle in Hungary. Their places in Kosovo were taken by Albanians, deported or encouraged to migrate from northern Albania by the Ottomans to ensure the permanent displacement of the rebellious Serbs. Catholics among the Albanians soon converted to Islam and the settlers became staunch supporters of the Ottoman regime. Thus, Kosovo's Albanians are relatively recent immigrants, settled by the state to displace Serbs and to buttress Muslim rule."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Serbian historians reject that Albanian family clans during the Ottoman period assisted to safeguard and preserve Orthodox monasteries and churches in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Udovicki29"/&gt; Instead they contend that Albanians held imperial Ottoman military and administrative employment and were to blame as much as the Turks for the turmoil that forced many Serbs in 1690 and 1734 to migrate northward.&lt;ref name="Udovicki29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Udovički|first=Jasminka|chapter=The bonds and the fault lines|editor1-last=Udovički|editor1-first=Jasminka|editor2-last=Ridgeway|editor2-first=James|title=Burn this house: The making and unmaking of Yugoslavia|year=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2590-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuGe9fy4raoC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Serb+historians+kosovo#v=onepage&amp;q=Serb%20historians%20kosovo&amp;f=false|page=29|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shu-tian Li''' (Shu-tien Li; {{zh|李書田}}) (1900 – 1988) was a citizen of the United States, a [[Chinese American]] educator and [[hydraulic engineer]]. After receiving a Ph.D. degree in engineering/economics from [[Cornell University]] in 1926, Li returned to China to assume a professorship at the [[Peiyang University]].&lt;ref&gt;Peiyang University was split into several colleges and universities in [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] after 1950, including the present-time [[Tianjin University]]&lt;/ref&gt;   He became the executive officer of Northern China Hydraulic Commission in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjsw.gov.cn/pub/tjwcb/shuilibk/shuiwenhua/youjiuls/200911/t20091114_22873.html|title=民间水事|website=Tjsw.gov.cn|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a founder of the [[Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society]] and served as its deputy president and then president for six terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ches.org.cn/zgslxh/gyxh/lsyg/A060104index_1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707045504/http://www.ches.org.cn/zgslxh/gyxh/lsyg/A060104index_1.htm |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he was appointed to lead the Yellow River Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh|《黄河志卷一 黄河大事记》}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 28, Li was chosen as the president of [[Tangshan College of Engineering]] and became the youngest college administrator in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh| 西南交通大学档案馆《西南交通大学校名、校址、校长一览表》}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1932, he was named the President of the Peiyang Engineering College. He was the longest serving president in Peiyang's first 56 years of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tju.edu.cn/xxgk/master_old/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221072331/http://www.tju.edu.cn/xxgk/master_old/ |archivedate=2010-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Under his leadership, Peiyang established one of the first graduate engineering programs and the first hydraulic engineering laboratory in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydropower.org.cn/info/shownews.asp?newsid=2908 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707050444/http://www.hydropower.org.cn/info/shownews.asp?newsid=2908 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1937 and 1949, he led the establishment of several national colleges and universities in western and southwestern China (e.g. {{lang|zh|西北联大, 国立西北工学院, 西康技艺专科学校, 贵阳农工学院, 贵州大学}} and {{lang|zh|北洋西京分院}}).  During his leadership at the [[Si-kang Institute of Technology]], the [[Panzhihua Mine]], one of the largest iron (and rare metal) deposits in the world, was discovered. In recognition of his contribution to hydraulic engineering and to China during [[World War II]], Li was awarded a First Order Hydraulic Gold Medal and an Order of Victory of Resistance Against Aggression, respectively, from the Chinese government after the war.  He was elected to the National Peking Academy of Sciences{{clarify|date=June 2018}} in 1948.  He published many research papers and books on the management and improvement of the nation's water resources, Yellow River basin and northern China harbor.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.{{lang|zh|《中国水利问题》, 《永定河治本计划》, 《北方大港之现状及初步计划》}}: Shu-tian Li, managing editor&lt;/ref&gt;   Among these publications, "The Chinese Hydraulic Issues" ({{lang|zh|《中国水利问题》}}), the first comprehensive review and scientific recommendation regarding Chinese water resources, established him as the leading hydraulic engineering authority in China in the 1940s.

Li returned to the United States in 1950 to start private engineering practice and academic teaching/research. The Chinese Institute of Engineers (CIE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie-usa.org/|title=Chinese Institute of Engineers ? USA|website=Cie-usa.org|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; awarded Li the CIE annual award in 1963 for his work on the Unified Energy-Matrix Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie-gnyc.org/newsletter/cie_award_2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Other recipients of the award during the last 50 years included Nobel Prize winners Tsung Tao Li, Chen-Ning Yang, Samuel Ting and Charles Kao; architect I.

Li died at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of notable people whom Li had close association with during his lifetime included Ch'en Li-fu (his classmate at Peiyang and former Secretary of Education in China), [[Y.H. Ku]], [[C. C. Li]] and David K. Cheng.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active [[philatelist]] and a devout Southern Baptist during his life.

[[File:Carfaxtower fromcornmarket.jpg|thumb|The [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] Tower, dated from the 13th century, "witnessed" the described events.]]

The '''St Scholastica Day riot''' of 10 February 1355 is one of the more notorious events in the [[history of Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decAC/Top_ten_astonishing_facts_occw.htm |title=Top_ten_astonishing_facts |date=15 December 2009 |publisher=[[Oxford City Council]], UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215225140/http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decAC/Top_ten_astonishing_facts_occw.htm |archive-date=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked off by a tavern dispute between two students and a taverner, the riot lasted two days and resulted in a large number of deaths among local citizens and students. The ensuing pacification led to a reinforcement and enlargement of the privileges and liberties of the academic institutions over the town.

==Background and dispute==
[[File:Site of the swindlestock tavern.jpeg|thumb|upright|Site of the Swindlestock Tavern, now a Santander Bank]]
The seed of the riot was an altercation in the Swindlestock Tavern in [[Oxford]] (now the site of the Santander Bank on [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]], on the corner of [[St Aldate's, Oxford|St Aldate's]] and [[Queen Street, Oxford|Queen Street]]) between two students of the [[University of Oxford]], Walter Spryngeheuse and Roger de Chesterfield, and the taverner, John Croidon. They complained about the quality of drinks, which led to an exchange of rude words that ended with the students throwing their drinks in the taverner's face and assaulting him.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Retaliation for the incident led to armed clashes between [[Town and gown|locals and students]].

The [[mayor of Oxford]], John de Bereford, asked the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of the University of Oxford]], [[Humphrey de Cherlton]], to arrest the two students, to no avail. Instead, 200 students supported Spryngeheuse and Chesterfield, allegedly assaulting the mayor and others.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; As the situation escalated, locals from the surrounding countryside poured in, crying: "Havac! Havoc! Smyt fast, give gode knocks!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oxford |last=Morris |first=James |publisher=Harcourt |year=1965 |page=69 |author-link=Jan Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A riot broke out and lasted two days, which left 63 students and perhaps 30 locals dead.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wardsbookofdays.com/10february.htm |title=10 February |date=19 August 2010 |website=http://www.wardsbookofdays.com/ |publisher=Ward's Book of Days |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819222053/http://www.wardsbookofdays.com/10february.htm |archive-date=2010-08-19 |access-date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students were eventually routed.

==Resolution==

The dispute was eventually settled in favour of the University, when a special charter was created. Annually thereafter, on 10 February the saint's day of St [[Scholastica]], the mayor and councillors had to march bareheaded through the streets, attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and pay to the university a fine of one penny for every scholar killed, a total of 5[[shilling|s]], 3[[Penny (English coin)|d]]. The penance ended 470 years later in 1825, when the mayor refused to take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/10/day-1355-university-fracas-ends-93-dead-birth-600-year-long/ |title=On this day in 1355: University fracas ends with 93 dead and the birth of a 600-year-long tradition |last=Selwood |first=Dominic |date=10 February 2017 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=8 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303014653/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/10/day-1355-university-fracas-ends-93-dead-birth-600-year-long/ |archive-date=3 March 2017 |dead-url=no |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan2012"&gt;{{Cite book |url={{google books|id=r9kSDQAAQBAJ|pg=PT54|plainurl=yes}} |title=Bloody British History: Oxford |last=Sullivan |first=Paul |date=31 January 2012 |publisher=History Press |isbn=9780752481975 |page=54 |access-date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In an act of conciliation on 10 February 1955, the Mayor was given an honorary degree and the Vice-Chancellor was made an Honorary Freeman, at a commemoration of the events of 1355.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Carol M. | last = Miller | url =http://fch.fiu.edu/FCH-1993/Miller_1993.htm | title = The St. Scholastica Day Riot: Oxford after the Black Death | journal = FCH Annals – Journal of the Florida Conference of Historians | pages = 29–42 | volume = 1 | date = June 1993  | accessdate = 6 September 2015 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151207214634/http://fch.fiu.edu/FCH-1993/Miller_1993.htm | archivedate = 7 December 2015| df = dmy-all }} ([http://fch.ju.edu/fch_vol_1.pdf PDF of entire volume] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014101915/http://fch.ju.edu/fch_vol_1.pdf |date=14 October 2015| format = pdf | deadurl = no  }})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unemployment''' or '''joblessness''' is the situation of actively looking for [[employment]] but not being currently employed.

The [[unemployment rate]] is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the [[labor force]]. During periods of [[recession]], an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;The Saylor Foundation. "Unemployment Rate." pp. 1 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf] Retrieved 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;million people globally or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The causes of unemployment are heavily debated.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(1)], on 'Three views on unemployment's causes'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical economics]], [[new classical economics]], and the [[Austrian School]] of economics argued that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment. [[Unemployment types#Classical unemployment|These theories]] argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside, such as unionization, bureaucratic work rules, [[minimum wage law]]s, taxes, and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers. [[Keynesian economics]] emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessions. This theory focuses on recurrent [[Shock (economics)|shocks]] that suddenly reduce [[aggregate demand]] for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers. Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers; these can include financial stimuli, publicly funded job creation, and expansionist monetary policies. Its namesake economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], believed that the root cause of unemployment is the desire of investors to receive more money rather than produce more products, which is not possible without public bodies producing new money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://future-finance.org/chapter/the-role-of-money-in-the-economy/why-money-matters/ "Why Money Matters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214064933/https://future-finance.org/chapter/the-role-of-money-in-the-economy/why-money-matters/ |date=14 February 2015 }} Retrieved 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A third group of theories emphasize the need for a stable supply of capital and investment to maintain [[full employment]].&lt;ref&gt;S Webb, ''How the Government Can Prevent Unemployment'' ([https://archive.org/stream/howgovernmentcan00webb#page/n3/mode/2up 1912]). M Kalecki, ‘Political aspects of full employment’ (1943) [http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~mshalev/ppe/Kalecki_FullEmployment.pdf 14(4) Political Quarterly 322]. [[United Kingdom]] Government White Paper, ''Employment Policy'' (May 1944) Cmd 6527. W Beveridge, ''Full Employment in a Free Society'' (1944). AA Berle, ‘A New look at management responsibility’ (1962) 2 Human Resource Management 3. E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, government should guarantee [[full employment]] through fiscal policy, monetary policy and trade policy as stated, for example, in the US [[Employment Act of 1946]], by counteracting private sector or trade investment volatility, and reducing [[Economic inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. MS Eccles, ''Beckoning Frontiers: Public and Personal Recollections'' (1951) 75-76 and [[Robert Reich]], ''Aftershock: The next economy and America's future'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment, there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely [[Conceptual model|model]] the effects of unemployment within the economic system. Some of the main types of unemployment include [[structural unemployment]] and [[frictional unemployment]], as well as [[cyclical unemployment]], [[involuntary unemployment]], and [[classical unemployment]]. [[Unemployment types#Structural unemployment|Structural unemployment]] focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]] and [[globalization]]. Discussions of [[frictional unemployment]] focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.

==Definitions, types, and theories==
The state of being without any work for an educated person, for earning one's livelihood is meant by unemployment. Economists  distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment, including [[#Cyclical or Keynesian theory of unemployment|cyclical or Keynesian unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[structural unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment.

Though there have been several definitions of "voluntary" and "[[involuntary unemployment]]" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, whereas involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of [[frictional unemployment]] is voluntary, since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low wage jobs whereas involuntary unemployment includes workers fired due to an economic crisis, [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.

On the other hand, cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature. However, the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, while classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties.

The clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those where there are fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust, so that even if all vacancies were to be filled, some unemployed workers would still remain. This happens with cyclical unemployment, as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment which can boomerang back and exacerbate these macroeconomic forces.

===Classical unemployment===

Classical, or real-wage unemployment, occurs when real wages for a job are set above the [[market-clearing]] level causing the number of job-seekers to exceed the number of vacancies. On the other hand, most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage many choose to fall out of the labor market and no longer seek employment. This is especially true in countries where low-income families are supported through public welfare systems. In such cases, wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare. Wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in above stated scenario. In addition, it must be noted that consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased need for labor. Higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services. Therefore, higher wages increase general consumption and as a result need for labor increases and unemployment decreases in the economy.

Many economists have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation. For example, [[minimum wage]] laws raise the cost of some low-skill laborers above market equilibrium, resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot (as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F. A. |last=Hayek |title=The Constitution of country |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1960 |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Anderton |title=Economics |year=2006 |location=Ormskirk |publisher=Causeway |edition=Fourth |isbn=1-902796-92-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws restricting layoffs may make businesses less likely to hire in the first place, as hiring becomes more risky.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

However, this argument overly simplifies the relationship between wage rates and unemployment, ignoring numerous factors, which contribute to unemployment.&lt;ref name="P. Garegnani 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Garegnani |title=Heterogeneous Capital, the Production Function and the Theory of Distribution |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=1970 |pages=407–436 |jstor=2296729 |doi=10.2307/2296729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert L.

In ''Out of Work: Unemployment and Government in the Twentieth-Century America'', economists [[Richard Vedder]] and Lowell Gallaway argue that the empirical record of wages rates, productivity, and unemployment in American validates classical unemployment theory. Their data shows a strong correlation between adjusted real wage and unemployment in the United States from 1900 to 1990. However, they maintain that their data does not take into account [[exogeny|exogenous events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Vedder |first2=Lowell |last2=Gallaway |title=Out of Work: Unemployment and Government in the Twentieth-Century America |location=New York |publisher=NYU Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-8147-8792-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclical unemployment===

Cyclical, deficient-demand, or [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] unemployment, occurs when there is not enough [[aggregate demand]] in the economy to provide jobs for everyone who wants to work. Demand for most goods and services falls, less production is needed and consequently fewer workers are needed, wages are sticky and do not fall to meet the equilibrium level, and mass unemployment results.&lt;ref name="Keynes 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |year=2007 |origyear=1936 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke, Hampshire |isbn=0-230-00476-8 |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/keynes/keynescont.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316094655/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/keynes/keynescont.htm |archivedate=16 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is derived from the frequent shifts in the [[business cycle]] although unemployment can also be persistent as occurred during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.

With cyclical unemployment, the number of unemployed workers exceeds the number of job vacancies, so that even if [[full employment]] were attained and all open jobs were filled, some workers would still remain unemployed. Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may [[supply shock|shock]] rational economic factors and suddenly inhibit aggregate demand.

[[Keynesian]] economists on the other hand see the lack of supply for jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention. One suggested interventions involves [[deficit spending]] to boost employment and demand. Another intervention involves an expansionary [[monetary policy]] that increases the supply of money which should reduce [[interest rate]]s which should lead to an increase in non-governmental spending.&lt;ref&gt;

===Marxian theory of unemployment===
[[File:Marx - Theorien über den Mehrwert, 1956 - 5708926.tif|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], ''Theorien über den Mehrwert'', 1956]]
{{Quotation|It is in the very nature of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to overwork some workers while keeping the rest as a [[reserve army of labour|reserve army]] of unemployed paupers.|Marx|[[Theories of Surplus Value|Theory of Surplus Value]]&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300"/&gt;}}

Marxists share the Keynesian viewpoint of the relationship between economic demand and employment, but with the caveat that the market system's propensity to slash wages and reduce labor participation on an enterprise level causes a requisite decrease in aggregate demand in the economy as a whole, causing crises of unemployment and periods of low economic activity before the [[capital accumulation]] (investment) phase of economic growth can continue.

According to [[Karl Marx]], unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected. He theorized that unemployment was inevitable and even a necessary part of the capitalist system, with recovery and regrowth also part of the process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/hardcastle/unemployment.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the [[proletariat]] within the capitalist system is to provide a "[[reserve army of labour]]" that creates downward pressure on wages. This is accomplished by dividing the proletariat into surplus labour (employees) and under-employment (unemployed).&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (2009). Capital: An Abridged Edition. Edited by David McLellan, Oxford Paperbacks, Oxford, UK. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953570-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[reserve army of labour]] fight among themselves for scarce jobs at lower and lower wages.

At first glance, unemployment seems inefficient since unemployed workers do not increase profits, but unemployment is profitable within the global capitalist system because unemployment lowers wages which are costs from the perspective of the owners. From this perspective low wages benefit the system by reducing [[economic rent]]s. Yet, it does not benefit workers; according to Karl Marx, the workers (proletariat) work to benefit the bourgeoisie through their production of capital&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Capitalist systems unfairly manipulate the market for labour by perpetuating unemployment which lowers laborers' demands for fair wages. Workers are pitted against one another at the service of increasing profits for owners.  As a result of the capitalist mode of production, Marx argued that workers experienced alienation and estrangement through their economic identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/a/l.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marx, the only way to permanently eliminate unemployment would be to abolish capitalism and the system of forced competition for wages and then shift to a socialist or communist economic system. For contemporary Marxists, the existence of persistent unemployment is proof of the inability of capitalism to ensure full employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The Communist Manifesto|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full employment===
{{Main|Full employment}}
[[File:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|Short-Run [[Phillips Curve]] before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU). Note, however, that the unemployment rate is an inaccurate predictor of inflation in the long term.&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;&lt;ref name=hossfeld/&gt;]]

In demand-based theory, it is possible to abolish cyclical unemployment by increasing the aggregate demand for products and workers. However, eventually the economy hits an "[[inflation]] barrier" imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist. Historical experience suggests that low unemployment affects inflation in the short term but not the long term.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;Chang, R. (1997) [https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf "Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113212953/https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf |date=13 November 2013 }} ''Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review'' 1Q97:4–13&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, the [[velocity of money]] supply measures such as the MZM ("money zero maturity", representing cash and equivalent [[demand deposit]]s) velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment.&lt;ref name=hossfeld&gt;Oliver Hossfeld (2010) [http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/texte/publikationen/forschungspapiere/HOSSFELD_USMONEY_INFERWP_2010-4.pdf "US Money Demand, Monetary Overhang, and Inflation Prediction"] ''International Network for Economic Research'' working paper no. 2010.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZMV |title=MZM velocity |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the [[natural rate of unemployment]]. The "natural" rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates. An alternative technical term for this rate is the [[NAIRU]], or the ''Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment''. No matter what its name, demand theory holds that this means that if the unemployment rate gets "too low," inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls (incomes policies).

One of the major problems with the NAIRU theory is that no one knows exactly what the NAIRU is (while it clearly changes over time).&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, making it hard to use the NAIRU in policy-making.&lt;ref name=hossfeld/&gt;

Another, normative, definition of full employment might be called the ''ideal'' unemployment rate. It would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency. This type of "full employment" unemployment would correspond to only frictional unemployment (excluding that part encouraging the [[McJob]]s management strategy) and would thus be very low. However, it would be impossible to attain this full-employment target using only demand-side [[Keynesian]] stimulus without getting below the NAIRU and causing accelerating inflation (absent incomes policies). Training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here.

To the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with "full employment".&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

===Structural unemployment===
{{Main|Structural unemployment}}
[[File:Okuns law quarterly differences.svg|thumb|[[Okun's Law]] interprets unemployment as a function of the rate of growth in GDP.]]
[[Structural unemployment]] occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs. Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment, except to say that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.

Structural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including [[job hunting|job-searching]] skills) become "rusty" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to [[homelessness]] and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty.

This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained ''high'' demand may ''lower'' structural unemployment. This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of [[path dependence]] or "hysteresis".

Much ''[[technological unemployment]]'',&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt; due to the replacement of workers by machines, might be counted as structural unemployment. Alternatively, technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with this problem suggests that this problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by [[Okun's Law]], the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers made redundant by increased labour productivity.

Seasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of [[Job (role)|jobs]] (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using "seasonal adjustment" techniques. This results in substantial, permanent structural unemployment.

===Frictional unemployment===
{{Main|Frictional unemployment}}
[[File:US beveridge 2004 through fall 2010.gif|thumb|The [[Beveridge curve]] of 2004 [[vacancy (economics)|job vacancy]] and unemployment rate from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics.]]

Frictional unemployment is the time period between jobs when a worker is [[search theory|searching]] for, or transitioning from one job to another. It is sometimes called search unemployment and can be voluntary based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual.

Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are [[Heterogeneous agents|heterogeneous]], and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, work-time, location, seasonal industries, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment.

Workers as well as employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away; they will invest some time and effort to find a better match. This is in fact beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers, since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment through multiple means including providing education, advice, training, and assistance such as [[daycare center]]s.

The frictions in the [[labour market]] are sometimes illustrated graphically with a [[Beveridge curve]], a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along this curve. An increase (decrease) in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards (inwards).

===Hidden unemployment===
Hidden, or covered, unemployment is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics, due to the way the statistics are collected. In many countries, only those who have no work but are actively looking for work (and/or qualifying for social security benefits) are counted as unemployed. Those who have given up looking for work (and sometimes those who are on Government "retraining" programs) are not officially counted among the unemployed, even though they are not employed.

The statistic also does not count the "[[underemployment|underemployed]]"—those working fewer hours than they would prefer or in a job that doesn't make good use of their capabilities. In addition, those who are of working age but are currently in full-time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics. Traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering, hunting, herding, and farming in wilderness areas, may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics. Official statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden unemployment.

===Long-term unemployment===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
'''Long-term unemployment''' is defined in [[European Union]] statistics, as unemployment lasting for longer than one year. The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), which reports current long-term unemployment rate at 1.9 percent, defines this as unemployment lasting 27 weeks or longer. Long-term unemployment is a component of [[structural unemployment]], which results in long-term unemployment existing in every social group, industry, occupation, and all levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bivens |first= Josh |last2=Shierholz |first2=Heidi |title=Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |url=http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
There are also different ways national statistical agencies measure unemployment. These differences may limit the validity of international comparisons of unemployment data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2000/06/art1full.pdf "International Unemployment Rates: How Comparable are They?"] by Constance Sorrentino, Monthly Labor Review, June 2000, pp. 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree these differences remain despite national statistical agencies increasingly adopting the definition of unemployment by the International Labour Organization.&lt;ref name="ilo.org"&gt;International Labour Organization Bureau of Statistics [http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---integration/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_088394.pdf Measurement of employment, unemployment and underemployment&amp;nbsp;– Current international standards and issues in their application]. Retrieved August 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924111726/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---integration/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_088394.pdf |date=24 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate international comparisons, some organizations, such as the [[Oecd#Statistics|OECD]], [[Eurostat]], and [[Division of international labor comparisons|International Labor Comparisons Program]], adjust data on unemployment for comparability across countries.

Though many people care about the number of unemployed individuals, economists typically focus on the unemployment rate. This corrects for the normal increase in the number of people employed due to increases in population and increases in the labour force relative to the population. The unemployment rate is expressed as a [[percentage]], and is calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Unemployment rate}=\frac{\text{Unemployed workers}}{\text{Total labor force}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

As defined by the [[International Labour Organization]], "unemployed workers" are those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay, currently available to work, and have actively searched for work.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization, Bureau of Statistics,[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/res/ecacpop.pdf The Thirteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians], received 21 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals who are actively seeking job placement must make the effort to: be in contact with an employer, have job interviews, contact job placement agencies, send out resumes, submit applications, respond to advertisements, or some other means of active job searching within the prior four weeks. Simply looking at advertisements and not responding will not count as actively seeking job placement. Since not all unemployment may be "open" and counted by government agencies, official statistics on unemployment may not be accurate.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Zuckerman |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/17/BU239666.DTL |title=Official unemployment numbers omit discouraged seekers, part-time workers |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=17 November 2002 |accessdate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629055550/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2002%2F11%2F17%2FBU239666.DTL |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, the unemployment rate does not take into consideration those individuals who are not actively looking for employment, such as those still attending college.&lt;ref&gt;Coy, P.

The [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] describes 4 different methods to calculate the unemployment rate:&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization, LABORSTA,[http://laborsta.ilo.org/applv8/data/c3e.html]. Retrieved 22 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Labour Force Sample Surveys'' are the most preferred method of unemployment rate calculation since they give the most comprehensive results and enables calculation of unemployment by different group categories such as race and gender. This method is the most internationally comparable.
* ''Official Estimates'' are determined by a combination of information from one or more of the other three methods. The use of this method has been declining in favor of Labour Surveys.
* ''Social Insurance Statistics'' such as unemployment benefits, are computed base on the number of persons insured representing the total labour force and the number of persons who are insured that are collecting benefits. This method has been heavily criticized due to the expiration of benefits before the person finds work.
* ''Employment Office Statistics'' are the least effective being that they only include a monthly tally of unemployed persons who enter employment offices. This method also includes unemployed who are not unemployed per the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] definition.

The primary measure of unemployment, U3, allows for comparisons between countries. Unemployment differs from country to country and across different time periods. For example, during the 1990s and 2000s, the United States had lower unemployment levels than many countries in the [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, John; Rho, Hye Jin; Fremstad, Shawn. [http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/US-EU-UR-2009-05.pdf U.S. Unemployment Now As High as Europe.] Center for Economic and Policy Research. May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which had significant internal variation, with countries like the UK and [[Denmark]] outperforming [[Italy]] and France. However, large economic events such as the [[Great Depression]] can lead to similar unemployment rates across the globe.

===European Union (Eurostat)===
{{Further|List of sovereign states in Europe by unemployment rate}}
[[File:EU Unemployment.svg|thumb|Unemployment in the European Union and two EEA countries (Iceland and Norway) in March 2017, according to Eurostat]]
[[File:Unemployment rate United states - Europe 1993-2009.svg|thumb|Unemployment rates from 1993–2009 for United States and [[European Union]].]]

[[Eurostat]], the statistical office of the [[European Union]], defines unemployed as those persons age 15 to 74 who are not working, have looked for work in the last four weeks, and ready to start work within two weeks, which conform to [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] standards. Both the actual count and rate of unemployment are reported. Statistical data are available by member state, for the European Union as a whole (EU28) as well as for the euro area (EA19). Eurostat also includes a long-term unemployment rate. This is defined as part of the unemployed who have been unemployed for an excess of 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Giugni, ed. ''The Contentious Politics of Unemployment in Europe: Welfare States and Political Opportunities''(Palgrave Macmillan; 2011) covers Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source used is the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). The EU-LFS collects data on all member states each quarter. For monthly calculations, national surveys or national registers from employment offices are used in conjunction with quarterly EU-LFS data. The exact calculation for individual countries, resulting in harmonized monthly data, depends on the availability of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/une_esms.htm|title=European Commission, Eurostat|accessdate=5 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126055630/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/en/une_esms.htm|archivedate=26 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures employment and unemployment (of those over 17 years of age) using two different labor force surveys&lt;ref&gt;United States, Bureau of Labor Statistics,[http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_faq.htm]. Retrieved 23 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the [[United States Census Bureau]] (within the [[United States Department of Commerce]]) and/or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (within the [[United States Department of Labor]]) that gather employment statistics monthly. The [[Current Population Survey]] (CPS), or "Household Survey", conducts a survey based on a sample of 60,000 households.

====Limitations of the unemployment definition====
Some critics believe that current methods of measuring unemployment are inaccurate in terms of the impact of unemployment on people as these methods do not take into account the 1.5% of the available working population incarcerated in U.S. prisons (who may or may not be working while incarcerated); those who have lost their jobs and have become [[discouraged worker|discouraged]] over time from actively looking for work; those who are [[self-employed]] or wish to become self-employed, such as tradesmen or building contractors or IT consultants; those who have retired before the official retirement age but would still like to work (involuntary early retirees); those on [[disability]] pensions who, while not possessing full health, still wish to work in occupations suitable for their medical conditions; or those who work for payment for as little as one hour per week but would like to work full-time.&lt;ref name="Krueger 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Alan B.|author2=Lawrence F. Katz|title=New Trend in Unemployment?: The High-Pressure U.S. Labor Market of the 1990s|journal=Brookings Review|year=1999|url=http://www.brookings.edu/articles/1999/fall_unemployment_katz.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511084352/http://www.brookings.edu/articles/1999/fall_unemployment_katz.aspx|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These last people are "involuntary part-time" workers, those who are underemployed, e.g., a computer programmer who is working in a retail store until he can find a permanent job, involuntary stay-at-home mothers who would prefer to work, and graduate and Professional school students who were unable to find worthwhile jobs after they graduated with their bachelor's degrees.

Internationally, some nations' unemployment rates are sometimes muted or appear less severe due to the number of self-employed individuals working in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Lebergott1964" /&gt; Small independent farmers are often considered self-employed; so, they cannot be unemployed. The impact of this is that in non-industrialized economies, such as the United States and Europe during the early 19th century, overall unemployment was approximately 3% because so many individuals were self-employed, independent farmers; yet, unemployment outside of agriculture was as high as 80%.&lt;ref name="Lebergott1964" /&gt;

Many economies industrialize and experience increasing numbers of non-agricultural workers. For example, the United States' non-agricultural labour force increased from 20% in 1800, to 50% in 1850, to 97% in 2000.&lt;ref name="Lebergott1964" /&gt; The shift away from self-employment increases the percentage of the population who are included in unemployment rates. When comparing unemployment rates between countries or time periods, it is best to consider differences in their levels of industrialization and self-employment.

Additionally, the measures of employment and unemployment may be "too high". In some countries, the availability of [[unemployment benefits]] can inflate statistics since they give an incentive to register as unemployed. People who do not seek work may choose to declare themselves unemployed so as to get benefits; people with undeclared paid occupations may try to get unemployment benefits in addition to the money they earn from their work.&lt;ref name="Reporting benefit fraud."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10014876 |title=Reporting benefit fraud |publisher=Directgov |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan and the European Union, unemployment is measured using a sample survey (akin to a [[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll).&lt;ref name="ilo.org"/&gt; According to the BLS, a number of Eastern European nations have instituted labour force surveys as well. The sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample rather than a census.

It is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ILO definitions, i.e., to be outside of the "labour force".&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; These are people who have no job and are not looking for one. Many of these people are going to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labour force. Still others have a physical or mental disability which prevents them from participating in labour force activities. Some people simply elect not to work preferring to be dependent on others for sustenance.

Typically, employment and the labour force include only work done for monetary gain. Hence, a [[homemaker]] is neither part of the labour force nor unemployed. Nor are full-time students nor prisoners considered to be part of the labour force or unemployment.&lt;ref name="Krueger 1999"/&gt; The latter can be important. In 1999, economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the United States by 0.17% between 1985 and the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Krueger 1999"/&gt;

In particular, as of 2005, roughly 0.7% of the U.S. population is incarcerated (1.5% of the available working population). Additionally, children, the elderly, and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labour force in and are correspondingly not included in the unemployment statistics. However, some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labour market

In the early stages of an [[boom and bust|economic boom]], unemployment often rises.&lt;ref name="Keynes 2007"/&gt; This is because people join the labour market (give up studying, start a job hunt, etc.) as a result of the improving job market, but until they have actually found a position they are counted as unemployed. Similarly, during a [[recession]], the increase in the unemployment rate is moderated by people leaving the labour force or being otherwise discounted from the labour force, such as with the self-employed.

For the fourth quarter of 2004, according to [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], (source [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/30/35024561.pdf Employment Outlook 2005] {{ISBN|92-64-01045-9}}), normalized unemployment for men aged 25 to 54 was 4.6% in the U.S. and 7.4% in France. At the same time and for the same population the employment rate (number of workers divided by population) was 86.3% in the U.S. and 86.7% in France. This example shows that the unemployment rate is 60% higher in France than in the U.S., yet more people in this demographic are working in France than in the U.S., which is counterintuitive if it is expected that the unemployment rate reflects the health of the labour market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Dean|url=http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&amp;year=2007&amp;base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&amp;162#comment-1679545|title=Wall Street Journal Gets German Unemployment Wrong|work=The American Prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Torres, OECD head of Employment Analysis, [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-917229@51-628862,0.html Avec 1,2 % de baisse fin avril, le taux de chômage continue sa décrue] ''Le Monde'', 30 mai 2007 : ''unemployment measure is less and less meaningful to measure labour market efficiency.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to these deficiencies, many [[labour economics|labour market]] economists prefer to look at a range of economic statistics such as labour market participation rate, the percentage of people aged between 15 and 64 who are currently employed or searching for employment, the total number of full-time jobs in an economy, the number of people seeking work as a raw number and not a percentage, and the total number of person-hours worked in a month compared to the total number of person-hours people would like to work. In particular the [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] does not use the unemployment rate but prefer various employment rates to date recessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwdev.nber.org/dec2008.html |title=Determination of the December 2007 Peak in Economic Activity |publisher=The National Bureau of Economic Research |date=28 November 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130905171428/http%3A//wwwdev.nber.org/dec2008.html |archivedate=5 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor force participation rate====
[[File:US Labor Participation Rate by gender.svg|thumb|The United States Labor Force Participation Rate by gender 1948–2011. Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.]]
The labor force participation rate is the ratio between the [[labor force]] and the overall size of their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (national population of the same age range). In the West, during the later half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly, due to an increase in the number of women who entered the workplace.

In the [[United States]], there have been four significant stages of women's participation in the labor force—increases in the 20th century and decreases in the 21st century. Male labor force participation decreased from 1953 until 2013. Since October 2013 men have been increasingly joining the labor force.

During the late 19th century through the 1920s, very few women worked outside the home. They were young single women who typically withdrew from the labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes. These women worked primarily in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry or as [[domestic workers]]. This profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.

Between 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily due to the increased demand for office workers, women's participation in the high school movement, and due to [[electrification]] which reduced the time spent on household chores. Between the 1950s to the early 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians ([[pink-collar]] jobs).

Between the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by a source of different factors, many of which arose from the [[second wave feminism]] movement. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force, investing in more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the female labor force participation rate rose from approximately 33% in 1948 to a peak of 60.3% in 2000. As of April 2015, the female labor force participation is at 56.6%, the male labor force participation rate is at 69.4% and the total is 62.8%.&lt;ref name="research.stlouisfed.org"&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS11300002 Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women] Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&lt;/ref&gt;

A common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the U.S. labor force in the 1950s to the 1990s was due to the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], and the adjustment of age of majority laws. The use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and advance their career while maintaining a relationship. By having control over the timing of their fertility, they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill.

This implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers. One factor may be that more and more men delayed the age of marriage, allowing women to marry later in life without worrying about the quality of older men. Other factors include the changing nature of work, with machines replacing physical labor, eliminating many traditional male occupations, and the rise of the service sector, where many jobs are gender neutral.

Another factor that may have contributed to the trend was [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|The Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children.

At the turn of the 21st century the labor force participation began to reverse its long period of increase. Reasons for this change include a rising share of older workers, an increase in school enrollment rates among young workers and a decrease in female labor force participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Zandweghe|first=Willem|title=Interpreting the Recent Decline in Labor Force Participation|journal=KC Fed Economic Review, First Quarter, 2012|pages=5–34|url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/pdf/12q1VanZandweghe.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The labor force participation rate can decrease when the rate of growth of the population outweighs that of the employed and unemployed together. The labor force participation rate is a key component in long-term economic growth, almost as important as [[productivity]].

A historic shift began around the end of the great recession as women began leaving the labor force in the United States and other developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2295236/Rise-happy-housewife-How-new-wave-feminists-giving-careers-stay-home-WANT-to.html Rise of the Happy Housewife] The Daily Mail, 18 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The female labor force participation rate in the United States has steadily decreased since 2009 and as of April 2015 the female labor force participation rate has gone back down to 1988 levels of 56.6%.&lt;ref name="research.stlouisfed.org"/&gt;

Participation rates are defined as follows:

{|  style="margin:auto; width:90%;"
| Pop = total population || LF = labor force = U + E
|-
| LFpop = labor force population &lt;br /&gt; (generally defined as all men and women aged 15–64) || p = participation rate = LF / LFpop
|-
| E = number employed || e = rate of employment = E / LFpop
|-
| U = number of unemployed || u = rate of unemployment = U / LF
|}

The labor force participation rate explains how an increase in the unemployment rate can occur simultaneously with an increase in employment. If a large amount of new workers enter the labor force but only a small fraction become employed, then the increase in the number of unemployed workers can outpace the growth in employment.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barth and Dennis Heffley [https://web.archive.org/web/20070621060113/http://www.cteconomy.uconn.edu/TCE_Individual_Articles/Spring_2004/LocalLaborForceParticipationRates.pdf "Taking Apart Taking Part: Local Labor Force Participation Rates"] University of Connecticut, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unemployment ratio====
The unemployment ratio calculates the share of unemployed for the whole population. Particularly many young people between 15 and 24 are studying full-time and are therefore neither working nor looking for a job. This means they are not part of the labour force which is used as the [[denominator]] for calculating the unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics#Youth_unemployment_trends |title=Unemployment statistics - Statistics Explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[youth unemployment]] ratios in the European Union range from 5.2 (Austria) to 20.6 percent (Spain). These are considerably lower than the standard youth unemployment rates, ranging from 7.9 (Germany) to 57.9 percent (Greece).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=File:Youth_unemployment,_2012Q4_%28%25%29.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130418091546# |title=File:Youth unemployment, 2012Q4 (%).png - Statistics Explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
High and persistent unemployment, in which [[economic inequality]] increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castells-Quintana|first=David|author2=Vicente Royuela |title=Unemployment and long-run economic growth: The role of income inequality and urbanisation|journal=Investigaciones Regionales|year=2012|volume=12|issue=24|pages=153–173|url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/33140/1/617293.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2013 Economics Nobel prize winner [[Robert J.

Unemployed individuals are unable to earn money to meet financial obligations. Failure to pay mortgage payments or to pay rent may lead to [[homelessness]] through [[foreclosure]] or [[eviction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/16/national/main6213988.shtml |title=Suburban Homeless: Rising Tide of Families |work=CBS News |date=16 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the United States the growing ranks of people made homeless in the foreclosure crisis are generating [[tent cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/26/tent-city-california-recession-economy |title=U.S. tent cities highlight new realities as recession wears on |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 March 2009 |location=London |first=Oliver |last=Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment increases susceptibility to [[cardiovascular disease]], [[somatization]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[suicide]]. In addition, unemployed people have higher rates of medication use, poor diet, physician visits, [[tobacco smoking]], [[alcoholic beverage]] consumption, drug use, and lower rates of exercise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380|title = Mission Critical: Getting Vets With PTSD Back to Work|last = Meade|first = Barbara J.|date = 29 March 2013|work = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|access-date = |via = |last2 = Glenn|first2 = Margaret K.|last3 = Wirth|first3 = Oliver|publisher = Medscape &amp; NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in Social Indicator Research, even those who tend to be optimistic find it difficult to look on the bright side of things when unemployed. Using interviews and data from German participants aged 16 to 94—including individuals coping with the stresses of real life and not just a volunteering student population—the researchers determined that even optimists struggled with being unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newswise.com/articles/view/545782/ |title=Even Optimists Get the Blues When Pink-slipped |work=Newswise |accessdate=27 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[M. Harvey Brenner|Brenner]] found that for every 10% increase in the number of unemployed there is an increase of 1.2% in total mortality, a 1.7% increase in [[cardiovascular disease]], 1.3% more [[cirrhosis]] cases, 1.7% more suicides, 4.0% more arrests, and 0.8% more assaults reported to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

A study by [[Christopher Ruhm|Ruhm]], in 2000, on the effect of recessions on health found that several measures of health actually improve during recessions.&lt;ref name=Ruhm&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Ruhm |title=Are Recessions Good for Your Health? |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |year=2000 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=617–650 |doi=10.1162/003355300554872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the impact of an economic downturn on crime, during the [[Great Depression]] the crime rate did not decrease. The unemployed in the U.S. often use [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs such as [[Food Stamps]] or accumulating [[debt]] because unemployment insurance in the U.S. generally does not replace a majority of the income one received on the job (and one cannot receive such aid indefinitely).

Not everyone suffers equally from unemployment. In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered more than twice as much if they became unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Christopher J.|author2=Wood, Alex M. |author3=Brown, Gordon D.A. |title=The dark side of conscientiousness: Conscientious people experience greater drops in life satisfaction following unemployment|journal=Journal of Research in Personality |year=2010 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=535–539 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2010.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. There is also possibility of reverse causality from poor health to unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bockerman|first=Petri|author2=Ilmakunnas, Pekka |title=Unemployment and self-assessed health: evidence from panel data|journal=Health Economics |year=2009|volume=18|issue=2|pages=161–179|doi=10.1002/hec.1361 |pmid=18536002 |url=http://www.petribockerman.fi/bockerman%26ilmakunnas_une_2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers hold that many of the low-income jobs are not really a better option than unemployment with a [[welfare state]] (with its [[unemployment insurance]] benefits). But since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, these jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes. (These jobs are often held short-term, either by students or by those trying to gain experience; turnover in most low-paying jobs is high.)

Another cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment, lack of financial resources, and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents. Unemployment can cause [[underemployment]], and fear of job loss can spur psychological anxiety. As well as anxiety, it can cause depression, lack of confidence, and huge amounts of stress. This stress is increased when the unemployed are faced with health issues, poverty, and lack of relational support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unemployment and underemployment: A narrative analysis about loss|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236855506_Unemployment_and_underemployment_A_narrative_analysis_about_loss|journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior|pages = 256–265|volume = 82|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jvb.2013.02.005|first = David L.|last = Blustein|first2 = Saliha|last2 = Kozan|first3 = Alice|last3 = Connors-Kellgren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An economy with high unemployment is not using all of the resources, specifically labour, available to it. Since it is operating below its [[production possibility frontier]], it could have higher output if all the workforce were usefully employed. However, there is a trade-off between economic efficiency and unemployment: if the [[frictional unemployment|frictionally unemployed]] accepted the first job they were offered, they would be likely to be operating at below their skill level, reducing the economy's efficiency.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_1st_Edn_Ch22/PThy_1st_Edn_Chap_22.html |title=Price Theory: First Edition, Chapter 22: Inflation and Unemployment |publisher=Daviddfriedman.com |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a long period of unemployment, workers can lose their skills, causing a loss of [[human capital]]. Being unemployed can also reduce the life expectancy of workers by about seven years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

High unemployment can encourage [[xenophobia]] and [[protectionism]] as workers fear that foreigners are stealing their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steininger |first=M. |last2=Rotte |first2=R. |year=2009 |title=Crime, unemployment, and xenophobia?: An ecological analysis of right-wing election results in Hamburg, 1986–2005 |journal=Jahrbuch für Regionalwissenschaft |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=29–63 |doi=10.1007/s10037-008-0032-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to preserve existing jobs of domestic and native workers include legal barriers against "outsiders" who want jobs, obstacles to immigration, and/or [[tariff]]s and similar [[trade barrier]]s against foreign competitors.

High unemployment can also cause social problems such as crime; if people have less disposable income than before, it is very likely that crime levels within the economy will increase.

The fall of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933 and [[Machtergreifung|Adolf Hitler's rise to power]], which culminated in [[World War II]] and the deaths of tens of millions and the destruction of much of the physical capital of Europe, is attributed to the poor economic conditions in Germany at the time, notably a high unemployment rate&lt;ref name="leopold"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/les-leopold/why-are-we-afraid-to-crea_b_487041.html Why are We Afraid to Create the Jobs We Need?], Les Leopold, 5 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of above 20%; see [[Great Depression in Central Europe]] for details.

Note that the [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] is not directly blamed for the Nazi rise—the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] occurred primarily in the period 1921–23, which was contemporary with Hitler's [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of 1923, and is blamed for damaging the credibility of democratic institutions, but the Nazis did not assume government until 1933, ten years after the hyperinflation but in the midst of high unemployment.

Rising unemployment has traditionally been regarded by the public and media in any country as a key guarantor of electoral defeat for any government which oversees it. This was very much the consensus in the United Kingdom until 1983, when [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government won a [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|landslide in the general election]], despite overseeing a rise in unemployment from 1,500,000 to 3,200,000 since its [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|election four years earlier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 |work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
{{Main|Full employment}}
The primary benefit of unemployment is that people are available for hire, without being [[Recruiter|headhunted]] away from their existing employers. This permits new and old businesses to take on staff.

Unemployment is argued to be "beneficial" to the people who are not unemployed in the sense that it averts inflation, which itself has damaging effects, by providing (in [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] terms) a [[reserve army of labour]], that keeps wages in check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Natale|first1= Samuel|last2=Rothschild|first2= Brian|year=1995|title=Work Values: Education, Organization and Religious Concerns (Value Inquiry Book Series , No 28)|publisher=Brill Rodopi|pages=91-100}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, the direct connection between full local employment and local inflation has been disputed by some due to the recent increase in international trade that supplies low-priced goods even while local employment rates rise to full employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=He |first=Xiaohong |year=1998 |chapter=From Trade Among Nations to Trade Within Firms Across National Borders |title=Globalization and Regionalization: Strategies, Policies, and Economic Environments |editor1-first=Jean Louis |editor1-last=Mucchielli |editor2-first=Peter J. |editor2-last=Buckley |editor3-first=Victor V. |editor3-last=Cordell |publisher=International Business Press |location=Binghamton, NY |pages=15–73 |isbn=0-7890-0513-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Efficiency wage Shapiro Stiglitz.svg|thumb|In the [[Shapiro–Stiglitz model]] of efficiency wages, workers are paid at a level that dissuades shirking. This prevents wages from dropping to market clearing levels.]] Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would shirk, if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/01/economist-explains-19https:|title=What full employment really means|date=2017|publisher= The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment as a result. The inflation-fighting benefits to the ''entire economy'' arising from a presumed optimum level of unemployment have been studied extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Carl |last2=Stiglitz |first2=Joseph E. |title=Equilibrium Unemployment as a Worker Discipline Device |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=74 |year=1984 |pages=433–444 |issue=3 |jstor=1804018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shapiro–Stiglitz model]] suggests that wages are not bid down sufficiently to ever reach 0% unemployment.&lt;ref name=SHAPIROSTGLTZMATH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coin.wne.uw.edu.pl/lwincenciak/docs/lecture_4.pdf |title=Efficiency wages, the Shapiro-Stiglitz Model |format=PDF |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because employers know that when wages decrease, workers will shirk and expend less effort. Employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive. These higher wages perpetuate unemployment while the threat of unemployment reduces shirking.

Before current levels of world trade were developed, unemployment was demonstrated to reduce inflation, following the [[Phillips curve]], or to decelerate inflation, following the NAIRU/[[natural rate of unemployment]] theory, since it is relatively easy to seek a new job without losing one's current one. And when more jobs are available for fewer workers (lower unemployment), it may allow workers to find the jobs that better fit their tastes, talents, and needs.

As in the Marxian theory of unemployment, [[special interests]] may also benefit: some employers may expect that employees with no fear of losing their jobs will not work as hard, or will demand increased wages and benefit. According to this theory, unemployment may promote general [[productivity (economics)|labour productivity]] and [[profit (economics)|profitability]] by increasing employers' rationale for their [[monopsony]]-like power (and profits).&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Theorien über den Mehrwert (Theory of Surplus Value)|year=1863|pages=478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me26/me26b471.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal unemployment has also been defended as an environmental tool to brake the constantly accelerated growth of the GDP to maintain levels sustainable in the context of resource constraints and environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the tool of denying jobs to willing workers seems a blunt instrument for conserving resources and the environment—it reduces the consumption of the unemployed across the board, and only in the short term. Full employment of the unemployed workforce, all focused toward the goal of developing more environmentally efficient methods for production and consumption might provide a more significant and lasting cumulative environmental benefit and reduced resource consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richard |first=Michael Graham |date=2 June 2008 |url=http://treehugger.com/files/2008/02/4_reasons_recession_bad_environment.php |title=Counter-Point: 4 Reasons Why Recession is BAD for the Environment |work=TreeHugger }}&lt;/ref&gt; If so the future economy and workforce would benefit from the resultant structural increases in the sustainable level of GDP growth.

Some critics of the "culture of work" such as anarchist [[Bob Black]] see employment as overemphasized culturally in modern countries. Such critics often propose quitting jobs when possible, working less, reassessing the cost of living to this end, creation of jobs which are "fun" as opposed to "work," and creating cultural norms where work is seen as unhealthy. These people advocate an "[[anti-work]]" ethic for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Idle Foundation|url=http://idlefoundation.org|access-date=26 August 2018|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709181256/http://idlefoundation.org/|archive-date=9 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies try a number of different measures to get as many people as possible into work, and various societies have experienced close to [[full employment]] for extended periods, particularly during the [[Post-World War II economic expansion]]. The United Kingdom in the 1950s and 1960s averaged 1.6% unemployment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sloman | first = John | title = Economics | year = 2003 | page = 811 | publisher=Prentice Hall |location=London |isbn=0-273-65574-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Australia the 1945 ''[[White Paper on Full Employment in Australia]]'' established a government policy of full employment, which policy lasted until the 1970s when the government ran out of money.

However, [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] discussions of [[full employment]] since the 1970s suggest that attempts to reduce the level of unemployment below the [[natural rate of unemployment]] will fail, resulting only in less output and more inflation.

===Demand-side solutions===
Increases in the demand for labour will move the economy along the demand curve, increasing wages and employment. The demand for labour in an economy is derived from the demand for goods and services. As such, if the demand for goods and services in the economy increases, the demand for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.

There are many ways to stimulate demand for goods and services. Increasing wages to the working class (those more likely to spend the increased funds on goods and services, rather than various types of savings, or commodity purchases) is one theory proposed. Increased wages are believed to be more effective in boosting demand for goods and services than central banking strategies that put the increased money supply mostly into the hands of wealthy persons and institutions. Monetarists suggest that increasing money supply in general will increase short-term demand. Long-term the increased demand will be negated by inflation. A rise in fiscal expenditures is another strategy for boosting aggregate demand.

Providing aid to the unemployed is a strategy used to prevent cutbacks in consumption of goods and services which can lead to a vicious cycle of further job losses and further decreases in consumption/demand. Many countries aid the unemployed through [[social welfare program]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. These unemployment benefits include [[unemployment insurance]], [[unemployment compensation]], welfare and subsidies to aid in retraining. The main goal of these programs is to alleviate short-term hardships and, more importantly, to allow workers more time to search for a job.

A direct demand-side solution to unemployment is government-funded employment of the able-bodied poor. This was notably implemented in Britain from the 17th century until 1948 in the institution of the [[workhouse]], which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use. A modern alternative is a [[job guarantee]], where the government guarantees work at a living wage.

Temporary measures can include [[public works]] programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Government-funded employment is not widely advocated as a solution to unemployment, except in times of crisis; this is attributed to the public sector jobs' existence depending directly on the tax receipts from private sector employment.
[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Top 10%.jpg|thumb|Supply-side economics proposes that lower taxes lead to employment growth. Historical state data from the United States shows a heterogeneous result.]]

In the U.S., the unemployment insurance allowance one receives is based solely on previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.) and usually compensates for one-third of one's previous income. To qualify, one must reside in their respective state for at least a year and work. The system was established by the [[Social Security Act of 1935]]. Although 90% of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance, less than 40% apply for and receive benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=Introduction to Unemployment Insurance|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1466#_ftn2|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions. In cases of highly seasonal industries, the system provides income to workers during the off seasons, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.
[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Bottom 90% v2.jpg|thumb|Tax decreases on high income earners (top 10%) are not correlated with employment growth, however, tax decreases on lower income earners (bottom 90%) are correlated with employment growth.&lt;ref name="economix.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/tax-cuts-for-job-creators/ | work=The New York Times | title=Tax Cuts for Job Creators | date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economix.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;]]

According to classical economic theory, markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand; everyone who wants to sell at the market price can. Those who do not want to sell at this price do not; in the labour market this is classical unemployment. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short-term growth in the economy, increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment.

===Supply-side solutions===
However, the labor market is not 100% efficient, although it may be more efficient than the bureaucracy. Some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling, which means too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot. This assumes [[perfect competition]] exists in the labour market, specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels and that employees are similar in ability.

Advocates of [[supply-side]] policies believe those policies can solve this by making the labour market more flexible. These include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions. Supply-siders argue the reforms increase long-term growth by reducing labour costs. This increased supply of goods and services requires more workers, increasing employment. It is argued that supply-side policies, which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation, create jobs, reduce unemployment and decrease labour's share of national income. Other supply-side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers.

==History==
There are relatively limited historical records on unemployment because it has not always been acknowledged or measured systematically. Industrialization involves economies of scale that often prevent individuals from having the capital to create their own jobs to be self-employed. An individual who cannot either join an enterprise or create a job is unemployed. As individual farmers, ranchers, spinners, doctors and merchants are organized into large enterprises, those who cannot join or compete become unemployed.

Recognition of unemployment occurred slowly as economies across the world industrialized and bureaucratized. Before this, traditional [[self-sufficiency|self sufficient]] native societies have no concept of unemployment. The recognition of the concept of "unemployment" is best exemplified through the well documented historical records in England. For example, in 16th century England no distinction was made between [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and the jobless; both were simply categorized as "[[sturdy beggar]]s", to be punished and moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&amp;offset=0 |title=Sturdy Beggars |publisher=Probertencyclopaedia.com |accessdate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DOhNAjB?url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&amp;offset=0 |archivedate=26 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing of the [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 1530s increased [[poverty]], as the [[Christian Church|church]] had helped the poor. In addition, there was a significant rise in [[enclosure]] during the [[Tudor period]]. Also the population was rising. Those unable to find work had a stark choice: starve or break the law. In 1535, a bill was drawn up calling for the creation of a system of [[public works]] to deal with the problem of unemployment, to be funded by a tax on income and capital. A law passed a year later allowed vagabonds to be whipped and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/poortudors.html |title=Poor Tudors |publisher=Localhistories.org |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1547, a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law, namely two years servitude and branding with a "V" as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second.&lt;ref&gt;R. O.

A description of the miserable living standards of the mill workers in England in 1844 was given by [[Fredrick Engels]] in ''The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn=  |pages=45, 48–53 |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }}Link is to excerpt&lt;/ref&gt;  In the preface to the 1892 edition Engels notes that the extreme poverty he wrote about in 1844 had largely disappeared. [[David Ames Wells]] also noted that living conditions in England had improved near the end of the 19th century and that unemployment was low.

The scarcity and high price of labor in the U.S. during the 19th century was well documented by contemporary accounts, as in the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The laboring classes are comparatively few in number, but this is counterbalanced by, and indeed, may be one of the causes of the eagerness by which they call in the use of machinery in almost every department of industry. Wherever it can be applied as a substitute for manual labor, it is universally and willingly resorted to ....It is this condition of the labor market, and this eager resort to machinery wherever it can be applied, to which, under the guidance of superior education and intelligence, the remarkable prosperity of the United States is due."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Scarcity of labor was a factor in the economics of slavery in the United States.

As new territories were opened and Federal land sales conducted, land had to be cleared and new homesteads established. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants annually came to the U.S. and found jobs digging canals and building railroads. Almost all work during most of the 19th century was done by hand or with horses, mules, or oxen, because there was very little mechanization. The workweek during most of the 19th century was 60 hours. Unemployment at times was between one and two percent.

The tight labor market was a factor in productivity gains allowing workers to maintain or increase their nominal wages during the secular deflation that caused real wages to rise at various times in the 19th century, especially in the final decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Unemployment in the United Kingdom fell later in the 1930s as the depression eased, and remained low (in six figures) after [[World War II]].

Fredrick Mills found that in the U.S., 51% of the decline in work hours was due to the fall in production and 49% was from increased productivity.&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995"&gt;{{cite book| author = Rifkin, Jeremy | title = [[The End of Work]]: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era | publisher = Putnam Publishing Group | year = 1995| isbn = 0-87477-779-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1972 [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment in the UK]] had crept back up above 1,000,000, and was even higher by the end of the decade, with inflation also being high.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7073">The phrase '''world car''' is an engineering strategy used to describe an [[automobile]] designed to suit the needs of global automotive markets with minimal changes in each market it is sold in. The goal of a world car program is to save costs and increase quality by standardizing parts and design for a single vehicle in a certain class, in hopes of using the cost savings to deliver a superior product that satisfies expectations for quality, appeal and performance of automobile buyers worldwide.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kiley|first1=David|title=Can Ford's "World Car" Bet Pay Off?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-06-04/can-fords-world-car-bet-pay-off|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Ford Mondeo]]&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Richard Alan|title=Six Men Who Built the Modern Auto Industry|date=2005|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=9780760319581|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ford Focus (international)|Focus]], modern no-frills cars such as the [[Fiat Palio]], [[Dacia Logan]] and [[VW Fox]] along with luxury cars such as the [[BMW 3 Series]] and [[Lexus LS]].

==History of the world car==
In the pioneering days of the [[automotive industry]], automobiles were primarily designed for the local market that the manufacturer was based in, such as the [[Ford Model T]], which was engineered to cope with the rural lifestyle and rugged terrain that most automobile buyers in the [[United States]] had to contend with in the early days of the automobile. However, the Model T was arguably the first world car, with [[knock-down kit]]s being assembled in locations such as [[Canada]], [[England]] and [[Argentina]].

The two largest manufacturers at the time, [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[General Motors]] (GM), both of the United States, were focused on expanding globally, with General Motors either acquiring or partnering with local automobile manufacturers, such as [[Opel]] of [[Germany]], [[Vauxhall]] of England and [[Holden]] of [[Australia]], while Ford created overseas subsidiaries such as [[Ford Germany|Ford of Germany]], [[Ford of Britain]] and [[Ford Australia]]. Both Ford and GM's overseas subsidiaries would later develop their own line of bespoke automobiles independently of their American parents.

In 1933, Ford introduced their first car designed for European tastes that was not sold in the United States, the [[Ford Model Y]], developed by Ford of Britain, and also manufactured by Ford of Germany as the [[Ford Köln]]. General Motors responded with the [[Opel 1.2 litre]], developed by GM in the United States but exclusively built and sold in Europe. This would begin the divergence of vehicles sold by Ford and General Motors worldwide. In Australia, the [[Coupé utility]] was beginning to catch on in popularity, as “a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays.”

===Economy cars===
The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was a success worldwide due to affordability and economy. To a lesser extent, its European contemporaries succeeded in global markets with the original [[Mini]] and [[Citroën 2CV]].

The [[Toyota Corolla]] and [[Nissan Sunny]] were the first two-passenger cars from [[Japan]] to be popular worldwide, thanks to a combination of durability and economy.

The [[1970s energy crisis]] saw Japanese and European manufacturers make inroads worldwide as American and Australian manufacturers focused on larger and less fuel-efficient cars.

===Diversification===
In the 1980s, compacts including the Beetle evolved into the [[C-segment]], featuring vehicles such as the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and [[Ford Escort (European)|Ford Escort]], along with the [[supermini]] class such as the [[Opel Corsa]] and [[Fiat Panda]], which has become the leading segment in the European car market.

[[Japanese domestic market]] vehicles increasingly focused on performance or luxury, featuring exclusive vehicles or variants of existing cars unique to Japan, such as the [[Nissan Laurel]] and [[Toyota Soarer]].

Buoyed by exports to the United States, [[Volkswagen]] opened a [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly|plant]] in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. [[Honda]], [[Nissan]], [[Toyota]] along with an [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.|Isuzu-Subaru joint venture]] also opened plants in the United States during the 1980s, while their Japanese compatriots [[Mazda]], [[Suzuki]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors]] partnered with their American affiliates, Ford, General Motors and [[Chrysler]], respectively, to create joint ventures in the lucrative North American market.

The [[Honda Accord]] was the first vehicle from a foreign brand that became the top selling car in the United States in 1989. From then on, Japanese manufacturers designed their midsize sedans to primarily appeal to the lucrative family sedan sector in the United States, with their sales in Japan and other markets an afterthought. Toyota launched the first [[Toyota Camry (XV10)|Camry]] that exceeded Japanese width restrictions in 1991, a successful attempt that saw them surpass the Accord and [[Ford Taurus]] for best-selling passenger car in the United States, and Honda launched a [[Honda Accord#Sixth generation .281997.E2.80.932002.29|bespoke Accord]] for the North American market in 1997 that was not sold in Japan or Europe.

===Modern attempts at a world car===
Models in the C-segment have usually shared a platform worldwide, with minimal styling changes for each market they are sold in. The most successful C-segment car is the [[Toyota Corolla]].

The [[Ford Mondeo]] was the first modern attempt by an automaker to make a mainstream [[D-segment]] car that specifically designed to successful in the United States and Europe and was billed as a "world car", succeeding the [[Ford Sierra]] in Europe and the [[Ford Tempo]] in [[North America]].

==Market needs worldwide==

Despite being a [[Earth|global]] design initially, world cars have to have specific changes made per national laws/regulations, or cultural differences / market tastes where these are divergent. For example, fuel prices vary greatly in different countries, and this affects the choice of engine fitted.

One vehicle that is an example of this is the Volkswagen Golf (currently sold in the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|Mk VI]] version), offered only with a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder petrol in the United States and Canada, but in Europe, it has 1.4, 1.4 TSI [[turbocharged|turbo]], 1.6, 2.0, 2.0 turbo 4-cylinder and 3.2 V6 petrol and 1.9 SDI [[diesel engine|diesel]] and 2.0 TDI [[turbodiesel]] engines. The differences between market needs are not just reflected by equipment levels (in Europe the Golf offers multiple trim levels, compared to North America where it is only available in two versions, and sold as a [[luxury car|premium]] hatchback rather than a workaday [[family car]] as in Europe.
