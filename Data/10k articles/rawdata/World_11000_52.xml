The '''24 Hours of Zolder''' ('''24 uur van Zolder''' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a yearly [[sports car racing|sports car]] and [[touring car racing|touring car]] [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]] held at [[Circuit Zolder]] in [[Belgium]].

The race was initially held in 1983, and has run every year except for 1988.  In 1989 a GT car won for the first time, and the following year the race joined the calendar of the BBL Cup, which became the Carglass Cup in 1992.  The 24 Hours became part of the [[Belcar]] championship in 1997 (for a few years named Belgian GT Championship, since 2010 named Belcar Endurance Championship), continuing to be the series' yearly endurance event.

The '''A7''' is a planned [[Motorway]] to link the city of [[Paphos]] with [[Polis, Cyprus|Polis]], a small town in the north west of the island.

== Overview ==

This motorway is one of the oldest demands of locals, due to number of accidents happened on the [[B7 Road (Cyprus)|B7 road]] (current route towards Polis), and due to the constant heavy traffic on it.  Τhis is the first motorway project in Cyprus, which is going to be performed through the Design, Build, Finance and Operate method (DBFO).  After several bureaucratic delays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jacqueline |last=Theodoulou |coauthors= |title=There are better places to spend £200m |date=October 13, 2005 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=22300&amp;archive=1 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202911/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=22300&amp;archive=1 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; plans are completed, and offers were made from 5 construction consortia.  Although at first  it was decided that the consortium called "Kinyras" was the preferred  bidder, Kinyras claiming rising costs due to the ongoing financial crisis raising its financial demands, hence putting the whole project in hiatus. Following government's refusal to pay more for an already expensive project, talks moved to the second preferred bidder the Austrian-Cypriot consortium "Strabag-Nemesis". If an agreement is reached construction can commence as soon as the first quarter of 2011 with a 2015 deadline.

Currently, the project is on hold, although the Government announced they are reassessing the design (August 2013) &lt;ref&gt;http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/08/14/on-again-off-again-paphos-polis-highway-could-be-on-again/ | On-again off-again Paphos-Polis highway could be on again&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project Details==

The A7 will be the most expensive road project ever being held by the [[Republic of Cyprus]], with a 447 million Euros price tag.

'''''BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea''''' is an [[Episodic video game|episodic]] [[Expansion pack|expansion]] to the [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', and a prequel to the original ''[[BioShock]]''. It was developed by [[Irrational Games]], and published by [[2K Games]]. It is available on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[OS X]]. ''Burial at Sea'' consists of two episodes. ''Episode 1'' was released worldwide via download-only on November 12, 2013, and ''Episode 2'' was released on March 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/02/05/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-2-release-date-announced/ | title = Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 2 release date announced | publisher = [[PC Gamer]] | date= February 5, 2014 | accessdate = February 5, 2014 | first = Phil | last = Savage  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A retail version for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released on November 4, 2014 as part of ''[[BioShock (series)#BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition|BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition]]'', and for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 13, 2016 as part of ''[[BioShock: The Collection]]''.

''Burial at Sea'' is set after the events of ''BioShock Infinite'', which spanned several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]] and was themed on the nature of choice. Whereas ''Infinite'' took place aboard [[Columbia (BioShock)|Columbia]], the floating air city set in 1912, ''Burial at Sea'' takes place in an alternate reality within the underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]], a year before the events of the first ''BioShock'' game (which is set in 1960). The game features Booker DeWitt as a private detective, and [[Elizabeth (BioShock)|Elizabeth]] as a ''[[femme fatale]]'' who employs Booker's services.

==Gameplay==
{{seealso|BioShock Infinite#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in ''BioShock Infinite''}}
Like ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', ''Burial at Sea'' is a [[first-person shooter]] with [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements. Using a mixture of the limited spaces of Rapture in ''[[BioShock]]'' and ''[[BioShock 2]]'' with the expanded environment of Columbia from ''BioShock Infinite'' allows for more dynamic combat challenges. Returning from ''BioShock'' and ''BioShock 2'', the player may carry more than two weapons at a time,&lt;ref name="manual7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|pp=7|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can collect other weapons and ammunition either from defeated enemies or from random locations around the city.&lt;ref name="guide17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|pp=17|ref=guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from ''Infinite'' is the regenerating shield, while health can be replenished with medical kits or food.&lt;ref name="manual2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|pp=2|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmids and EVE replace Vigors and Salts from ''Infinite''. Plasmids grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, releasing bolts of electricity, and machine/human possession. Plasmids require EVE, the equivalent of [[magic points]] for powering their abilities.

[[File:Elizabeth in Burial at Sea.png|thumb|left|"There were some Columbia ideas we kicked around, but I think we also got to the point where we felt like that was the story that we had just told.

And I just fixated on that." — Ken Levine&lt;ref name="How Playing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/08/07/how-playing-as-elizabeth-changes-bioshock-infinite |title=How Playing as Elizabeth Changes BioShock Infinite |author=Andrew Goldfarb |date=August 7, 2013 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The player can traverse Rapture both on foot and by riding a pneumo-line, a [[roller coaster]]-like rail system similar to the Skyline from Columbia. The player rides the pneumo-lines via a wrist-mounted tool called an Air-Grabber, which the player and enemies use to jump to/from and hang onto the self-powered tracks. Players can jump onto, off of, and between pneumo-line tracks at any time, and may face enemies that use the system to attack; the player can use one-handed weapons in Booker's free hand while using the pneumo-line. Freedom of movement along the pneumo-line allows for several varieties of combat, including flanking, cover, and area-of-effect attacks through creative uses of the system. Throughout episode one, the player does not directly control Elizabeth, but instead she scavenges the area for supplies such as ammunition, medical kits, EVE, and other items, and tosses them to Booker as needed. She can also use her Tear-opening powers to aid the player, bringing in weapons, health, EVE, assistance in the form of [[Samurai]] warriors, and automated defense units. Only one Tear can be opened at a time, forcing the player to decide between the available options to suit the battle.

''Episode Two'' includes a "1998 Mode" in which the player is challenged to complete the episode using only stealth and non-lethal methods of defeating enemies. The mode is a callback to ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]'' released in 1998 by [[Looking Glass Studios]], the predecessor to Irrational Games, and is compared to the main game's "1999 Mode", itself named in reference to the release year of Irrational's ''[[System Shock 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/27/5453626/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-2-1998-stealth-mode | title = BioShock Infinite Burial At Sea Episode 2 adds Thief-inspired '1998 Mode' | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = February 27, 2014 | accessdate=  February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The events of ''Burial at Sea'' connect many of the themes and characters from the original ''[[BioShock]]'' game and the ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' sequel.

===''Episode One''===
''Burial at Sea'' begins in a reality where [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Booker DeWitt|Booker DeWitt]] ([[Troy Baker]]) is a private investigator in Rapture. On the eve of the Rapture civil war, Elizabeth ([[Courtnee Draper]]) asks him to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Sally. Though Booker fears that Sally may have been made into a Little Sister, Elizabeth believes Sally to be alive and that the artist [[Sander Cohen]] ([[T. Ryder Smith]]) may have information regarding her whereabouts. Cohen makes them dance as part of a performance piece, but disappointed with their act, knocks them both unconscious. They wake up in a bathysphere descending towards the Fontaine Department Store building, previously sunk by [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) to serve as a prison for Atlas, the leader of the underclass uprising who, unknown to the other characters, is really [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Frank Fontaine|Frank Fontaine]], Ryan's political rival. 

Within the building, the two deal with Atlas' men that scavenge through the stores, and find Sally crawling within the ventilation system. They devise a plan to close all but one vent, then raise the air temperature to force Sally to the last open vent so they can grab her. When Booker attempts to pull her out, he discovers she has become a Little Sister and refuses to answer his call. Sally calls upon a [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddy]], which then proceeds to attack Booker and Elizabeth. They fight off the Big Daddy, and Booker goes to grab Sally again. He suddenly has a flashback to events he had previously forgotten, in that he had accepted his baptism and became Columbia's founder [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Zachary Hale Comstock|Zachary Hale Comstock]]. With the help of [[List of characters in the BioShock series#The Lutece Twins|Robert and Rosalind Lutece]] (Oliver Vaquer and [[Jennifer Hale]]) they had  attempted to steal the infant Anna (who would grow up to be Elizabeth) from an alternate version of Booker, but in this situation, Anna was killed when the portal closed around her neck despite Comstock's efforts to pull her free. Comstock was shamed by the loss and asked the Lutece twins to wipe his memories and place him in an alternate reality where Columbia did not exist; this resulted in his identity of Booker within Rapture.

As Booker realizes what he has done, he passionately apologies to Elizabeth, but she does not accept this. As they argue, Booker is impaled from behind by the Big Daddy.

===''Episode Two''===
The second episode takes place from Elizabeth's point-of-view. She wakes up from a nightmarish vision of [[Paris]] in flames to find herself and Sally captured by Atlas ([[Karl Hanover]]). Atlas prepares to kill her, but a vision of Booker appears, instructing her to say that she knows where to find [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Yi Suchong|Dr. Yi Suchong]] (James Yaegashi), a doctor working under Ryan but secretly assisting Fontaine. Atlas lets her go, taking Sally as a hostage. 

While exploring the store, Elizabeth finds her body impaled by a piece of reinforcement steel, and realizes she had been killed at the same time as Booker; she still exists as her other alternate selves have collapsed into a single body and lacking her ability to use Tears, a result of her deal with the Luteces to bring her to Rapture. She explains to the vision of Booker that she had seen visions of how to end the cycle of violence by coming to Rapture. The vision, in turn, tells Elizabeth that Suchong is in Rapture, and she must find a way to get there.

She learns of a secret lab that Suchong kept in Fontaine's store where a portal to Columbia can be opened. Elizabeth hypothesizes that by acquiring Lutece particles that keep the air city afloat, she can use them to lift the building off the sea floor and back to Rapture's depth. She arrives in Columbia in the midst of the Vox Populi revolution, and discovers that Suchong and [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Jeremiah Fink|Jeremiah Fink]] ([[Bill Lobley]]) had cooperated in sharing technology between the two periods, co-developing the Big Daddies and [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Songbird|Songbird]]; she also learns that the Luteces' had a role in prompting the Vox Populi leader [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Daisy Fitzroy|Daisy Fitzroy]] ([[Kimberly Brooks]]) into actions that previously caused Elizabeth to use her powers to kill her. On return to the Fontaine building, Elizabeth finds herself assaulted by Ryan's men, believing her working for Atlas. She escapes and makes it to the top of the building, releasing the particles. The building starts to lift, but Atlas appears and knocks her out. She awakes, finding that she is being injected with truth serum by Atlas to learn where Suchong is. She is given an overdose of the drug and falls unconscious for two weeks.

When she wakes, Atlas has launched an all-out war against Ryan. Atlas is now desperate to locate Suchong as the doctor has his "ace in the hole" to be used against Ryan. When Atlas threatens Sally, Elizabeth has a momentary vision and reports Suchong is in his clinic guarded by Ryan's security systems that are keyed to repel Atlas and his men by their DNA. Atlas sends Elizabeth in to retrieve Suchong. In the clinic, Elizabeth finds the doctor as he harms two Little Sisters, causing a Big Daddy to appear and kill him. Fearing the "ace in the hole" lost, she finds a piece of paper with a coded message, has another vision, and realizes she has found the ace. She returns the paper to Atlas, and decodes the message for him: "Would you kindly?" Atlas realizes this is the trigger phrase that Suchong has implanted in Jack, the illegitimate son of Ryan that Atlas has sent to the surface to keep out of Ryan's hands until the right time (and the player-protagonist from the first game). Atlas orders his men to make arrangements for Jack to come to Rapture, and then delivers a fatal blow to Elizabeth, leaving her alone with Sally. As Elizabeth dies, she has a final vision of the events at the end of ''BioShock'', where Sally and other Little Sisters are saved by Jack, the future that she came to Rapture to ensure would happen, and holds Sally's hand as she dies.

A post-credits scene shows a steady shot of Rapture as the tail end of a crashed plane sinks into the city, [[BioShock|signalling Jack's arrival]] as the screen fades out.

==Development==
The in-game setting of Rapture is nearly completely rebuilt with very little reuse of ''BioShock'' assets. The gameplay for the content was altered to fit the setting and feel of Rapture compared to the larger battles of ''Infinite''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer burial"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-30-ken-levine-talks-bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea | title= Ken Levine talks BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = July 30, 2013 | accessdate  =July 30, 2013 | first = Tom | last = Bramwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Rapture seen through windows is built up by 3D models instead of the 2D backdrops used in ''BioShock'' and ''BioShock 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/09/recreating-rapture-in-bioshock-infinite | title = Recreating Rapture in BioShock Infinite | first = Andrew | last = Goldfarb | date = August 9, 2013 | accessdate = August 4, 2017 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The added content includes new weapons, gear, and Plasmids (the Rapture equivalent of Vigors), as well as bringing back the mechanic of the "weapons wheel," used in the first two ''BioShock'' games, where players can swap between more than two weapons at their disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/9/4819606/bioshock-infinites-dlc-brings-back-the-classic-weapon-wheel | title = BioShock Infinite's DLC brings back the classic weapon wheel | first = Alexa Ray | last = Corriea | date = October 9, 2013 | accessdate = October 9, 2013 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Plasmids is Old Man Winter that freezes and shatters enemies. The concept was created by Joe Trinder, a fan and graphic designer, shortly after the reveal of ''Infinite''. The concept art, mimicking other in-game posters for Vigors, caught the attention of Levine, who decided to incorporate the concept within the ''Burial at Sea'' content with Trinder's help. The artwork was redesigned to match the Rapture setting, but further influenced one section of the content where a portion of the city has been converted into a winter wonderland where the Plasmid will be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/16/the-story-behind-bioshock-infinites-old-man-winter-plasmid | title = The Story Behind BioShock Infinite’s Old Man Winter Plasmid | first = Andrew | last = Goldfarb | date = October 16, 2013 | accessdate = October 16, 2013 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second episode, Elizabeth becomes the player character. Being more of a thoughtful character than Booker, her gameplay focuses more on strategy and avoidance of direct combat, more like a [[survival horror]] or [[Stealth game|stealth]] game. It was important that Elizabeth did not feel simply like Booker "in a dress". Amanda Jeffrey noted that Elizabeth was the main character of ''Infinite'' and Rapture the main character of the first game, and so "Burial" involved "our two leading ladies playing opposite each other". No longer being recently out of the tower, Elizabeth's character is slightly different in "Burial", being "older, wiser and more confident". Lead animator Shawn Robertson felt that Elizabeth's presence helped tie Rapture with ''Infinite''.

In February 2014, while promoting ''Burial at Sea: Episode Two'', series director [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] stated that the ''Burial at Sea'' will leave fans "walk[ing] away pretty satisfied with feeling a sense of completeness", with [[Courtnee Draper]] (voice of Elizabeth) calling it "the wrap-up for the whole BioShock series".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrev7Bf0NHg "BioShock Infinite Burial At Sea Episode Two - Behind The Scenes Trailer"]. ''[[IGN]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Levine revealed that ''BioShock Infinite'' would be [[Irrational Games]]' last game in the ''BioShock'' series, leaving the intellectual property in the hands of [[2K Games]], should they like to continue the franchise with another developer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2014/02/18/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-winding-down-irrational-games-as-you-know-it/ "BioShock Creator Ken Levine ‘Winding Down Irrational Games as You Know It’"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed how the combat was easy, with throwaway action sequences, and felt that ''BioShock Infinite''{{'}}s mechanics did not make sense in Rapture.

The second episode received "generally favorable" reviews according to Metacritic and experienced a better reception with critics than its predecessor.

He enjoyed the stealth-driven gameplay and liked that it served as a conclusion for both ''BioShock Infinite'' and the first ''BioShock''. He slightly criticized the goals of the game that required the player to go on fetch quests for various items, but otherwise felt it "a carefully crafted, appropriately mind-bending sendoff" for the entire series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=McCaffrey |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/03/25/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-2-review/1900-6415528/ |title=BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea Episode Two Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=March 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Destructoid''{{'}}s Chris Carter found it to be a vast improvement to the previous episode, calling it "Irrational's swan song". Like McCaffrey, Carter applauded the "uniquely improved [stealth-based] gameplay" and longer length of the episode, as well as the larger environments and return of characters from previous games in the series. He also believed that Irrational "went above and beyond with the implementation of 1998 Mode", a difficulty that tasks the player with completing the story without killing anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Carter |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-two-272421.phtml |title=Review: BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea Episode Two |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=March 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin VanOrd similarly found the episode to improve significantly on the previous one, writing that aside from some plot points and metaphors which he found overly contrived, it was a strong entry with well-paced gameplay and a smart story. VanOrd also approved of [[Frank Fontaine (BioShock)|Frank Fontaine]], believing him to be an excellent villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=VanOrd |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-2-review/1900-6415712/ |title=BioShock Infinite Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=March 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Justin McElroy of Polygon was not as impressed; though he liked the visuals and "enjoyable sneaky combat", he felt that both were used "to tell a story that, without flowcharts and some seriously generous apologetics, is convoluted to migraine-inducing degrees." He stated that for all the episode's strengths regarding the gameplay, his time "was marred only by the persistent, suffocating suspicion that [he] at no time had a solid idea of who [he] was, what [he] was doing or why [he] was doing it." McElroy expressed that because of the constant mysteries, Irrational's final entry in the ''BioShock'' franchise kept him at arm's length rather than sucking him in and providing closure, and its attempts to wrap everything up "too often feels like well-made fan fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Justin |last=McElroy |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/27/5555138/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-two-review-a-drop-in-the-ocean |title=BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea Episode Two review: a drop in the ocean |publisher=[[Polygon]] |date=March 27, 2014 |accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles II''' (26 January 1555 – 17 May 1589) was [[List of rulers of Monaco|Lord]] [[Monaco|of Monaco]] from 7 October 1581 to 17 May 1589.

Charles was the eldest son of [[Honoré I, Lord of Monaco|Honoré I]] (1522–1581) and [[Isabella Grimaldi]] (died 1583). He became [[List of rulers of Monaco|Lord]] [[Monaco|of Monaco]] on the death of his father in 1581.

Protected by [[Spain]], due to the Treaties of 1524, Charles was the first Lord of Monaco who refused to pay homage to the [[House of Savoy|Dukes of Savoy]] for [[Menton]]e and [[Roccabruna]]. In 1583 he was declared, after a trial, to have forfeited those two cities.

Charles ruled for only 8 years before dying at the age of 33. He left no issue and so his youngest brother [[Hercule, Lord of Monaco|Hercule]] became [[List of rulers of Monaco|Lord]] [[Monaco|of Monaco]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2373">The '''Corpus Evangelicorum''' was a league of [[Protestant]] imperial states within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that came into existence on 22 July 1653. Its progenitor was King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] who proposed the Corpus as a body of Protestant states who were allies, or were potential allies, against [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Gustavus Adolphus proposed that the Corpus Evangelicorum was to be the civil administration alongside the [[Corpus Bellicum]] which would be responsible for military concerns. The presidency of the Corpus Evangelicorum became associated with the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. The Corpus lasted until 1806 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|''Christian Cyclopedia''}}{{sfn|Trueman|2016}}

From its foundation, religious matters in the Holy Roman Empire were decided on only with an agreement from both Corpus Evangelicorum and [[Corpus Catholicorum]] (a similar league for [[Catholic]] imperial states). When [[Augustus the Strong]] converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in order to become [[King of Poland]] in 1697, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Duchy of Württemberg]] unsuccessfully tried to take over the presidency for themselves, but this eventually failed.

[[Elector of Saxony]] was always presiding over this body since its inception until the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ended.

[[Image:Swiss judicial system.png|thumb|350px|The federal judiciary within the Swiss legal system.]]

The '''federal judiciary''' of [[Switzerland]] consists of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]], the [[Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland|Federal Criminal Court]], the [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland|Federal Patent Court]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland|Federal Administrative Court]]. These courts are charged with the application of Swiss federal law through the [[judicial process]].

The Federal Supreme Court in [[Lausanne]] is established in the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] as the supreme judicial authority of Switzerland. It is the court of appeal for all decisions of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] courts of last instance, and also for most decisions of the three federal courts of first instance.

The Federal Criminal Court in [[Bellinzona]] tries the (relatively few) criminal cases subject to federal criminal jurisdiction, such as cases involving [[organised crime]], [[terrorism]] and crimes against federal institutions. It also decides disputes between cantonal prosecuting authorities. The Federal Administrative Court in [[St. Gallen]] reviews decisions made in application of federal administrative law that have been issued by federal and in some cases by cantonal authorities. The [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]] is a specialized court, which started hearing patent cases in 2012, taking jurisdiction from the cantonal courts.

'''Fræbbblarnir''' were formed in [[Iceland]] in 1978 and released a number of records until they quit early in 1983. A punk-pop band playing short, melodic songs fast and raw, they were inspired by the Ramones, Clash, Stranglers, Jam, Sex Pistols, Damned, Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias, Stiff Little Fingers, Undertones, Buzzcocks, Crass, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury and the rest of the early punk and New Wave scene, as well as 1960s bands like the Kinks and Troggs. They appeared in the documentary [[Rokk í Reykjavík]], and the album “Viltu nammi væna?” is regarded as a classic.

Its members continued playing on and off under various names until a compilation album was released by Smekkleysa (“Bad Taste”) in 1996, when the original band was re-formed.

The band is still active.

From 2004 to 2012, political power was concentrated in the hands of the president, under a president-parliamentary variant of semi-presidentialism. Only during the period of cohabitation from 2012 to 2013 was the president's authority challenged. In 2010, the Constitution was amended with effect from 2013, reducing the power of the president considerably, arguably in an attempt by term-limited President Saakashvili to secure a political comeback as a powerful prime minister. Under the new premier-presidential Constitution, powers have been much more evenly distributed with each branch of government exercising its Constitutional powers. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|საქართველო|tr}}, {{IPA-ka|sɑkʰɑrtʰvɛlɔ|IPA|Sakartvelo.ogg}}) is a country in the [[Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]]. Located at [[Europe–Asia border|the crossroads]] of [[Western Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]], it is bounded to the west by the [[Black Sea]], to the north by Russia, to the south by Turkey and [[Armenia]], and to the southeast by [[Azerbaijan]]. The [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|largest city]] is [[Tbilisi]]. Georgia covers a territory of {{convert|69700|km²|0|abbr=out}}, and its 2017 population is about 3.718&amp;nbsp;million. The [[sovereign state]] of Georgia is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]], with the government elected through a [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref name="Nakashidze2016" /&gt;

During the [[classical antiquity|classical era]], several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia, such as [[Colchis]], later known as [[Lazica]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]. The Georgians [[Georgian Orthodox Church#History|adopted Christianity]] in the early 4th century. The common [[Eastern Orthodox Church|belief]] had an enormous importance for [[Georgian Orthodox Church|spiritual]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|political unification]] of early [[List of historical states of Georgia#Early Middle Ages|Georgian states]]. A unified [[Kingdom of Georgia]] reached its [[Georgian Golden Age|Golden Age]] during the reign of [[David IV of Georgia|King David IV]] and [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Thereafter, the kingdom declined and eventually [[Kingdom of Georgia#Final disintegration|disintegrated]] under hegemony of various regional powers, including the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and successive dynasties of [[Iran]]. In the late 18th century, the eastern Georgian [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti]] [[Treaty of Georgievsk|forged an alliance]] with the [[Russian Empire]], which directly [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|annexed]] the kingdom in 1801 and conquered the western [[Kingdom of Imereti]] in 1810. Russian rule over Georgia was eventually acknowledged in various peace treaties with Iran and the Ottomans and the remaining Georgian territories were absorbed by the Russian Empire in a piecemeal fashion in the course of the 19th century. During the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] following the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, Georgia briefly became part of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]] and then emerged as an independent [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|republic]] before the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army invasion]] in 1921 which established a government of workers' and peasants' [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]. Soviet Georgia would be incorporated into a new [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]] which in 1922 would be a founding republic of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian Federation was dissolved and Georgia emerged as a [[Union Republic]]. During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]], almost 700,000 Georgians fought in the Red Army against the German invaders. After Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], a native Georgian, died in 1953, a wave of protest spread against [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his [[de-Stalinization]] reforms, leading to the death of nearly one hundred students in 1956. From that time on, Georgia would become marred with blatant corruption and increased alienation of the government from the people.

By the 1980s, Georgians were ready to abandon the existing system altogether. A pro-independence movement led to the secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For most of the following decade, [[post-Soviet]] Georgia suffered from [[Georgian Civil War|civil conflicts]], secessionist wars in [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], and economic crisis. Following the bloodless [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy; aimed at [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO]] and [[Future enlargement of the European Union|European integration]], it introduced a series of democratic and economic reforms. This brought about mixed results, but strengthened state institutions. The country's Western orientation soon led to the [[Georgia–Russia relations|worsening of relations]] with Russia, culminating in the brief [[Russo-Georgian War]] in August 2008 and Georgia's current [[territorial dispute]] with Russia.

Georgia is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]]. It contains two ''de facto'' independent regions, [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], which gained [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|very limited international recognition]] after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Georgia and most of the world's countries consider the regions to be [[Occupied territories of Georgia|Georgian territory under Russian occupation]].&lt;ref name="smr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf |title=The Law of Georgia on Occupied Territories (431-IIs) |date=23 October 2008 |publisher=[[State Ministry for Reintegration (Georgia)|State Ministry for Reintegration]] |accessdate=1 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624083638/http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gorgania on Fra Mauro map.jpg|thumb|left|"Gorgania" i.e. Georgia on [[Fra Mauro map]]]]

"Georgia" probably stems from the [[Iran|Persian]] designation of the Georgians – ''gurğān'', in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''gurz-ān''/''gurz-iyān'' and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''ĵurĵan''/''ĵurzan''. Lore-based theories were given by the traveller [[Jacques de Vitry]], who explained the name's origin by the popularity of St. George amongst Georgians,&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigol Peradze|Peradze, Gregory]]. "The Pilgrims' derivation of the name Georgia". ''Georgica'', Autumn, 1937, nos. 4 &amp; 5, 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; while traveller [[Jean Chardin]] thought that "Georgia" came from Greek γεωργός ("tiller of the land"). As Prof. [[Alexander Mikaberidze]] adds, these century-old explanations for the word ''Georgia/Georgians'' are rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''gurğ/gurğān'' ("wolf"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hock|first1=Hans Henrich|last2=Zgusta|first2=Ladislav|title=Historical, Indo-European, and Lexicographical Studies|date=1997|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3110128840|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the root of the word.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/&gt; Starting with the Persian word ''gurğ/gurğān'', the word was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Winfried |last=Boeder |first2=Wolfram |last2=Bublitz |first3=Manfred |last3=von Roncador |first4=Heinz |last4=Vater |title=Philology, typology and language structure |date=2002 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0820459912 |page=65|quote=The Russian designation of Georgia (Gruziya) also derives from the Persian gurg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region, which was referred to as ''[[Hyrcania|Gorgan]]'' ("land of the wolves"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rapp Jr.|first1=Stephen H.|title=The Sasanian World through Georgian Eyes: Caucasia and the Iranian Commonwealth in Late Antique Georgian Literature|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1472425522|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"/&gt;

The native name is ''Sakartvelo'' ([[wikt:საქართველო|საქართველო]]; "land of Kartvelians"), derived from the core central Georgian region of [[Kartli]], recorded from the 9th century, and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval [[Kingdom of Georgia]] by the 13th century. The self-designation used by [[Georgians|ethnic Georgians]] is ''Kartvelebi'' (ქართველები, i.e. "[[Kartvelian peoples|Kartvelians]]").

The medieval [[the Georgian Chronicles|Georgian Chronicles]] present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, [[Kartlos]], a great-grandson of [[Japheth]]. However, scholars agree that the word is derived from the ''Karts'', the latter being one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Georgia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|page=3|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Sakartvelo'' (საქართველო) consists of two parts.

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Colchis and Iberia, VI-III centuries B.C..jpg|thumb|Ancient Georgian states of [[Colchis]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], 500–400 BC]]

The [[classical antiquity|classical period]] saw the rise of a number of early Georgian states, the principal of which was [[Colchis]] in the west and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]] in the east. In [[Greek mythology]], Colchis was the location of the [[Golden Fleece]] sought by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]]' epic tale ''[[Argonautica]]''. The incorporation of the Golden Fleece into the myth may have derived from the local practice of using fleeces to sift gold dust from rivers.&lt;ref name="LOCge15"&gt;"Christianity and the Georgian Empire" (early history) Library of Congress, March 1994, webpage:[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ge0015) LCweb2-ge0015].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC, a kingdom of Iberia – an early example of advanced state organization under one king and an aristocratic hierarchy – was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints|publisher=[[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary|St. Vladimir's Seminary Press]]|edition=2|year=1997|author=[[David Marshall Lang]]|isbn=978-0913836293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Roman Republic]] completed its [[Pompey's Georgian campaign|brief conquest]] of what is now Georgia in 66 BC, the area became a primary objective of what would eventually turn out to be [[Roman–Persian Wars|over 700 years]] of protracted [[Roman–Iranian relations|Irano–Roman]] geo-political rivalry and warfare.&lt;ref name="Armenia, Azerbaijan 1996, p. 158"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny]].

=== Middle Ages up to Early Modern Period ===
Located on the crossroads of protracted [[Roman–Persian Wars|Roman–Persian wars]], the early Georgian kingdoms disintegrated into various feudal regions by the early [[Middle Ages]]. This made it easy for the remaining Georgian realms to fall prey to the [[Arab rule in Georgia|early Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century. After the wide political and cultural changes brought about by the Muslim conquests, refugees from the Iberia took shelter in the West, either in [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]] or [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Tao-Klarjeti]], and brought there their culture.

An [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|Arab incursion]] into western Georgia was repelled by [[Abasgoi|Abkhazians]] jointly with [[Lazica|Lazic]] and [[Principality of Iberia|Iberian]] allies in 736, towards {{Circa}}786, [[Leon II of Abkhazia|Leon II]] won his full independence from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and transferred his capital to the western Georgian city of [[Kutaisi]] after unifying Lazica and Abasgia via a dynastic succession. The increasingly expansionist tendencies of the kingdom to the east and the struggle against Byzantium, fighting for the hegemony within the Georgian territories speed up the process of unification of Georgia in a single feudal monarchy. In 9th century western Georgian Church broke away from [[Constantinople]] and recognized the authority of the [[List of heads of the Georgian Orthodox Church#Catholicoi of Kartli (467–1010)|Catholicate of Mtskheta]]; language of the church in Abkhazia shifted from [[Greek language|Greek]] to [[Georgian language|Georgian]], as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rapp|2007|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ushguli towers in Svaneti, Georgia.png|thumb|[[Svaneti]] defensive [[tower house]]s in [[Ushguli]]]]
The extinction of the different Iberian royal dynasties, such as [[Guaramid dynasty|Guaramids]] and the [[Chosroid dynasty|Chosroids]],&lt;ref&gt;Suny (1994), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and also the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] preoccupation with their own civil wars and conflict with the [[Byzantine Empire]], let the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] family to grown in prominence. The head of the Bagrationi dynasty [[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot I]], who had migrated to the former southwestern territories of Iberia, came to rule over [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]] and restored the [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Principate of Iberia]] in 813.

Despite the revitalization of the monarchy, Georgian lands remained divided among rival authorities, with Tbilisi remaining in [[Emirate of Tbilisi|Arab hands]]. The sons and grandsons of Ashot I established three separate branches – the lines of [[Principality of Iberia|Kartli]], [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]], and [[Klarjeti]] – frequently struggling with each other and with neighboring rulers. The Kartli line prevailed; in 888, with [[Adarnase I Kuropalates|Adarnase I]], it restored the indigenous Georgian royal authority dormant since 580. His descendant [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] was able to [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|consolidate]] his inheritance in Tao-Klarjeti and the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazian Kingdom]], due largely to the diplomacy and conquests of his energetic foster-father [[David III of Tao]].

The stage of [[Georgian feudalism|feudalism]]'s development and struggle against common invaders as much as [[Georgian Orthodox Church|common belief]] of various Georgian states had an enormous importance for spiritual and [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|political unification]] of Georgia feudal monarchy under the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] in 11th century.

George V was the last great king of the unified Georgian state. After his death, different local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule, until the total disintegration of the Kingdom in the 15th century. Georgia was further weakened by several [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|disastrous invasions]] by [[Timur|Tamerlane]]. [[Turkmen incursions into Georgia|Invasions continued]], giving the kingdom no time for restoration, with both [[Kara Koyunlu|Black]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu|White]] sheep Turkomans constantly raiding its southern provinces. As a result, the Kingdom of Georgia [[Kingdom of Georgia#Final disintegration|collapsed]] into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities. Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country, and beginning in the 16th century up to the late 18th century, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iran]] (and successive Iranian [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties) and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] subjugated the eastern and western regions of Georgia, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The rulers of regions that remained partly [[Autonomy|autonomous]] organized rebellions on various occasions. However, subsequent Iranian and Ottoman invasions further weakened local kingdoms and regions. As a result of incessant wars and deportations, the population of Georgia dwindled to 250,000 inhabitants at the end of the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Eastern Georgia (country)|Eastern Georgia]] ([[Safavid Georgia]]), composed of the regions of [[Kartli]] and [[Kakheti]], had been under Iranian [[suzerainty]] since 1555 following the [[Peace of Amasya]] signed with neighbouring rivalling Ottoman Turkey. With the death of [[Nader Shah]] in 1747, both kingdoms broke free of Iranian control and were reunified through [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|a personal union]] under the energetic king [[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]] in 1762.

In 1783, Russia and the eastern Georgian [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], by which Georgia abjured any dependence on [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] or another power, and made the kingdom a protectorate of Russia, which guaranteed Georgia's territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagrationi dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/georgia.htm |script-title=ru:Георгиевский трактат|trans-title=Treaty of Georgievsk|date=24 July 1783|publisher=[[Moscow State University]]|accessdate=1 February 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian envoy in [[Saint Petersburg]] reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor Prince Kurakin.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1957), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1801, under the oversight of General Carl Heinrich von Knorring, Imperial Russia transferred power in eastern Georgia to the government headed by General [[Ivan Petrovich Lazarev]].&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until 12 April 1802, when Knorring assembled the nobility at the [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral|Sioni Cathedral]] and forced them to take an oath on the [[Imperial Crown of Russia]]. Those who disagreed were temporarily arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1957), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1805, Russian troops on the Askerani River near [[Zagam, Georgia|Zagam]] defeated the Iranian army during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]] and saved Tbilisi from reconquest now that it was officially part of the Imperial territories. Russian suzerainty over eastern Georgia was officially finalized with Iran in 1813 following the [[Treaty of Gulistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C.

The principality of [[Guria]] was abolished and incorporated into the Empire in 1829, while [[Svaneti]] was gradually annexed in 1858.

=== Declaration of independence ===
{{Main|Democratic Republic of Georgia}}

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] was established with [[Nikolay Chkheidze]] acting as its president. The federation consisted of three nations: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. As the Ottomans advanced into the Caucasian territories of the crumbling Russian Empire, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918. The [[Menshevik]] [[Social Democratic Party of Georgia]] won the parliamentary election and its leader, [[Noe Zhordania]], became prime minister. Despite the Soviet takeover, [[Noe Jordania]] was recognized as the legitimate head of the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile|Georgian Government]] by France, UK, Belgium, and Poland through the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Talmon (1998), ''Recognition of Governments in International Law'', p. 289–290. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-826573-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1918 [[Georgian–Armenian War]], which erupted over parts of Georgian provinces populated mostly by Armenians, ended because of British intervention. In 1918–1919, Georgian general [[Giorgi Mazniashvili]] led an attack against the [[White Army]] led by Moiseev and Denikin in order to claim the [[Black Sea]] coastline from [[Tuapse]] to [[Sochi]] and [[Adlersky City District|Adler]] for the independent Georgia.&lt;ref name="shirokov"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Широков|first1=И.

=== Georgia in the Soviet Union ===

[[Image:Ordzhonikidze, Stalin and Mikoyan, 1925.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]] in Tbilisi, 1925]]

In February 1921, during the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army advanced into Georgia]] and brought the local Bolsheviks to power. The Georgian army was defeated and the Social Democratic government fled the country. On [[Soviet Occupation Day, Georgia|25 February 1921]], the Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a government of workers' and peasants' [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] with [[Filipp Makharadze]] as acting head of state. Georgia was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], alongside [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], in 1921 which in 1922 would become a founding member of the Soviet Union.

There remained significant opposition to the Bolsheviks in Georgia, which was unindustrialized and viewed as socially backward, and this culminated in the [[August Uprising]] of 1924. Soviet rule was firmly established only after the insurrection was swiftly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Amy. ''Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant'', [[Princeton University Press]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], p. 237, {{ISBN|978-0-691-01093-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia would remain an unindustrialized periphery of the USSR until the [[first five-year plan]] when it would become a major center for textile goods. Later, in 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved and Georgia emerged as a [[union republic]]: the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

[[Joseph Stalin]], an ethnic Georgian born Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili (იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი) in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], was prominent among the Bolsheviks. Stalin was to rise to the highest position, leading the Soviet Union from 3 April 1922 until his death on 5 March 1953.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In June 1941, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Operation Barbarosa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on an immediate course towards Caucasian oil fields and munitions factories. They never reached Georgia, however, and almost 700,000 Georgians fought in the Red Army to repel the invaders and advance towards Berlin. Of them, an estimated 350,000 were killed.

After Stalin's death, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the leader of the Soviet Union and implemented a policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. This was nowhere else more publicly and violently opposed than in Georgia, where in 1956 riots broke out upon the release of Khruschev's [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|public denunciation of Stalin]] and led to the death of nearly 100 students.

Throughout the remainder of the Soviet period, Georgia's economy continued to grow and experience significant improvement, though it increasingly exhibited blatant corruption and alienation of the government from the people. With the beginning of [[perestroika]] in 1986, the Georgian Communist leadership proved so incapable of handling the changes that most Georgians, including [[wikt:Special:Search/rank and file|rank and file]] Communists, concluded that the only way forward was a break from the existing Soviet system.

=== Georgia after restoration of independence ===

On 9 April 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Council (Georgia)|Supreme Council]] of Georgia declared independence after a [[Georgian independence referendum, 1991|referendum]] held on 31 March 1991.&lt;ref name="GovtofGeorgia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=193 |title=Government of Georgia:About Georgia|publisher=gov.ge |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May 1991, [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia|Gamsakhurdia]] was elected as the first President of independent Georgia. Gamsakhurdia stoked Georgian nationalism and vowed to assert Tbilisi's authority over regions such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia that had been classified as autonomous [[oblast]]s under the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

He was soon deposed in a bloody ''coup d'état'', from 22 December 1991 to 6 January 1992. The coup was instigated by part of the National Guards and a paramilitary organization called "[[Mkhedrioni]]" ("horsemen"). The country became embroiled in a bitter [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]], which lasted until nearly 1995. [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1985 to 1991) returned to Georgia in 1992 and joined the leaders of the coup—[[Tengiz Kitovani]] and [[Jaba Ioseliani]]—to head a triumvirate called "The State Council".{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Simmering disputes within two regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and [[South Ossetia]], between local separatists and the majority Georgian populations, erupted into widespread inter-ethnic violence and wars. Supported by Russia, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia achieved ''de facto'' independence from Georgia, with Georgia retaining control only in small areas of the disputed territories. In 1995, Shevardnadze was officially elected as president of Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Georgia, Tbilisi - Rose Revolution (2003).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rose Revolution]], 2003]]

During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)]], roughly 230,000 to 250,000 Georgians&lt;ref name="hrwreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Georgia2.htm |title= Georgia/Abchasia: Violations of the laws of war and Russia's role in the conflict |date= March 1995 |publisher=Hrw.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; were expelled from Abkhazia by Abkhaz separatists and North Caucasian volunteers (including Chechens). Around 23,000 Georgians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Human Rights Watch/Helsinki |url= http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Russia.htm |title=Russia – The Ingush–Ossetian conflict in the Prigorodnyi region |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; fled South Ossetia as well, and many Ossetian families were forced to abandon their homes in the [[Borjomi]] region and moved to Russia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2003, Shevardnadze (who won re-election in 2000) was deposed by the [[Rose Revolution]], after Georgian opposition and international monitors asserted that 2 November parliamentary elections were marred by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav112204a.shtml |title=EurasiaNet Eurasia Insight – Georgia's Rose Revolution: Momentum and Consolidation |publisher=Eurasianet.org |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution was led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], [[Zurab Zhvania]] and [[Nino Burjanadze]], former members and leaders of Shevardnadze's ruling party. Mikheil Saakashvili was elected as President of Georgia in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabula.ge/ge/elections-2016/history|title=არჩევნების ისტორია|publisher=Tabula|date=17 August 2016|access-date=2 November 2017}}{{ka-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Rose Revolution, a series of reforms were launched to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities. The new government's efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of [[Ajaria]] led to a major [[Ajaria Crisis|crisis]] early in 2004. Success in Ajaria encouraged Saakashvili to intensify his efforts, but without success, in breakaway South Ossetia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

These events, along with accusations of Georgian involvement in the [[Second Chechen War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last= Gorshkov | first= Nikolai | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/2269057.stm | title= Duma prepares for Georgia strike |work=BBC News  | date= 19 September 2002 | accessdate= 24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a severe deterioration of [[Georgian-Russian relations|relations with Russia]], fuelled also by Russia's open assistance and support to the two secessionist areas. Despite these increasingly difficult relations, in May 2005 Georgia and Russia reached a bilateral agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=10007 |title=Russia, Georgia strike deal on bases |publisher=Civil Georgia, Tbilisi |date =30 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which Russian military bases (dating back to the Soviet era) in [[Batumi]] and [[Akhalkalaki]] were withdrawn.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Georgia (country)}}
Georgia is a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[semi-presidential]] [[republic]], with the [[President of Georgia|President]] as the head of state, and Prime Minister as the head of government. The executive branch of power is made up of the President and the [[Cabinet of Georgia]]. The Cabinet is composed of ministers, headed by the [[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]], and appointed by the President.&lt;ref name="Nakashidze2016" /&gt; Notably, the [[Ministry of Defense of Georgia|Ministers of Defense]] and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia|Interior]] are not members of the Cabinet and are subordinated directly to the President of Georgia. [[Giorgi Margvelashvili]] is the current President of Georgia after winning 62.12% of the vote in the [[Georgian presidential election, 2013|2013 election]]. Since 2015, [[Giorgi Kvirikashvili]] has been the Prime Minister of Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Parliament of Georgia in Kutaisi.jpg|thumb|Georgian parliament building in Kutaisi]]
[[Legislature|Legislative]] authority is vested in the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. It is unicameral and has 150 members, known as deputies, of whom 75 are elected by plurality to represent single-member districts, and 75 are chosen to represent parties by proportional representation. Members of parliament are elected for four-year terms. Five parties and electoral blocs had representatives elected to the parliament in the [[Georgian legislative election, 2008|2008 elections]]: the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] (governing party), The Joint Opposition, the [[Christian-Democratic Movement (Georgia)|Christian-Democrats]], the [[Georgian Labour Party|Labour Party]] and [[Republican Party of Georgia|Republican Party]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated a new Parliament building in the western city of [[Kutaisi]], in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |title=Georgia opens new parliament in Kutaisi, far from the capital |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}{{Dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|elections in October 2012]] resulted in the victory for the opposition "[[Georgian Dream|Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia]]" [[Coalition#Politics and government|coalition]], which President Saakashvili acknowledged on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Saakashvili Concedes Defeat in Parliamentary Election|newspaper=Civil|date=2 October 2012 |url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although considerable progress was made since the [[Rose revolution]], former President Mikheil Saakashvili stated in 2008 that Georgia is still not a "full-fledged, very well-formed, crystallized society."&lt;ref name=misha&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Leader: Country on Right Track |publisher=Fox News |date=7 January 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0,4670,GeorgiaPresidentialElection,00.html |accessdate=17 October 2008 |first=Lynn |last=Berry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108095512/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0%2C4670%2CGeorgiaPresidentialElection%2C00.html |archivedate=8 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political system remains in the process of transition, with frequent adjustments to the balance of power between the President and Parliament, and opposition proposals ranging from transforming the country into parliamentary republic to re-establishing the [[Monarchy of Georgia|monarchy]].&lt;ref name="GeorgiaToday"&gt;Zaza Jgharkava (18 October 2007).

Different opinions exist regarding the degree of political freedom in Georgia. Saakashvili believed in 2008 that the country is "on the road to becoming a European democracy."&lt;ref name= misha/&gt; [[Freedom House]] lists Georgia as a partly free country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2008 |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |accessdate=23 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110131211403/http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for 2012 parliamentary elections, Parliament adopted a new electoral code on 27 December 2011 that incorporated many recommendations from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Venice Commission. However, the new code failed to address the Venice Commission's primary recommendation to strengthen the equality of the vote by reconstituting single-mandate election districts to be comparable in size. On 28 December, Parliament amended the Law on Political Unions to regulate campaign and political party financing. Local and international observers raised concerns about several amendments, including the vagueness of the criteria for determining political bribery and which individuals and organizations would be subject to the law. {{as of|2012|March|}}, Parliament was discussing further amendments to address these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5253.htm |title=Georgia |publisher=State.gov |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing U.S. and European Union influence in Georgia, notably through proposed EU and NATO membership, the U.S. [[Georgia Train and Equip Program|Train and Equip]] military assistance program, and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] have frequently strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow. Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=8271 |title=U.S. Announces New Military Assistance Program for Georgia |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=1 July 2001 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia is currently working to become a full member of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]]. In August 2004, the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia was submitted officially to NATO. On 29 October 2004, the [[North Atlantic Council]] of NATO approved the [[NATO#International Partnership Action Plans|Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) of Georgia, and Georgia moved on to the second stage of Euro–Atlantic Integration. In 2005, by the decision of the President of Georgia, a state commission was set up to implement the Individual Partnership Action Plan, which presents an interdepartmental group headed by the Prime Minister. The Commission was tasked with coordinating and controlling the implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On 14 February 2005, the agreement on the appointment of [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) liaison officer between Georgia and NATO came into force, whereby a liaison officer for the South Caucasus was assigned to Georgia. On 2 March 2005, the agreement was signed on the provision of the host nation support to and transit of NATO forces and NATO personnel. On 6–9 March 2006, the IPAP implementation interim assessment team arrived in Tbilisi. On 13 April 2006, the discussion of the assessment report on implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan was held at NATO Headquarters, within 26+1 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=89&amp;lang_id=ENG |title=Georgia's way to NATO |publisher=Mfa.gov.ge |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=2 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827220629/http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?sec_id=89&amp;lang_id=ENG |archivedate=27 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Georgian parliament voted unanimously for the bill which calls for integration of Georgia into NATO.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The majority of Georgians and politicians in Georgia support the push for NATO membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/NDI_November%202016%20poll_press%20release_ENG.pdf |title=NDI Poll: Economy Still Top Concern for Georgians; Support for NATO and EU Stable |publisher=National Democratic Institute |date=16 January 2017 |accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, law enforcement is conducted and provided for by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia. In recent years, the Patrol Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has undergone a radical transformation, with the police having now absorbed a great many duties previously performed by dedicated independent government agencies. New duties performed by the police include border security and customs functions and contracted security provision; the latter function is performed by the dedicated 'security police'. Intelligence collecting in the interests of national security is now the remit of the [[Georgian Intelligence Service]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Georgia is divided into 9 regions, 1 city, and 2 autonomous republics.&lt;ref name="CIA Factbook Georgia"/&gt; These in turn are subdivided into 67 [[Districts of Georgia (country)|districts]] and 12 self-governing cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mreg.reestri.gov.ge/|title=Registry of Municipalities|publisher=National Agency of Public Registry|accessdate=23 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020853/https://mreg.reestri.gov.ge/|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia contains two official autonomous regions, of which one has declared independence.

[[South Ossetia]] is officially known by Georgia as the Tskinvali region, as it views "South Ossetia" as implying political bonds with Russian [[North Ossetia]].&lt;ref name="BBC South Ossetia"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3797729.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Regions and territories: South Ossetia | date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called [[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] when Georgia was part of Soviet Union. Its autonomous status was revoked in 1990. De facto separate since Georgian independence, offers were made to give South Ossetia autonomy again, but in 2006 an unrecognised referendum in the area resulted in a vote for independence.&lt;ref name="BBC South Ossetia"/&gt;

In both Abkhazia and South Ossetia large numbers of people had been given Russian passports, some through a process of forced [[passportization]] by Russian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/home/73289 |title=Human Rights in the Occupied Territories of Georgia |publisher=Osce.org |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was used as a justification for Russian invasion of Georgia during the 2008 South Ossetia war after which Russia recognised the region's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Russian Passportization |url=http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/russian-passportization/|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia considers the regions as occupied by Russia.&lt;ref name="parliament.ge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19330 Abkhazia, S.

[[Adjara]] under local strongman [[Aslan Abashidze]] maintained close ties with Russia and allowed a Russian military base to be maintained in Batumi. Upon the election of Mikheil Saakashvili in 2004 tensions rose between Abashidze and the Georgian government, leading to demonstrations in Adjara and the resignation and flight of Abashidze. The region retains autonomy, as a sign of Ajaria's reconnection with the central Georgian government, the Georgian Constitutional Court was moved from T'bilisi to Batumi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3520322.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Regions and territories: Ajaria | date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bisected by the Caucasus Mountains; the area north of the Greater Caucasus range is called Ciscaucasia and the region to the south Transcaucasia.

Because of a complex geographic setting, mountains also isolate the northern region of [[Svaneti]] from the rest of Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range forms the northern border of Georgia.&lt;ref name="Cac"/&gt; The main roads through the mountain range into Russian territory lead through the Roki Tunnel between [[Shida Kartli]] and North Ossetia and the [[Darial Gorge]] (in the Georgian region of [[Khevi]]). The Roki Tunnel was vital for the Russian military in the [[2008 Russo-Georgian War]] because it is the only direct route through the Caucasus Mountains. The southern portion of the country is bounded by the [[Lesser Caucasus|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Cac"/&gt; The [[Greater Caucasus|Greater Caucasus Mountain Range]] is much higher in elevation than the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, with the highest peaks rising more than {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The highest mountain in Georgia is Mount [[Shkhara]] at {{convert|5068|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, and the second highest is Mount Janga ([[Dzhangi–Tau]]) at {{convert|5059|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.

The region between [[Kazbek]] and Shkhara (a distance of about {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers. Out of the 2,100 glaciers that exist in the Caucasus today, approximately [[Glaciers of Georgia|30% are located within Georgia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Tusheti, Georgia — Omalo area.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tusheti]] region in northeast Georgia]]

The term Lesser Caucasus Mountains is often used to describe the mountainous (highland) areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range.&lt;ref name="Cac"/&gt; The area can be split into two separate sub-regions; the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, which run parallel to the Greater Caucasus Range, and the [[Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland]], which lies immediately to the south of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The overall region can be characterized as being made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of volcanic origin) and plateaus that do not exceed {{convert|3400|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation. Prominent features of the area include the [[Javakheti Volcanic Plateau]], lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs. Two major [[List of rivers of Georgia (country)|rivers in Georgia]] are the [[Rioni River|Rioni]] and the [[Mtkvari River|Mtkvari]]. The Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland is a young and unstable geologic region with high seismic activity and has experienced some of the most significant earthquakes that have been recorded in Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Krubera Cave]] is the deepest known cave in the world. It is located in the [[Arabika Massif]] of the [[Gagra Range]], in Abkhazia. In 2001, a Russian–Ukrainian team had set the world depth record for a cave at {{convert|1710|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. In 2004, the penetrated depth was increased on each of three expeditions, when a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team crossed the {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} mark for the first time in the history of [[speleology]]. In October 2005, an unexplored part was found by the CAVEX team, further increasing the known depth of the cave.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Physical Map of Georgia (en).svg|thumb|Physical map of Georgia]]
The landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied. Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and [[temperate rainforest]]s to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi-arid plains. Forests cover around 40% of Georgia's territory while the [[alpine tundra|alpine]]/[[subalpine zone|subalpine]] zone accounts for roughly around 10 percent of the land.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past 100 years because of the agricultural development of the land and urbanization. The large majority of the forests that covered the Colchis plain are now virtually non-existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves (e.g. [[Lake Paliastomi]] area). At present, the forest cover generally remains outside of the low-lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains. Western Georgia's forests consist mainly of deciduous trees below {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and contain species such as [[oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[Oriental Beech|beech]], [[elm]], [[ash tree|ash]], and [[Sweet Chestnut|chestnut]].

The west-central slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] in [[Ajaria]] as well as several locations in Samegrelo and Abkhazia are covered by [[temperate rain forests]]. Between {{convert|600|-|1000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, the deciduous forest becomes mixed with both broad-leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life. The zone is made up mainly of beech, [[Caucasian Spruce|spruce]], and [[Nordmann Fir|fir]] forests. From {{convert|1500|-|1800|m|ft|0}}, the forest becomes largely coniferous. The tree line generally ends at around {{convert|1800|m|ft|0}} and the alpine zone takes over, which in most areas, extends up to an elevation of {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the 3,000 metre line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Eastern Georgia's landscape (referring to the territory east of the [[Likhi Range]]) is considerably different from that of the west, although, much like the Colchis plain in the west, nearly all of the low-lying areas of eastern Georgia including the [[Mtkvari]] and [[Alazani]] River plains have been deforested for agricultural purposes. In addition, because of the region's relatively drier climate, some of the low-lying plains (especially in Kartli and south-eastern Kakheti) were never covered by forests in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains. In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85 percent of the forests of the region are deciduous. Coniferous forests only dominate in the [[Borjomi Gorge]] and in the extreme western areas. Out of the deciduous species of trees, [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[hornbeam]] dominate. Other deciduous species include several varieties of [[maple]], [[aspen]], ash, and [[hazelnut]]. The Upper Alazani River Valley contains [[Taxus baccata|yew]] forests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

At higher elevations above {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (particularly in the [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], and [[Khevi]] regions), [[Scots Pine|pine]] and [[birch]] forests dominate. In general, the forests in eastern Georgia occur between {{convert|500|-|2000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with the alpine zone extending from 2,000–2,300 to 3,000–3,500 metres (6,562–7,546 to 9,843–11,483&amp;nbsp;ft). The only remaining large, low-land forests remain in the [[Alazani]] Valley of Kakheti. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|adj=on}} line in most areas of eastern Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Georgia (country)}}
The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size. There are two main climatic zones, roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Batumi Botanical Garden. Black Sea.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Batumi]], western Georgia]]

Much of western Georgia lies within the northern periphery of the humid subtropical zone with annual precipitation ranging from {{convert|1000|–|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The precipitation tends to be uniformly distributed throughout the year, although the rainfall can be particularly heavy during the Autumn months. The climate of the region varies significantly with elevation and while much of the lowland areas of western Georgia are relatively warm throughout the year, the foothills and mountainous areas (including both the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains) experience cool, wet summers and snowy winters (snow cover often exceeds 2 meters in many regions). Ajaria is the wettest region of the [[Caucasus]], where the Mt. Mtirala [[temperate rain forest|rainforest]], east of [[Kobuleti]], receives around {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental. The region's weather patterns are influenced both by dry Caspian air masses from the east and humid Black Sea air masses from the west. The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea is often blocked by mountain ranges ([[Likhi Range|Likhi]] and [[Meskheti]]) that separate the eastern and western parts of the nation. Annual precipitation is considerably less than that of western Georgia and ranges from {{convert|400|–|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The wettest periods generally occur during spring and autumn, while winter and summer months tend to be the driest. Much of eastern Georgia experiences hot summers (especially in the low-lying areas) and relatively cold winters. As in the western parts of the nation, elevation plays an important role in eastern Georgia where climatic conditions above {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}} are considerably colder than in the low-lying areas. The regions that lie above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} frequently experience frost even during the summer months.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Biodiversity ===

Because of its high landscape diversity and low latitude, Georgia is home to about 5,601 species of animals, including 648 species of [[vertebrates]] (more than 1% of the species found worldwide) and many of these species are endemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversity-georgia.net/index.php?taxon=Chordata |title=  Eucariota, Animalia, Chordata |publisher=Institute of Ecology |date=2015 |website=Georgian Biodiversity Database |access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of large [[carnivores]] live in the forests, namely [[Brown bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[lynx]]es and [[Caucasian leopard|Caucasian Leopards]]. The [[common pheasant]] (also known as the Colchian Pheasant) is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced throughout the rest of the world as an important [[game bird]]. The species number of [[invertebrates]] is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications. The [[spider]] checklist of Georgia, for example, includes 501 species.&lt;ref name="Caucasus-spiders.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caucasus-spiders.info/introduction/checklists/ |title=Caucasian Spiders " CHECKLISTS &amp; MAPS |publisher=Caucasus-spiders.info |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328225817/http://caucasus-spiders.info/introduction/checklists/ |archivedate=28 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slightly more than 6,500 species of [[Fungus|fungi]], including lichen-forming species, have been recorded from Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;Nakhutsrishvili, I.G. ["Flora of Spore Producing Plants of Georgia (Summary)"]. 888 pp., Tbilisi, Academy of Science of the Georgian SSR, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cybertruffle1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/robigalia/eng/index.htm |title=Cybertruffle's Robigalia – Observations of fungi and their associated organisms |publisher=cybertruffle.org.uk |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species occurring in Georgia, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about seven percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. "Dictionary of the Fungi". Edn 10. CABI, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Georgia, and 2,595 species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/gruzfung/eng/endelist.htm |title=Fungi of Georgia – potential endemics |publisher=cybertruffle.org.uk |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,729 species of plants have been recorded from Georgia in association with fungi.&lt;ref name="cybertruffle1"/&gt; The true number of plant species occurring in Georgia is likely to be substantially higher.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

For much of the 20th century, Georgia's economy was within the Soviet model of [[command economy]]. Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Georgia embarked on a major structural reform designed to transition to a [[free market]] economy. As with all other [[post-Soviet states]], Georgia faced a severe economic collapse. The civil war and military conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia aggravated the crisis. The agriculture and industry output diminished.

Traditionally the country was located on an important north-south trade route between [[European Russia]] and the [[Near East]] and Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In recent years Georgia has invested large amounts of money in the modernization of its transport networks. The construction of new highways has been prioritized and, as such, major cities like Tbilisi have seen the quality of their roads improve dramatically; despite this however, the quality of inter-city routes remains poor and to date only one [[motorway]]-standard road has been constructed – the ს 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georoad.ge/?que=eng/statistics/roads |title=Roads Department of Georgia |publisher=Georoad.ge |date= |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian railways represent an important transport artery for the Caucasus as they make up the largest proportion of a route linking the Black and [[Caspian Sea]]s, this in turn has allowed them to benefit in recent years from increased energy exports from neighbouring Azerbaijan to the European Union, Ukraine and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.ge/?web=0&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=407&amp;lang=eng |title=Georgian Railway |publisher=Railway.ge |date= |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger services are operated by the state-owned [[Georgian Railways]] whilst freight operations are carried out by a number of licensed operators.

Religious minorities of Georgia include Muslims (10.7 percent), [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christians]] (2.9 percent) and Roman Catholics (0.5 percent).&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt;{{refn|name=a|group=n}} 0.7 percent of those recorded in the 2014 census declared themselves to be adherents of other religions, 1.2 percent refused or did not state their religion and 0.5 percent declared no religion at all.&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt;

[[Islam in Georgia (country)|Islam]] is represented by both Azerbaijani [[Shia]] Muslims (in the south-east) ethnic Georgian [[Sunni]] Muslims in Adjara, and [[Laz language|Laz]]-speaking Sunni Muslims as well as Sunni [[Meskhetian Turks]] along the border with Turkey. In [[Abkhazia]], a minority of the Abkhaz population is also Sunni Muslim, alongside the faithful of the revived [[Abkhaz neopaganism|Abkhaz pagan faith]]. There are also smaller communities of [[Greek Muslims]] (of [[Pontic Greek]] origin) and [[Armenian Muslims]], both of whom are descended from Ottoman-era converts to Turkish Islam from [[Eastern Anatolia]] who settled in Georgia following the [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign]] that led to the Ottoman conquest of the country in 1578. Georgian Jews trace the history of their community to the 6th century BC; their numbers have dwindled in the last decades due to high levels of immigration to [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Dan Norman.

=== Architecture and arts ===
[[File:Hpim3433.jpg|thumb|Old Tbilisi – Architecture in Georgia is in many ways a fusion of European and Asian.]]
[[Architecture of Georgia (country)|Georgian architecture]] has been influenced by many civilizations. There are several different [[architectural styles]] for [[castles]], [[tower]]s, [[fortifications]] and [[Church (building)|churches]]. The [[Upper Svaneti]] fortifications, and the castle town of [[Shatili]] in [[Khevsureti]], are some of the finest examples of medieval Georgian [[castle architecture]]. Other architectural aspects of Georgia include [[Rustavelis Gamziri|Rustaveli]] avenue in Tbilisi in the [[Haussmannian architecture|Haussmann style]], and the [[Old Tbilisi|Old Town District]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Georgian [[ecclesiastic]] art is one of the most notable aspects of Georgian [[Christian architecture]], which combines the classical [[dome]] style with the original [[basilica]] style, forming what is known as the Georgian cross-dome style. Cross-dome architecture developed in Georgia during the 9th century; before that, most Georgian churches were basilicas. Other examples of Georgian [[ecclesiastic]] [[architecture]] can be found outside Georgia: [[Bachkovo Monastery]] in Bulgaria (built in 1083 by the Georgian military commander Grigorii Bakuriani), [[Iviron monastery]] in Greece (built by Georgians in the 10th century), and the [[Monastery of the Cross]] in Jerusalem (built by Georgians in the 9th century). One of the most famous late 19th/early 20th century Georgian artists was [[primitivist]] painter [[Niko Pirosmani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pirosmani.org/pirosmani/ |title=Niko Pirosmani – Short Biographical Information |publisher=Steele Communications  |website=Niko Pirosmani |access-date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian polyphony is based on three vocal parts, a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths, and a harmonic structure rich in parallel fifths and dissonances.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Three types of polyphony have developed in Georgia: a complex version in Svaneti, a dialogue over a bass background in the Kakheti region, and a three-part partially-improvised version in western Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgian Polyphonic Singing, "Chakrulo"|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;pg=33&amp;id=1737|accessdate=17 December 2016|work=UNESCO|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian folk song "[[Chakrulo]]" was one of 27 musical compositions included on the [[Voyager Golden Record]]s that were sent into space on [[Voyager 2]] on 20 August 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Untold Story of How "Chakrulo" Ended Up in Space|url=http://www.georgianjournal.ge/discover-georgia/28321-the-untold-story-of-how-chakrulo-ended-up-in-space.html|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=Georgian Journal|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgian cuisine]] and [[Georgian wine|wine]] have evolved through the centuries, adapting traditions in each era. One of the most unusual traditions of dining is [[Supra (feast)|supra]], or ''Georgian table'', which is also a way of socialising with friends and family. The head of ''supra'' is known as [[tamada]]. He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, [[khinkali]] (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and [[khachapuri]], mainly from [[Imereti]], [[Samegrelo]] and Adjara. In addition to traditional Georgian dishes, the foods of other countries have been brought to Georgia by immigrants from Russia, Greece, and recently China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Georgia vs Romania 2011 RWC (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgia]] vs. [[Romania]] in the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]]]]
The most popular sports in Georgia are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[rugby union]], [[wrestling]], [[judo]], and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]]. Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Romans erected the statue of the Iberian King Pharsman after he demonstrated Georgian training methods during his visit to Rome; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'', LXIX, 15.3&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia, and some historians think that the [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman style of wrestling]] incorporates many Georgian elements.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Douglas. ''Georgia in my Heart'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style. There were a number of other styles in the past that are not as widely used today. For example, the [[Khevsureti]] region of Georgia has three different styles of wrestling. Other popular sports in 19th century Georgia were [[polo]], and [[Lelo burti|Lelo]], a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Basketball]] was always one of the notable sports in Georgia, and Georgia had a few very famous [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union national team]] members, such as [[Otar Korkia]], [[Mikheil Korkia]], [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] and [[Levan Moseshvili]]. [[BC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] won the prestigious [[Euroleague]] competition in [[1961–62 FIBA European Champions Cup|1962]]. Georgia had five players in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]: [[Vladimir Stepania]], [[Jake Tsakalidis]], [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]], [[Tornike Shengelia]] and current [[Golden State Warriors]] center [[Zaza Pachulia]]. Other notable basketball players are two times Euroleague champion [[Giorgi Shermadini]] and Euroleague players [[Manuchar Markoishvili]] and [[Viktor Sanikidze]]. Sport is regaining its popularity in the country in recent years. [[Georgia national basketball team]] qualified to [[EuroBasket]] during the last three tournaments since 2011.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''Giriama''' (also called '''Giryama''') are one of the nine ethnic groups that make up the [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]] (which literally translates to "nine towns").

The Mijikenda occupy the coastal strip extending from [[Lamu]] in the north to the [[Kenya]]/[[Tanzania]] border in the south, and approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km inland. The Giriama are among the largest of these ethnic groups. They inhabit the area bordered by the coastal cities of [[Mombasa]] and [[Malindi]], and the inland towns or [[Mariakani]] and [[Kaloleni, Kenya|Kaloleni]]. 

The Giriama is one of the largest groups of the Mijikenda people in the back-up area of the Northeast coast of Kenya. The Giriama are subdivided into clans which include Thoya, Mweni, Nyundo, Nyale and so on.

In recent years, the Giriama have extended their living space down to the coast. They are now a big part of service employees in the growing tourism centres. Education programmes initiated by the state included building of central primary schools alongside the coast street. School attendance has become compulsory even for girls up to an age of 12 years. The continuous migration of Giriama to places such as Takaungu and Mtwapa has allowed them to get access to paid labour, hence they have become part of manpower resources, which were once dominated by the Chonyi. 
The relationship of the Giriama to other Mijikenda groups such as the Ribe, Rabai, Digo and Duruma is rather loose. The Kamba and Jigana have mixed with the coastal population in recent decades. Only a very few villages could sustain them. The Kauma have also been assimilated. The area around the Kilifi Creek is inhabited by Giriama up to nearly 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Studies on Musical Diversity – Methodological Approaches, UPM Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their language is called '''Kigiriama''', or '''Kigiryama''', and is a sub-language of the [[Kimijikenda]]. The nine Mijikenda groups speak closely related languages, all types of [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], which is the same group to which the more widely known [[Swahili language|Swahili]] belongs. The Giriama grow crops to sell and partake in subsistence agriculture.

The Giriama people experience [[spirit possession]]. &lt;ref&gt;Reluctant Muslims: Embodied Hegemony and Moral Resistance in a Giriama Spirit Possession Janet McIntosh The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp.91-112&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verification needed|date=November 2015}}

'''Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries''' ('''HelMet''') is a [[library]] network in [[Finland]]. It consists of the city libraries of [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]], [[Kauniainen]], and [[Vantaa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iii.com/news/pr_display.php?id=559 | title=Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries (Finland) Upgrades to Sierra Services Platform | publisher=Innovative | type=Press release | date=5 February 2013 | accessdate=1 August 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044631/http://www.iii.com/news/pr_display.php?id=559 | archivedate=8 August 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network and operation==
All libraries in HelMet have common operating rules, procedures, and services.&lt;ref name="Library-card-and-loans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helmet.fi/en-US/Info/Using_the_library/Library_card_and_loans%28950%29 |title=Library card and loans |publisher=HelMet|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same library card can be used at any library in the network. Patrons can request material from any library in the network. They can also return and renew materials at any library in the network.

The HelMet network consists of 63 locations and six library buses.&lt;ref name="What-is-HelMet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helmet.fi/en-US/Info/What_is_HelMet |title=What is HelMet? |publisher= HelMet |accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional book storage facility is located at the Main Library in [[Pasila]]. The 844 m² storage facility's collection includes more than 200 000 books and over 900 magazine annual volumes. Music related materials are stored at the Tikkurila Library in [[Tikkurila]].

==History==
The libraries of the [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area]] have been working together since 1976.{{fact|date=August 2014}} At the time, they purchased their first common computer-based circulation system. In the 1980s, customers were given regionally common library cards.

In 2002, the third joint library data management system was taken into use.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Experiences from using the system and its capabilities inspired closer cooperation within the library network. This led to the creation of a common collection, which is now in constant use by the whole population of the [[Greater Helsinki|Capital Region]].

According to a study conducted by Taloustutkimus, HelMet was Finland's second most valued online brand in 2012, bested only by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taloustutkimus.fi/ajankohtaista/uutiskirje/uutiskirje-8-2012/google-jo-kymmenen-vuotta-suomen/ |title= Google jo kymmenen vuotta Suomen arvostetuin verkkobrändi |publisher=Taloustutkimus |date= |accessdate=2014-09-26 |language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Lee''' is an [[Antarctic]] researcher, best known for her work on invasion biology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2010/01/21/antarctica-no-place-for-old-socks---or-alien-seed|title=Antarctica no place for old socks - or alien seed|website=Business Day Live|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the Environment Officer in the Government of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.gs/information/personnel/|title=Personnel|website=www.gov.gs|publisher=Government of South Georgia &amp; the South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lee grew up in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], UK. She received her PhD from the Centre for Invasion Biology, [[Stellenbosch University]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.south-atlantic-research.org/our-people/research-fellows/68-jenniferlee|title=Dr Jennifer Lee|last=Blockley|first=David|website=www.south-atlantic-research.org|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Invasion Biology, Stellenbosch University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="antarctica.gov.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/magazine/2011-2015/issue-21-2011/subantarctic-forum/preventing-a-marine-invasion-in-the-subantarctic|title=Preventing a marine invasion in the subantarctic|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and impact==
Lee is an ecologist and has focused on [[Antarctic]] and [[sub-Antarctic]] systems since 2006.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lee has diverse interests including invasion biology,&lt;ref name="antarctica.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Preventing a marine invasion in the sub-Antarctic|url=http://www.ecosmagazine.com/?paper=EC11072|journal=ECOS|language=en|volume=2011|issue=164|doi=10.1071/EC11072}}&lt;/ref&gt; population genetics,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.sun.ac.za/cib/news/news_cib_postdoc_scar_fellowship.htm|title=CIB DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology|website=academic.sun.ac.za|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; species distribution modelling and invertebrate physiology. Her  research on alien species in Antarctica influenced global thinking about the risks posed by the increased presence of alien vegetation due to [[Tourism in Antarctica|Antarctic tourism]] and [[Research stations in Antarctica|Antarctic research teams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lee has completed several field seasons on [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]] and three field seasons in the Antarctic; for two of these Antarctic field seasons she was the field operator, making her the first woman field operator for the [[South African National Antarctic Programme]] (SANAP). She was also the second woman Chief Scientist for land based science during a field season to Marion Island.

Lee moved to the [[Falkland Islands]] to begin work as the Environment Officer in the Government of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] in early 2012.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.gs/information/personnel/|title=Personnel {{!}} Government of South Georgia &amp; the South Sandwich Islands|website=www.gov.gs|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is works on projects to eradicate non-native plants and animals (including rats and [[Reindeer in South Georgia|reindeer]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/10648170/Thousands-of-reindeer-culled-in-UK-territory.html|title=Thousands of reindeer culled in UK territory|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; from South Georgia, and then monitors ecosystem recovery after removal of these pest species. She uses her research to help inform management decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Lee was the first scientist from a South African Institute to be awarded a highly competititve [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] (SCAR) fellowship.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan region]]'s '''gross domestic product''', or '''GDP''', is one of several measures of the size of its economy. Similar to GDP, [[Gross Regional Product|GRP]] is defined as the market value of all final goods and services produced within a metropolitan area in a given period of time. In this case the statistics of [[Eurostat]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/region_cities/city_urban/data_cities/database_sub1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124191101/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/region_cities/city_urban/data_cities/database_sub1 |archivedate=24 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }} European Commission, Regions and cities Database&lt;/ref&gt; Urban Audit for [[Larger Urban Zones]] have been used.

== List of gross domestic products in EU metropolitan areas ==

The table below shows data from [[Eurostat]]'s [[Urban Audit]] program and participating [[Larger Urban Zone]]s (LUZs). Nationally established and/or recognized metropolitan areas may take preference, if equivalent to correspondingly joined Larger Urban Areas. As the Urban Audit program collects comparable data from national statistics offices only, some data may be missing.

'''Moviment Graffitti''' is a [[Malta|Maltese]] [[pressure group]] promoting an amalgamation of [[leftist]] sociopolitical ideas, mainly [[human rights]], [[social equality|equality]], [[environmentalism]] and [[anti-fascism]]. It was founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/86137/moviment_graffitti_since_1994_fighting_the_power#.WwZjHUiFOUk&lt;/ref&gt;



== Ideals and Objectives ==

Moviment Graffitti stands for social justice, equality and sustainability. This entails supporting and lobbying for fairer workers’ rights such as an increase in the minimum wage and working towards a new and equal economic system in which exploitation has no place. This includes standing against the destruction of the environment, illegal developments and the privatisation of public spaces. 

Moviment Graffitti stands for the well-being of all humanity and thus, for the right of migration for all and against a world with man-made borders. An important part of standing for a more just world is actively working to eradicate racism and xenophobia by organising actions and information campaigns as well as pushing for migrants’ rights. One campaign that the movement feels strongly about is showing international solidarity with the plight of Palestinians by raising awareness of the cruel and constant injustice and discrimination they face everyday at the hands of the Israeli state.

== How their goals are achieved ==

Moviment Graffitti utilizes a number of different strategies in its work. It has often taken a pro-active role in forming coalitions and building networks that bring together different organisations and individuals to work as a common front on issues such as racism, destruction of natural landscape and animal rights. It has regularly supported workers’ struggles and voiced its stance in favour of workers’ rights. 

Moviment Graffitti frequently holds awareness-raising campaigns where it distributes information and engages in discussions in public spaces and other venues such as University, schools and youth centres. 

Direct actions are also used to draw the public’s attention to specific issues. These consist in activities like banner-drops and sit-ins. Moviment Graffitti has also coordinated several protests in relation to pressing issues being faced at a particular point in time, such as war, racist incidents and projects damaging the environment.

Decisions within the movement are taken during regular meetings where anyone who shares the organisation’s vision and principles can attend and contribute. Moviment Graffitti’s activities are self-funded by the organisation through membership-payment and fund-raising events held throughout the year.

'''Pendergardens''' is a [[Real estate development|development]] in [[St. Julian's]], [[Malta]], consisting of a number of apartments, retail outlets and office space.

==Planning and construction==
In 2005, a consortium of investors formed Pender Ville Ltd to acquire and develop the Pender Place and Mercury House sites in St. Julian's. {{convert|4,300|m2|abbr=on}} of the Pender Place site were sold to a related company in 2008, and part of the Mercury House site was sold to [[Fimbank|FIMbank]] the following year. The remaining parts of Pender Place are new being developed into Pendergardens, while the Mercury House site is being developed into The Exchange. Pendergardens includes a residential development, while The Exchange focuses solely on commercial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Background|url=http://www.pendergardens.com/content.aspx?id=268933|website=Pendergardens|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 1 of the development, which includes 150 residential apartments spread out over 6 [[low-rise]] blocks and an underlying car park, is now complete. Phase 2, which consists of two residential blocks, two towers and another car park, is currently under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phase Two of Pendergardens Onto a Promising Start|url=http://www.pendergardens.com/content.aspx?id=375674|accessdate=4 September 2015|website=Pendergardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Exchange==
The Exchange is situated across the road from Pendergardens. It is a financial and business centre, housing the [[Fimbank|FIMbank]] Global Headquarters. Excluding FIMbank, The Exchange includes {{convert|16,700|m2|abbr=on}} of office space in two towers and {{convert|10,800|m2|abbr=on}} of managed, mixed, retail and leisure outlets fronting a large public piazza.&lt;ref name=theexchange&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.exchangemalta.com/exchange/|website=The Exchange Financial &amp; Business Centre|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Reflector became one of the first of bands (which many in China consider to be "punk") from [[China]] to tour the [[United States]]; the band performed in seven West Coast cities, including a gig in [[Sacramento]] opening for former punk band [[Anti-Flag]].  

The band performed at [[Cui Jian]]'s 2003 [[Live Vocals festival]], and in the [[Midi Music Festival|2003 Midi Music Festival]].

'''Latvian [[rock and roll|rock]]''' has been an important part of [[Latvia]]'s music scene since the 1980s, when it was a part of the discontents of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.

The city of [[Liepāja]] has an especially active rock scene. [[Līvi (band)|Līvi]], [[Credo (band)|Credo]] and [[Remix]] are from [[Liepāja]], as are rock composers [[Imants Kalniņš]] and [[Zigmars Liepiņš]].

In the 1980s, [[Pērkons (band)|Pērkons]] played a pompous sort of hard rock that was popular with audiences. Underground studio-based groups [[NSRD]] and [[Dzeltenie Pastnieki]] introduced extensive use of electronic instrumentation, while [[Zig Zag (Latvian band)|Zig Zag]] and [[Aurora (Latvian band)|Aurora]] brought guitar-based [[post-punk]] tendencies (though about ten years after the fact).

In 1988, [[rock opera]] [[Lāčplēsis (rock opera)|Lāčplēsis]] by Zigmars Liepiņš and Māra Zālīte, based on the [[Lāčplēsis|national epic]], became a hit, with [[Igo_(singer)|Igo (Rodrigo Fomins)]] in the title role of Lāčplēsis.

[[Inokentijs Mārpls]], [[Baložu Pilni Pagalmi]] and [[Sirke]] are among the most important acts within the later alternative scene.

In the 2000s [[Olive Mess]] reached international success in the  [[progressive rock]] scene.

The '''Soninke''', also called '''Sarakole''', '''Seraculeh''', or '''Serahuli''', are a [[West Africa]]n ethnic group found in eastern [[Senegal]] and its capital [[Dakar]], northwestern [[Mali]] and Foute Djalon in [[Guinea]], and southern [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph A.

Soninke people were the founders of the ancient [[Ghana Empire|empire of Ghana]] c. AD 750-1240. Subgroups of Soninke include the [[Maraka]] and [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]]. When the Ghana empire dispersed, the resulting [[diaspora]] brought Soninkes to Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, Gambia, Burkina Faso, [[Ghana]], and [[Guinea-Bissau]] where some of this trading diaspora was called Wangara.&lt;ref name="Hunwick2003xxviii"&gt;{{cite book|author=John O.

Predominantly Muslims, the Soninke were one of the early ethnic groups from Sub-Saharan [[West Africa]] to convert to [[Islam]] in about the 10th century.&lt;ref name=asante121/&gt; The contemporary population of Soninke people is estimated to be over 2 million.&lt;ref name="DG2013soninke"/&gt; The cultural practices of Soninke people are similar to the [[Mandé]] peoples, and those of the [[Imraguen people|Imraguen]] of Mauritania. It includes traditional Islamic rites of marriage(s),&lt;ref name="Brand2001p69"/&gt; circumcision&lt;ref name="Ouldzeidoune2013"/&gt; and social stratification.&lt;ref name=gomez24/&gt;&lt;ref name=bella1987/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Soninke people}}
[[Image:BakelDiobé.jpg|thumb|right|Diobé, ruler of Soninke colonial era town of [[Bakel, Senegal|Bakel]], with his advisors (1887-1888)]]
Archaeological evidence suggests that the regions where Soninke people are found were inhabited in ancient times. These stone settlements were built on the rocky promontories of Tichit-Walata and the Tagant cliffs of Southern Mauritania. However, there are no surviving records to suggest which ethnic group these people were, but the settlers of this region by between 1000 BCE and 600 BCE were likely related to the Soninke people. A significant agro-pastoral society had developed in this prehistoric era.&lt;ref name=conrad23/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shillington2012p88"/&gt;

According to Soninke [[oral tradition]] history, the ancestor of the Soninke was Dinga, who came from the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David C. Conrad|title=Empires of Medieval West Africa: Ghana, Mali, and Songhay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mP2KSOvJHbMC&amp;pg=PA25 |year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-1-60413-164-2|pages=25 }}, Quote: "The legend often begins by describing how the ancestor Dinga came from somewhere in the Middle East."&lt;/ref&gt; His sons included Dyabe Sisse, the founder of the Wagadu kingdom with its capital at [[Koumbi Saleh|Kumbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia| title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|pages=16–18, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Soninke tradition indicates that they migrated from [[Aswan]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=cisse+aswan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc_M6G587XAhVFRN8KHTOIDqAQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cisse+aswan&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African American History [3 volumes]|first1=Leslie M.|last1=Alexander|first2=Walter C.

The early written records about Soninke come from early Islamic historians. The Soninke, according to these records, were the founders of the ancient [[Ghana Empire]] (not to be confused with modern Ghana), also called the Wagadu Empire.&lt;ref name=conrad23/&gt; This empire has roots in the 5th-century CE and was destroyed by about the 12th century,&lt;ref name=conrad23&gt;{{cite book|author=David C.

==Demographics and distribution==
[[Image:Soninke.gif|thumb|right|Map of the Soninke population centers in Mali]]
In contemporary time, the total population of Soninke people is above 2 million.&lt;ref name="DG2013soninke"/&gt; Soninke people are found throughout West Africa and in France, given their migration when Senegal and Mali were a part of the French colonial empire.&lt;ref name=dalby574/&gt;

Most of the Soninke people are found in the valley of the upper [[Senegal river]] and along the Mali – Senegal – Mauritania border between [[Nara, Mali|Nara]] and [[Nioro du Sahel]]. Migrations under [[French West Africa|French colonial rule]] have led many Soninke to build communities in [[Dakar]], other cities in Africa and in France. Soninke community were the early settlers in France, their community is found in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and in southern French cities, and their language is the primary dialect spoken among many Muslim communities of France.&lt;ref name=dalby574/&gt; There are also many Soninke living in cities throughout [[Central Africa]], a population that includes new migrants as well as descendants of migration dating back to the 1800s, such as the [[laptot]]s who represented French mercantile and colonial interests in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Manchuelle|title=Willing Migrants: Soninke Labor Diasporas, 1848-1960|url=http://www.ohioswallow.com/book/Willing+Migrants|year=1997|publisher=Ohio University Press|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022744/http://www.ohioswallow.com/book/Willing+Migrants|archivedate=2017-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade networks led by the ''Wangara'' mercantile confederations, spread Soninke people and culture throughout most of Mali and Senegal, southern Mauritania, northern Burkina Faso, as well as parts of [[the Gambia]], and Guinea-Bissau. The '''Maraka''' - Soninke merchant communities and plantations (centered just north of the city of [[Segou]], Mali) were an economic mainspring under the [[Bambara Empire]], and built trade routes in the West Africa region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Religion==
The Soninke people were a coastal trade link between the Berber people of [[Maghreb]] and the Empires in sub-Saharan West Africa. In their early history, they helped exchange salt from the north and western coast for gold found inland.&lt;ref name="Shillington2012p90"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Shillington|title=History of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdscBQAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-00333-1|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade brought Muslim traders to them, particularly Arab traders interested in gold, after Islam arrived in North Africa. The earliest passing mention of Soninke people's Ghana Empire is found in the 8th-century Arab geographer [[Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī]] and a more complete record found in another 11th-century Arab geographer [[Al-Bakri]].&lt;ref name="Shillington2012p90"/&gt;

The rulers and Soninke people of the Ghana Empire converted to Islam in the 11th century, and they have been Muslim ever since. Some Islamic sources suggest that the conversion was triggered after the 1076 [[Almoravid]] conquest of the Empire of Ghana.&lt;ref name=asante121&gt;Asante, Molefi Kete. ''The History of Africa: The Quest for Eternal Harmony''. New York: Routledge, 2007. 121-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soninke people, like other Mande peoples, subscribe to the [[Maliki]] school of [[Sunni]] Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

==Society and culture==
[[File:SarrakholaisCaravanier.jpg|thumb|180px|A Soninke man in 1890, sketched by M Philippe]]
The Soninke society and its culture has historically many cultural practices with its neighboring ethnic groups, particularly the Mande peoples. This includes the religion of Islam, occupations, foods, the rites of passage, family structure, weddings and social stratification.

===Social stratification===
Soninke society, like other groups in Mande and beyond, is shaped by various forms of social stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haddy Tunkara-Bah|year= 2016|title= Sociocultural factors influencing fertility among the Soninke| journal=African Renaissance| volume=13| number= 1-2|pages= 31–44}}, Quote: "The Soninke society in the Gambia is primarily rural and highly gender-stratified culture.

The Soninke strata have included a free category called ''Horro'' or ''Horon'', a caste system category called ''Namaxala'' or ''[[Nyamakala|Nyaxamalo]]'', and slaves called ''Komo''.&lt;ref name=tal61/&gt;&lt;ref name=gomez24&gt;{{cite book|author= Michael Gomez|title=Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad: The Precolonial State of Bundu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfhGouf7_TsC |year=2002 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52847-4| page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanretta2009p37"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Hanretta|title=Islam and Social Change in French West Africa: History of an Emancipatory Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Fj79QbyRJUC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89971-0|pages=37 with footnote 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jaara subgroup of the Soninke people, the nobility called ''Tunkanlenmu'' was another strata.&lt;ref name="Hanretta2009p37"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mamadou Lamine Diawara (1990), La Graine de la Parole: dimension sociale et politique des traditions orales du royaume de Jaara (Mali) du XVème au milieu du XIXème siècle, volume 92, Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH, pages 35-37, 41-45&lt;/ref&gt; The Soninke society became highly stratified after the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=tal61&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Tamari|editor=David C.

The slaves were the largest strata, one at the bottom among the Soninke like other West African ethnic groups, and constituted up to half of the population. The slaves among the Soninke people were hierarchically arranged into three strata.&lt;ref name="Littlefield1991p79"/&gt; The village slaves were a privileged servile group who lived apart from the village and took orders from the village chief. The domestic slaves lived in with a family and could not be sold. The lowest level among slaves were the trade slaves who could be bought and sold. With time, each of these strata became [[endogamous]], states Daniel Littlefield, a professor of history.&lt;ref name="Littlefield1991p79"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel C. Littlefield|title=Rice and Slaves |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEO5lLG95lMC&amp;pg=PA79 |year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06214-8|pages=79 footnote 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the slaves were the castes of Soninke, which too were hereditary, endogamous and had an embedded hierarchical status.&lt;ref name=hoffman10/&gt; They included, for example, the ''garanke'' (leather workers) below the ''fune'' (bard), the ''fune'' below the ''gesere'' or ''jeli'' (griots, singers), the ''jeli'' below the ''tage'' or ''numu'' (smiths, pottery workers).&lt;ref name=hoffman10&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara G.

The castes and slaves system of Soninke may be linked. According to Susan McIntosh, a professor of anthropology specializing in African societies, archeological evidence shows that Arabs and Berbers had expanded and established an integrated sub-Saharan trade and transport network with West Africa, building upon the pre-existing trade routes through Western Sudan.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R.

The reach of slave trading had extended into [[Ghana]] and the western Atlantic coast by the 11th century, and the slave raiding, capture, holding and trading systems became increasingly sophisticated in 13th and 14th century Mali Empire and 16th century Songhai Empire.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;

As the practice of slavery grew, so did the caste system. Tamari suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among numerous ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tamari | first=Tal | title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa | journal=The Journal of African History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=32 | issue=02 | year=1991 | pages=221–250 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700025718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh concurs with Tamari, but states that the emergence of caste systems likely occurred much earlier in the West African societies such as Soninke, Mande, Malinke, Wolof, Serer, and others.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt; She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th-century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding by elite families was an established institution in West Africa by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;

The linguistic evidence suggests that stratification structure relating to caste system and slavery likely were shared between the Manding and Soninke people, and possibly some others such as the Dogon people of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Tamari|editor=David C. Conrad and Barbara E. Frank|title=Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzeVS6pYS7YC |year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11264-8|pages=65–67, 71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the linguistic differences between the caste and slave systems between Soninke and northern ethnic groups of Africa such as the Tuareg people and Moors suggests that these evolved separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Tamari|editor=David C. Conrad and Barbara E. Frank|title=Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzeVS6pYS7YC |year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11264-8|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
[[File:Boilat-22-Femme sarackoullée.jpg|thumb|180px|A Soninke woman, an 1853 sketch by David Boilat]]
Marriage in Soninke society has followed Islamic practices. Cousin marriages are common and preferred in Soninke culture, just as with the [[Fula people]].&lt;ref name="Brand2001p69"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saskia Brand|title=Mediating Means and Fate: A Socio-Political Analysis of Fertility and Demographic Change in Bamako, Mali |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZdrxQRXE7AC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2001|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-12033-5|pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents consent to marriage.&lt;ref name="Brand2001p69"/&gt; A traditional proverb states, "Cousins are made for each other." The practice among Soninke merchants, states Saskia Brand, a professor of psychology and educational sciences, may be related to the cultural belief that cousin marriages "helps to keep the money in the family".&lt;ref name="Brand2001p69"/&gt;

If both families agree, the couple is engaged (''i na tamma laga'') in a [[mosque]]. Each month after the engagement, the man pays the woman's family a bridewealth [[dower]] (''nakhafa'') for their food and other spending. The marriage, called ''futtu'', is complete with a marriage contract that mentions the dower, and is accompanied with a wedding event called ''karikompe''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The newly married couple has advisors. The man’s advisor is called the “khoussoumanta-yougo” and the woman’s is called “khoussoumanta-yakhare”. After one week of celebration, the women meet to show the gifts that the couple received from their parents mostly from the woman's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Culture Et Tradition |year=2002 |publisher=Soninkara.com |accessdate=2006-04-05 |url=http://www.soninkara.com/main.php3?f=accueil |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113021254/http://www.soninkara.com/main.php3?f=accueil |archivedate=2006-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage across social strata and caste lines has been taboo, states Saskia Brand. But, in polygynous noble families, a noble could take a wife from the slave strata.&lt;ref name="Brand2001p69"/&gt;

===Circumcision ===
The Soninke practise [[circumcision]] and call it ''birou''. Every afternoon, the boys who were circumcised the previous year organize ''tam-tams''{{clarify|date=February 2011}} for the new boys in order to prepare them psychologically. Throughout the circumcision ceremony, the boys to be circumcised sit around the “tambour” called “daïné”. The other teenagers of the village, young girls, women, men, and slaves form a circle around the boys. During this time the boys are surrounded with beautiful scarves called ''disa'' sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The circumcision among Soninke |url=http://www.soninkara.org/societe-soninkara/circoncision/index.php |accessdate=2006-04-28 |publisher=Soninkara.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225180752/http://www.soninkara.org/societe-soninkara/circoncision/index.php |archivedate=2006-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author Mamadou Soumare wrote “Above its traditional surgery, the ritual of circumcision makes in evidence, the physical endurance, the pain, the courage, in one word the personality of the child.”

====Female genital mutilation====
The Soninke people have long carried out [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also called female circumcision.&lt;ref name="Ouldzeidoune2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ericksen | first=K. P. | title=Female Genital Mutilations in Africa | journal=Cross-Cultural Research | volume=23 | issue=1-4 | year=1989 | pages=182–204 | doi=10.1177/106939718902300104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence rate of FGM is higher among the Soninke than among neighbouring ethnic groups such as Wolof people and others,.&lt;ref name="Ouldzeidoune2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ouldzeidoune | first=Nacerdine | last2=Keating | first2=Joseph | last3=Bertrand | first3=Jane | last4=Rice | first4=Janet | title=A Description of Female Genital Mutilation and Force-Feeding Practices in Mauritania: Implications for the Protection of Child Rights and Health | journal=PLOS One | volume=8 | issue=4 | year=2013 | page=e60594 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is culturally done as a ritual of social acceptance, and sometimes assumed to be required for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Ouldzeidoune2013"/&gt; In Mauritania and Senegal, FGM of a child is illegal in contemporary law but continues because it is culturally sanctioned for young girls as young as one year old.&lt;ref name="Ouldzeidoune2013"/&gt; According to the 2009 Report on Human Rights Practices by the US State Department, FGM practice among Soninke has included the most dangerous Type III mutilations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=US State Department|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NMXABwIjyAC&amp;pg=PA554|year=2010|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foods===
Breakfast foods include ''fonde'', porridge made of [[millet]], sugar, milk, and salt, and ''sombi'' porridge made of rice, millet or corn. For lunch ''demba tere'' and ''takhaya'' are very common, both containing rice and peanuts, frequent Soninke ingredients. ''Dere'', a stew, is a mixture of millet and beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Soninke Recipes |year=2002 |publisher=Soninkara.com |accessdate=2006-04-05 |url=http://www.soninkara.org/societe-soninkara/cuisine-soninke/index.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220154506/http://www.soninkara.org/societe-soninkara/cuisine-soninke/index.php |archivedate=2007-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The Soninke traditionally engage in both trade and agriculture. During the rainy season, men and women both cultivate. However, women usually stay at home to cook and take care of their children. They also do other work, such as dyeing cotton material.

Many early West African immigrants in France came from this ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_1_33/ai_56027336 |accessdate=2006-04-28 |title=Willing Migrants: Soninke Labor Diasporas, 1848-1960 | work=Journal of Social History | first=R. Darrell | last=Meadows | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soninke are an influential ethnic group in the Gambia, Senegal and Mali.

'''Spinola Battery''' ({{lang-mt|Batterija ta' Spinola}}), also known as '''Fort Spinola''', was an [[artillery battery]] in [[St. Julian's]], [[Malta]]. It was built by the [[British Empire|British]] between 1889 and 1894, and it was demolished to make way for hotels and a yacht marina.

==History==
Construction of Spinola Battery began in 1889 and was completed in 1894, at a cost of around £5000.&lt;ref&gt;{{mt icon}} {{cite book|last1=Guillaumier|first1=Alfie|title=Bliet u Rħula Maltin|date=1987|publisher=Valletta Publishing &amp; Promotion Co. Ltd.|location=[[Valletta]]|page=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a new series of fortifications meant to house [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading (BL) guns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Charles|title=The Fortifications of Malta 1530–1945|date=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1841766933|page=41|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=XsQ1CdqvyqUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230225912/https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=XsQ1CdqvyqUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2014-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinola Battery was located behind the [[Spinola Entrenchment]], an 18th-century bastioned [[Entrenchment (fortification)|entrenchment]] wall stretching from St. Julian's Bay to St. George's Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinola Bay to St Georges Bay Entrenchment|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1421.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=24 June 2015|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a pentagonal shape, and was armed with four guns, including two [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk I–VII|9.2-inch BL guns]]. Its armament was removed in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9.2inch B.L.|url=http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/art/9_2inchBLGun.htm|website=Victorian Forts and Artillery|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery was converted and developed into a hospital, known as the ''Spinola Hospital'', during World War I. It served as a hospital from 16 November 1915 till 27 April 1917. It was designed to serve for roughly 1000 patients, but during the war it had served for a maximum of 1168.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelmalta.com/aztours/ANZAC%20experience%20-%20Arrival.pdf The Anzac experience in Malta]. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The battery saw use again in [[World War II]], when it was armed with [[QF 4.5-inch Mk I – V naval gun#Land use|4.5-inch anti-aircraft guns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Debono|first1=Charles|title=The blitz on HMS Illustrious 70 years ago|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110130/life-features/the-blitz-on-hms-illustrious-70-years-ago.347816|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was severely damaged by aerial bombardment.

In 1969, it was used as a film sound studio, known as Intermed, later,  as Brittania Studios. The studio was exactly situated behind the Milenium Chapel, now, a supermarket. Some of the films that made use of this sound stage were:
Orca the killer whale, Zeppelin, Murpheys War, The Mcintosh man, Pulp, Raise the Titanic. Actors: Michael Cane, Mickey Roony, Charlotte Ramplin, Paul Newman, Peter O'Toole.

[[File:Malta - St. Julian's - Vjal Portomaso - Hilton + Portomaso Marina 02 ies.jpg|thumb|The site of the battery is now the Portomaso Marina]]

The Hilton Malta Hotel was built in 1967 on the site of the battery. The hotel and any remains of the battery were later completely demolished to make way for the [[Portomaso Marina]] and a new Hilton hotel.

'''The KOLIN''' are a [[Hungarian indie]]-[[Hungarian pop|pop]] band best known for their hit song ''San Francisco''. The band was formed in 2007 in [[Budapest]]. Their music style is [[synthpop]] influenced with [[indie rock]] and [[new rave]] sounds. The band consists of Márkó Linczényi (vocals/synthesizer), Ágoston Iván (drums) and Ferigeri (bass). Their debut album called ''Yell Into The Kazzo''. It was released in 2008 by [[Universal Music Group]]. The KOLIN won the award for Best Hungarian Act at the 2009 and 2010 [[MTV Europe Music Awards]].

==Perez Hilton's reaction==

[[Perez Hilton]], the famous American [[celebrity]] blogger gave a positive review for San Francisco on his blogsite:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are LOVING loving LOVING this band called the KOLIN - from Hungary.
Yes, Hungary! They sing in English, though. So you'll be able to understand what they're saying.
We've never mention a band from Hungary before, and we are thrilled to pop our cherry with the KOLIN.
If you like sweet, sexy, dirty, garage, disconess, then you will love the band!
Think [[Scissor Sisters]] meets [[Gossip (band)|The Gossip]]. We think the Bay Area has a new anthem!!!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''World Peace Through World Law''}}
'''''World Peace Through World Law''''', first published in 1958, was a book by [[Louis B. Sohn]] and [[Grenville Clark]] proposing a Revised [[United Nations Charter]][http://www.san.beck.org/GPJ27-Clark-SohnPlan.html#2]. Among other suggestions, they proposed: 

*Allocating votes in the [[UN General Assembly]] based on member nations' populations;
*Replacing the [[UN Security Council]] with an Executive Council with China, India, USSR, and the US as permanent members, and no veto power; and
*Making a World Police Force the only military force permitted in the world.

==Cultural references==

In one passage of [[Rex Stout]]'s 1959 [[detective]] novel ''[[Champagne for One]]'', the character [[Nero Wolfe]] is mentioned as sitting behind his desk reading ''World Peace Through World Law''. Wolfe is greatly impressed with the book, to the point of forgetting the current mystery he is involved in solving, and says to his colleague [[Archie Goodwin (character)|Archie Goodwin]] that he must read it, too (ch.VII).

'''Yamal 101''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Ямал-101'''}}) was a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Gazprom Space Systems|Gazkom]] and built by [[S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]].&lt;ref name=rsw-yamal /&gt; It was, along with [[Yamal 102]] the first communications satellite of the [[Yamal (satellite constellation)|Yamal]] program and the first iteration of the [[USP (satellite bus)|USP Bus]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie2 /&gt; It was a {{convert|1360|kg|abbr=on}} satellite with 2200W of power (1300W available for the payload) on an unpressurized bus.&lt;ref name=energia-usp /&gt; It had eight [[SPT-70]] [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric thrusters]] by [[OKB Fakel]] for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]].&lt;ref name=gsp-energiyausp /&gt; Its payload was 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] equivalent [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] supplied by [[Space Systems Loral]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal101tech /&gt;

==History==
It was launched along Yamal 102 September 6, 1999 at 16:36 UTC from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81|Site 81/23]] by a [[Proton-K]]/[[Blok D|Blok-DM-2M]] directly to [[geostationary orbit|GEO]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal101launch /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal101 /&gt; But a failure in the electrical system at solar panel deployment meant that it was lost right after the successful launch.&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-yamal /&gt;

==Rename of Yamal 102==
After '''Yamal 101''' failure, [[Gazprom Space Systems|Gazkom]] registered [[Yamal 102]] as Yamal 101. This has caused significant confusion but the records are clear that the satellite that failed was, in fact, the original Yamal 101.&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-yamal101 /&gt;
