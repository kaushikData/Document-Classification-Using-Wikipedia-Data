      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13837">An '''anthropologist''' is a person engaged in the practice of [[anthropology]]. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of [[human]]s within past and present [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="oed3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|title=What is Anthropology?|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[philosophical anthropology]] study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life, while [[economic anthropology]] studies human economic behavior. [[Biological anthropology|Biological (physical)]], [[Forensic anthropology|forensic]], and [[medical anthropology]] study the biological development of humans, the application of biological anthropology in a legal setting, and the study of diseases and their impacts on humans over time, respectively.

==Education==
Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[Postgraduate education|graduate level]]. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.

Anthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master's degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than [[anthropology]] and graduate degrees in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1782|title=Career Paths and Education - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, anthropologists primarily worked in academic settings; however, by 2014, U.S. anthropologists and [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] were largely employed in research positions (28%), management and consulting (23%), and government positions (27%).&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Marietta L.

Anthropologists without doctorates tend to work more in other fields than [[Academy|academia]], while those while the majority of those with doctorates are primarily employed in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/16/anthropology_master_s_are_most_likely_to_bring_their_discipline_to_the_public|title=Anthropology Without Doctorates|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those without doctorates in academia tend to work exclusively as researchers and do not teach. Those in research-only positions are often not considered faculty. The median salary for anthropologists in 2015 was $62,220.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/anthropologist|title=Anthropologist Ranks Among Best Jobs of 2017|website=money.usnews.com|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists report an above average level of job satisfaction.

Although closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and [[archeologist]]s perform differing roles, though [[archeology]] is considered a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paesta.psu.edu/book/earth-systems-science-introduction/definitions/paleontology-vs-archaeology-vs-anthropology|title=Paleontology vs. Archaeology vs. Anthropology {{!}} PAESTA|website=www.paesta.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of [[forensic anthropology]], [[digital anthropology]], and [[cyber anthropology]]. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a [[historian]]. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.careerigniter.com/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-a-historian-and-an-anthropologist/|title=What Is The Difference Between A Historian And An Anthropologist? - Career Igniter|website=www.careerigniter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies. A far greater percentage of historians are employed in academic settings than anthropologists, who have more diverse places of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/jobs-and-professional-development/career-diversity-for-historians/career-diversity-resources/where-historians-work-an-interactive-database-of-history-phd-career-outcomes|title=Where Historians Work: An Interactive Database of History PhD Career Outcomes {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists are experiencing a shift in the twenty-first century [[United States]] with the rise of forensic anthropology. In the United States, as opposed to many other countries forensic anthropology falls under the domain of the anthropologist and not the [[Forensic pathologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Traithepchanapai|first=Pongpon|last2=Mahakkanukrauh|first2=Pasuk|last3=Kranioti|first3=Elena F.|date=2016-04-01|title=History, research and practice of forensic anthropology in Thailand|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073816300470|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=261|issue=Supplement C|pages=167.e1–167.e6|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.02.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, forensic anthropologists help in the identification of skeletal remains by deducing biological characteristics such as [[sex]], [[Ageing|age]], [[Human height|stature]], and [[Ancestor|ancestry]] from the [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of forensic anthropology: especially as developed in the United States.|last=Stewart|first=T.D.|publisher=Charles C. Thomas|year=1979|isbn=978-0398038113|location=Springfield, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, forensic anthropologists tend to gravitate more toward working in academic and laboratory settings, while forensic pathologists perform more applied field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/albertm/forensic.htm|title=UNCW Forensic Anthropology|website=people.uncw.edu|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic anthropologists typically hold [[Doctor of Philosophy|academic doctorates]], while forensic pathologists are medical doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/albertm/forensic.htm|title=UNCW Forensic Anthropology|website=people.uncw.edu|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of forensic anthropology is rapidly evolving with increasingly capable technology and more extensive databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.nfstc.org/tech_transition/anthropology/overview.htm|title=Advances in Forensic Anthropology • Technology Transition Workshop at NFSTC|website=projects.nfstc.org|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic anthrology is one of the most specialized and competitive job areas within the field of anthropology and currently has more qualified graduates than positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/articles/Forensic_Anthropologist_Job_Description_Outlook_and_Salary.html|title=Forensic Anthropologist: Job Description, Outlook and Salary|work=Study.com|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of Anthropology has also received an additional sub-field with the rise of [[Digital anthropology]]. This new branch of the profession has an increased usage of [[computer]]s as well as interdisciplinary work with [[medicine]], computer visualization, [[industrial design]], [[biology]], and [[journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174131450|title=Virtual anthropology : a guide to a new interdisciplinary field|last=1961-|first=Weber, Gerhard W.,|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=Bookstein, Fred L., 1947-|isbn=9783211486474|location=Wien|oclc=174131450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists in this field primarily study the evolution of human reciprocal relations with the [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Libin|first=Alexander|last2=Libin|first2=Elena|date=2005|title=Cyber-anthropology: a new study on human and technological co-evolution|journal=Studies in Health Technology and Informatics|volume=118|pages=146–155|issn=0926-9630|pmid=16301776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber anthropologists also study digital and [[Cyberethics|cyber ethics]] along with the global implications of increasing connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50279971|title=Ethics and the profession of anthropology : dialogue for ethically conscious practice|date=2002|publisher=AltaMira Press|others=Fluehr-Lobban, Carolyn.|isbn=9780759103375|edition=2nd|location=Walnut Creek|oclc=50279971}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cyber ethical issues such as [[net neutrality]] increasingly coming to light, this sub-field is rapidly gaining more recognition.

[[Image:Apoplast and symplast pathways.svg|thumb|300px|The apoplastic and symplastic pathways]]
Inside a [[plant]], the '''apoplast''' is the space outside the [[plasma membrane]] within which material can diffuse freely. It is interrupted by the [[Casparian strip]] in [[root]]s, by air spaces between plant cells and by the [[plant cuticle]].

Structurally, the apoplast is formed by the continuum of cell walls of adjacent cells as well as the extracellular spaces, forming a tissue level compartment comparable to the [[symplast]]. The apoplastic route facilitates the transport of water and solutes across a tissue or organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell, N.A.|author2=Reece, J.B.|year=2002|title=Biology |location=California|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|pages=753–754|isbn=0-8053-6624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as ''apoplastic transport''.

The apoplast is important for all the plant's interaction with its environment. The main carbon source ([[carbon dioxide]]) needs to be solubilized in the apoplast before it diffuses through the plasma membrane into the cell's [[cytoplasm]] ([[symplast]]) and is used by the [[chloroplast]]s during [[photosynthesis]]. In the roots, ions diffuse into the apoplast of the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] before diffusing into the symplast, or in some cases being taken up by specific [[ion channels]], and being pulled by the plant's [[transpiration stream]], which also occurs completely within the boundaries of the apoplast. Similarly, all gaseous molecules emitted and received by plants such as [[plant hormone]]s and other [[pheromone]]s must pass the apoplast. In nitrate poor soils, acidification of the apoplast increases cell wall extensibility and root growth rate. This is believed to be caused by a decrease in nitrate uptake (due to deficit in the soil medium) and supplanted with an increase in chloride uptake. H+ATPase increases the efflux of H+, thus acidifying the apoplast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

During local [[oxidative stress]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[superoxide]] anions can diffuse through the apoplast and transport a warning signal to neighbouring cells. In addition, a local alkalinization of the apoplast due to such a stress can travel within minutes to the rest of the plant body via the [[xylem]] and trigger [[systemic acquired resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The apoplast also plays an important role in resistance to aluminium toxicity and resistance. Exclusion of aluminium ions in the apoplast prevent toxic levels which inhibit shoot growth, reducing crop yields&lt;ref&gt;Horst, Walter. "The role of the apoplast in aluminium toxicity and resistance of higher plants: A review".''Journal of plant nutrition and soil science''. 1995. Vol.158(5), p. 419–428&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term apoplast was coined in 1930 by [[Ernst Münch|Münch]] in order to separate the "living" [[symplast]] from the "dead" apoplast.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, E (1930). ''Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze''. Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattelmacher, B. (2000). The apoplast and its significance for plant mineral nutrition. ''New Phytologist'' 149: 167–192, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00034.x/abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apoplastic transport==
The apoplastic pathway is one of the two main pathways for water transport in plants, the other being symplastic pathway. In apoplastic transport, water and minerals flow in an upward direction via the apoplast to the xylem in the root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Merrill A.|last1=Ross|first2=Carole A.|last2=Lembi|title=Applied Weed Science: Including the Ecology and Management of Invasive Plants|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2008|page=79|isbn=978-0-13-502814-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of solutes transported in aboveground organs is established through a combination of import from the xylem, absorption by cells, and export by the phloem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grignon|first=C.|last2=Sentenac|first2=H.|date=1991-01-01|title=pH and Ionic Conditions in the Apoplast|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.pp.42.060191.000535|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=103–128|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.42.060191.000535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport velocity is higher in the apoplast than the symplast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios100/lecturesf04am/lect19.htm|title=Transport in Plants|publisher=Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of transport also accounts for a higher proportion of water transport in plant tissues than does symplastic transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomas N. Buckley|author2=Grace P. John|author3=Christine Scoffoni|author4=Lawren Sack|last-author-amp=yes|title=How Does Leaf Anatomy Influence Water Transport outside the Xylem?|journal=Plant Physiology|date=17 June 2015|volume=168|doi=10.1104/pp.15.00731|pmc=4528767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apoplastic pathway is also involved in passive exclusion. Some of the ions that enter through the roots do not make it to the xylem. The ions are excluded by the plasma membranes of the endodermal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Science|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2011|isbn=978-0-321-59820-2|location=San Francisco, California|pages=747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
#Apoplast was previously defined as "everything but the [[symplast]], consisting of [[cell wall]]s and spaces between [[cell (biology)|cells]] in which [[water]] and [[solution|solutes]] can move freely". However, since solutes can neither freely move through the air spaces between plant cells nor through the cuticle, this definition has been changed. When referring to "everything outside the plasma membrane", the term "extracellular space" is in use.
#The word '''apoplasm''' is also in use with similar meaning as apoplast, although less common.

'''''SRM – Associazione Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/?lang=en |title=Official Website|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Italy|Italian]] Study Centre founded in [[Naples]] in 2003 which aims to improve the knowledge of Italian economy in terms of infrastructural, productive and social assets, proceeding from a European and Mediterranean perspective. From the Study Centre of the [[Banco di Napoli]], established in 1931, SRM inherited a consolidated know-how in the analysis of the economic dynamics of the South of Italy. Over the years, it has implemented its research from an international point of view.

Its founders are four banks of the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]], the Banco di Napoli Foundation and the Turin-based Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compagniadisanpaolo.it/|title=Compagnia di San Paolo|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of SRM is Paolo Scudieri and the [[General Manager]] is Massimo Deandreis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/chi-siamo/?lang=en |title=About Us|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and Research==

SRM is a Study Centre related to the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]]. It specializes in the analysis of regional economic dynamics, with a particular eye towards Southern Italy. In this context, it carries out studies and research monitoring of the performance of productive sectors, investigating economic and financial scenarios, interdependence and internationalisation, and the economic value of the non-profit sector. SRM publishes studies and research in three types of publishing products: monographic research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/ricerche-monografiche-en/?lang=en|title=Researches|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; periodical reports &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/rapporti-periodici/?lang=en|title=Periodical Reports|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/reviews/?lang=en|title=Reviews|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Since 2003 SRM has provided much research on topics related to numerous Italian economic sectors: automotive, aerospace, agri-food, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism, water, renewable energy, and many others.
* Among the periodic reports, SRM has a line of reports produced in collaboration with other Institutes: the semi-yearly report "Check up Mezzogiorno"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/check-up-mezzogiorno/|title=Check Up Mezzogiorno|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[Confindustria]]; the "Territorial Finance in Italy" Report, in collaboration with IRES, IRPET, Eupolis Lombardia, IPRES and Liguria Ricerche; and the Report on the internationalisation of Italian regions, in collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo Research Department. SRM also publishes the Young Entrepreneurs Observatory and the Mezzogiorno Bulletin.
* SRM also edits three magazines. Since 1993, it has been publishing the bi-monthly magazine ''Dossier Unione Europea'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/dossier-ue/|title= Dossier UE|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to monitor European policies and their impact on the Italian economy. Since 2004, it has been editing the international magazine ''Rassegna Economica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/rassegna-economica/|title= Rassegna Economica|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1931 by the Banco di Napoli. Since 2016, SRM has also published a half-yearly magazine ''Quaderni di Economia Sociale'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/quaderni-di-economia-sociale//|title= Quaderni di Economia Sociale|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of non-profit and social solidarity, carried out together with the Fondazione con il Sud and with the collaboration of Banca Prossima ([[Intesa Sanpaolo]] Banking Group), established as a periodic report in 2012.

SRM has also activated two permanent observatories: the first one, on the Maritime Economy, monitors the economic impact of the logistics and maritime transport sector; the second, on the Mediterranean Economy, monitors the dynamics of the commercial relations between Italy (and in particular the South of Italy) and the Mediterranean countries. Italy, including its southern regions, plays a natural role as an economic and logistic bridge between Europe and the southern shores of the Mediterranean, where the great maritime trade routes pass to and from Asia and America.

==Maritime Economy Permanent Observatory==

''Maritime Economy'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/|title=Maritime Economy|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a SRM project born in 2014 with the aim to establish a permanent observatory on the logistics and maritime transport sector. SRM has always had a consolidated research area dedicated to this field of studies because it has always believed that efficient and effective maritime transport fosters internationalization, innovation, investments in infrastructure, and employment and GDP growth.

The Maritime Economy Observatory manifests itself in a website (http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/ - in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) that offers a wealth of analysis and studies on the topic of maritime transport seen from a variety of standpoints: from the business side (e.g. the shipping industry), from the point of view of infrastructures (ports), and in terms of individual sectors and territories (for instance by taking a closer look at the maritime transport strategies pursued by other countries).

An Annual Report titled "Italian Maritime Economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/cp/annual-report/|title= Italian Maritime Economy Annual Report|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published every year, in June. This Report is the result of SRM analyses and its study missions abroad. It includes also scientific articles by international experts in the sector. In the course of its research activity on the maritime economy, SRM has created numerous "networks" formed by entities of varying nature - business associations, companies, infrastructure components, institutions – each of which, in its own way, provides added value to the research activity and papers offered.

SRM, in Shanghai on 13 December 2016, signed the Cooperation Agreement called "Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/srm-firma-a-shanghai-laccordo-global-shipping-think-tank-alliance/?lang=en|title= Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a partnership fostered by the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.sisi-smu.org/|title= Shangai International Shipping Institute|publisher=SISI}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important Chinese research centres in the world for research on shipping, logistics and the port industry. The Agreement involves the most prestigious research institutes on the maritime economy of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[the United States]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Germany]] and the [[UK]]. SRM was the only Italian study centre and one of three European entities to become a partner in the initiative, which was endorsed to implement joint studies on maritime transport, to exchange research and analysis methods, to propose policies to public policy makers with the aim to develop port and logistics infrastructure, and to organize meetings to discuss and debate the economic trends of the sea-related sectors.
With this agreement SRM strengthens its ability to analyse and forecast trends in the economics of the maritime industry and the dynamics of shipping and port logistics, expanding its cooperation with international economic think tanks such as the [[Kühne Logistics University of Hamburg]], the [[University of Antwerp]] and the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], which are globally recognized in the field of the maritime economy.

==Mediterranean Economy Permanent Observatory==

The Permanent Observatory on the Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean Area &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/|title= Mediterranean Observatory|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a project realized by SRM and born in 2011 thanks to the sponsorship of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Compagnia di San Paolo]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the aim to monitor and study the dynamics and the impact of mutual economic relations between [[Italy]] (and in particular Southern Italy) and the Mediterranean Area.

SRM has established this new field of research developing a strong network of relations with other national and international Research Centres on the Mediterranean Area. The Observatory analyses in particular two geographic areas - the Southern Mediterranean Area ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]) and the Eastern Mediterranean Area ([[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]) - investigating the commercial, financial, infrastructural, entrepreneurial, energetic and technological inter-exchange relations, paying special attention to business indicators and normative-institutional dynamics affecting the Euro-Mediterranean Area. The Adriatic Mediterranean Area ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]]) is investigated separately. Since 2015 the analysis has been extended to the [[Gulf Countries]] ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]]).

SRM Med Observatory represents a permanent laboratory the activity of which takes place on the website. At the end of each year of research activities the Mediterranean Observatory gives life to the "Annual Report on Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/cp/med-annual-report/|title= Annual Report on Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean |publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; available online and printed also in paper format, which describes the overall picture of economic relations between Italy / Southern of Italy and Mediterranean.

==Awards and acknowledgments==

SRM received the [[Guido Dorso International Award]] in 2010. This plaque, given by the [[President of the Italian Republic]], is designated for a scientific - cultural institution of the South of Italy. It was awarded to the Association "in recognition of the intense and qualified activity carried out for a deeper knowledge of the southern territory".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The '''Bibikely Biodiversity Institute''' (pronounced ''bee-bee-KAY-lee'') is the primary research and training organization for the study of [[arthropod]]s in [[Madagascar]].

Since the first inventory in 1992, the Institute's activities have evolved into one of the most important projects for the advancement of arthropod training and research across Madagascar.

The Institute was founded in 1992 by Dr. [[Brian Fisher (biologist)|Brian Fisher]], preeminent field [[biologist]], and the curator and chairman of the [[entomology]] department of the [[California Academy of Sciences]].  Dr. Fisher is also the present executive director of the Institute.

==Projects==
===Inventory===
This project has become one of the largest arthropod inventory programs ever undertaken. 

Over the last 12 years, field crews have inventoried 112 sites across Madagascar.  In Madagascar, a team of 15 taxonomic assistants sorted and processed over a million specimens.  For ants alone, over 800 new species have been discovered.  The Arthropod Inventory of Madagascar project has demonstrated the feasibility of the effort to collect, process, and prepare enormous quantities of taxonomically rich specimens across diverse, large-scale landscapes.

Inventory of the island's rich arthropod fauna remains incomplete, but the success of the current effort has brought us closer to achieving this goal.

===Education===
Many students receive a significant part of their education working with the Institute.  A particular focus is training students from Madagascar.

===Biodiversity Center===
The Institute is the driving force behind the incipient [[Madagascar Biodiversity Center]].

==Support==
The following organizations have provided funding for the Institute:
*The [[National Science Foundation]]
*[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]
*[[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF)
*The McBean Family foundation
*Private individuals

[[File:Glassy carbon and a 1cm3 graphite cube HP68-79.jpg|thumbnail|A large sample of [[glassy carbon]], and a nearby 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[graphite]] cube.]]

'''Carbon chauvinism''' is a [[neologism]] meant to disparage the assumption that the chemical processes of hypothetical [[extraterrestrial life]] must be constructed primarily from [[carbon]] ([[organic compound]]s) because carbon's chemical and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties render it far superior to all other elements.&lt;ref name = darling /&gt;

==Concept==
The term was used as early as 1973, when scientist [[Carl Sagan]] described it and other human [[chauvinism]]s that limit imagination of possible extraterrestrial life. It suggests that [[human being]]s, as carbon-based life forms who have never encountered any life that has evolved outside the Earth’s environment, may find it difficult to envision [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|radically different biochemistries]].&lt;ref name = sagan /&gt;

In a 1999 ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine article discussing the theory of a [[fine-tuned universe]], Kenneth Silber quotes [[astrophysicist]] [[Victor J. Stenger]] using the term:&lt;ref name = kenneth /&gt;
{{quote|There is no good reason, says Stenger, to "assume that there's only one kind of life possible" – we know far too little about life in our own universe, let alone "other" universes, to reach such a conclusion. Stenger denounces as "carbon chauvinism" the assumption that life requires carbon; other chemical elements, such as silicon, can also form molecules of considerable complexity. Indeed, Stenger ventures, it is "molecular chauvinism" to assume that molecules are required at all; in a universe with different properties, atomic nuclei or other structures might assemble in totally unfamiliar ways.|Victor J. Stenger|''Reason'', July 1999}}

==Carbon alternatives==
[[File:Silicon-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|thumbnail|Silicon in a diamond cubic crystal structure]]
Like carbon, [[silicon]] can form four stable bonds with itself and other elements, and long chemical chains known as [[silane]] polymers, which are very similar to the [[hydrocarbon]]s essential to life on Earth.  Silicon is more reactive than carbon, which could make it optimal for extremely cold environments.&lt;ref name=silanes&gt;{{cite news | title = Target: Titan &amp; Silicon-based life | date = 18 March 2010 | url = http://astrowright.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/target-titan/ | work = Astrowright | accessdate = 5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, silanes spontaneously burn in the presence of oxygen at relatively low temperatures, so an oxygen atmosphere may be deadly to silicon-based life. On the other hand, it is worth considering that [[alkanes]] are as a rule quite flammable, but carbon-based life on Earth does not store energy directly as alkanes, but as sugars, lipids, alcohols, and other hydrocarbon compounds with very different properties. Water as a solvent would also react with silanes, but again, this only matters if for some reason silanes are used or mass-produced by said organisms.

Hydrocarbons and organic compounds are abundant in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, while their silicon analogs have never been observed in nature. Silicon does, however, form complex one-, two- and three-dimensional polymers in which oxygen atoms form bridges between silicon atoms. These are termed [[silicates]]. They are both stable and abundant under terrestrial conditions, and have been proposed as a basis for a pre-organic form of evolution on Earth (see [[Graham Cairns-Smith#Clay hypothesis|clay hypothesis]]).

'''Chinese influences on [[Islamic pottery]]''' cover a period starting from at least the 8th century CE to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Zheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; This influence of [[Chinese ceramics]] has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on [[Islamic art]]s in general.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

==Earliest exchanges==

===Pre-Islamic contacts with Central Asia===
[[File:ZhouVase.JPG|thumb|left|[[Eastern Zhou]] vase, thought to incorporate Western influences (3rd–4th century BCE).]]
Despite the distances involved, there is evidence of some contact between eastern and southwestern Asia from antiquity. Some very early Western influence on Chinese pottery seems to appear from the 3rd–4th century BCE. An [[Eastern Zhou]] red earthenware bowl, decorated with [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] and inlaid with glass paste, and now in the British Museum, is thought to have imitated metallic vessels, possibly of foreign origin. Foreign influence especially is thought to have encouraged the Eastern Zhou interest in glass decorations.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum, Ancient China permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacts between [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] were formally opened from the 2nd to 1st century BCE through the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; In the following centuries, a great cultural influx benefited China, embodied by the appearance in China of foreign art, new ideas and religions (especially [[Buddhism]]), and new lifestyles.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; Artistic influences combined a multiplicity of cultures which had intermixed along the Silk Road, especially [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[India]]n and [[Central Asian]] cultures, displaying a strong cosmopolitanism.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

Such mixed influences are especially visible in the earthenwares of Northern China in the 6th century, such as those of the [[Northern Qi]] (550–577) or the [[Northern Zhou]] (557–581).&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; In that period, high quality high-fired earthenware starts to appear, called the "jeweled type", which incorporates [[Lotus Flower|lotuses]] from Buddhist art, as well as elements of [[Sasanian]] designs such as pearl roundels, lion masks or musicians and dancers.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz5KGNcs9xEC&amp;pg=PA119 ''The arts of China'' by Michael Sullivan p.119''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; The best of these ceramics use bluish green, yellow or olive glazes.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
[[File:Tang earthenware fragment with sancai glaze end of 7th early 8th century excavated in Nishapur Iran.jpg|thumb|[[Tang Dynasty]] earthenware fragment with ''[[sancai]]'' glaze, end of 7th-early 8th century, excavated in [[Nishapur]], [[Iran]].]]
Direct contacts between the Muslim and Chinese worlds were marked by the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 in [[Central Asia]]. Muslim communities are known to have been present in China as early as the 8th century CE, especially in commercial harbours such as [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

From the 9th century onwards, Islamic merchants started to import Chinese ceramics, which were at the core of the [[Indian Ocean]] luxury trade at that time.&lt;ref name="Meri"&gt;''Medieval Islamic civilization: an encyclopedia'' by Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach p.143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MypbfKdMePIC&amp;pg=PA143]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; These exotic objects were cherished in the [[Islamic world]] and also became an inspiration for local potters.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Archaeological finds of [[Chinese pottery]] in the [[Middle East]] go back to the 8th century, starting with Chinese pottery of the [[Tang period]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="Zheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Remains of [[Tang dynasty|Tang period]] (618–907) ceramics have been found in [[Samarra]] and [[Ctesiphon]] in present-day [[Iraq]], as well as in [[Nishapur]] in present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Notice of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] permanent exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; These include porcelaneous white wares from Northern Chinese kilns, celadon-glazed stoneware originating in the [[State of Yue|Yue]] kilns of Northern [[Zhejiang]], and the splashed stoneware of [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Changsha kilns]] in [[Hunan Province]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TV6f2XWG6t4C&amp;pg=PA68 ''Maritime silk road'' Qingxin Li p.68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese pottery was the object of gift-making in Islamic lands: the Islamic writer Muhammad Ibn-al-Husain-Bahaki wrote in 1059 that [[Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan|Ali Ibn Isa]], the governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], presented [[Harun al-Rashid]], the Caliph, twenty pieces of Chinese imperial porcelain, the like of which had never been at a caliph's court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain".&lt;ref name="Zheng"&gt;''Studies in Chinese ceramics'' by Dekun Zheng, Cheng Te-K'Un p.90''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3die4xQmNzQC&amp;pg=PA90]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan and Ming dynasties===
[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early Chinese [[blue and white porcelain]], c 1335, early [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Jingdezhen]], using a Middle-eastern shape]]
By the time of the [[Mongol invasion of China]] a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own [[fritware]] bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of [[Korean pottery]], but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140–141 especially&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger [[celadon]] dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East.  Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;  After about 1450 celadon wares fell out of fashion in China, and the continuing production, of lower quality, was for export.

The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of [[Chinese blue and white porcelain]], which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming; it was called "Muslim blue" by the Chinese.  Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the [[arabesque]]s and [[scroll (art)|plant scrolls]] of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels.  This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves.  The [[cobalt blue]] that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in [[Quanzhou]], convenient for the huge [[Jingdezhen]] potteries, and other ports to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 137–140; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 86–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the [[Ming dynasty]] was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries.  This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the [[Zhengde Emperor]]'s (r. 1505–1521) flirtation with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

===Yue ware===
{{further|Yue ware}}
[[File:Tang Dynasty stoneware with celadon glaze ie Yue ware found in Samarra Iraq.jpg|thumb|[[Tang Dynasty]] stoneware with [[celadon]] [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (Yue ware), found in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]].]]
Yue ware originated in the [[State of Yue|Yue]] kilns of Northern [[Zhejiang]], in the site of [[Jiyuan]] near [[Shaoxing]], called "Yuezhou" (越州) in ancient times.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sn0CyBCJKz8C&amp;pg=PA90 ''The arts of China'' by Michael Sullivan p.90''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Yue ware was first manufactured from the 2nd century CE, when it consisted in some very precise imitations of [[bronze]] vessels, many of which were found in tombs of the [[Nanjing]] region.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt; After this initial phase, Yue ware evolved progressively into true ceramic form, and became a true medium of artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.35''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA35]&lt;/ref&gt; Production in Jiyuan stopped in the 6th century, but expanded to various areas of Zhejiang, especially around the shores of Shanglinhu in Yuyaoxian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

Yue ware was highly valued, and was used as tribute for the imperial court in northern China in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Significantly, it was also used in China's most revered [[Famen Temple]] in [[Shaanxi Province]].&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Yue ware was exported to the [[Middle East]] early on, and shards of Yue ware have been excavated in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]], in an early example of Chinese influences on Islamic pottery,&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; as well as to [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]] as well as [[East Africa]] from the 8th to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

===Sancai ware===
{{further|Sancai}}
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = '''Left image''': Chinese Tang lobed dish 9–10th century.

[[File:Tang sancai vase 8th 9th century.jpg|thumb|Tang ''[[sancai]]'' vase displaying Central Asian and Persian influence. 8–9th century. [[Guimet Museum]].]]
[[Tang period]] earthenware shards with low-fired [[polychrome]] three-color ''[[sancai]]'' glazes from the 9th century were exported to Middle-Eastern countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]], and have been excavated in [[Samarra]] in present-day [[Iraq]] and in [[Nishapur]] in present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood205"&gt;''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.205''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA206]&lt;/ref&gt; These Chinese styles were soon adopted for local [[Middle-Eastern]] manufactures. Copies were made by Iraqi craftsmen as soon as the 9th century CE.&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;Notice of [[British Museum]] "Islamic Art Room" permanent exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brend"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ba3LyiGfPU8C&amp;pg=PA41 ''Islamic art'' by Barbara Brend p.41]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to imitate Chinese ''Sancai'', lead glazes were used on top of vessels coated with white [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] and a colorless glaze. The coloured lead glazes were then splashed on the surface, where they spread and mixed, according to the [[slipware]] technique.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

Shapes were also imitated, such as the lobed dishes found in Chinese Tang ceramics and silverware which were reproduced in Iraq during the 9–10th century.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Conversely, numerous Central Asian and Persian influences were at work in the designs of Chinese ''sancai'' wares: pictures of Central Asian mounted warriors, scenes representing Central Asian musicians, vases in the shape of Middle-Eastern [[ewer]]s.

===White ware===

Soon after the sancai period, Chinese white ware ceramics also found their way to the [[Islamic world]],&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood205"/&gt; and were immediately reproduced.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The Chinese white ware was actually [[porcelain]], invented in the 9th century, and used [[kaolin]] and high-temperature firing,&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; but Islamic workshops were unable to duplicate its manufacture. Instead, they manufactured fine earthenware bowls with the desired shape, and covered them with a white glaze rendered [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] by the addition of [[tin]], an early example of [[tin-glazing]].&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brend"/&gt; The Chinese shapes were also reproduced, seemingly to pass for China-made wares.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

In the 12th century, Islamic manufacturers further developed [[stone-paste]] techniques in order to obtain hard bodies approximating the hardness obtained by Chinese porcelain. This technique was used until the 18th century, when the Europeans discovered the Chinese technique for high-firing porcelain clays.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

===Celadon ware===
The Chinese fashion for greenware, or [[celadon]], ware was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where it gave rise to productions using [[turquoise]] glazing and fish motifs identical to the ones used in China.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

===Blue and white ware===

The technique of [[cobalt blue]] decorations seems to have been invented in the Middle East in the 9th century through decorative experimentation on white ware,&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; and the technique of blue-and-white ware was developed in China in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/porcelain.aspx Porcelain.  ''Columbia Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions, Chinese blue and white wares also incorporated Islamic designs, as in the case of some Mamluk brass works which were converted into blue and white Chinese porcelain designs.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Chinese blue and white ware then became extremely popular in the Middle East, where both Chinese and Islamic types coexisted.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

From the 13th century, Chinese pictorial designs, such as flying [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], [[dragons]] and [[lotus flowers]] also started to appear in the ceramic productions of the Near East, especially in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

[[File:Ming incense burner 1575 1600 with Ottoman mount 1618.jpg|thumb|[[Ming Dynasty]] [[incense burner]] (1575–1600) with [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] metallic mount dated 1618. [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]].]]
Chinese porcelain of the 14th or 15th century was transmitted to the [[Middle East]] and the [[Near East]], and especially to the [[Ottoman Empire]] either through gifts or through war [[Looting|booty]]. Chinese designs were extremely influential with the pottery manufacturers at [[Iznik]], [[Turkey]]. The Ming "grape" design in particular was highly popular and was extensively reproduced under the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The style of Persian pottery known as [[Kubachi ware]] also absorbed influence from China, imitating both celadons and Ming blue-and-white porcelain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8386">The '''conservation and restoration of glass objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[glass]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].
[[File:Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation]]

Glass was discovered in the third millennium B.C.E. and is still a relatively new material. The art of glassworking did not occur until long after [[metalworking|metalwork]] or [[pottery]].&lt;ref name= "Koob"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koob |first=Stephen |title=Conservation and Care of Glass Objects |publisher=Archetype Publications |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=1-904982-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. [[Water]] is the primary cause of deterioration in glass materials.&lt;ref name = "Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Newton |first=Roy |author2=Sandra Davison |title= Conservation of Glass |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1989 |isbn=0-408-10623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of deterioration==
'''Weathering'''

[[Weathering]] is a broad definition for any form of deterioration which appears on the surface of the glass and is caused by exposure to adverse conditions.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  Below are the seven typical forms of weathering.

''Dulling'' is the simplest form of weathering. It occurs when glass loses its clarity and transparency and becomes translucent.&lt;ref name= "Tennent"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Tennent |first= Norman, ed. |title= The Conservation of Glass and Ceramics: Research, Practice and Training |publisher= James &amp; James (Science Publishers) Ltd. |year= 1999 |location= London |isbn= 1-873936-18-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Strain cracking'' describes the presence of minuscule cracks running through the glass in all directions, giving it a sugary appearance and causing the glass to disintegrate.

''Frosting''

''[[Iridescence]]'' is caused by continuous flaking of a glass surface causing a multi-colored sheen to appear on the surface of formerly transparent glass.&lt;ref name= "Tennent" /&gt;

''Milky''

''Enamel-like''

'''Devitrification'''
{{Main article|Devitrification}}

Devitrification is the process of converting glass into a crystalline substance by heating it to a temperature just below its melting point then cooled. By doing this, the randomly situated molecules in the glass, when cooled, will attempt to settle in a less random and more crystalline form.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt; This technique is used to create an opaque appearance in the glass. Due to the high level of stress this technique places on the glass, it may cause the glass to deteriorate.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  For more information on devitrification as an artistic technique, see the main article above.

The term "devitrification" is used by archaeologists and art historians to refer to a glass object which has lost it [[vitreous lustre|vitreous nature]], giving the glass a weathered appearance.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  This is first caused by the loss of [[alkali]] then followed by the loss of other materials of the glass, and finally the creation of a silica gel, indicating the change in the glass's chemical composition.

'''Crizzling'''
{{Main article|Crizzling}}

Atmospheric deterioration, commonly referred to as crizzling, weeping or glass disease is primarily caused by a chemical imbalance in specific types of glass, though it can occur in almost any glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;  This form of deterioration is a basic defect in glass caused by incorrect proportions of ingredients, particularly an excess of alkali in the glass composite.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt; Crizzling occurs in 5 main stages.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

''Stage One''

:The "initial stage" of crizzling occurs when alkali is present on the glass, giving the glass a cloudy or hazy appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/article/crizzling |title=Crizzling |author= |date=April 26, 2012 |work= |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If neglected, crizzling's initial stage may occur within five or 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. Indications of crizzling may be seen as tiny droplets in high (above 55%) humidity or as fine crystals in low (below 40%) relative humidity.&lt;ref name = "Koob" /&gt; A feeling of slippery or slimy glass is another possible indication of stage one crizzling. The initial stage is treatable. Washing the glass removes the alkali and will keep the glass looking new.:

''Stage Two''

:"Incipient crizzling" has similar characteristic symptoms as stage one, however, the haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks, which appear as tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt; A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks.  These cracks are the first sign of deterioration in the glass. The cracks are caused by a combination of the cycling of the glass through humid and dry environments and the loss of alkali, leaving microscopic voids in the glass.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

''Stage Three''

:"Full-blown crizzling" occurs when the fine cracks in the glass during stage two of deterioration have progressed and are visible to the naked eye. In some cases, the crazing also gains a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;  The deeper cracks are indicative of higher amounts of alkali leaching from the glass composition. Crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass. Crizzling is far more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow. Symptoms of stage one and two may also be present on the glass if this advanced form of deterioration has not affected all of the glass's surface.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

''Stage Four''

:"Advanced crizzling" shows distinctive cracks on the surface of the glass. The fissures may be so deep that some surface material may be lost from flaking of chipping, this is referred to as spalling.:&lt;ref name="Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

''Stage Five''

:The "fragmentation stage" of crizzling is the final stage of deterioration and occurs when the structural integrity of the glass is no longer present causing the glass to separate into pieces.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

'''Cystolith''' (Gr. "cavity" and "stone") is a [[botanical]] term for outgrowths of the epidermal [[cell wall]], usually of [[calcium carbonate]], formed in a [[cellulose]] matrix in special [[cell (biology)|cell]]s called lithocysts, generally in the [[leaf]] of [[plant]]s. 

Cystoliths are present in certain [[Family (biology)|families]], including in many [[Genus|genera]] of [[Acanthaceae]]. Plants in the family [[Urticaceae]], known as [[stinging nettle]]s, also form leaf cystoliths, but only during their later flowering and seed setting stages. Other examples include [[Cannabis]] and other plants in the family [[Cannabaceae]], which produce leaf and flower cystoliths, and ''[[Ficus elastica]]'', the Indian rubber plant of the family [[Moraceae]]. 

From a 1987 article on cystolith development and structure:

{{blockquote|... The cystolith is a spindle-shaped body composed of concentric layers of longitudinally oriented cellulose [[microfibril]]s associated with [[pectin]]s and other cell wall polysaccharides. At maturity it is heavily impregnated with calcium carbonate. Some cystoliths also contain silicon and are covered in a sheath of siliceous material. Cystolith formation occurs at the tip of a peg that grows in from the lithocyst wall. Evidence from ultrastructure suggests that the lithocyst cytoplasm transports carbohydrates to the cystolith via [[Golgi apparatus#Structure|Golgi vesicle]]s, and organizes the deposition of cystolith cellulose microfibrils via a system of [[microtubule]]s lying beneath the plasma membrane that envelopes the growing cystolith. The peg is composed of heavily staining amorphous material like that of an apoplastically sealed cell wall. It is incapable of supporting the migration of lanthanum ions into the cystolith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watt, W.M.|author2=Morrell, C.K.|author3=Smith, D.L.|author4=Steer, M.W.|year=1987|title=Cystolith development and structure in Pilea cadierei (Urticaceae)|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=60|issue=1|pages=71–84|url=http://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/60/1/71/251264/Cystolith-Development-and-Structure-in-Pilea}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4086">'''Design Space Exploration''' (DSE) refers to systematic analysis and pruning of unwanted design points based on parameters of interest. While the term DSE can apply to any kind of system, we refer to electronic and embedded system design in this article.

Given the complex specification of electronic systems and the plethora of design choices ranging from the choice of components, number of components, operating modes of each of the components, connections between the components, choice of algorithm, etc.; design decisions need to be based on a systematic exploration process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pimentel|first1=Andy|title=Exploring Exploration: A Tutorial Introduction to Embedded Systems Design Space Exploration|journal=IEEE Design &amp; Test|date=Feb 2017|volume=34|issue=1|page=77-90|doi=10.1109/MDAT.2016.2626445|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738470}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the exploration process is complex because of a variety of ways in which the same functionality can be implemented. A tradeoff analysis between each of the implementation option based on a certain parameter of interest forms the basis of DSE. The parameter of interest could vary across systems, but the commonly used parameters are power, performance, and cost. Additional factors like size, shape, weight, etc. can be important for some handheld systems like cellphone and tablets. With growing usage of mobile devices, energy is also becoming a mainstream optimization parameter along with power and performance.

Owing to the complexity of the exploration process, researchers have proposed automated DSE where the exploration software is able to take decisions and comes up with the optimal solution. However, it is not possible to have an automated DSE for all kind of systems and hence there are semi-automated methods of DSE where the designer has to steer the tool after every iteration towards convergence. Since the exploration is a complex process which takes large computational time, researchers have developed exploration tools which can give an approximate analysis of the system behavior in a fraction of time compared to accurate analysis. Such tools are very important for quick comparison of design decisions and are becoming more important with increasing complexity of designs.

To simplify the complexity of DSE, researchers have been continuously striving to raise the abstractions of component and system definition to be able to cater to larger and complex systems. For example, instead of modeling a digital system at transistor or gate level, there have been attempts to use RTL or behavioral modeling. Further higher abstractions like SystemC or block diagram based modeling are also used depending on the system requirements. Modeling at higher abstractions allows fast exploration of various design choices for the lower level implementation.

The ability to operate on the space of design candidates makes DSE useful for many engineering tasks, such as rapid prototyping, optimization, and system integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2023014|title = An approach for effective design space exploration|last = Kang|first = Eunsuk|date = 2010|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |series = FOCS'10 Proceedings of the 16th Monterey conference on Foundations of computer software: modeling, development, and verification of adaptive systems|isbn = 978-3-642-21291-8|last2 = Jackson|first2 = Ethan|last3 = Schulte|first3 = Wolfram|publisher = Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

is a nascent movement in real estate development that preserves and invests in agricultural land use.  As farmland is lost due to the challenging economics of farming and the pressures of the real estate industry, DSA attempts to reconcile the need for development with the need to preserve agricultural land. The overall goal of DSA is to incubate small-scale organic farms that co-exist with residential land development, providing benefits to farmers, residents, the local community, and the environment.

A related term, ''agricultural urbanism'', refers to agricultural operations located in proximity to and integrated with urban areas.  The term of agricultural urbanism was coined by Mark Holland and Janine de la Salle, and is based on their book by the same name, published by Green Frigate Press in 2010 (De la Salle and Holland et al.).  The term and concept of Agricultural Urbanism was originally developed in British Columbia in 2008 during a planning process for a development project called Southlands in South Delta, Metro Vancouver and was introduced to planner, real estate developer, and founder of the New Urbanism movement, Andres Duany, as part of the preparation for a design charrette which Duany and his team were involved in. 

Two academics who authored a chapter (Patrick Condon from UBC and Kent Mulnix from Kwantlen Polytechnic) posited the original idea of using development to support agriculture by using mechanisms such as transferring density rights from agricultural land onto adjacent areas and preserving the agricultural land through covenants while harvesting the development land value in the adjacent area that received the transferred development rights. 

Andres Duany has been a significant proponent of the idea as well as the author of a similar stream of thought called Agrarain Urbanism.  Duany’s adoption of the concept has given it a higher profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawley|first=Steve|title=Agricultural Urbanism:Transects and Food Planning|url=http://www.houstontomorrow.org/initiatives/story/agricultural-urbanism/|publisher=HoustonTomorrow|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The term ''development-supported agriculture'' (DSA) was coined to describe the Harvest project. A variety of individuals collaborated on the project, including planner Duane Verner, developer Nathan Wieler, members of Piedmont Biofuels, participants in the Sustainable Agriculture program at Central Carolina Community College, and others. The group set out to determine the best usage for an existing farm that was being sold by the owner, a career farmer named Paul McCoy. It became clear that the group had an opportunity to create a unique residential community where farmers and residents have a symbiotic relationship. This relationship would benefit all involved, while also improving the general state of residential development and helping to reduce the ecological destruction associated with typical residential development models. Reynolds &amp; Jewell Landscape Architecture was retained to design the master plan for the community, and the team grew to include experienced organic farmers, experts on native plants, and others. As of July 2008, the developer is actively implementing the master plan, and response to the concept has been overwhelmingly positive.

==DSA and CSA==

Development-supported agriculture has its roots in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) movement. However, whereas CSA typically focuses on establishing a direct business relationship between consumers and farmers, DSA builds on a [[barter]] approach first and foremost, while also ensuring that products from DSA farms are integrated into the local economy. On a more general level, DSA is a response to concerns about the urbanization of agricultural land and an attempt to preserve existing farms. Another goal of DSA is to establish a new generation of farmers by using the revenue from real estate development to establish small-scale organic farms that are protected in perpetuity by conservation easements and property covenants.

== Five points of DSA ==

Development-supported agriculture is based on the concept of a master-planned residential development with farming as the central amenity. This model provides residents with the benefits of, and the opportunity to experience, small-scale organic farming. Property owners have the option of participating in the farming or leasing their land to a farmer; in either case, the farmland is protected from development. Homesites are restricted to certain areas and continuous areas of open space are maintained across multiple properties.

In the spirit of [[Le Corbusier| Le Corbusier's]] "Five Points of a New Architecture," DSA focuses on five core principles:

# Preservation of farmland through limited development and continuity of previous farming uses.
# Agreements between developers and farmers (development provides farm infrastructure, farmers provide farm products to residents and the local community).
# Low-impact development techniques, sustainable architecture, and careful ecological/environmental planning.
# Establishment of wildlife corridors and animal habitats, promotion of native plant species, and protection of water quality.
# Utilization of an open-source development model that provides a framework for master-planned farm communities and integrated local food systems.

== Examples ==

=== Developments in the urban-rural fringe ===

'''Harvest, North Carolina'''

Harvest&lt;ref&gt;http://wieler.com/communities/harvest/overview/&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} development introduced in 2008, sited in the [[New Hope River Valley]] in [[Chatham County, North Carolina]].  The development consists of 20 individual properties with an organic farm as the literal and metaphorical center of the community.  A farmbelt easement protects farmland and preserves rural views.

According to Paul McCoy, the previous owner of the land, the Harvest property had been used for farming since the American Revolution.  During the middle of the 20th century, the primary use of the farm was for growing tobacco.  In the late 20th century, the farm was used to grow a typical rotation of tobacco, corn, and soybeans. In 2008, the developer of Harvest began transitioning the farm from conventional operations to organic certification. The change from commercial (i.e. using pesticides) to organic farming will help protect the water quality of nearby Jordan Lake and the Haw River. 

'''Serenbe, Georgia'''

Another example of an urban-rural fringe project that fits into the DSA framework is [[Serenbe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serenbecommunity.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; This community is located on one of the last undeveloped parcels of land in the [[Atlanta]] area. The founders of Serenbe realized that their largely untouched {{convert|900|acre|km2}} presented a window of opportunity for creating a unique type of residential development. A {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} organic farm is located at Serenbe that provides organic produce throughout Atlanta and The Chattahoochee Hill Country. The {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of Serenbe lie in the heart of {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} protected with a master plan that calls for 80% green space. Building sites are limited to 220 structures, including live/work spaces and commercial buildings.

'''Middle Green Valley, Solano County, CA'''

One of the largest and most recent examples of development-supported agriculture is in Middle Green Valley in southwestern Solano County, California.  
The City of Fairfield to the south, and unincorporated Solano County to the north, have continued to entitle subdivisions while Green Valley has remained largely undeveloped agricultural land and open space.  Like many places at the edge of suburban boundaries, there has been a longstanding conflict between the open space desired by neighbors and development rights desired by landowners.  The landowners in this part of Green Valley have been under pressure to preserve the rural culture, even as the basic economics of agriculture have eroded the financial viability of their lands.  Usually, the only viable choice was to develop their property to realize economic benefit.  Many of the landowners, some whose families have cultivated the land for over 150 years, wished to realize the development value while at the same time maintain the integrity of the open space, agricultural productivity and the farming legacy.

In 2010, at significant cost and with no guarantee of success, the Solano County Board of Supervisors – with meaningful participation from landowners AND neighborhood groups – approved a Specific Plan for Middle Green Valley.  The final plan includes more than 1,400 acres of protected agricultural and open space and a small village of about 400 clustered homes that are shielded from the main views from Green Valley Road.  Over 15 different land owners covering almost 200 acres signed the Master Development Agreement putting this plan into place.  The entire Specific Plan can be obtained at: 

http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/rm/documents/eir/middle_green_valley_specific_plan.asp

Preserving the rural beauty and cultural legacy of the Green Valley area is the guiding vision in crafting a long term, equitable, and sustainable development plan. The Specific Plan celebrates and perpetuates the tradition of the working landscapes that characterize this part of Solano County for over 150 years. A core component is the promotion of sustainable food and agriculture systems as a means to connect agricultural lands, the built and natural environments, community health and natural resource stewardship.

The Green Valley Agricultural Conservancy

To provide assurances for the long-term preservation and management of the open space, the Middle Green Valley Specific Plan envisioned the creation of a non-profit Conservancy (the GVAC) to oversee the ±1,490 acres of productive agricultural land, pastures, and natural areas. The Conservancy has three primary areas of responsibility:

* Assisting and encouraging the farms in Green Valley;
* Overseeing the management, stewardship, enhancement, restoration and access easements for conservation lands; and
* Managing and developing a design review process for the community 

One of the first tangible initiatives by the Conservancy to promote and support local farmers and artisans has been the creation of Totally Local - a new Certified Farmers' Market (CFM) - that was started in July 2011. The Green Valley Farmers' Market provides a community gathering place to share a cup of coffee, meet the local farmers, taste some great local food, and simply have some conversation with neighbors. The Conservancy’s goal is not to compete with, but rather compliment the already established food stands and local artisans in the region to help provide a stable platform for featuring LOCAL agricultural and artisan products.

=== Future possibilities: vertical farming ===

[[Vertical farming]], also known as skyfarming, is a conceptual form of agriculture done in urban high-rises. In these high-rises, food such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and livestock can be raised by using greenhouse growing methods and recycled resources year-round, allowing cities of the future to become self-sufficient. The concept of the vertical farm remains mostly hypothetical; however, many people believe that this type of development will become necessary as a result of increased [[urban density]] and rising energy costs.

The '''Divided Visual Field Paradigm''' is an experimental technique that involves measuring task performance when visual stimuli are presented on the left or right visual hemifields.  If a visual stimulus appears in the left visual field (LVF), the visual information is initially projected to the right cerebral hemisphere (RH), and conversely, if a visual stimulus appears in the right visual field (RVF), the visual information is initially received by the left cerebral hemisphere (LH).  In this way, if a [[cerebral hemisphere]] has functional advantages with some aspect of a particular task, an experimenter might observe improvements in task performance when the visual information is presented on the contralateral visual field.&lt;ref name="Banich"&gt;Banich, M.T. (2003). The divided visual field technique in laterality and interhemispheric integration. In K. Hughdahl (Ed.), ''Experimental Methods in Neuropsychology'' (pp. 47-63). New York: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourne"&gt;Bourne, V.J. (2006). The divided visual field paradigm: Methodological considerations. ''Laterality, 11'', 373-393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The divided visual field paradigm capitalizes on the lateralization of the [[visual system]].  Each cerebral hemisphere only receives information from one half of the visual field—specifically, from the contralateral hemifield.  For example, retinal projections from [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]] in the left eye that receive information from the left visual field cross to the right hemisphere at the [[optic chiasm]]; while information from the right visual field received by the left eye will not cross at the optic chiasm, and will remain on the left hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, G. (2001). Architecture of the optic chiasm and the mechanisms that sculpt its development. ''Physiological Reviews, 81''(4), 1393-1414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stimuli presented on the right visual field (RVF) will ultimately be processed first by the left hemisphere's (LH) occipital cortex, while stimuli presented of the left visual field (LVF) will be processed first by the right hemisphere's (RH) occipital cortex.
Because lateralized visual information is initially segregated between the two cerebral hemispheres, any differences in task performance (e.g., improved response time) between LVF/RVF conditions might be interpreted as differences in the RH or LH's ability to perform the task.

==Methodology==
To enable the lateralized presentation of visual stimuli, participants must first be fixated at a centralized location, and must be unable to anticipate whether an upcoming stimulus will be presented to the right or left of fixation. 
 
Because the center of the visual field, the fovea, may project bilaterally to both RH and LH,&lt;ref name="Lindell"&gt;Lindell, A.K. &amp; Nicholls, M.E.R. (2003). Cortical representation of the fovea: Implications for visual half-field research. ''Cortex, 39'',111-117.&lt;/ref&gt; lateralized stimuli should appear sufficiently far from fixation.  Researchers recommend that the inside edge of any visual stimulus should be between 2.5° and 3° from central fixation &lt;ref name="Bourne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunt"&gt;Bunt, A.H., Minckler, D.S., &amp; Johanson, G.W. (1977). Demonstration of bilateral projection of the central retina of the monkey with horseradish peroxidase neuronography. ''Journal of Comparative Neurology, 17'', 619-630.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lateralized stimuli must also be presented very briefly, to eliminate the participant's ability to make an eye-movement toward the lateralized stimulus (which would result in the stimulus no longer being lateralized, and instead projected to both cerebral hemispheres).  Since [[saccade|saccadic]] latencies to a lateralized stimulus can be as fast as 150ms following stimulus onset, the lateralized stimulus should only be presented for a duration of 180ms at most.&lt;ref name="Bourne" /&gt;

A free software tool called the "Lateralizer" has been developed for piloting and conducting customizable experiments using the divided visual field paradigm.&lt;ref name="Motz"&gt;Motz, B.A., James, K.H., &amp; Busey, T.A. (2012). The Lateralizer: a tool for students to explore the divided brain. ''Advances in Physiology Education, 36'', 220-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
A significant difference between RVF/LH and LVF/RH task performance using the divided visual field paradigm does provide evidence of a functional asymmetry between the two cerebral hemispheres.  However, as described by Ivry and Robertson (1998), there are limitations to the types of inferences that can be made from this technique:

&lt;blockquote&gt; These [divided visual field] methods have their limitations.  A critical assumption has been that differences in performance with lateralized stimuli nearly always reflect functional differences between the two hemispheres. This is an extremely strong assumption.  Researchers have tended to ignore or downplay the fact that asymmetries in brain function cannot be directly observed with these methods.  It would require a leap of faith to assume that there is a straightforward mapping between lateralizing a stimulus and producing disproportionate activation throughout the contralateral hemisphere.  Normal subjects have an intact corpus callosum, which provides for the rapid transfer of information from one hemisphere to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ivry, R.B. &amp; Robertson, L.C. (1998). ''The two sides of perception.'' Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Visual information can be transferred from one cerebral hemisphere to the other in as little as 3ms,&lt;ref&gt;Poffenberger, A.T. (1912). ''Reaction time to retinal stimulation: with special reference to the time lost in conduction through nerve centers (No. 23) ''. University of Virginia: The Science Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cherbuin, N. &amp; Brinkman, C. (2006). Hemispheric interactions are different in left-handed individuals. ''Neuropsychology, 20'' (6), 700-707.&lt;/ref&gt; so any task differences greater than 3ms may represent asymmetries in neural dynamics that are more complex than a single hemisphere's simple dominance for a particular task.  
Moreover, the divided visual field technique represents a relatively coarse and indirect method for localizing brain regions associated with cognitive function.  Other neuroimaging techniques, including [[fMRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], will provide more spatial resolution, and more direct measures of neural activity.  However, these methods are significantly more costly than the divided visual field paradigm.

The '''Dunton Technical Centre''' (informally '''Ford Dunton''' or '''Dunton''') is a major automotive research and development facility located in [[Dunton Wayletts]], [[Laindon]], [[Essex]], [[United Kingdom]] owned and operated by [[Ford Motor Company]]. It was the largest automotive technical centre in the United Kingdom and takes its name from the nearby [[Dunton Wayletts]].&lt;ref name=theengin1/&gt; Ford Dunton houses the main design team of [[Ford of Europe]] alongside its [[Merkenich Technical Centre]] in [[Cologne]], Germany. In 2007, Dunton had around 3,000 staff working at the site.&lt;ref name=gaz1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/1754626.ford_dunton_turns_40/|title=Ford Dunton turns 40|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Daily Gazette|date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[Image:Approach Road to Ford's Dunton - geograph.org.uk - 927711.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The entrance to Ford Dunton.]]
Ford Dunton is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2116413 situated] at the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2140424 junction] of ''West Mayne'' (B148) and the [[A127 road|A127]] Southend Arterial Road, in [[Dunton Wayletts]] in the district of [[Basildon (borough)|Basildon]]. An electricity pylon line straddles the site. In front of the building, to the north, is a vehicle test track. To the south is the Southfields Business Park. The site lies in the religious parish of Laindon with Dunton, formerly in Dunton and [[Bulphan]] before 1976. Dunton is a small hamlet to the west, with a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2135721 former church] near Dunton Hall. There is a Ford dealership on the B148 on the north-west corner of the site.

==History==
===Construction===
Ford Dunton was constructed by [[George Wimpey]] for a contracted price of £6.5 million. The total cost of the centre was around £10 million. The centre originally had {{convert|45,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space for design work, making it the largest engineering research centre in Europe. Another development site at [[Aveley]] had been opened in 1956 which made prototype cars and spare parts, and closed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3431869.stm Aveley site closes in 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's earlier UK design site was at Dagenham (5 start building) and it previously had seven engineering sites around the UK, with five in Essex; these all moved to Dunton.

Ford Dunton was opened by [[Harold Wilson]], then the British Prime Minister, on 12 October 1967.&lt;ref name=gaz1/&gt;

===1967 to 2000===
At the time of its opening, Dunton was assigned responsibility within Ford of Europe for vehicle design, interior styling, chassis and body interior engineering, engine calibration and product planning. Ford's Merkenich Centre in Cologne, Germany was given principal responsibility for body and electrical engineering, base engine design, advanced engine development, exterior styling, homologation, vehicle development (ride, handling, NVH) and transmission engineering. This was a 'systems' approach to the engineering process intended to eliminate the duplication of engineering responsibility within Ford of Europe.

In the late 1960s Dunton worked on an experimental electric car, first shown on 7 June 1967, and called the [[Ford Comuta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAkQhbgpkpIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Ford+Comuta+dunton&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GHvtTcDACIGa8QPstoG-Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Comuta%20dunton&amp;f=false|title=Battery-car progress - at 8 mile an hour in 25 years|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=New Scientist|date=9 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1971 Peter Walker opened a £1 million engine emissions laboratory at Dunton, the largest of its type in Europe. In November 1974 the world's first automated (computerised) multiple engine (six) test bed was constructed at Dunton, built in co-operation with the engineering department of [[Queen Mary, University of London]]. In 1974 a [[GE-600 series|Honeywell 6050]] computer was installed at Dunton at a cost of £820,000. The computer was linked to Merkenich and to the Ford test track at [[Lommel Proving Grounds|Lommel]] in Belgium. From 1978 Dunton had access to a [[CDC Cyber|CDC Cyber 176]] computer at the USA base in Dearborn.

By 1984 staff at Dunton were conducting video-conferences with colleagues at Merkenich, using the ECS-1 satellite, and enabled by British Telecom International. In 1988 Dunton prepared the way for design of the Mondeo (codename [[Ford CDW27 platform|CDW27]]) by pioneering, in collaboration with Merkenich, the World Engineering Release System (WERS). Dunton at this time was the most advanced automotive development centre in Europe.

In 1995 Dunton, in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], developed a device which is capable of detecting different [[List of synthetic polymers|types of plastic]] (for recycling) using the [[triboelectric effect]], including polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon and [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS).

On 16 December 1997 [[Alexander Trotman, Baron Trotman]] opened a £128 million environmental engine testing facility at Dunton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/39990.stm|title=Motorists face fines for dirty fumes|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=16 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 to present===
In 2003 a [[Silicon Graphics International]] (SGI) Reality Centre was constructed at Dunton, incorporating [[SGI Origin 3000 and Onyx 3000|SGI Onyx 3000]] [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualisation]] supercomputers, using the [[InfiniteReality|InfiniteReality3]] graphics rendering system.

In March 2010 Ford announced plans to develop a new generation of environmentally friendly engines and vehicle technologies at Dunton following an announcement by the UK Government that it would underwrite £360 million of a £450 million loan to Ford from the European Investment Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.essexcountystandard.co.uk/news/localnews/5067894.Jobs_safeguarded_at_Ford_in_Essex/|title=Jobs safeguarded at Ford in Essex|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Essex County Standard|date=18 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154239/http://www.essexcountystandard.co.uk/news/localnews/5067894.Jobs_safeguarded_at_Ford_in_Essex/|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 the new coalition government confirmed that it would honour the loan commitment, and the contract was signed in a ceremony at Dunton attended by the business minister Mark Prisk on 12 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.basildonrecorder.co.uk/news/echo/8268255.Coalition_to_honour___360m_loan_to_Ford_Dunton/|title=Coalition to honour £360m loan to Ford Dunton|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Basildon Recorder|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years Dunton has been responsible for the development of the [[ECOnetic]] range of vehicles, and has contributed to development of the [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] range of engines.

==Activities==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Dunton houses the main design team of Ford of Europe, alongside its [[Merkenich Technical Centre]] in Cologne. Currently Dunton has responsibility for the design of the [[Ford Fiesta]], the [[Ford Ka]], engines for Ford of Europe (powertrain), commercial vehicles and the interior of Ford of Europe cars. It has facilities to simultaneously test fifteen cars and around one hundred engines. Around 3,000 engineers currently work at Dunton.

Ford Dunton is also the home of [[Ford Team RS]], and as part of the Special Vehicle Engineering section of Ford created by [[Rod Mansfield]], developed the [[Hot hatch|XR family]] of '[[hot hatch]]' vehicles with the [[Ford Fiesta RS Turbo]], more recently becoming the RS family of vehicles. Ford also notably worked in this area of design with [[Cosworth]] of [[Northampton]].

'''''Eco''RI''' (pronounced "eco R one") is a restriction [[endonuclease]] enzyme isolated from species ''[[E. coli]].'' The ''Eco'' part of the enzyme's name originates from the species from which it was isolated, while the R represents the particular strain, in this case RY13. The last part of its name, the I, denotes that it was the first enzyme isolated from this strain. ''Eco''RI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA double helices into fragments at specific sites. It is also a part of the [[restriction modification system]].

In [[molecular biology]] it is used as a [[restriction enzyme]]. ''Eco''RI creates 4 nucleotide [[DNA end|sticky ends]] with [[5' end]] overhangs of AATT. The nucleic acid recognition sequence where the enzyme cuts is G/AATTC, which has a [[Palindrome|palindromic]], complementary sequence of CTTAA/G. The / in the sequence indicates which phosphodiester bond the enzyme will break in the DNA molecule. Other restriction enzymes, depending on their cut sites, can also leave 3' overhangs or blunt ends with no overhangs.

== Structure ==

=== Primary structure ===
''Eco''RI contains the PD..D/EXK motif within its active site like many [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]].

=== Tertiary and quaternary structure ===
The enzyme is a [[homodimer]] of a 31 kilodalton subunit consisting of one globular domain of the α/β architecture. Each subunit contains a loop which sticks out from the globular domain and wraps around the DNA when bound.&lt;ref name="Pingoud"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurpiewski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurpiewski MR, Engler LE, Wozniak LA, Kobylanska A, Koziolkiewicz M, Stec WJ, Jen-Jacobson L | title = Mechanisms of coupling between DNA recognition specificity and catalysis in EcoRI endonuclease | journal = Structure | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 1775–88 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15458627 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2004.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:EcoRI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg|thumb|175x175px|''Ec''oRI recognition site with cutting pattern indicated by a green line]]

''Eco''RI has been cocrystallized with the sequence it normally cuts. This crystal was used to solve the structure of the complex {{PDB2|1QPS}}. The solved crystal structure shows that the subunits of the enzyme [[homodimer]] interact with the DNA symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Pingoud" /&gt; In the complex, two [[Alpha helix|α-helices]] from each subunit come together to form a four-helix bundle.&lt;ref name="Bitinaite"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bitinaite J, Wah DA, Aggarwal AK, Schildkraut I | title = FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 18 | pages = 10570–5 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9724744 | pmc = 27935 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the interacting helices are residues Glu144 and Arg145, which interact together, forming a crosstalk ring that is believed to allow the enzyme's two active sites to communicate.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YC, Grable JC, Love R, Greene PJ, Rosenberg JM | title = Refinement of Eco RI endonuclease crystal structure: a revised protein chain tracing | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4974 | pages = 1307–9 | date = September 1990 | pmid = 2399465 | doi = 10.1126/science.2399465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Restriction enzymes, such as ''Eco''RI, are used in a wide variety of molecular genetics techniques including [[Clone (genetics)|cloning]], DNA screening and deleting sections of DNA ''in vitro''. Restriction enzymes, like ''Eco''RI, that generate [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky ends]] of DNA are often used to cut DNA prior to [[DNA ligase|ligation]], as the sticky ends make the [[DNA ligase|ligation reaction]] more efficient. ''Eco''RI can exhibit non-site-specific cutting, known as [[star activity]], depending on the conditions present in the reaction. Conditions that can induce star activity when using ''Eco''RI include low salt concentration, high glycerol concentration, excessive amounts of enzyme present in the reaction, high pH and contamination with certain organic solvents. The cut made by the Eco RI enzyme produces sticky ends on the vector mainly plasmids or viral DNA's. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/faqproductR0101.asp#1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:European Environment Agency Building in Copenhagen at winter.jpg|thumb|European Environment Agency Building in Copenhagen in winter]]
The '''European Environment Agency''' ('''EEA''') is the [[agency of the European Union]] (EU) which provides independent information on the environment.

==Definition==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the [[agency of the European Union]] (EU) which provides independent information on the environment. 
Its goal is to help those involved in developing, implementing and evaluating [[environmental policy]], and to inform the general public.

==Organization==
The EEA was established by the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) Regulation 1210/1990 (amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999 and EC Regulation 401/2009) and became operational in 1994,  headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

The agency is governed by a management board composed of representatives of the governments of its 33 member states, a [[European Commission]] representative and two scientists appointed by the [[European Parliament]], assisted by a committee of scientists.
The current Executive Director of the agency is Professor [[Hans Bruyninckx]], who has been appointed for a five-year term. He is the successor of Professor [[Jacqueline McGlade]].

==Member countries==
The [[Member states of the European Union|member states]] of the union are members; however other states may become members of it by means of agreements concluded between them and the EU.

It was the first EU body to open its membership to the 13 candidate countries (pre-[[enlargement of the EU|2004 enlargement]]).

The EEA has 33 member countries and six cooperating countries. The 33 member countries include the 28 EU Member States together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.

The six Balkans countries are cooperating countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99. These cooperation activities are integrated into Eionet and are supported by the EU under the "Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance".

The EEA is an active member of the [[EPA Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epanet.ew.eea.europa.eu/ European Network of the Heads of Environment Protection Agencies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 33 member countries include the 28 [[European Union member state]]s together with [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]]. The six [[Western Balkans|Western Balkan]] countries are cooperating countries: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] as well as [[Kosovo]] under the [[UN Security Council]] Resolution 1244/99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/countries-and-eionet Countries and Eionet], European Environment Agency, Retrieved on 24 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reports ==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) reported in 2017 that climate-related extreme events accounted ca €400 billion ($430 billion) of economic losses in EEA area from 1980 to 2013, and were responsible for 85,000 deaths during 1980-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Chestney [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-climatechange-idUSKBN15912K South, southeast face Europe's most adverse climate change impact: agency]  Reuters, January 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==European environment information and observation network==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}} 
{{unreferenced section |date=July 2018}} 
The European environment information and observation network (Eionet) is a partnership network of the EEA and the countries. The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities. To do so, the EEA works closely together with national focal points (NFP´s), typically national environment agencies or environment ministries which are responsible for coordinating national networksof the National Reference Centres (NRCs) involving many institutions (about 350 in all).

Apart from the NFPs and NRCs, Eionet covers six European Topic Centres (ETCs) in the areas of air and climate change, biological diversity, climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, water, land use and spatial information and analysis and [[sustainable consumption]] and production.

==Annual discharge process==
In February 2012, the [[European Parliament]]'s Committee on Budgetary Control published a draft report, identifying areas of concern in the use of funds and its influence for the 2010 budget such as a 26%  budget increase  from 2009 to 2010 to €50 600 000.&lt;ref name= budg&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120215ATT38159/20120215ATT38159EN.pdf Draft Report on discharge on the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2010] 14 pages, 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} and questioned that maximum competition and value-for-money principles were honored in hiring, also possible fictitious employees.&lt;ref name= budg/&gt;{{rp|10}}

[[File:Fat_composition_in_foods.png|thumb|Composition of fats from various foods, as percentage of their total fat.]]

'''Fat''' is one of the three main [[macronutrients]], along with the other two: [[carbohydrate]] and [[protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/macronutrients.htm|title = Macronutrients: the Importance of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat|date = |accessdate = 20 September 2014|website = McKinley Health Center|publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms, thus they are all [[hydrocarbon]] molecules. Examples include [[cholesterol]], [[phospholipids]] and [[triglyceride]]s.

The terms "[[lipid]]", "[[oil]]" and "fat" are often confused. "Lipid" is the general term, though a lipid is not necessarily a [[triglyceride]]. "Oil" normally refers to a lipid with short or [[Unsaturated (hydrocarbon)|unsaturated]] fatty acid chains that is liquid at [[room temperature]], while "fat" (in the strict sense) may specifically refer to lipids that are solids at room temperature – however, "fat" (in the broad sense) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid. Fats, like other lipids, are generally [[hydrophobic]], and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.

Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life, and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions.  They are a necessary part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of most [[heterotroph]]s (including humans) and are the most energy dense, thus the most efficient form of energy storage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/fat-and-protein-metabolism/v/introduction-to-energy-storage | title = Introduction to Energy Storage | publisher = [[Khan Academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not bind water thus do not increase body mass as much as proteins, especially carbohydrates, both of which bind a lot more water. 

Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents. There are two [[essential fatty acids]] (EFAs) in human nutrition: [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozaffarian|first=Dariush|last2=Katan|first2=Martijn B.|last3=Ascherio|first3=Alberto|last4=Stampfer|first4=Meir J.|last5=Willett|first5=Walter C.|date=2006-04-13|title=Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601–1613|doi=10.1056/NEJMra054035|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16611951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt; Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats. Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called [[lipase]]s produced in the [[pancreas]].

Fats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain. Fats that are [[saturated fat]]s have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain. [[Unsaturated fat]]s have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain. The nomenclature is based on the non-acid (non-carbonyl) end of the chain. This end is called the omega end or the n-end. Thus [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] is called an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end. Some oils and fats have multiple double bonds and are therefore called  [[polyunsaturated fats]]. Unsaturated fats can be further divided into [[cis fat]]s, which are the most common in nature, and [[trans fat]]s, which are rare in nature. Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This action, called [[hydrogenation]], tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat. To make vegetable shortening, then, liquid ''cis''-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40&amp;nbsp;°C), and store well, whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air. However, [[trans fat]]s are generated during hydrogenation as contaminants created by an unwanted side reaction on the catalyst during partial hydrogenation.

Saturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature.  For example, animal fats [[tallow]] and [[lard]] are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids.  Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid. Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 [[Calorie|food calories]] (37 [[Joule|kJ]] = 8.8 [[Calorie|kcal]]).&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/contents/made The Food Labelling Regulations 1996] &amp;ndash; [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/7/made Schedule 7: Nutrition labelling]&lt;/ref&gt; Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, [[Glycerin|glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.  Glycerol itself can be converted to [[glucose]] by the liver and so become a source of energy.

==Chemical structure==
{{main| Triglyceride}}[[File:Triglyceride Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|Example of a natural triglyceride with three different fatty acids. One fatty acid is saturated (&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; highlighted), another contains one [[double bond]] within the carbon chain (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;'''green'''&lt;/span&gt; highlighted). The third  fatty acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid, highlighted in &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''red'''&lt;/span&gt;) contains three [[double bond]]s within the carbon chain. All carbon-carbon double bonds shown are ''cis'' isomers. ]]
There are many different kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure.  All fats are derivatives of [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Most fats are [[glyceride]]s, particularly [[triglyceride]]s ([[ester|triesters]] of glycerol). One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid (-COOH) with the alcohol; I.e. three chains per molecule. Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an -O- bond through [[Condensation reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. This process is called [[esterification]] and fats are therefore [[ester]]s.  As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and [[bond angle|angles]] of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E.  The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol "backbone" would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines. Fats therefore have "ester" [[Chemical bond|bonds]].

The properties of any specific fat molecule depend on the particular fatty acids that constitute it.  Fatty acids form a family of compounds that are composed of increasing numbers of carbon atoms linked into a zig-zag chain (hydrogen atoms to the side). The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid, the longer its chain will be.  Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction (in this case, [[van der Waals forces]]), and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature ([[melting point]]).

|}

Fatty acid chains may also differ by length, often categorized as short to very long.
* Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons (i.e. butyric acid).
* Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6–12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.
* Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons.
* Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons.
Any of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short [[triformin]] to very long, e.g., cerotic acid, or ''hexacosanoic acid'', a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid. Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow (lard) whose chains are 17 carbons long. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Importance for living organisms ===

Fats are also sources of [[essential fatty acid]]s, an important dietary requirement. They provide energy as noted above. [[Vitamin]]s [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]] are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy [[skin]] and [[hair]], insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as [[excretion]], [[urination]], accidental or intentional [[bloodletting]], [[sebum]] excretion, and [[hair]] growth.

==Adipose tissue==
[[File:Fatmouse.jpg|right|thumb|The [[obesity|obese]] [[mouse]] on the left has large stores of adipose tissue. For comparison, a mouse with a normal amount of adipose tissue is shown on the right.]]
{{main|Adipose tissue}}
In animals, [[adipose tissue]], or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. [[Adipocyte]]s (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver [[metabolism]]. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the [[circulatory system|circulation]]. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., [[insulin]], [[glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]]). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone [[leptin]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/adipose|title=The human proteome in adipose - The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: [[visceral fat]] is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas "[[subcutaneous fat]]" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but ''above'' the abdominal muscle wall).  Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., [[hormone]]s), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is [[resistin]] which has been linked to obesity, [[insulin resistance]], and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.

==Fatty acids and human health==

Dietary consumption of fatty acids has effects on human health. Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with ''cis'' unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the [[Cochrane Library]] concluded: "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats."&lt;ref&gt;Hooper et al., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737/abstract;jsessionid=0DEB4D52F5ECDF485FAD400C5795A535.f02t04 "Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease"],''Cochrane Database Syst Rev''. 2015 Jun 10;'''(6)''':CD011737.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have also found that consumption of ''trans'' fats increases risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;  The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] advises that replacing ''trans'' fats and saturated fats with ''cis'' monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/ "Fats and Cholesterol"], ''Harvard School of Public Health''.

'''''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule''''' (''Foreign Languages and University'') is a triannual [[academic journal]] published by the [[German Association of University Language Centers]].

==History==
The journal was created in 1968 under the title ''AKS-Rundbrief'' (= AKS-Circular) by the German Association of University Language Centers. Being a practice-oriented journal in the first phase of its existence, it has developed into an academic, at times empirical, journal throughout the years.

==Content and scope==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' covers [[second language acquisition]], [[language education]], and [[applied linguistics]], with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[German language|German]] as foreign languages being the potential target languages. Intercultural analyses represent an important part as well. Publication languages are German as well as any of the languages mentioned above.

==Publication and editors==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' is published triannually by the German Association of Language Centers, which is a sub-organization of the [[European Association of Language Centers]]. There are three editors, with manuscripts requiring two positive votes.

==Article types==
In addition to academic [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[book review]]s on relevant publications, including newly published [[textbook]]s, are also included. In addition, the journal publishes [[call for papers|calls for papers]] and [[academic conference]] announcements. The journal also serves as an information and publication platform for [[UNIcert]] - the international education and certification system for foreign languages taught at universities, which was founded in [[Germany]] and whose headquarters are located there.

With the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] in the [[Renaissance]], the poetry of [[Ovid]] became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of '''[[Greek mythology]]''' through subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="BrBurn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;br /&gt;* L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', the [[Leda and the Swan|Ledas]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]''.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Through the medium of [[Latin]] and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Dante]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature.  Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, [[Chaucer]], the [[Elizabethan]]s and [[John Milton]] were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from [[Shakespeare]] to [[Robert Bridges]] turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. [[Jean Racine]] in [[France]] and [[Goethe]] in [[Germany]] revived Greek drama.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Racine reworked the ancient myths &amp;mdash; including those of [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaidra]], [[Andromache]], Oedipus and [[Iphigeneia]] &amp;mdash; to new purpose.&lt;ref name="Burn75"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Francisco Goya, [[Europa (mythology)|''The rape of Europa'']] ''(El rapto de Europa),'' 1772]]
In the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] spread throughout Europe.  It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the [[libretti]] for [[Handel]]'s operas ''[[Admeto]]'' and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'', [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''.&lt;ref name="Burn75" /&gt; By the end of the century, [[Romanticism]] initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including  Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and [[Homer]]'s works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as [[Keats]], [[Byron]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="Burn75-76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[poet laureate]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of [[King Arthur]] are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the [[Parthenon marbles]] in 1816; many of the "Greek" paintings of [[Lord Leighton]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.&lt;ref name="Burn76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

American authors of the 19th century, such as [[Thomas Bulfinch]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature.&lt;ref name="Klatt"&gt;Klatt-Brazouski, ''Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulfinch, "The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men.

Sanborn, Carter, and Bazin.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as [[Jean Anouilh]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Jean Giraudoux]] in France, [[Eugene O'Neill]] in America, and [[T. S. Eliot]] in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish [[James Joyce]] and the French [[André Gide]].

The '''heat death of the universe''' is a plausible [[ultimate fate of the universe]] in which the [[universe]] has evolved to a state of no [[thermodynamic free energy]] and therefore can no longer sustain processes that increase [[entropy]]. Heat death does not imply any particular [[Thermodynamic temperature#Internal energy at absolute zero|absolute temperature]]; it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform [[work (thermodynamics)|work]]. In the language of [[physics]], this is when the universe reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] (maximum entropy).

If the topology of the universe is [[Big Freeze|open or flat]], or if [[dark energy]] is a positive [[cosmological constant]] (both of which are consistent with current data), the universe will continue expanding forever, and a heat death is expected to occur,&lt;ref name="DftS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the universe cooling to approach equilibrium at a very low temperature after a very long time period.

The hypothesis of heat death stems from the ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] (Lord Kelvin), who in the 1850s took the [[theory of heat]] as [[mechanical energy]] loss in nature (as embodied in the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale.

==Origins of the idea==
The idea of heat death stems from the [[second law of thermodynamics]], of which one version states that entropy tends to increase in an [[isolated system]]. From this, the hypothesis infers that if the universe lasts for a sufficient time, it will [[asymptotically]] approach a state where all [[energy]] is evenly distributed. In other words, according to this hypothesis, there is a tendency in nature to the [[dissipation]] (energy transformation) of [[mechanical energy]] (motion) into [[thermal energy]]; hence, by extrapolation, there exists the view that, in time, the mechanical movement of the universe will run down as work is converted to heat because of the second law.

The conjecture that all bodies in the universe cool off, eventually becoming too cold to support life, seems to have been first put forward by the French astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]] in 1777 in his writings on the history of astronomy and in the ensuing correspondence with [[Voltaire]]. In Bailly's view, all planets have an [[Internal heating|internal heat]] and are now at some particular stage of cooling. [[Jupiter]], for instance, is still too hot for life to arise there for thousands of years, while the [[Moon]] is already too cold. The final state, in this view, is described as one of "equilibrium" in which all motion ceases.&lt;ref&gt;

The idea of heat death as a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics, however, was first proposed in loose terms beginning in 1851 by William Thomson, who theorized further on the mechanical energy loss views of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (1824), [[James Joule]] (1843), and [[Rudolf Clausius]] (1850). Thomson's views were then elaborated on more definitively over the next decade by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[William Rankine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===History===
The idea of heat death of the universe derives from discussion of the application of the first two laws of thermodynamics to universal processes. Specifically, in 1851, William Thomson outlined the view, as based on recent experiments on the dynamical [[theory of heat]]: "heat is not a substance, but a dynamical form of mechanical effect, we perceive that there must be an equivalence between mechanical work and heat, as between cause and effect."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir William. (1851). [https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_dynamical_theory_of_heat.html "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule’s equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault’s Observations on Steam"] Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'', March 1851, and ''[[Philosophical Magazine|Philosophical Magazine IV]]'', 1852. [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|175px|right|thumb|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] originated the idea of universal heat death in 1852.]]

In 1852, Thomson published ''On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy'', in which he outlined the rudiments of the second law of thermodynamics summarized by the view that mechanical motion and the energy used to create that motion will naturally tend to dissipate or run down.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir William (1852). [https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_a_universal_tendency.html "On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy"] ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'' for 19 April 1852, also ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', Oct. 1852. [This version from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. 59, pp. 511.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in this paper, in relation to their application to the age of the [[Sun]] and the dynamics of the universal operation, attracted the likes of William Rankine and Hermann von Helmholtz. The three of them were said to have exchanged ideas on this subject.&lt;ref name="Energy and Empire"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Thomson published "On the age of the Sun’s heat", an article in which he reiterated his fundamental beliefs in the indestructibility of energy (the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]) and the universal dissipation of energy (the second law), leading to diffusion of heat, cessation of useful motion ([[work (physics)|work]]), and exhaustion of [[potential energy]] through the material universe, while clarifying his view of the consequences for the universe as a whole. In a key paragraph, Thomson wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The result would inevitably be a state of universal rest and death, if the universe were finite and left to obey existing laws. But it is impossible to conceive a limit to the extent of matter in the universe; and therefore science points rather to an endless progress, through an endless space, of action involving the transformation of [[potential energy]] into [[Work (physics)|palpable motion]] and hence into [[heat]], than to a single finite mechanism, running down like a clock, and stopping for ever.&lt;ref&gt;

In the years to follow both Thomson's 1852 and the 1865 papers, Helmholtz and Rankine both credited Thomson with the idea, but read further into his papers by publishing views stating that Thomson argued that the universe will end in a "''heat death''" (Helmholtz) which will be the "''end of all physical phenomena''" (Rankine).&lt;ref name="Energy and Empire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Proposals about the final state of the universe depend on the assumptions made about its ultimate fate, and these assumptions have varied considerably over the late 20th century and early 21st century. In a hypothesized [[Shape of the universe|"open" or "flat" universe]] that continues expanding indefinitely, either a heat death or a [[Big Rip]] is expected to eventually occur.&lt;ref name="DftS" /&gt; If the [[cosmological constant]] is zero, the universe will approach absolute zero temperature over a very long timescale. However, if the cosmological constant is [[Cosmological constant#Positive value|positive]], as appears to be the case in recent observations, the temperature will asymptote to a non-zero positive value, and the universe will approach a state of maximum entropy.&lt;ref&gt;

If a Big Rip doesn't happen long before that, the "heat death" situation could be avoided if there is a method or mechanism to regenerate [[hydrogen]] atoms from [[radiation]], [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[zero-point energy]], or other sources so that [[star formation]] and [[heat transfer]] can continue to avoid a gradual running down of the universe due to the conversion of matter into energy and heavier elements in [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar processes]] and the absorption of matter by [[black hole]]s and their subsequent evaporation as [[Hawking radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Future of an expanding universe}}

From the [[Big Bang]] through the present day, [[matter]] and [[dark matter]] in the universe are thought to have been concentrated in [[star]]s, [[galaxies]], and [[galaxy cluster]]s, and are presumed to continue to be so well into the future. Therefore, the universe is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and objects can do physical work.&lt;ref name="A dying universe"&gt;

A recent analysis of entropy states, "The entropy of a general gravitational field is still not known", and, "gravitational entropy is difficult to quantify". The analysis considers several possible assumptions that would be needed for estimates and suggests that the [[observable universe]] has more entropy than previously thought. This is because the analysis concludes that supermassive black holes are the largest contributor.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram''' ('''IISER Thiruvananthapuram''' or '''IISER-TVM''') is one of seven IISERs, institutes established by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]].

The institute awards five-year integrated [[Master of Science]] degrees in [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]]. There are facilities for doing research in those areas leading to the award of PhD.

IISER-TVM is located at the foothills of the [[Ponmudi]] hills of the Western Ghats, about 50&amp;nbsp;km from Thiruvananthapuram.&lt;ref&gt;G Mahadevan, [http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/26/stories/2007102661670400.htm ''Centre hailed for sanctioning IISER''], ''[[The Hindu]]'' dated 26 October 2007 (Retrieved on 18 February 209)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008101653270700.htm&amp;date=2008/10/16/&amp;prd=th&amp; ''Land for IISER at Vithura''], ''[[The Hindu]]'' dated 16 October 2008 (Retrieved on 18 February)&lt;/ref&gt; There are six other [[IISER]]s in India, namely [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal|IISER Bhopal]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata|IISER Kolkata]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali|IISER Mohali]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune|IISER Pune]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati|IISER Tirupati]] and [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Berhampur|IISER Berhampur]].

== Background==
[[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs) were created in 2006 through a proclamation of Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, under the category of [[List of Institutes of National Importance|institutes of national importance]], to promote quality education and research in basic sciences. Soon after the announcement, two of these institutes at [[Pune]] and [[Kolkata]], respectively, were started in 2006. This was followed by an institute at [[Mohali]] (2007) and at [[Bhopal]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/IISER-starts-functioning-from-Vithura-campus/article14517924.ece|title=IISER starts functioning from Vithura campus|date=31 July 2016|accessdate=1 August 2018|website=Thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each IISER is a degree granting autonomous institution with a prime focus to integrate science education and research. IISERs are destined to become Science Institutes of the highest caliber and reach the prestigious position in the global setting that [[Indian Institute of Science|IISc]], [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIMs]], [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]] and [[National Institutes of Technology|NITs]]  presently enjoy.

== Administration ==
The institute is administered by a Board of Governors with [[Tessy Thomas]] as Chairperson, a 25-member Senate  and the Director, V. Ramakrishnan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/pages/board_of_governors.phpx|title=Board of Governors - IISER - TVM|website=Iisertvm.ac.in|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/pages/senate.phpx|title=Senate - IISER - TVM|website=Iisertvm.ac.in|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deans are M. P. Rajan (Academics), Ramesh Chandra Nath (Students Affairs), Hema Somanathan (Research and Development) and Anil Shaji (Planning and Development).&lt;ref name="iisertvm.ac.in"/&gt;

==Academic Programs==
* '''Integrated Master's (M.S.)''': [[University and college admissions|Admission]] to this program is through the following channels:
# [[Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana]] (KVPY) Basic Science Stream: Students qualifying in SA (2012)/SX (2013)/SB (2013).
# Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced): Students securing a place in the rank list of Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).
# State and Central Boards: Those, who are eligible for INSPIRE scholarship by [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST) on the basis of their aggregate scores in class XII may be considered for admission after clearing an aptitude test. Currently done in co-ordination with the other [[IISER]]s through a Joint Admission Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iiseradmission.in/|title=Joint IISER admission portal|last=|first=|date=|website=Iiseradmission.in|publisher=|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first two years of the 5-year program involves coursework in all subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Humanities and Interdisciplinary courses). For the next two years, the students choose courses across subjects, as per their liking. The final year is spent on a research project.&lt;ref&gt;G Mahadevan, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008090851000300.htm&amp;date=2008/09/08/&amp;prd=edu&amp; ''Emphasis on integrated research''], ''[[The Hindu]]'' dated 8 August 2008 (Retrieved on 18 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Doctoral Program''' ([[Ph.D.]]): Admission to the doctoral program is after a master's degree in [[science]]. Besides the students of the Integrated Master's program, [[postgraduate]] students with a master's degree in science from other Universities/Institutes will also be admitted to the doctoral program. The program will involve course work, a qualifying examination, a state-of-the-art seminar, [[thesis]] work, open seminar and a thesis [[Test (assessment)|examination]], leading to the award of a PhD degree. The quantum of course work will vary depending on the background of the student. Besides individual research, students will be involved in several [[professional]] activities such as seminars, workshops, presentations and review meetings. All doctoral students will assist faculty members in [[teaching]] during the course of the doctoral program.
* '''Integrated Doctoral Program''' (Int. Ph.D.): Admission to this program is after a B.Sc. degree in any of the [[basic science]]s. Students of this program start their course by attending their class with third year students of Dual Degree B.S.- M.S. course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iiseradmission.in/|title=IISER ADMISSION 2018|website=Iiseradmission.in|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RIAN archive 667778 May 18th - International Museum Day.jpg|thumb|People visiting the [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Fine Arts Museum]] on International Museum Day]]
'''International Museum Day''' (IMD) is an [[international observances|international day]] a celebration that held every year on or around [[18 May]], coordinated by the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM). The event highlights a specific theme that changes every year and that is at the heart of the international museum community’s preoccupations.

The IMD provides the opportunity for museum professionals to meet the public and alert them as to the challenges that museums face. Indeed, following the definition of museums provided by ICOM, a museum is ''a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment''.{{cn|date=August 2018}} International Museum Day therefore serves as a platform to raise public awareness on the role museums play in the development of society today, on an international level.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==
Each year, all museums in the world are invited to participate in IMD to promote the role of museums around in the world, creating unique, enjoyable and free activities around a theme discussed within the ICOM community for this special day. 
Since its creation in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/events/international-museum-day/|title=ICOM Website on IMD|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Museum Day has gained increasing attention. In 2009, International Museum Day attracted the participation of 20,000 museums hosting events in more than 90 countries. In 2010, 98 countries participated in the celebration, with 100 in 2011, and 30,000 museums in 129 countries in 2012.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In 2011, the official IMD poster was translated into 37 languages.

The '''International Research Center for Traditional Polyphony''' ('''IRCTP''' or '''Polyphonic Center''') is an academic organization focused on the study of the phenomenon of traditional [[vocal]] [[polyphony]]. It is a part of [[Tbilisi Vano Sarajishvili State Conservatory]]. Establishment of IRCTP was announced during the First International Symposium of Traditional Polyphony in 2002, and it was logistically established by the order of the Rector of [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in February 2003. Its director is Rusudan Tsurtsumia. The head of its International Bureau is [[Joseph Jordania]]. Central activity of the Polyphonic Center is organizing [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]], with subsequent publication of the presented papers, fostering dissemination of the knowledge on human musical cultures and establishing close professional contacts between ethnomusicologists interested in study of the phenomenon of traditional [[choral singing]].

==History ==
[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been known among ethnomusicologists as the country with extremely rich traditions of [[vocal]] [[polyphony]] since the 1920s. Study of vocal polyphony has been one of the central issues for Georgian ethnomusicology from the second half of the 19th century. In 1972 [[Union of Composers]] of [[Soviet Union]] organized the conference dedicated to traditional polyphony in Georgia (this was the very first conference in the world, fully dedicated to traditional polyphony). The ongoing series of [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|conferences]] dedicated to the problems of traditional polyphony, with the wide participation of the experts from Soviet Union, Europe and America, were organized in 1984, 1986 and 1988. The following conference (scheduled in 1990) was initially postponed and later canceled due to the political instability in post-soviet Georgia. The series of biannual conferences on traditional polyphony were revived in 1998 and 2000, leading to the organizing of the First International Symposium on Traditional Polyphony in 2002. The first symposium was preceded by proclamation of Georgian traditional polyphony among the '''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''' by [[UNESCO]] in 2001. Representative of '''UNESCO''' attended the Symposium, providing support of '''UNESCO'''. The Polyphonic Centre has been supported during the recent years by the Presidents of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and [[Mikhail Saakashvili]]. For several years the Polyphonic Centre was also supported by the Japanese government.
There has been a steady increase in interest towards the study of traditional [[polyphony]] ([[choral singing]]) during the recent years. In the 1970s there were two initial conferences organized on this subject, in the 1980s four conference, in the 1990s three conferences, and during the first decade of the 21st century nine conferences had been organized in several countries (apart from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in [[Taiwan]] in 2002, in Austria in 2005 and 2008, in [[Portugal]] in 2007). A centre for the study of European traditional polyphony was established at [[Vienna University]] in 2005, and the study group on multipart music of [[ICTM]] was established in 2009 and organized a conference in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2010. The earliest international organization to dedicate its activity entirely to study of traditional choral singing was '''Polifonies Vivante''', organized in France during the 1991-1994 by [[Simha Arom]].

==International symposia==
[[International]] [[Academic conference|symposia]] on the problems of traditional polyphony had been organized biannually from 2002. The last one was held on September 26 - October 1, 2016. All of them had been organized in late September - early October, at the Tbilisi State Conservatory. The geography of representation of scholars from different countries of the world had been steadily increasing. A group of international expert-ethnomusicologists, including [[Simha Arom]] from France, Dieter Christensen from the United States, Franz Fodermayr from Austria, Polo Vallejo from Spain, had been participating in virtually every symposia, together with ethnomusicologists from different countries (including experts from China, Japan, Australia, Canada, eastern and western [[Europe]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]]. The general program of the symposia is stable and contains twelve themes, covering wide range of research topics, including problems of [[vocal]] and [[instrumental]] polyphony, [[Folk music|folk]] and [[church music]], regional styles, elements of [[musical language]], [[social]] and [[gender]] aspects, history, links with [[popular music]]al styles. Participating scholars are traditionally provided by the hosts with hotel accommodation, internal transport and food during the Symposium. In 2010 for the first time a special theme was added (''vocal polyphony is Asia''). 2012 symposium (September 24–29) had the special theme ''comparative research in traditional polyphony'', 2014 Symposium main theme was ''Polyphony in Minority Music'' (September 22–26, 2014), and 2016 symposium was dedicated to the geographic dynamics of traditional polyphony (September 26 - October 1, 2016). Next symposium is planning to a later date: October 29 - November 3, 2018.

==Publications==
The most important publication of the IRCTP is the [[proceedings]] of the [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]]. They are usually prepared under the editorship of Rusudan Tsurtsumia and [[Joseph Jordania]]. All the papers of the previous symposia are freely available on the website of the IRCTP on both Georgian and English languages &lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.polyphony.ge/en/proceedings/ Papers presented at the Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulletins are another periodic publication of the IRCTP &lt;ref&gt;[http://polyphony.ge/en/category/publications-2/bulletin/ Bulletins of the Polyphonic Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Centre also published several collections of the articles, including '''Seventeen Arguments on Georgian Polyphony''' and numerous audio and video materials.

'''James Braidwood''' (1800–1861) was a Scottish [[firefighter]] who founded of the world's first municipal fire service in [[Edinburgh]] in 1824. He was the first director of the ''London Fire Engine Establishment'' (the [[fire brigade|brigade]] which was eventually to become the [[London Fire Brigade]]).&lt;ref name="LFB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/ |title=London Fire Brigade website |publisher=London Fire Brigade |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the development of the modern municipal fire service.&lt;ref name="GlosFire"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041128234033/http://www.glosfire.gov.uk/sections/schools/school_rc_modern.html The foundations of the modern fire service, Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] the tenth child of Janet Mitchell and Francis James Braidwood, a cabinetmaker. He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]]. He learned about the construction of buildings after joining his father's building firm as an apprentice, knowledge he was later to put to good use.
[[File:Edinburgh fire engine, 1824.JPG|thumb|220px|left|One of Edinburgh's first [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]] from 1824]]
Appointed Master of Fire Engines at the age of 24, two months prior to the [[Great Fire of Edinburgh (1824)|Great Fire of Edinburgh]], Braidwood established principles of fire-fighting that are still applied today. His training as a surveyor gave him exceptional knowledge of the behaviour of building materials and housing conditions in the Old Town of Edinburgh. He recruited to the service expert tradesmen – slaters, carpenters, masons and plumbers – who could apply their various fields of expertise to [[fire fighting]]. He also recruited experienced mariners for an occupation that required heavy manual work in hauling engines and trundling wheeled escape ladders up and down Edinburgh's steep streets, as well as nimble footwork when negotiating rooftops and moving through partially destroyed buildings. His many original ideas of practical organisation and methodology, published in 1830, were adopted throughout Britain. He was, however, resistant to the introduction of steam-driven engines. In 1833 he left Edinburgh to lead the London Fire Engine Establishment. The London Fire Engine Establishment had to fight a blaze at the [[Burning of Parliament|Palace of Westminster]], on 16 October 1834, that destroyed almost all of the Palace. 

Braidwood was distinguished for his heroism on the occasion of great fires in Edinburgh (1824) and London (1830). He also undertook a pastoral role, introducing visits to ordinary firemen and their families by the [[London City Mission]].

As a strange curiosity, Braidwood was the first witness at the trial of William Burke of [[Burke and Hare]] fame. He gave evidence on Christmas Eve of 1828, in his capacity as an Edinburgh builder, who had been commissioned by the authorities to draw scale plans of the notorious lodging house on Tanners Close where the murders took place. His evidence was simply to state that the plans were an accurate representation of the building.&lt;ref&gt;''The Infamous Burke and Hare: Serial Killers and Resurrectionists of 19th Century Edinburgh'', by R. Michael Gordon p. 103 {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4403-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death at Tooley Street Fire==

[[File:The Tooley Street fire by the end of the second day.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The Tooley Street fire by the end of the second day]]

On 22 June 1861 he died in the [[1861 Tooley Street fire|Tooley Street fire]] at [[Cotton's Wharf]] near [[London Bridge station]] when a falling wall crushed him, three hours after the fire began.&lt;ref name="tooley street fire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/TheTooleyStreetFire.asp |title=Tooley Street Fire |publisher=London Fire Brigade |accessdate=18 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117182240/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/TheTooleyStreetFire.asp |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took two days to recover his body and his heroism led to a massive funeral on 29 June where his funeral cortege stretched one and a half miles behind the hearse, a public spectacle equal almost to the Tooley Street fire itself.&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst925.html |title=Edinburgh University profile of James Braidwood |publisher=Scottish-places.info |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire, which continued to burn for a fortnight, caused £2,000,000 worth of damage. A London [[fireboat]] was named in his honour in the 1930s.

Braidwood is buried at [[Abney Park Cemetery]], [[Stoke Newington]], London, not far from the Stoke Newington Fire Station. The grave lies on a path edge towards the south, rendering it relatively easy to see in this congested and overgrown cemetery. His wife, Mary Ann Jane Braidwood (1806–1871) was buried with him.

The grave was long lost to public view and in 1981, following much research by the then Stoke Newington Fire Station White Watch Station Officer, Liam Hackett, the precise location of the grave was found. Hackett then spent the rest of the Summer clearing the site and restoring the lettering on the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Wood Paul.

==National memorial==
[[File:The grave of James Braidwood, Abney Park Cemetery, London.jpg|thumb|Headstone of James Braidwood at Abney Park Cemetery in 2015]]
The death of James Braidwood, whilst engaged in fire fighting duties, is recorded on the [[National Firefighters Memorial]] which is located adjacent to [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in the City of London.

==Remembered, 2004==
A group of former London Firefighters decided to form a new Masonic Lodge. They chose to remember the life and death of this famous fireman by naming the Lodge after him. Consecrated in 2005 this is now known as the Braidwood Lodge Number 9802 in the Province of West Kent.

Recognising the lack of publications on fire engines in the English language, Braidwood published what is regarded as one of the first text books on the science of [[Fire protection engineering|fire engineering]] in 1830: ''On the Construction of Fire Engines and Apparatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxYbmpY3cJsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On the Construction of Fire Engines and Apparatus by James Braidwood, 2nd edition, 2004. Preface by Brian Allaway |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many historical (Public domain) books often are re-published, Braidwood's book was officially re-published as a second edition in 2004. Braidwood also authored ''Fire prevention and fire extinction'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AI8BAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fire prevention and fire extinction |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; published posthumously in 1866.

==New memorial, 2008==
On 5 September 2008, the James Braidwood memorial statue in [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh]] was unveiled by Professor [[Timothy O'Shea|Sir Timothy O'Shea]], Principal of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="father of firefighting"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/No-bells-and-no-whistles.4328264.jp |title='No bells and no whistles for 'father of firefighting' |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fund had been established for a £75,000 memorial to Braidwood, to be created by the Glasgow sculptor, Kenneth Mackay, led by Dr Frank Rushbrook CBE, 93-year-old former Firemaster at [[Lothian &amp; Borders Fire Brigade]]. The statue stands around the corner from the site of the original main fire station in the High Street. The bronze plaque below it reads:

{{cquote|''James Braidwood&lt;br /&gt;
''1800 – 1861&lt;br /&gt;
''Father of the British Fire Service &lt;br /&gt;
''This statue is dedicated to the memory of James Braidwood, a pioneer of the scientific approach to fire-fighting. It also recognises the courage and sacrifice of fire-fighters, not only in Lothian &amp; Borders Fire and Rescue Service, but all over the world.}}

Dr Rushbrook was also the benefactor of the Fire Laboratory that lies at the heart of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130329001154/http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/fire/ BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering], in the  School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. His gift was motivated by a desire to promote education in applied fire science, and is routinely used for experimental classes on the undergraduate and taught postgraduate fire programmes at the University, together with PhD/post-doctoral research and also on occasion by fire service personnel. The laboratory was officially opened in 2003, and has since been expanded to two floors.

She spent much of her adult life in [[Great Falls, Montana]], but traveled throughout France and the United States.

== Personal life ==
Josephine Hale was born in 1878 as Josephine Adeline Bruneau. The Bruneau family had eleven children, of which Hale was the youngest. Most of her siblings were born in Quebec however her family moved to the United States before Hale was born and settled near Sioux Point, South Dakota.  In 1896 Hale graduated from a high school in Sioux City, Iowa. Two years later, at the age of twenty, Hale moved to Great Falls, MT where three of her siblings already lived. She began teaching in Eden, ten miles away from Great Falls, after passing her teacher certification test. The Montana Museum of Art and Culture states that it is likely she taught at "Canyon Schoolhouse, in the Eden area."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990066233|title=Intimate west : women artists in Montana : 1880-1944.|last=|first=|publisher=University of Montana Press and the Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|others=Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture., University of Montana Press (Missoula, Mont.),, University of Montana Printing &amp; Graphic Services|year=|isbn=9780998343846|location=Missoula, Montana|pages=49–50|oclc=990066233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Great Falls, Josephine Hale met her husband, wealthy rancher Walter George Hale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006511690|title=Over there! : Montanans in the great war.|last=Chacón|first=H.

Walter Hale contracted and then died of tuberculosis. After her husband's death, Hale retained ownership of the ranch she had owned with him, and rented it to tenants as a source of income beginning in 1907. In 1910 Hale purchased a three-house lot in Great Falls which she used to board family members. She also created studio space in one of the attics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1917 Hale joined the Red Cross as a nurse to serve during WWI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While living in France, Hale met George Hepburn Robertson and fell in love. George Hepburn Robertson served as the Director of Transportation for the American Red Cross, which is likely where they met. Although Hale never married Robertson it is likely that part of her reason for returning to France later in life was to continue the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She remained in France until 1926 when she returned to the US and began attending school for interior decoration. Hale returned to France less than a year later to continue her art education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1935 Hale moved back to Great Falls, MT where she lived during the Great Depression and WWII. During the ten years after her return from Europe she created a prolific amount of art work, she also continued nursing, a skill she had picked up in the Red Cross, for the rest of her life, including volunteering during WWII at Columbus Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hale died in 1961 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Red Cross ==
World War I began in 1914, and in 1917 Josephine Hale enlisted in the Red Cross. At the time the Red Cross had an age limit on enlistment, and the forty year old Hale lied about her age, stating she was thirty-five, in order to enlist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her ability to speak French was viewed as an asset and she paid for her own passage to Europe in order to ensure her acceptance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hale traveled from New York to London aboard a transport vessel named the Corinthia. For protection her ship was accompanied by a cruiser, U-boat destroyers, airplanes and hydroplanes. After she arrived in London, Hale took a train to Paris.

Hale's first assignment in France was in Paris at the Gara de l'Est canteen where she took medical classes and improved her language skills. After her training in Paris, Hale worked in canteens near the front, at Bordeaux. She would later open her own canteen in Marseilles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hale wrote in her diary about her experiences working with soldiers:&lt;blockquote&gt;"because of my knowledge of French I am assigned on the French and Belgian side. They are so different from our boys and so very polite but they are accustomed to being waited on so it is a bit harder on the waiter. They seem very much pleased to have an American to talk and joke with them and how they love to air every bit of English that they know. The Americans are all about the same age, but the others range from 55 to 18 -- grey haired men and fresh faced boys and everyone ready to smile back at you every chance they get. It seems they take this war as their work and it is here to do."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hale also recorded her experiences through at the front photography including images of damage caused by bombs at Fort de la Pompelle, a cathedral in ruins and the destruction of a forest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]], Hale extended her visa in order to continue working in devastated areas. In October 1920 she received her nursing degree from the Societe Francaise de Secours in Paris and in 1924 she was awarded the ''[[Medal of French Gratitude|Médaille de la Reconnaissance française]]'' by the French government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Art ==
In early 1926 Hale moved to Boston and began attending courses at the New York School of Interior of Decoration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her professors recommended that she pursue painting as a degree program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By October 14, 1926 Hale returned to Paris in order to continue studying interior design but the next year she began attending the [[Académie Delécluse]], where she began her full-time study of painting and drawing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the academy she studied under Auguste Delécluse, Eugene Delécluse, De Courmon and Jean-Paul Laurens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, she would describe her time studying art in France as "the happiest years of my life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following nine years improving her skills, Hale received accolades in the Salon of 1934 and was invited to galleries and arts organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hale produced paintings with a wide variety of subjects including still lifes, florals, landscapes, portraits and nudes. Stylistically she was influenced by her experience with interior design in her use of fabric and floral patterns, French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Fauves use of animated lines in landscapes, and the European tradition of plein air painting. She also consistently referenced the book ''The Art Spirit'' by Robert Henri in her sketchbooks. Hale built her body of work by travelling extensively including visits to French Brittany, Monaco, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Morocco, the Sonoran Desert and Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1995 Vivian Ellis and Fran Walton gifted the Josephine Hale art collection to the [[Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|Montana Museum of Art and Culture]], which is the primary repository of her work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; MMAC exhibit "Intimate West: Women Artists in Montana 1880-1944." The goal of the exhibit was to show a different interpretation of the American West than the traditional representations by artists like C.M. Russel and Edgar S. Paxson. Hale's works in the exhibit include studies and images of Glacier National Park that are described as "long, thoughtful studies of the natural world" by MMAC curator Jeremy Camwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/intimate-west-surveys-pioneering-female-artists-take-on-region/article_64ef0242-3f12-591c-aeef-6317a10fe247.html|title='Intimate West' surveys pioneering female artists' take on region|last=Walsh|first=Cory|date=January 20, 2017|work=missoulian.com|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale was also the subject of an exhibit, "The Life and Art of Josephine Hale, 1878-1961," at the Hockaday Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockadaymuseum.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;page=327|title=The Life and Art of Josephine Hale Exhibition at the Hockaday Museum of Art|website=www.hockadaymuseum.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6283">'''Knowledge of results''' is a term in the [[psychology of learning]].&lt;ref name=John/&gt;&lt;ref name=Art&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1963. Instruments and media of instruction. In N.L. Gage (ed) ''Handbook of research on teaching''. Chicago: AERA and Rand McNally, 583–682.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p619&lt;/sup&gt; A psychology dictionary defines it as [[feedback]] of information:
:"(a) to a subject about the correctness of [their] responses; (b) a student about success or failure in mastering material, or (c) a client in psychotherapy about progress".&lt;ref&gt;Reber A.S. &amp; E.S. 2001. ''The Penguin dictionary of psychology''. London: Penguin, p381. {{ISBN|0-140-51451-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It describes the situation where a subject gets information which helps them to change [[behaviour]] in a desirable way, or to gain understanding.

There are a number of similar terms in psychology:
*'''KCR''': this means "knowledge of ''correct'' results". This [[Logical consequence|implies]] that there is always a specific correct result.
*[[Operant conditioning]] and [[reinforcement]]: this implies a [[behaviourist]] approach using [[schedules of reinforcement]] to "shape behaviour".
*Feedback: this is a more general term, often used for the way [[systems]] adjust to preset limits. It is often used in general conversation, with various meanings. [[Corrective feedback]] is a version sometimes used in school education.

Knowledge of results,&lt;ref name=John&gt;Annett J. 1964. The role of knowledge of results in learning: a survey. In ''Educational Technology'', De Cecco (ed), Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes ''immediate'' knowledge of results,&lt;ref&gt;Rowntree, Derek 1966. ''Basically branching: a handbook for programmers''. London: Macdonald, p41.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used for any learning where a student (or an animal) gets information after the action. The information is about how satisfactory the action is.

== Experimental evidence ==
An early experiment on knowledge of results was the machine invented by [[Sidney Pressey]], where a device both tested and taught [[multiple-choice]] questions.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1926. A simple apparatus which gives tests and scores – and teaches. ''School and Society'', '''23''' (586), 373–376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A &amp; Glaser R. (eds) 1960. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning I: a source book''. Washington D.C. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This method tells the user (by [[inference]]) only whether the choice was correct or not. The material was multiple choice items, and the method used as an addition to collecting classroom test scores.

Later work in training research and education used the term "knowledge of results" frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1962. Experimental research on instructional devices and materials. In Glaser R. (ed) ''Training research and education'', Columbia University Press, and 1965: Science Editions, Wiley, p260{{ndash}}263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smode A.F. 1962. Recent development in training problems, and training and training research methodology. In Glaser R. (ed) ''Training research and education'', New York: Columbia University Press, and 1965: Science Editions, Wiley, p471{{ndash}}477 and 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important question was whether scores would be improved more if direct teaching was given either before or after the question was asked. The answer in both cases was (broadly) yes. Using instructional films, Michael and Maccoby split groups into two halves. Half the students were given material which required active, explicit responses. After a pause, they were told the correct answer. The other half was not given feedback. Instructional time was identical. The result showed a "slight but significant gain" for the active-response procedure without feedback, but more gain when feedback was provided. The experimenters later described this as "KCR" rather than "feedback".&lt;ref&gt;Michael D.N. &amp; Maccoby N. 1953. Factors influencing verbal learning from films under varying methods of audience participation. ''J. Experimental Psychology'' '''46''', 411–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D.N. &amp; Maccoby N. 1961. Factors influencing the effects of audience participation on verbal learning from films: motivating versus practice effects. In Lumsdaine A.A. (ed) ''Student response in programmed instruction: a symposium''. Washington D.C. National Academy of Sciences–National Research Council, publication #943.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the active response itself is summarised in &lt;ref name=Art/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p614&lt;/sup&gt;. Later discussion of experiments like these suggested that the results might be due to practice rather than feedback. Undoubtedly, the set-up had given extra practice on the questions as well as knowledge of results, and the experiments often [[confounding|confounded]] the two factors.

Another issue is that knowledge of results may give information to the instructor as to ways the material can be improved. Using a teaching program on [[decimal arithmetic]], an experienced teacher can put student mistakes into types. For example, one group of mistakes are due to the learners not understanding the rules about placement of the point in decimal [[multiplication]]. This shows where and how the learning material needs to be revised.

== Conscious thought not always essential ==
[[Conscious]] thought is not always necessary for knowledge of results to have its effect. Research on [[wikt:implicit|implicit]] learning shows that complex information can be got by humans without their awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Reber A.S. 1993. ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge: an essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford University Press, p10. {{ISBN|0-19-510658-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also shown by experiments on animal learning which show the effects of knowledge of results on later behaviour. It seems likely that unconscious learning by results evolved first in early [[metazoa]], and conscious thought very much later. This is what Reber calls the "primacy of the implicit", meaning [[implicit learning]] came first in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Reber A.S. 1993. ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge: an essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford University Press, Chapter 3: Evolutionary considerations: the primacy of the implicit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manchester Institute of Biotechnology''', formerly the '''Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre''' ('''MIB''') is a [[research institute]] of the [[University of Manchester]], England.  The centre has been designed to enable academic communities to explore specific areas of interdisciplinary quantitative [[biology|bioscience]], largely through the efforts of multidisciplinary research teams. Research at MIB follows three broadly defined, interdisciplinary and complementary themes: Biological Mechanism and Catalysis, Molecular Bioengineering, [[Systems biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Planning for the institute began late in 1998 and culminated with the official opening on 25 October 2006 of the [[John Garside]] Building. The building won "Building of the Year" from Manchester Chamber's Building and Development Committee in 2006 along with [[Beetham Tower, Manchester]].

The building has featured in several television commercials, notably Injury Lawyers 4u.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename=ta1784 "Injury Lawyers 4 U - We Fight Hard"], Tellyads, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was  renamed the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology on 1 June 2012, retaining the acronym MIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mib.ac.uk/aboutus/structure/index2.html|title=Message from the Director|first=Nigel|last=Scrutton|accessdate=19 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421051812/http://www.mib.ac.uk/aboutus/structure/index2.html|archivedate=21 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">'''Megullia''', surnamed '''Dotata''' ('richly dowered'), was an ancient Roman noblewoman.

==Life==
Megullia is one of the one hundred and six subjects of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]’s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' (''De mulieribus claris'', 1362).&lt;ref name=GB&gt;[[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio, Giovanni]], ''Famous Women'', translated by Virginia Brown (Cambridge and London, [[Harvard University Press]], 2001) pp. 109-110 ({{ISBN|0-674-01130-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; She is famous (as Boccaccio says) "more through the lavishness of her ancestors than through the worthiness of any of her own deeds. For at that time it seemed such a marvellous thing to give 50,000 bronze coins as dowry to one's husband..."&lt;ref name=guarino&gt;Boccaccio, Giovanni, ''Concerning Famous Women'', translated by Guido A. Guarino (New Brunswick, [[Rutgers University Press]], 1963) pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  Boccaccio used manuscripts of [[Valerius Maximus]] as his source, but they "disagree widely about the amount of money in Megullia's dowry".&lt;ref name=guarino/&gt; Valerius says in his Book 4 (4.10)&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html Valerius Maximus — Liber IV]&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] wrote to the Senate from Spain asking to be replaced. He wanted to go home to build up a dowry for his daughter that just became of marrying age.&lt;ref&gt;Memorable Deeds and Sayings: One Thousand Tales from Ancient Rome By Valerius Maximus translated by Henry J. Walker, P. 141, {{ISBN|0-87220-674-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate wanted Scipio to stay in command, so they consulted with the bride to be and Scipio's family and agreed on an amount that would be acceptable for a dowry of a daughter of a person of such high rank. They raised a dowry for Scipio's daughter from the treasury of 40,000 [[As (coin)|asses]]. [[Valerius Maximus|Valerius]] compares this sum of a family fortune to those raised for "Tuccia, daughter of [[Caeso Quinctius]]" (10,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]]'') and for Megullia, daughter of a consul (50,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]]'') - from which the name "Dotata" (dowried) came when she entered her husband's house with this large amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5imDC6VN-FcC&amp;pg=PA141 translation of Valerius Maximus' Liber IV]&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to make then the name of the woman with such a large dowry that of '''''Megullia Dotata'''''. Besides Scipio and Fabricius, the Senate raised dowries for the daughters of others they wished to keep in service if there were no family funds for a dowry, like in the case of [[Fabricius Luscinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livy]], ''History of Rome'', Vol. 3 [10 AD], Book XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dotata==
At the beginning of the Roman republic [[dowry|dowries]] were small.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638349 Roman Dowry and the Devolution of Property in the Principate]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the dowry given by the senate to the daughter of [[Scipio Africanus]] was only 35 pounds or 11,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]] of brass.''&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Alexander; ''Roman antiquities: or An account of the manners and customs of the Romans'', p. 329; 1842 New York; New York public library 480576A&lt;/ref&gt; If the dowry was about five times this amount, 160 - 175 pounds (50,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]] of brass''), then it was considered a Great Fortune and ''Megullia'' was nicknamed ''Dotata''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, ''op. cit.'', p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''dotata'' was synonymous with "dowry girl" and was the name given to the bride that had a [[dowry]]. This trend continued for a long time and if anything above a normal amount was given then the female giver was called a ''Megullia Dotata''.&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

{{About|microprocessors|central processing units|CPU|text= (A Microprocessor is a type of CPU)}}
A '''microprocessor''' is a [[processor (computing)|computer processor]]  that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single [[integrated circuit]] (IC),&lt;ref name="Osborne80"&gt;{{cite book | first=Adam | last=Osborne | title=An Introduction to Microcomputers | volume=Volume 1: Basic Concepts | edition=2nd | publisher=Osborne-McGraw Hill | location=Berkeley, California | year=1980 | isbn=0-931988-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at most a few integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Krishna Kant ''Microprocessors And Microcontrollers: Architecture Programming And System Design'', PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd., 2007 {{ISBN|81-203-3191-5}}, page 61, describing the iAPX 432.&lt;/ref&gt; The microprocessor is a multipurpose, [[Clock signal|clock]] driven, [[Processor register|register]] based, digital [[integrated circuit]] that accepts [[binary code|binary]] data as input, processes it according to [[instruction (computing)|instruction]]s stored in its [[memory (computing)|memory]], and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both [[combinational logic]] and [[sequential logic|sequential digital logic]]. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the [[binary number system]].

The integration of a whole CPU onto a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] or on a few chips greatly reduced the cost of processing power, increasing [[efficiency (computing)|efficiency]]. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by [[semiconductor device fabrication|highly automated processes]], resulting in a low [[unit price|per-unit cost]]. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are many fewer electrical connections that could fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to [[Rock's law]].

Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of [[circuit board]]s with many [[medium-scale integration|medium-]] and [[small-scale integration|small-scale integrated circuits]]. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few [[large-scale integration|large-scale]] ICs. Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see [[history of computing hardware]]), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest [[embedded system]]s and [[handheld device]]s to the largest [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[supercomputer]]s.

==Structure==
[[File:Z80 arch.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|A block diagram of the  architecture of the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] microprocessor, showing the arithmetic and logic section, register file, control logic section, and buffers to external address and data lines]]

The internal arrangement of a '''microprocessor''' varies depending on the age of the design and the intended purposes of the microprocessor. The complexity of an integrated circuit (IC) is bounded by physical limitations on the number of [[transistors]] that can be put onto one chip, the number of package terminations that can connect the processor to other parts of the system, the number of interconnections it is possible to make on the chip, and the heat that the chip can dissipate. Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture.

A minimal hypothetical microprocessor might include only an [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic logic unit (ALU)]] and a control logic section. The ALU performs operations such as addition, subtraction, and operations such as AND or OR. Each operation of the ALU sets one or more flags in a status register, which indicate the results of the last operation (zero value, negative number, overflow, or others). The control logic retrieves instruction codes from memory and initiates the sequence of operations required for the ALU to carry out the instruction. A single [[operation code]] might affect many individual data paths, registers, and other elements of the processor.

As integrated circuit technology advanced, it was feasible to manufacture more and more complex processors on a single chip. The size of data objects became larger; allowing more transistors on a chip allowed word sizes to increase from [[4-bit|4-]] and [[8-bit]] words up to today's [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] words. Additional features were added to the processor architecture; more on-chip registers sped up programs, and complex instructions could be used to make more compact programs. Floating-point arithmetic, for example, was often not available on 8-bit microprocessors, but had to be carried out in software. Integration of the [[floating point unit]] first as a separate integrated circuit and then as part of the same microprocessor chip sped up floating point calculations.

Occasionally, physical limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a [[Bit slicing|bit slice]] approach necessary. Instead of processing all of a long word on one integrated circuit, multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each data word. While this required extra logic to handle, for example, carry and overflow within each slice, the result was a system that could handle, for example, [[32-bit]] words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four&amp;nbsp;bits each.

The ability to put large numbers of transistors on one chip makes it feasible to integrate memory on the same die as the processor. This [[CPU cache]] has the advantage of faster access than off-chip memory and increases the processing speed of the system for many applications. Processor clock frequency has increased more rapidly than external memory speed, except in the recent past,{{When|date=September 2016}} so cache memory is necessary if the processor is not delayed by slower external memory.

===Special-purpose designs===
A microprocessor is a general-purpose entity. Several specialized processing devices have followed from the technology:

* A [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) is specialized for signal processing.
* [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) are processors designed primarily for realtime rendering of 3D images. They may be fixed function (as was more common in the 1990s), or support programmable [[shader]]s. With the continuing rise of [[GPGPU]], GPUs are evolving into increasingly general-purpose [[stream processing|stream processor]]s (running [[compute kernel|compute shader]]s), while retaining hardware assist for rasterizing, but still differ from CPUs in that they are optimized for throughput over latency, and are not suitable for running application or OS code.
* Other specialized units exist for [[video processing]] and [[vision processing unit|machine vision]]. (See: [[Hardware acceleration]].)
* [[Microcontroller]]s integrate a microprocessor with peripheral devices in embedded systems. These tend to have different tradeoffs compared to CPUs.
*[[System on a chip|Systems on chip]] (SoCs) often integrate one or more microprocessor or microcontroller cores.

32-bit processors have more digital logic than narrower processors, so 32-bit (and wider) processors produce more digital noise and have higher static consumption than narrower processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Kristian |last1=Saether |first2=Ingar |last2=Fredriksen |url=http://www.atmel.com/images/doc7926.pdf |title=Atmel Corporation Introducing a New Breed of Microcontrollers for 8/16-bit Applications |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923190029/http://www.atmel.com/images/doc7926.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing digital noise improves [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]] conversion results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/application_note/CD00004444.pdf "AN1636: Understanding and minimising ADC conversion errors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807063742/http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/application_note/CD00004444.pdf |date=2015-08-07 }}.

&lt;/ref&gt; So, 8- or [[16-bit]] processors can be better than 32-bit processors for [[system on a chip]] and microcontrollers that require extremely [[low-power electronics]], or are part of a [[mixed-signal integrated circuit]] with noise-sensitive on-chip analog electronics such as high-resolution analog to digital converters, or both.

Nevertheless, trade-offs apply: running 32-bit arithmetic on an 8-bit chip could end up using more power, as the chip must execute software with multiple instructions. Modern microprocessors go into low power states when possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing the Impact of Increasing Microprocessor Power Consumption|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~mobile/elec518/readings/Intel/gunther01power.pdf|work=[[Rice University]]|accessdate=October 1, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003085353/http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~mobile/elec518/readings/Intel/gunther01power.pdf|archivedate=October 3, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 8-bit chip running 32-bit calculations would be active for more cycles. This creates a delicate balance between software, hardware and use patterns, and costs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

When manufactured in a similar process, 8-bit microprocessors use less power when operating and less power when sleeping than 32-bit microprocessors.&lt;ref name="cmicrotek"&gt;CMicrotek.

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 32-bit microprocessor may use less average power than an 8-bit microprocessor when the application requires certain operations such as floating-point math
that take many more clock cycles on an 8-bit microprocessor than on a 32-bit microprocessor, so the 8-bit microprocessor spends more time in high-power operating mode.&lt;ref name="cmicrotek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard York.

==Embedded applications==
Thousands of items that were traditionally not computer-related include microprocessors. These include large and small household [[home appliance|appliance]]s, cars (and their accessory equipment units), car keys, tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and [[Arc-fault circuit interrupter|electrical circuit breakers]], smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from [[DVD player]]s to [[Phonograph#Turntable technology|phonograph turntables]]). Such products as cellular telephones, [[DVD video]] system and [[HDTV]] broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems to allow optimal control of emissions over the widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require complex, bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.

A microprocessor control program ([[embedded software]]) can be easily tailored to different needs of a product line, allowing upgrades in performance with minimal redesign of the product. Different features can be implemented in different models of a product line at negligible production cost.

Microprocessor control of a system can provide control strategies that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose-built electronic controls. For example, an engine control system in an automobile can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed, load on the engine, ambient temperature, and any observed tendency for knocking—allowing an automobile to operate on a range of fuel grades.

==History==
The advent of low-cost computers on [[integrated circuits]] has transformed [[modern society]]. General-purpose microprocessors in [[personal computer]]s are used for computation, text editing, [[multimedia|multimedia display]], and communication over the [[Internet]]. Many more microprocessors are part of [[embedded system]]s, providing digital control over myriad objects from appliances to automobiles to [[cellular phone]]s and industrial [[process control]].

The first use of the term "microprocessor" is attributed to [[Viatron Computer Systems]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/viatron/ViatronSystem21Brochure.pdf Viatron Computer Systems. "System 21 is Now!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321143159/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/viatron/ViatronSystem21Brochure.pdf |date=2011-03-21 }} (PDF). &lt;/ref&gt; describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System 21 small computer system announced in 1968.

By the late 1960s, designers were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of MOS LSI chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chipsets. Building on an earlier [[Busicom]] design from 1969, Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor, the [[4-bit]] [[Intel 4004]], in 1971, followed by its 8-bit microprocessor 8008 in 1972. In 1969, Lee Boysel, based on b[[8-bit]] arithmetic logic units (3800/3804) he designed earlier at Fairchild, created the Four-Phase Systems Inc. AL-1, an 8-bit CPU slice that was expandable to 32-bits. In 1970, Steve Geller and Ray Holt of Garrett AiResearch designed the MP944 chipset to implement the F-14A Central Air Data Computer on six metal-gate chips fabricated by AMI.

During the 1960s, computer processors were constructed out of small- and medium-scale ICs, each containing from tens of [[transistors]] to a few hundred. These were placed and soldered onto [[printed circuit boards]], and often multiple boards were interconnected in a chassis. A large number of discrete [[logic gate]]s uses more electrical power—-and therefore produces more heat—-than a more integrated design with fewer ICs. The distance that signals have to travel between ICs on the boards limits a computer's [[clock rate]].

In the [[NASA]] Apollo space missions to the [[moon]] in the 1960s and 1970s, all onboard computations for primary guidance, navigation, and control were provided by a small custom processor called "The [[Apollo Guidance Computer]]". It used circuit boards whose only [[logic gate|logic element]]s were three-input [[NOR gate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/80k85_verification/index.htm Back to the Moon: The Verification of a Small Microprocessor's Logic Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011061919/http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/80k85_verification/index.htm |date=2011-10-11 }} - [[NASA]] Office of Logic Design&lt;/ref&gt;

The first microprocessors emerged in the early 1970s and were used for electronic [[calculator]]s, using [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) arithmetic on 4-bit [[word (data type)|words]].&lt;!-- Really? These were mostly dedicated calculator chips, not general-purpose microprocessors. --&gt; Other [[embedded system|embedded]] uses of 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors, such as [[computer terminal|terminal]]s, [[computer printer|printer]]s, various kinds of [[automation]] etc., followed soon after. Affordable 8-bit microprocessors with [[16-bit]] addressing also led to the first general-purpose [[microcomputer]]s from the mid-1970s on.

Since the early 1970s, the increase in capacity of microprocessors has followed [[Moore's law]]; this originally suggested that the number of components that can be fitted onto a chip doubles every year. With present technology, it is actually every two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore |first=Gordon |title=Cramming more components onto integrated circuits |journal=Electronics |volume=38 |issue=8 |date=19 April 1965 |url=ftp://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218224945/http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result Moore later changed the period to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excerpts from A Conversation with Gordon Moore: Moore's Law |publisher=Intel |year=2005 |url=ftp://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Video-Transcripts/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029060050/http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Video-Transcripts/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First projects===
Three projects delivered a microprocessor at about the same time:  [[Garrett AiResearch]]'s [[Central Air Data Computer]] (CADC), [[Texas Instruments]]' TMS 1000 (September 1971) and [[Intel]]'s [[Intel 4004|4004]] (November 1971, based on an earlier 1969 [[Busicom]] design). Arguably, [[Four-Phase Systems AL1]] microprocessor was also delivered in 1969.

====CADC====
{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2010}}
{{Details|Central Air Data Computer}}

In 1968, [[Garrett AiResearch]] (who employed designers [[Ray Holt]] and Steve Geller) was invited to produce a digital computer to compete with [[electromechanical]] systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the [[US Navy]]'s new [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighter. The design was complete by 1970, and used a [[MOSFET|MOS]]-based chipset as the core CPU. The design was significantly (approximately 20 times) smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against, and was used in all of the early Tomcat models. This system contained "a 20-bit, [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]], [[Parallel computing|parallel]] [[multiprocessor|multi-microprocessor]]". The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until 1997. For this reason the [[Central Air Data Computer|CADC]], and the [[MP944]] chipset it used, are fairly unknown.Ray Holt's autobiographical story of this design and development is presented in the book: The Accidental Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6MPzCi9Cz?url=http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com/ |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World’s First Microprocessor Chip Set | last=Holt | first=Ray M. | url=http://www.firstmicroprocessor.com | 5= | publisher=Ray M.

[[Ray Holt]] graduated from [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] in 1968, and began his computer design career with the CADC. From its inception, it was shrouded in secrecy until 1998 when at Holt's request, the US Navy allowed the documents into the public domain. Since then people{{Who|date=July 2010}} have debated whether this was the first microprocessor. Holt has stated that no one has compared this microprocessor with those that came later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title=Lecture: Microprocessor Design and Development for the US Navy F14 FighterJet | last=Holt | first=Ray | date=27 September 2001 | location=Room 8220, Wean Hall, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US | url=http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/SDI/2001/092701.html | accessdate=2010-07-25 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001020654/http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/SDI/2001/092701.html | archivedate=1 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Parab et al. (2007), {{Quote|text=The scientific papers and literature published around 1971 reveal that the MP944 digital processor used for the F-14 Tomcat aircraft of the US Navy qualifies as the first microprocessor. Although interesting, it was not a single-chip processor, as was not the Intel 4004{{snd}}they both were more like a set of parallel building blocks you could use to make a general-purpose form. It contains a CPU, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]], and two other support chips like the Intel 4004.

This chip could also arguably lay claim to be one of the first microprocessors or microcontrollers having [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and a [[RISC]] instruction set on-chip. The layout for the four layers of the [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] process was hand drawn at x500 scale on mylar film, a significant task at the time given the complexity of the chip.

Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. They had significant previous design experience on multiple calculator chipsets with both GI and [[Elliott Automation|Marconi-Elliott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ANITA at its Zenith | publisher= | work=Bell Punch Company and the ANITA calculators | first=Nigel | last=Tout | url=http://anita-calculators.info/html/anita_at_its_zenith.html | accessdate=2010-07-25 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811034328/http://anita-calculators.info/html/anita_at_its_zenith.html | archivedate=2010-08-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key team members had originally been tasked by [[Elliott Automation]] to create an 8-bit computer in MOS and had helped establish a MOS Research Laboratory in [[Glenrothes]], Scotland in 1967.

Calculators were becoming the largest single market for semiconductors so Pico and GI went on to have significant success in this burgeoning market. GI continued to innovate in microprocessors and microcontrollers with products including the CP1600, IOB1680 and PIC1650.&lt;ref&gt;16 Bit Microprocessor Handbook by Gerry Kane, Adam Osborne {{ISBN|0-07-931043-5}} (0-07-931043-5)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the GI Microelectronics business was spun out into the [[Microchip Technology|Microchip]] [[PIC microcontroller]] business.

The [[Smithsonian Institution]] says [[Texas Instruments|TI]] engineers Gary Boone and Michael Cochran succeeded in creating the first microcontroller (also called a microcomputer) and the first single-chip CPU in 1971. The result of their work was the TMS 1000, which went on the market in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Widely Used Computer on a Chip: The TMS 1000|work=State of the Art: A Photographic History of the Integrated Circuit|last=Augarten|first=Stan|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|location=New Haven and New York|year=1983|isbn=0-89919-195-9|url=http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/augarten/p38.htm|accessdate=2009-12-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217065617/http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/augarten/p38.htm|archivedate=2010-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
TI stressed the 4-bit TMS 1000 for use in pre-programmed embedded applications, introducing a version called the TMS1802NC on September 17, 1971 that implemented a calculator on a chip.

TI filed for a patent on the microprocessor. Gary Boone was awarded {{US patent|3757306}} for the single-chip microprocessor architecture on September 4, 1973. In 1971, and again in 1976, Intel and TI entered into broad patent cross-licensing agreements, with Intel paying royalties to TI for the microprocessor patent. A history of these events is contained in court documentation from a legal dispute between Cyrix and Intel, with TI as inventor and owner of the microprocessor patent.

A computer-on-a-chip combines the microprocessor core (CPU), memory, and I/O ([[input/output]]) lines onto one [[integrated circuit|chip]]. The computer-on-a-chip patent, called the "microcomputer patent" at the time, {{US patent|4074351}}, was awarded to Gary Boone and Michael J. Cochran of TI. Aside from this patent, the standard meaning of [[microcomputer]] is a computer using one or more microprocessors as its CPU(s), while the concept defined in the patent is more akin to a microcontroller.

The microprocessor was designed by a team consisting of Italian engineer [[Federico Faggin]], American engineers [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Stanley Mazor]], and Japanese engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The History of the 4004 | last1=Faggin | first1=Federico | last2=Hoff | first2=Marcian E., Jr. | last3=Mazor | first3=Stanley | last4=Shima | first4=Masatoshi | journal=IEEE Micro | date=December 1996 | volume=16 | issue=6 | pages=10–20 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=546561 | doi=10.1109/40.546561 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216205658/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=546561 | archivedate=2013-02-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project that produced the 4004 originated in 1969, when [[Busicom]], a Japanese calculator manufacturer, asked Intel to build a chipset for high-performance [[desktop calculator]]s. Busicom's original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips. Three of the chips were to make a special-purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read-write memory. [[Ted Hoff]], the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project, believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data, rather than shift register memory, and a more traditional general-purpose CPU architecture. Hoff came up with a four-chip architectural proposal: a ROM chip for storing the programs, a dynamic RAM chip for storing data, a simple [[input/output|I/O]] device and a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU). Although not a chip designer, he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip, but as he lacked the technical know-how the idea remained just a wish for the time being.

[[File:Intel 4004.jpg|thumb|First microprocessor by Intel, the 4004.]]
[[File:Microprocessore silicio germano.jpg|thumb|upright|Silicon and germanium alloy for microprocessors]]
While the architecture and specifications of the MCS-4 came from the interaction of Hoff with [[Stanley Mazor]], a software engineer reporting to him, and with Busicom engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]], during 1969, Mazor and Hoff moved on to other projects. In April 1970, Intel hired Italian engineer [[Federico Faggin]] as project leader, a move that ultimately made the single-chip CPU final design a reality (Shima meanwhile designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during the first six months of the implementation). Faggin, who originally developed the [[silicon gate]] technology (SGT) in 1968 at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistor Integrated Circuits with Silicon Gates | last1=Faggin | first1=F. | last2=Klein | first2=T. | last3=Vadasz | first3=L. | conference=International Electronic Devices Meeting | publisher=IEEE Electron Devices Group | date=23 October 1968 | url=http://www.intel4004.com/images/iedm_covart.jpg | format=JPEG image | accessdate=2009-12-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219143313/http://www.intel4004.com/images/iedm_covart.jpg | archivedate=19 February 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed the world’s first commercial integrated circuit using SGT, the Fairchild 3708, had the correct background to lead the project into what would become the first commercial general purpose microprocessor. Since SGT was his very own invention, Faggin also used it to create his new methodology for [[random logic]] design that made it possible to implement a single-chip CPU with the proper speed, power dissipation and cost. The manager of Intel's MOS Design Department was [[Leslie L. Vadász]] at the time of the MCS-4 development but Vadász's attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories so he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin, who was ultimately responsible for leading the 4004 project to its realization. Production units of the 4004 were first delivered to Busicom in March 1971 and shipped to other customers in late 1971.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===8-bit designs===
{{Refimprove|section and the sections below|date=June 2011}}

The Intel 4004 was followed in 1972 by the [[Intel 8008]], the world's first [[8-bit]] microprocessor. The 8008 was not, however, an extension of the 4004 design, but instead the culmination of a separate design project at Intel, arising from a contract with [[Datapoint|Computer Terminals Corporation]], of San Antonio TX, for a chip for a terminal they were designing,&lt;ref name="mit-comp-history"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ceruzzi | first = Paul E. | title = A History of Modern Computing | edition = 2nd |date=May 2003 | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 0-262-53203-4 | pages = 220–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Datapoint 2200]]—fundamental aspects of the design came not from Intel but from CTC. In 1968, CTC's Vic Poor and Harry Pyle developed the original design for the [[instruction set]] and operation of the processor. In 1969, CTC contracted two companies, [[Intel]] and [[Texas Instruments]], to make a single-chip implementation, known as the CTC 1201.&lt;ref name="forgotten-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9111341/Forgotten_PC_history_The_true_origins_of_the_personal_computer |title=Forgotten history: the true origins of the PC |first=Lamont |last=Wood |date=August 2008 |publisher=Computerworld |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vZKtCs1r?url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9111341/Forgotten_PC_history_The_true_origins_of_the_personal_computer?taxonomyName=Hardware&amp;taxonomyId=12 |archivedate=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1970 or early 1971, TI dropped out being unable to make a reliable part. In 1970, with Intel yet to deliver the part, CTC opted to use their own implementation in the Datapoint 2200, using traditional TTL logic instead (thus the first machine to run "8008 code" was not in fact a microprocessor at all and was delivered a year earlier). Intel's version of the 1201 microprocessor arrived in late 1971, but was too late, slow, and required a number of additional support chips. CTC had no interest in using it. CTC had originally contracted Intel for the chip, and would have owed them {{US$|50,000|1971}} for their design work.&lt;ref name="forgotten-history"/&gt; To avoid paying for a chip they did not want (and could not use), CTC released Intel from their contract and allowed them free use of the design.&lt;ref name="forgotten-history"/&gt; Intel marketed it as the 8008 in April, 1972, as the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. It was the basis for the famous "[[Mark-8]]" computer kit advertised in the magazine ''[[Radio-Electronics]]'' in 1974.  This processor had an 8-bit data bus and a 14-bit address bus.&lt;ref&gt;Intel 8008 data sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8008 was the precursor to the successful [[Intel 8080]] (1974), which offered improved performance over the 8008 and required fewer support chips. Federico Faggin conceived and designed it using high voltage N channel MOS. The [[Zilog Z80]] (1976) was also a Faggin design, using low voltage N channel with depletion load and derivative Intel 8-bit processors: all designed with the methodology Faggin created for the 4004. [[Motorola]] released the competing [[Motorola 6800|6800]] in August 1974, and the similar [[MOS Technology 6502]] in 1975 (both designed largely by the same people). The 6502 family rivaled the Z80 in popularity during the 1980s.

A low overall cost, small packaging, simple [[computer bus]] requirements, and sometimes the integration of extra circuitry (e.g. the Z80's built-in [[memory refresh]] circuitry) allowed the [[home computer]] "revolution" to accelerate sharply in the early 1980s. This delivered such inexpensive machines as the Sinclair [[ZX81]], which sold for {{US$|99|1981}}. A variation of the 6502, the [[MOS Technology 6510]] was used in the [[Commodore 64]] and yet another variant, the 8502, powered the [[Commodore 128]].

[[Western Design Center|The Western Design Center, Inc]] (WDC) introduced the CMOS [[WDC 65C02]] in 1982 and licensed the design to several firms. It was used as the CPU in the [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIc|IIc]] personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade [[pacemaker]]s and [[defibrillator]]s, automotive, industrial and consumer devices. WDC pioneered the licensing of microprocessor designs, later followed by [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] (32-bit) and other microprocessor [[intellectual property]] (IP) providers in the 1990s.

Motorola introduced the [[Motorola 6809|MC6809]] in 1978. It was an ambitious and well thought-through 8-bit design that was [[source compatible]] with the [[Motorola 6800|6800]], and implemented using purely [[Electrical wiring|hard-wired]] logic (subsequent 16-bit microprocessors typically used [[microcode]] to some extent, as CISC design requirements were becoming too complex for pure hard-wired logic).

Another early 8-bit microprocessor was the [[Signetics 2650]], which enjoyed a brief surge of interest due to its innovative and powerful [[instruction set]] architecture.

A seminal microprocessor in the world of spaceflight was [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]]'s [[RCA 1802]] (aka CDP1802, RCA COSMAC) (introduced in 1976), which was used on board the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' probe to Jupiter (launched 1989, arrived 1995). RCA COSMAC was the first to implement [[CMOS]] technology. The CDP1802 was used because it could be run at very [[low-power electronics|low power]], and because a variant was available fabricated using a special production process, [[silicon on sapphire]] (SOS), which provided much better protection against [[cosmic radiation]] and [[electrostatic discharge]] than that of any other processor of the era. Thus, the SOS version of the 1802 was said to be the first radiation-hardened microprocessor.

The RCA 1802 had a [[static logic (digital logic)|static design]], meaning that the [[clock frequency]] could be made arbitrarily low, or even stopped. This let the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] use minimum electric power for long uneventful stretches of a voyage. Timers or sensors would awaken the processor in time for important tasks, such as navigation updates, attitude control, data acquisition, and radio communication. Current versions of the Western Design Center 65C02 and 65C816 have static cores, and thus retain data even when the clock is completely halted.

===12-bit designs===
The [[Intersil 6100]] family consisted of a [[12-bit]] microprocessor (the 6100) and a range of peripheral support and memory ICs. The microprocessor recognised the DEC [[PDP-8]] [[minicomputer]] instruction set. As such it was sometimes referred to as the '''CMOS-PDP8'''. Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation, it was also known as the '''Harris HM-6100'''. By virtue of its CMOS technology and associated benefits, the 6100 was being incorporated into some military designs until the early 1980s.

===16-bit designs===
{{x86 processor modes}}
The first multi-chip [[16-bit]] microprocessor was the [[National Semiconductor]] [[IMP-16]], introduced in early 1973. An 8-bit version of the chipset was introduced in 1974 as the IMP-8.

Other early multi-chip 16-bit microprocessors include one that [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] used in the [[LSI-11]] OEM board set and the packaged [[PDP-11|PDP 11/03]] [[minicomputer]]—and the [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] MicroFlame 9440, both introduced in 1975–76.  In 1975, National introduced the first 16-bit single-chip microprocessor, the [[National Semiconductor PACE]], which was later followed by an [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] version, the [[INS8900]].

Another early single-chip 16-bit microprocessor was TI's [[Texas Instruments TMS9900|TMS 9900]], which was also compatible with their [[TI-990]] line of minicomputers. The 9900 was used in the TI 990/4 minicomputer, the [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]] home computer, and the TM990 line of OEM microcomputer boards. The chip was packaged in a large ceramic 64-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP package]], while most 8-bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 used the more common, smaller, and less expensive plastic 40-pin DIP. A follow-on chip, the TMS 9980, was designed to compete with the Intel 8080, had the full TI 990 16-bit instruction set, used a plastic 40-pin package, moved data 8&amp;nbsp;bits at a time, but could only address 16&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]]. A third chip, the TMS 9995, was a new design. The family later expanded to include the 99105 and 99110.

The [[Western Design Center]] (WDC) introduced the CMOS [[WDC 65816/65802|65816]] 16-bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] in 1984. The 65816 16-bit microprocessor was the core of the [[Apple IIgs]] and later the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], making it one of the most popular 16-bit designs of all time.

Intel "upsized" their 8080 design into the 16-bit [[Intel 8086]], the first member of the [[x86]] family, which powers most modern [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] type computers. [[Intel]] introduced the 8086 as a cost-effective way of porting software from the 8080 lines, and succeeded in winning much business on that premise. The [[Intel 8088|8088]], a version of the 8086 that used an 8-bit external data bus, was the microprocessor in the first [[IBM PC]]. Intel then released the [[Intel 80186|80186]] and [[Intel 80188|80188]], the [[Intel 80286|80286]] and, in 1985, the 32-bit [[Intel 80386|80386]], cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family's backwards compatibility. The 80186 and 80188 were essentially versions of the 8086 and 8088, enhanced with some onboard peripherals and a few new instructions.  Although Intel's 80186 and 80188 were not used in IBM PC type designs,{{dubious|Intel 80186 and IBM PC-style computers|date=November 2016}} second source versions from NEC, the [[NEC V20|V20]] and V30 frequently were.  The 8086 and successors had an innovative but limited method of [[memory segmentation]], while the 80286 introduced a full-featured segmented [[memory management unit]] (MMU). The 80386 introduced a flat 32-bit memory model with paged memory management.

The 16-bit Intel x86 processors up to and including the 80386 do not include [[Floating-point unit|floating-point units (FPUs)]]. Intel introduced the [[Intel 8087|8087]], [[Intel 80187|80187]], [[Intel 80287|80287]] and [[Intel 80387|80387]] math coprocessors to add hardware floating-point and transcendental function capabilities to the 8086 through 80386 CPUs. The 8087 works with the 8086/8088 and 80186/80188,&lt;ref&gt;Intel 8087 datasheet, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; the 80187 works with the 80186 but not the 80188,&lt;ref&gt;The 80187 only has a 16-bit data bus because it used the 80387SX core.&lt;/ref&gt; the 80287 works with the 80286 and the 80387 works with the 80386.  The combination of an x86 CPU and an x87 coprocessor forms a single multi-chip microprocessor; the two chips are programmed as a unit using a single integrated instruction set.&lt;ref&gt;"Essentially, the 80C187 can be treated as an additional resource or an extension to the CPU. The 80C186 CPU together with an 80C187 can be used as a single unified system." Intel 80C187 datasheet, p. 3, November 1992 (Order Number: 270640-004).&lt;/ref&gt; The 8087 and 80187 coprocessors are connected in parallel with the data and address buses of their parent processor and directly execute instructions intended for them.  The 80287 and 80387 coprocessors are interfaced to the CPU through I/O ports in the CPU's address space, this is transparent to the program, which does not need to know about or access these I/O ports directly; the program accesses the coprocessor and its registers through normal instruction opcodes.

===32-bit designs===
[[File:80486DX2 200x.png|thumb|Upper interconnect layers on an [[Intel 80486]]DX2 die]]

16-bit designs had only been on the market briefly when [[32-bit]] implementations started to appear.

The most significant of the 32-bit designs is the [[Motorola 68000|Motorola MC68000]], introduced in 1979.{{dubious|date=January 2015}} The 68k, as it was widely known, had 32-bit registers in its programming model but used 16-bit internal data paths, three 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Units, and a 16-bit external data bus (to reduce pin count), and externally supported only 24-bit addresses (internally it worked with full 32&amp;nbsp;bit addresses). In [[PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes]] the MC68000 internal microcode was modified to emulate the 32-bit System/370 IBM mainframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priorartdatabase.com/IPCOM/000059679# |title=Priorartdatabase.com |publisher=Priorartdatabase.com |date=1986-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorola generally described it as a 16-bit processor. The combination of high performance, large (16&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s or 2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;bytes) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular [[CPU design]] of its class. The [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] designs made use of the 68000, as did a host of other designs in the mid-1980s, including the [[Atari ST]] and [[Commodore Amiga]].

The world's first single-chip fully 32-bit microprocessor, with 32-bit data paths, 32-bit buses, and 32-bit addresses, was the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] [[Bell Labs]] [[Bellmac 32|BELLMAC-32A]], with first samples in 1980, and general production in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoji, M. Bibliography|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/bib/shoji.bib|date=7 October 1998&lt;!-- page info --&gt;|publisher=Bell Laboratories|access-date=2009-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016070217/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/bib/shoji.bib|archivedate=16 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: 1982–1984|work=Physical Sciences &amp; Communications at Bell Labs|publisher=Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent|url=http://www.bell-labs.com/org/physicalsciences/timeline/span23.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025934/http://www.bell-labs.com/org/physicalsciences/timeline/span23.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |date=17 January 2001 |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Bell System divestiture|divestiture of AT&amp;T]] in 1984, it was renamed the WE 32000 (WE for [[Western Electric]]), and had two follow-on generations, the WE 32100 and WE 32200. These microprocessors were used in the AT&amp;T 3B5 and 3B15 minicomputers; in the 3B2, the world's first desktop super microcomputer; in the "Companion", the world's first 32-bit [[laptop]] computer; and in "Alexander", the world's first book-sized super microcomputer, featuring ROM-pack memory cartridges similar to today's gaming consoles. All these systems ran the [[UNIX System V]] operating system.

The first commercial, single chip, fully 32-bit microprocessor available on the market was the [[HP FOCUS]].

Intel's first 32-bit microprocessor was the [[Intel iAPX 432|iAPX 432]], which was introduced in 1981, but was not a commercial success. It had an advanced [[Capability-based security|capability-based]] [[Object (computer science)|object-oriented]] architecture, but poor performance compared to contemporary architectures such as Intel's own 80286 (introduced 1982), which was almost four times as fast on typical benchmark tests. However, the results for the iAPX432 was partly due to a rushed and therefore suboptimal [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] [[compiler]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Motorola's success with the 68000 led to the [[Motorola 68010|MC68010]], which added [[virtual memory]] support. The [[Motorola 68020|MC68020]], introduced in 1984 added full 32-bit data and address buses. The 68020 became hugely popular in the [[Unix]] supermicrocomputer market, and many small companies (e.g., [[Altos Computer Systems|Altos]], [[UNOS (operating system)|Charles River Data Systems]], [[Cromemco]]) produced desktop-size systems. The [[Motorola 68030|MC68030]] was introduced next, improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip. The continued success led to the [[Motorola 68040|MC68040]], which included an [[floating point unit|FPU]] for better math performance. The 68050 failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released, and the follow-up [[Motorola 68060|MC68060]] was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs. The 68k family faded from use in the early 1990s.

Other large companies designed the 68020 and follow-ons into embedded equipment. At one point, there were more 68020s in embedded equipment than there were [[Intel]] Pentiums in PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCore: Does Motorola Need Another Processor Family?|last=Turley|first=Jim|work=Embedded Systems Design|publisher=TechInsights (United Business Media)|url=http://www.embedded.com/98/9807sr.htm|date=July 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980702003323/http://www.embedded.com/98/9807sr.htm |archivedate=1998-07-02|accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motorola ColdFire|ColdFire]] processor cores are derivatives of the 68020.

During this time (early to mid-1980s), [[National Semiconductor]] introduced a very similar 16-bit pinout, 32-bit internal microprocessor called the NS 16032 (later renamed 32016), the full 32-bit version named the [[NS320xx|NS 32032]]. Later, National Semiconductor produced the [[NS320xx|NS 32132]], which allowed two CPUs to reside on the same memory bus with built in arbitration. The NS32016/32 outperformed the MC68000/10, but the NS32332—which arrived at approximately the same time as the MC68020—did not have enough performance. The third generation chip, the NS32532, was different. It had about double the performance of the MC68030, which was released around the same time. The appearance of RISC processors like the AM29000 and MC88000 (now both dead) influenced the architecture of the final core, the NS32764. Technically advanced—with a superscalar RISC core, 64-bit bus, and internally overclocked—it could still execute Series 32000 instructions through real-time translation.

When National Semiconductor decided to leave the Unix market, the chip was redesigned into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on chip peripherals. The chip turned out to be too expensive for the [[laser printer]] market and was killed. The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor, which is very similar to the NS32764 core internally. The big success of the Series 32000 was in the laser printer market, where the NS32CG16 with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price/performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon. By the mid-1980s, [[Sequent Computer Systems|Sequent]] introduced the first SMP server-class computer using the NS 32032. This was one of the design's few wins, and it disappeared in the late 1980s. The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[R2000 (microprocessor)|R2000]] (1984) and [[R3000]] (1989) were highly successful 32-bit RISC microprocessors. They were used in high-end workstations and servers by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], among others. Other designs included the [[Zilog Z80000]], which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly.

The [[ARM architecture|ARM]] first appeared in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[RISC]] processor design, which has since come to dominate the 32-bit [[embedded systems]] processor space due in large part to its power efficiency, its licensing model, and its wide selection of system development tools. Semiconductor manufacturers generally license cores and integrate them into their own [[system on a chip]] products; only a few such vendors are licensed to modify the ARM cores. Most [[cell phones]] include an ARM processor, as do a wide variety of other products. There are microcontroller-oriented ARM cores without virtual memory support, as well as [[symmetric multiprocessor system|symmetric multiprocessor]] (SMP) applications processors with virtual memory.

From 1993 to 2003, the 32-bit [[x86]] architectures became increasingly dominant in [[desktop computer|desktop]], [[laptop]], and server markets, and these microprocessors became faster and more capable. Intel had licensed early versions of the architecture to other companies, but declined to license the Pentium, so [[AMD]] and [[Cyrix]] built later versions of the architecture based on their own designs. During this span, these processors increased in complexity (transistor count) and capability (instructions/second) by at least three orders of magnitude. Intel's Pentium line is probably the most famous and recognizable 32-bit processor model, at least with the public at broad.

===64-bit designs in personal computers===
While [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] microprocessor designs have been in use in several markets since the early 1990s (including the [[Nintendo 64]] [[gaming console]] in 1996), the early 2000s saw the introduction of 64-bit microprocessors targeted at the PC market.

With AMD's introduction of a 64-bit architecture backwards-compatible with x86, [[x86-64]] (also called '''AMD64'''), in September 2003, followed by Intel's near fully compatible 64-bit extensions (first called IA-32e or EM64T, later renamed '''Intel 64'''), the 64-bit desktop era began. Both versions can run 32-bit legacy applications without any performance penalty as well as new 64-bit software. With operating systems [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|Windows XP x64]], [[Windows Vista]] x64, [[Windows 7]] x64, [[Linux]], [[BSD]], and [[macOS]] that run 64-bit natively, the software is also geared to fully utilize the capabilities of such processors. The move to 64&amp;nbsp;bits is more than just an increase in register size from the IA-32 as it also doubles the number of general-purpose registers.

The move to 64&amp;nbsp;bits by [[PowerPC]] had been intended since the architecture's design in the early 90s and was not a major cause of incompatibility. Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways, but, as was the case with IA-32, both floating point and vector units had been operating at or above 64&amp;nbsp;bits for several years. Unlike what happened when IA-32 was extended to x86-64, no new general purpose registers were added in 64-bit PowerPC, so any performance gained when using the 64-bit mode for applications making no use of the larger address space is minimal.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 2011, ARM introduced a new 64-bit ARM architecture.

===RISC===
{{Main article|reduced instruction set computing}}

In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, a crop of new high-performance reduced instruction set computer ([[RISC]]) microprocessors appeared, influenced by discrete RISC-like CPU designs such as the [[IBM 801]] and others. RISC microprocessors were initially used in special-purpose machines and [[Unix]] [[workstation]]s, but then gained wide acceptance in other roles.

The first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in 1984, by [[MIPS Computer Systems]], the 32-bit [[R2000 (microprocessor)|R2000]] (the R1000 was not released). In 1986, HP released its first system with a [[PA-RISC]] CPU&lt;!-- NOT microprocessor --&gt;. In 1987, in the non-Unix [[Acorn computers]]' 32-bit, then cache-less, [[ARM2]]-based [[Acorn Archimedes]] became the first commercial success using the [[ARM architecture]], then known as Acorn RISC Machine (ARM); first silicon [[ARM architecture|ARM1]] in 1985. The R3000 made the design truly practical, and the [[R4000]] introduced the world's first commercially available 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Competing projects would result in the IBM [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] architectures. Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design, including the [[AT&amp;T CRISP]], [[AMD 29000]], [[Intel i860]] and [[Intel i960]], [[Motorola 88000]], [[DEC Alpha]].

In the late 1990s, only two 64-bit RISC architectures were still produced in volume for non-embedded applications: [[SPARC]] and [[Power Architecture|Power ISA]], but as ARM has become increasingly powerful, in the early 2010s, it became the third RISC architecture in the general computing segment.

===Multi-core designs===
{{Main article|multi-core processor}}
{{Refimprove|section and the sections below|date=March 2012}}

A different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in [[symmetric multiprocessing]] designs, which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with [[Moore's law]] is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach their physical limits. In response, microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance so they can maintain the momentum of constant upgrades.

A [[multi-core processor]] is a single chip that contains more than one microprocessor core. Each core can simultaneously execute processor instructions in parallel. This effectively multiplies the processor's potential performance by the number of cores, if the software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor core. Some components, such as bus interface and cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically close to each other, they can communicate with each other much faster than separate (off-chip) processors in a multiprocessor system, which improves overall system performance.

In 2001, [[IBM]] introduced the first commercial multi-core processor, the monolithic two-core [[POWER4]].  Personal computers did not receive multi-core processors until the 2005 introduction, of the two-core [[Intel]] [[Pentium D]]. The Pentium D, however, was not a monolithic multi-core processor. It was constructed from two dies, each containing a core, packaged on a [[multi-chip module]]. The first monolithic multi-core processor in the personal computer market was the [[AMD]] [[Athlon X2]], which was introduced a few weeks after the Pentium D. {{As of|2012}}, dual- and quad-core processors are widely used in home PCs and laptops, while quad-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and sixteen-core processors are common in the professional and enterprise markets with workstations and servers.

Sun Microsystems has released the [[UltraSPARC T1|Niagara]] and [[UltraSPARC T2|Niagara 2]] chips, both of which feature an eight-core design. The Niagara 2 supports more [[thread (computing)|thread]]s and operates at 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz.

High-end Intel Xeon processors that are on the [[LGA 775]], [[LGA 1366]], and [[LGA 2011]] sockets and high-end AMD Opteron processors that are on the [[Socket C32|C32]] and [[Socket G34|G34]] sockets are DP (dual processor) capable, as well as the older Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9775 also used in an older Mac Pro by Apple and the Intel Skulltrail motherboard. AMD's G34 motherboards can support up to four CPUs and Intel's [[LGA 1567]] motherboards can support up to eight CPUs.

Modern desktop computers support systems with multiple CPUs, but few applications outside of the professional market can make good use of more than four cores. Both Intel and AMD currently offer fast quad, hex and octa-core desktop CPUs, making multi-CPU systems obsolete for many purposes.
The desktop market has been in a transition towards quad-core CPUs since Intel's Core 2 Quad was released and are now common, although dual-core CPUs are still more prevalent. Older or mobile computers are less likely to have more than two cores than newer desktops.  Not all software is optimised for multi-core CPUs, making fewer, more powerful cores preferable.

AMD offers CPUs with more cores for a given amount of money than similarly priced Intel CPUs—but the AMD cores are somewhat slower, so the two trade blows in different applications depending on how well-threaded the programs running are. For example, Intel's cheapest Sandy Bridge quad-core CPUs often cost almost twice as much as AMD's cheapest Athlon II, Phenom II, and FX quad-core CPUs but Intel has dual-core CPUs in the same price ranges as AMD's cheaper quad-core CPUs. In an application that uses one or two threads, the Intel dual-core CPUs outperform AMD's similarly priced quad-core CPUs—and if a program supports three or four threads the cheap AMD quad-core CPUs outperform the similarly priced Intel dual-core CPUs.

Historically, AMD and Intel have switched places as the company with the fastest CPU several times. Intel currently leads on the desktop side of the computer CPU market, with their Sandy Bridge and [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] series. In servers, AMD's new [[Opteron]]s seem to have superior performance for their price point. This means that AMD are currently more competitive in low- to mid-end servers and workstations that more effectively use fewer cores and threads.

Taken to the extreme, this trend also includes [[manycore]] designs, with hundreds of cores, with qualitatively different architectures.

==Market statistics==
In 1997, about 55% of all [[central processing unit|CPU]]s sold in the world were 8-bit [[microcontroller]]s, of which over 2 billion were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Microchip on the March | year=1998 | author=Cantrell, Tom | url=http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/designforum/silicon_update/3/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220134759/http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/designforum/silicon_update/3/index.asp | archivedate=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world were 32-bit or more. Of all the 32-bit CPUs sold, about 2% are used in desktop or laptop personal computers. Most microprocessors are used in embedded control applications such as household appliances, automobiles, and computer peripherals. Taken as a whole, the average price for a microprocessor, microcontroller, or [[digital signal processor|DSP]] is just over {{US$|6|2002}}.&lt;ref name="turley"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Two Percent Solution | last=Turley | first=Jim | date=18 December 2002 | work=Embedded Systems Design | publisher=TechInsights (United Business Media) | url=http://www.embedded.com/print/4024488 | accessdate=2009-12-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403140448/http://www.embedded.com/print/4024488 | archivedate=3 April 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

The '''Pitlochry fish ladder''' is a [[fish ladder]] next to the Pitlochry Power Station on the  [[River Tummel]] near [[Pitlochry]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Scotland]] that allows [[salmon]] to travel upstream during the breeding season. 

== Construction details ==
The ladder was constructed as a result of a 1943 [[Act of Parliament]] which laid a duty of care on the [[North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board]] to preserve fish stocks in the waterways encompassing its power schemes. The form and design were created by the fish biologist [[John Berry (zoologist)|John Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/berry_john.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It was completed in 1951 alongside the dam for the [[hydro-electric]] power station as part of the [[Tummel Hydro-Electric Power Scheme]] and was installed in 1952. It was the first of its type in Scotland.&lt;ref name="SNH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/commissioned_reports/F01NB02.pdf|title=Trends in Atlantic salmon: the role of automatic fish counter data in their recording
|author=Eatherley, D.M.R., Thorley, J.L., Stephen, A.B., Simpson, I., MacLean, J.C. &amp; Youngson, A.F|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|date=2005|accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fish ladder consists of 34 separate pools, each {{convert|50|cm|ft}} higher than the last and covering a distance of {{convert|310|m|yd}}.&lt;ref name="PL1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8993.html |title=Pitlochry Fish Ladder|author=|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|date=|accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each pool has a {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} opening below the water level to allow the fish to pass to the next pool; a continuous flow of water maintains the water level in the pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people =|date =2006| title =Countryfile| url =| medium = Television series| location =| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three larger pools which allow the fish to rest during their ascent, and one of these has an underwater viewing area with a glass wall and CCTV cameras to allow the public to observe the fish making their climb during the breeding season. The ladder is equipped with a [[fish counter]] which allows the number of fish making the journey each year to be recorded. In 2006, 7,238 fish were recorded travelling up the ladder.&lt;ref name="PAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitlochryanglingclub.co.uk/news.html|title=News: 2006 Salmon Season|author=|publisher=Pitlochry Angling Club|date=2006|accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total to date for 2016 as of September 13 was 6098 fish. The 2006 figure, and 2016 figures, are relatively high, when taken in context with the counts since 1980. An average figure has been nearer to 4000 fish, looking at the Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board report of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tdsfb.org/images/AnnualReport2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam across the River Tummel at Pitlochry (that led to the formation of [[Loch Faskally]]) was constructed between 1947 and 1950 as part of the Board's Tummel Hydro-Electric Power Scheme. Without the fish ladder it would have been an impassable obstacle for the migrating salmon.&lt;ref name="PL1" /&gt;

'''Protochlorophyllide''',&lt;ref name="kegg"&gt;KEGG compound database entry [http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?compound+C02880]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''monovinyl protochlorophyllide''', is an immediate precursor of [[chlorophyll|chlorophyll ''a'']] that lacks the [[phytol]] side-chain of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;Entry in Mondofacto library [http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?protochlorophyllide]&lt;/ref&gt; Protochlorophyllide is highly [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]]; mutants that accumulate it glow red if irradiated with blue light.&lt;ref name="rasa"&gt;Meskauskiene R, Nater M, Goslings D, Kessler F, op den Camp R, Apel K.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2001; 98(22):12826-31 [http://www.pnas.org/content/98/22/12826.full.pdf pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[angiosperms]], the last step, conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent, and such plants are pale ([[Chlorosis|chlorotic]]) if grown in the darkness. [[Gymnosperms]], [[algae]], and photosynthetic bacteria have another, light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness as well.

== Conversion to chlorophyll ==
{{main|Protochlorophyllide reductase}}
The enzyme that converts protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide is [[protochlorophyllide reductase]],&lt;ref name="KEGG enzyme"&gt;KEGG enzyme entry 1.3.1.33 [http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?enzyme+1.3.1.33]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enzyme Commission number|EC]] 1.3.1.33. There are two structurally unrelated proteins with this activity: the light-dependent and the dark-operative. The light-dependent reductase needs light to operate. The dark-operative version is a completely different protein, consisting of three subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of [[nitrogenase]], which catalyzes the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen.&lt;ref&gt; Yuichi FujitaDagger and Carl E. Bauer (2000). Reconstitution of Light-independent Protochlorophyllide Reductase from Purified Bchl and BchN-BchB Subunits. J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 275, Issue 31, 23583-23588. [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/275/31/23583]&lt;/ref&gt; This enzyme might be evolutionary older but (being similar to nitrogenase) is highly sensitive to free [[oxygen]] and does not work if its concentration exceeds about 3%.&lt;ref&gt;S.Yamazaki, J.Nomata, Y.Fujita (2006) Differential operation of dual protochlorophyllide reductases for chlorophyll biosynthesis in response to environmental oxygen levels in the cyanobacterium ''Leptolyngbya boryana''. Plant Physiology, 2006, 142,  911-922 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18274807]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the alternative, light-dependent version needed to evolve.

Most of the photosynthetic bacteria have both light-dependent and light-independent reductases. Angiosperms have lost the dark-operative form and rely on 3 slightly different copies of light-dependent version, frequently abbreviated as POR A, B, and C. Gymnosperms have much more copies of the similar gene ([[Loblolly pine]] has about 11 [http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/39/8/795]). In plants, POR is encoded in the [[cell nucleus]] and only later transported to its place of work, [[chloroplast]]. Unlike with POR, in plants and algae that have the dark-operative enzyme it is at least partially encoded in the [[chloroplast genome]].&lt;ref&gt;J Li, M Goldschmidt-Clermont, M P Timko (1997). Chloroplast-encoded chlB is required for light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase activity in ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii''. Plant Cell 5(12): 1817–1829.  [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=160407].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential danger for plant ==
Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide, however, occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a photosensitizer, forming highly toxic free radicals. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of [[aminolevulinic acid|δ-aminolevulinic acid]] (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthetic pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, as do mutants with a disrupted regulatory system.

''Arabidopsis'' ''FLU'' mutant with damaged regulation can survive only either in a continuous darkness (protochlorophyllide is not dangerous in the darkness) or under continuous light, when the plant is capable to convert all produced protochlorophyllide into chlorophyll and do not overaccumulate it despite of the lack of regulation. In [[barley]] ''Tigrina'' mutant (mutated on the same gene,&lt;ref name = "tigrina"&gt; TIGRINA d, required for regulating the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles in barley, is an ortholog of the FLU gene of ''Arabidopsis thaliana''. FEBS Letters, 553, 119-124 .[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014579303009839].&lt;/ref&gt;) light kills the majority of the leaf tissue that has developed in the darkness, but part of the leaf that originated during the day survives. As a result, the leaves are covered by white stripes of necrotic regions, and the number of the white stripes is close to the age of the leaf in days. Green regions survive the subsequent nights, likely because the synthesis of chlorophyll in the mature leaf tissue is greatly reduced anyway.

== Biosynthesis regulatory protein FLU ==
In spite of numerous past attempts to find the mutant that overacumulates protochlorophyllide under usual conditions, only one such gene (''flu'') is currently (2009) known. ''Flu'' (first described in &lt;ref name="rasa"/&gt;) is a nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-located protein that appears containing only protein-protein interaction sites. It is currently not known which other proteins interact through this linker. The regulatory protein is a [[transmembrane]] protein that is located in the [[thylakoid]] membrane. Later, it was discovered that ''Tigrina'' mutants in barley, known a long time ago, are also mutated in the same gene.&lt;ref name='tigrina'/&gt; It is not obvious why no mutants of any other gene were observed; maybe mutations in other proteins, involved into the regulatory chain, are fatal. ''Flu'' is a single gene, not a member of the [[gene family]].

Later, by the sequence similarity, a similar protein was found in ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'' algae,&lt;ref&gt;A Falciatore, L Merendino, F Barneche, M Ceol, R Meskauskiene, K Apel, JD Rochaix (2005). The FLP proteins act as regulators of chlorophyll synthesis in response to light and plastid signals in ''Chlamydomonas''. Genes &amp; Dev, 19:176-187
 [http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/1/176.full.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; showing that this regulatory subsystem existed a long time before the angiosperms lost the independent conversion enzyme. In a different manner, the ''Chlamydomonas'' regulatory protein is more complex: It is larger, crosses the thylakoid membrane twice rather than once, contains more protein-protein interactions sites, and even undergoes alternative [[RNA splicing|splicing]]. It appears that the regulatory system underwent simplification during evolution.

"Chapter 12: Relational Dialectics." First Look at Communication Theory. [S.l.]: Mcgraw Hill Higher Educat, 2011. 153–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory, proposed respectively by [[Leslie A.

When making decisions, desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are brought up and lead to dialectical tensions.&lt;ref name="Cheney"&gt;Cheney, G., Christensen, L. T., Zorn, T.

A., &amp; Montgomery, B. M. (1996). Relating: Dialogues and dialectics.

The relational dialectic is an elaboration on [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s idea that life is an open monologue and  humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A. (2204). A tale of two voices: relational dialectics theory. ''The Journal of Family Communication'', 4(3&amp;4), 182–192.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baxter includes a list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that  relationships are constantly changing, and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention. Although Baxter's description of relational dialectics is thorough, it by no means is exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways.

==History==
Relational dialectics is the emotional and value-based version of the philosophical [[dialectic]].  It is rooted in the dynamism of the [[yin and yang]].  Like the classic yin and yang, the balance of emotional values in a relationship is always in motion, and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite.&lt;ref name="Bax6"&gt;Baxter, L. A. &amp; Montgomery, B. M. (1996) ''Relating: Dialogues and dialectics'' Guilford Press, New York, {{ISBN|1-57230-099-X}} ;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western world]], these ideas hark back to the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]], who held that the world was in constant flux (like fire), with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process. [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], a Russian scholar most known for his work in [[Dialogic|dialogism]], applied [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[dialectic]] to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism.  He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Emory A. (2003) A First Look at Communication Theory McGraw Hill, Boston, {{ISBN|0-07-248392-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference. Bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces ''centripetal'' (emotional forces tending towards unity) and ''centrifugal'' (emotional forces tending towards divergence). Like the Yin and Yang, Bakhtin's forces have no ultimate resolution.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

Baxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory.  She found a T-Bangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated.&lt;ref name="Bax6"/&gt;  Later authors have added other axes.&lt;ref name="Sahl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sahlstein | first1 = Erin M. | year = 2006 | title = Making plans: Praxis strategies for negotiating uncertainty-certainty in long-distance relationships | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 70 | issue = 2| pages = 147–165 | doi=10.1080/10570310600710042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to Relational Dialectics==
The ''monologic'' approach frames contradictions as either/or, the ''dualistic'' approach frames contradictions as two separate entities, and the ''dialectic'' approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction (both/and).&lt;ref name="West" /&gt;

==Core concepts and assumptions==
There are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics, as well as four major assumptions. Relational dialectics assumes that "(1.) relationships are not linear, (2.) relational life is characterized by change, (3.) contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life, and (4.) communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions".&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West, Richard, and Lynn Turner (2010) ''Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education {{ISBN|0073385077}}  ;&lt;/ref&gt;

The four core concepts of relational dialectics include: contradiction, totality, process, and praxis.

'''Contradictions''' are the core concept of relational dialectics. It is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions. A contradiction is formed "whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent (unity) yet mutually negate one another (negation)".&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Katherine (2002) ''Communication theories: perspectives, processes, and contexts'' McGraw Hill, Boston, {{ISBN|0-7674-0500-5}} ;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance.

'''Totality''' suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation. In other words, the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other. For example, the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy — both work to condition and define the other.

'''Process '''Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social '''processes'''. Movement, activity, and change are functional properties (Rawlins,1989). For example, instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness. In addition, the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication (Miller, 2002, 2005).

'''Praxis''' is a philosophical term for the concept of 'practical behavior' or sometimes 'the experience of practicing'.  In praxis the dialectic tensions are created and re-created through the active participation and interaction.  In other words, the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and value of another.  As the relationship endures one's own needs and values become apparent.  Praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values (dialectical tensions). In turn, the choices and actions themselves create, re-create, and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves.

Research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships, such as in the marriage, in the workplace, etc. Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics, or rather, the idea that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture. From there we also see the raise of public and private/real and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what we see on television in public life, versus what experience within our private lives. Examples of this include politicians as well as TV shows. According to West and Turner, "the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver:  We receive an idealized message of what family life is like, and then when we look at the families we live in, we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life. The tension between these two images forms this dialectic".&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard, and Lynn Turner (2010) Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education {{ISBN|0073385077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialectics==
According to the original relational dialectic [[Conceptual model|model]], there were many core tensions (opposing values) in any relationship.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt; These are autonomy and connectedness, favoritism and impartiality, openness and closedness, novelty and predictability, instrumentality and affection, and finally, equality and inequality.

Autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as a unique individual. An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete, who wants to feel like they are part of a team but also wanting to highlight their individual talents. Favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as "special". For instance, a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades, demonstrating favoritism. Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private. When chatting with a boss about one's weekend, there is the desire to be open, however, closedness is also at play, as certain details are often left out, because of the context. Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new. When creating scheduled meetings for board members, the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule, however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration. Instrumentality and affection, is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship. An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection, but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security. Finally, equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority. A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues, but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

According to the theory, while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness, certainty, and openness in our relationships, the communication is not a straight path towards these goals. Conflicts often produce the exact opposites.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

The table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways. The column that displays examples of Internal Dialect shows "ongoing tensions played out within a relationship".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; The column that displays examples of External Dialect shows "ongoing tensions between a couple and their community".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

'''Integration–separation''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes connection–autonomy, inclusion–seclusion, and intimacy–independence."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others.

'''Stability–change''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes certainty–uncertainty, conventionally–uniqueness, predictability–surprise, and routine–novelty."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Things must be consistent but not mundane. There must be a balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship.

'''Expression–nonexpression''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes openness–closedness, revelation–concealment, candor–secrecy, and transparency–privacy".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; In a relationship, it is important to keep some things between the two parties, while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about.

==Dialectics in relationships==
According to Michaela Meyer, "relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions. As a result, relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = M. E. | year = 2003 | title = "It's me. I'm it.": Defining Adolescent Sexual Identity through Relational Dialectics in Dawson's Creek | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 262–276 | doi=10.1080/01463370309370156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Leslie A.|title=Dialectical Theory|journal=International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family|date=2003|volume=2nd Edition|url=http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galemarriage/dialectical_theory/0?institutionId=6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Joseph P.|last2=Chango|first2=Joanna|last3=Szwedo|first3=David|title=The Adolescent Relational Dialectic and the Peer Roots of Adult Social Functioning|journal=Child Development|date=2014|volume=85|issue=1|pages=192–204|doi=10.1111/cdev.12106|pmc=4030385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studies of romantic relationships, long distance relationships, friendships, and family relationships, researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships.&lt;ref name="Sahl"/&gt;

According to Marsha Linehan, founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy, some people have great difficulty resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships.  Many people with personality disorders, potentially caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing, especially Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and some others, perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict, with resulting instability causing problems in living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities. In DBT's biosocial theory, some people "have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation, and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Little, Hannah; Tickle, Anna; das Nair, Roshan (16 October 2017).

===Romantic relationships===

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erbert | first1 = L. A. | year = 2000 | title = Conflict and dialectics: Perceptions of dialectic contradictions in marital conflict | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 17 | issue = 4–5| pages = 638–659 | doi=10.1177/0265407500174009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 25 [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses. Larry Erbert found that the Openness v. Closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants. Research conducted by Baxter and Montgomery confirmed this finding, and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships.

*'''''Openness with''''':  Refers to an individual's self-disclosure of information to another.  In this idea, three types of information are shared: information deemed to be personal, the individuals feelings or personal opinions, and information regarding one individual's relationship with the other.
*'''''Openness To''''': Often this form of openness is labeled as being attentive or responsive. People respond in cognitive, affective, and behavioral ways.
*'''''Closedness with''''': Describes the type of nondisclosive talk that occurs between individuals. It is most often identified as "small talk", being primarily superficial. The talk is oriented around conversation that requires little or no self-disclosure, allowing for a controlled level informational privacy.
*'''''Closedness to''''': Some people experience stress and discomfort when listening to others' problems. In response to this, some individuals attempt to distance themselves in order to discourage others from confiding in them.&lt;ref name="Bax6"/&gt;

Research has been conducted to examine the autonomy-connection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships. In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Dun's study they found that, "participants' joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction. Both antagonistic and non-antagonistic struggles were evident in these data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sahlstein | first1 = E. | last2 = Dun | first2 = T. | year = 2008 | title = "I Wanted Time to Myself and He Wanted to be Together All the Time": Constructing Breakups as Managing Autonomy-Connection | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Reports In Communication | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 37–45 | doi = 10.1080/17459430802400340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the study discovered that while normally break-ups are retroactively studied, the autonomy-connection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy.

These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship.

==== Re-marriage ====

In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilder | first1 = S. E. | year = 2012 | title = A Dialectical Examination of Remarriage Dyadic Communication and Communication with Social Networks | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Reports In Communication | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 63–70 | doi = 10.1080/17459435.2012.722163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on dialectics in second marriages, six tensions unique to remarriages emerged.

Three tensions related to the remarried dyad:

*'''''Old-new''''' - Many participants found that within their new marriage, the individuals brought with them ideas and expectations based on their previous, or "old," marriages. However, participants recognized that they had since entered a "new" marriage, which would not necessarily carry over the previous old expectations or experiences.
*'''''Emotional closeness-distance''''' - Participants expressed feelings of both emotional closeness and emotional distance with their new partners. While participants found that they experienced emotional closeness with their second spouse, they also found that either they or their new spouse had other close friends or family with whom they were close to.
*'''''Past-present''''' - Many participants found that they do not discuss prior relationships, or other things that relate to the past, with their new partners. Yet, the new couples remained open about issues and topics related to their present life.

Three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks:

*'''''Their time frame-our time frame''''' - Many participants expressed feeling tensions between adhering to a time frame that felt right to the individual, while acknowledging the expectations that they sensed from their friends and family members in regards to what an appropriate relationship and re-marriage time frame would be.
*'''''Dyadic revelation-network revelation''''' - Participants found that they desired to share information with their social network, however, sometimes their partner did not desire them to share such information with that particular network, resulting in tensions among participants to decide between revealing to their partner and revealing information to their social network.
*'''''Old-new''''' - Participants identified the tension that was created through interactions with friends and family from the "old" marriage while being in the "new" [[marriage]]. Participants managed this tension primarily through recalibration and reaffirmation, where participants recognized that both sides had to be present in order for the relationship to exist.

===Long distance relationships===

Based on research by Sahlstein,&lt;ref name="Sahl"/&gt; the uncertainty v. certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in long-distance relationships. Her work exposed uncertainty v. certainty as a competing yet complementary need. In interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships, contradictions emerged. For example, couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity. Within this, three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged:

*'''''Segmentation''''' - referred to the partners' ability to live separate, independent lives when they were not together.
*'''''Balance''''' - referred to the couple's ability to plan conversations about the future of the relationship.
*'''''Denial''''' - referring to the couple's refusal to admit the effect distance is having on the relationship.

===Friendships===

William Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to [[friendship]]s.  The tension of instrumentality v. affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; Within friendships, importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for "real" friendships opposed to instrumentality for "fake" friendships. [[Aristotle]]'s "friendship of virtue" notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point. The dichotomy of instrumentality v. affection cannot be ignored within friendships, as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends. This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships. While this remains true, the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v. affection is applied.

'''In the workplace'''

'''''Blended Relationships''''' are close friends that are a part of the same work environment. Dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations. It is not necessary, however, to have a friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions. Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Brad W.|last2=Jensen|first2=Katherine C.|last3=Hideko|first3=Sera|last4=Cimbora|first4=David M.|title=Ethics and Relational Dialectics in Mentoring Relationships|journal=Training and Education in Professional Psychology|date=2017|issue=Advance online publication|doi=10.1037/tep0000166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Impartiality vs. Favoritism''''':  Friends within organizations desire to provide each other with special support and assistance but organizations strive for equitable treatment and discourage bias.
*'''''Openness vs. Closedness''''':  It is a tendency of close friends to be open and honest with one another, but organizations often expect a level of confidentiality that places strain on friendships that value the sharing of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Bridge | first2 = K. | year = 1992 | title = Blended relationships: friends as work associates | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 200–225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Novelty and Predictability''''': Feeling excited about a restructuring of your organization but anxious since it may interrupt your routine and put stress on your current relationships.
*'''''Instrumentality and Affection''''':  Inviting a coworker to lunch with the intention of asking for support on a project at work.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

=== Family relationships ===

''' Sibling relationships '''

Relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conger|first=K.J.|last2=Little|first2=W.M.|year=2010|title=Sibling relationships during the transition to adulthood|url=|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=4|issue=2|pages=87–94|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2010.00123.x|via=|pmc=2917987}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one sibling begins a new phase of life, this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in his/her new lifestyle, along with a new geographic separation, both of which result in a change in communication. As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond his/her home, the pre-existing sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halliwell | first1 = D | year = 2016 | title = "I Know You, But I Don't Know Who You Are": Siblings' Discursive Struggles Surrounding Experiences of Transition | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 327–347 | doi = 10.1080/10570314.2015.1091493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition, all participants acknowledged that moving away from their sibling(s) resulted in a [[Discourse|discursive]] struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship. Two specific discursive struggles were identified:
*'''''Old relationship-new relationship''''' - For many siblings, family rituals were not continued upon moving out, resulting in a change in relationship and a feeling of missing out, emphasizing the changes that occur during the transition from an old relationship into new ones.
*'''''Certainty-uncertainty''''' - Participants found that the change from seeing a sibling regularly to not seeing him/her often resulted in feelings of uncertainty, resulting in an identity shift&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective|last=Baxter|first=Leslie A.|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the relationship and supporting the discursive struggle of certainty-uncertainty.

While participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions, 8 of the 19 participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brother(s) and/or sister(s).

''' Children and stepparents '''

In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = D. O. | last3 = Bryant | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Stepchildren's perceptions of the contradictions in communication with stepparents | url = | journal = Journal of Social &amp; Personal Relationships | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 447–467 | doi=10.1177/0265407504044841}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchild-[[Stepfamily|stepparent]] relationship, three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants:
*'''''Dialectics of emotional distance-closeness''''' - While many stepchildren expressed feelings of emotional distance, the participants had varying reasons for keeping the distance. Some participants who still had a positive relationship with their nonresidential parent kept an emotional distance from their stepparent as an act of loyalty that they felt toward their nonresidential parent. Other participants equated emotional distance to the fact that they had little in common with their stepparent. However, many participants expressed feeling some closeness with a stepparent while maintaining an amount of emotional distance. Participants reported that they upheld a relationship with the stepparent that contained honesty, respect, and trust, yet they kept an emotional distance by continuing to address the stepparent by his/her first name, or simply claiming that each individual was very different from the other, causing tension in an effort to promote emotional closeness.
*'''''Stepparent status''''' - Many of the stepchildren in the study also experienced a dialectical tension between desiring for the family authority position to be designated to their one residential parent along with a desire for both the residential parent and the stepparent to share parenting authority. Many participants felt that legitimating their stepparent as a parent would result in the formation of closeness.
*'''''Expression''''' - The participants expressed a desire for open communication with their stepparent, while at the same time, expressing resistance to openness and instead favoring a more careful form of communication due to the fact that the participants often sensed a lack of familiarity with their stepparent.

In another study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braithwaite | first1 = D. O. | last2 = Toller | first2 = P. W. | last3 = Daas | first3 = K. L. | last4 = Durham | first4 = W. T. | last5 = Jones | first5 = A. C. | year = 2008 | title = Centered but not Caught in the Middle: Stepchildren's Perceptions of Dialectical Contradictions in the Communication of Co-Parents | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 33–55 | doi = 10.1080/00909880701799337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents. The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while, at the same time, they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents. The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy-connection dialectic; stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents. However, these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication, particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another. While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening, at the same time, they also wanted to be protected, resulting in a second dialectic of control-restraint. Through this study, the researchers believe that openness-closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships.

One study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braithwaite | first1 = D. | last2 = Baxter | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = "You're My Parent but You're Not": Dialectical Tensions in Stepchildren's Perceptions About Communicating with the Nonresidential Parent | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 30–48 | doi = 10.1080/00909880500420200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on the relationship and communication between college-aged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents, found two underlying contradictions: parenting and not parenting, and openness and closeness. Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were. Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents, they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parent's lack of familiarity with the child's everyday life.

== Theory applications ==

=== End of life care ===
Relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care, specifically [[end-of-life care]], providing a system for [[caregiver]] communication that contains tensions and challenges. The quality of the end-of-life journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oetzel|first=John|last2=Simpson|first2=Mary|date=April 2015|title=Managing Communication Tensions and Challenges During the End-of-Life Journey: Perspectives of Māori Kaumātua and Their Whānau.|journal=Health Communication|volume=30|issue=4|pages=350–360|doi=10.1080/10410236.2013.861306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patients/family members during the process of end-of-life care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amati | first1 = R | last2 = Hannawa | first2 = A | year = 2014 | title = Relational Dialectics Theory: Disentangling Physician-Perceived Tensions of End-of-Life Communication | url = | journal = Health Communication | volume = 29 | issue = 10| pages = 962–973 | doi=10.1080/10410236.2013.815533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When making choices about end-of-life medical care, family members, friends, or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=U.K.|last2=Beyth|first2=R.J.|year=2008|title=Voices of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic surrogates on the burdens of end-of-life decision making|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=23|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0487-7|pages=267–274|pmc=2359470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-makers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decision-making.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toller|first=Paige|year=2009|title=Grieving Together and Apart: Bereaved Parents' Contradictions of Marital Interaction|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family members in charge of making end-of-life decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go; recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep a loved one alive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ohs | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Trees | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Gibson | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Holding On and Letting Go: Making Sense of End-of-Life Care Decisions in Families | url = | journal = Southern Communication Journal | volume = 80 | issue = 5| pages = 353–364 | doi = 10.1080/1041794X.2015.1081979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the end-of-life journey, it was found that despite the culture's focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony, four communication tensions existed between caregivers (family and friends) and patients: autonomy and connection, conflict and connection, isolation and connection, and balancing the needs of self and other.

==== Grief ====
The human [[Grief|grieving]] process is marked by relational dialectics. After the death of a child, bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their child's permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness, where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family, yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One study,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses, found two discursive contradictions: family members' wishes vs. patient's wishes, and emotionality vs. [[rationality]]. Through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one, researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members, patients, and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go. Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of a loved one, and with that, experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality.

Dialectical [[contradiction]]s have also been found among parents who have lost a child. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toller | first1 = P. W. | year = 2005 | title = Negotiation of Dialectical Contradictions by Parents who have Experienced the Death of a Child | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 46–66 | doi = 10.1080/0090988042000318512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child: openness-closeness, and presence-absence. Parents experienced openness-closeness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss, yet they perceived the outcome as risky, especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on. Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation. When dealing with the presence-absence dialectic, bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child, and the physical absence of the child. Participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child, the physical absence of the child was deeply felt. However, when people chose to remember the deceased child, the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child.

'''&lt;big&gt;Understanding Autistic Communication&lt;/big&gt;'''

As relational dialects’ aim is to analyse competence during interaction, it can suggest an approach to researching on communication competence among people which are with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]]. Applying relational dialects theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction. This approach&lt;ref&gt;Best, S. A. (2012). ''Using relational dialectics theory to better understand autistic communication competence.'' &lt;/ref&gt; can delve into how social contexts, expectations, and roles contribute to the autistics’ competent communication. The investigation of dialects includes integration-separation, expression-privacy, and stability-change enhance the understanding of the communication between people with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].

==Dialogue==

[[Dialogue]] is typically a conversation between two or more people. These conversations are what constitute relationships, as communication is the very foundation of any relationship. According to Cools, "the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1) the self and the other situated in contradictory forces, 2) unfinalizability, 3) the chronotope and the carnivalesque, and 4) heteroglossia and utterance".&lt;ref&gt;Cools, C. (2011). Relational dialectics in intercultural couples' relationships. Kult tuurienvälisten parisuhteiden relationaalinen dialektiikka&lt;/ref&gt; Similarity, in dialogue the following components are the most important: constitutive dialogue, utterance chains, dialectical flux, aesthetic moment, and critical sensibility.

''''Constitutive dialogue''''

While some theorists, along with Baxter, may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship, examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a relationship instead. According to Baxter, "a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines, or constructs, the social world, including our selves and our personal relationships. From a constitutive perspective, then, persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication; instead, communication constitutes these phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | year = 2004 | title = Relationships as dialogues | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6811.2004.00068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; When initial researchers studied relationships, they found that similarities, backgrounds, and interests are usually what hold people together while self-disclosure is the root of these components. Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

''''Utterance chains''''

To understand utterance chains, we must know that an [[utterance]] is what a person says in one turn of a conversation. When utterances are "linked to competing discourses", they are considered utterance chains. Baxter believes that there are "four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; These are: cultural ideologies, relational history, non-yet spoken response of partner or utterance, and normative evaluation of third party to utterance. Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance, we must also understand the discourse. She posits "in the broadest sense, a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a group's members and which makes our talk sensical. for example in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as, 'I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person'".&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A., &amp; Braithwaite, D. O. (2008). Relational dialectics theory. Engaging theories in interpersonal communication, 349-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Dialectical flux''''

A dialectical flux is "the unpredictable, unfinalizable, indeterminate nature of personal relationships".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions. Spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity. Spiraling inversion is generally a no-win situation; a struggle between two different thought processes. For example, if you were to do something your parents did not approve of, you could lie about it, but your parents might yell at you for lying. And on the other hand, you could tell them upfront, and they could be completely quiet in shock. Segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation. For example, if you were working at your father's shop as a part-time job, he would be considered your father AND your boss. This could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles.

''''Aesthetic moment''''

Aesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue. There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue. It is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships, such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows, but these moments can be experienced by anyone.

''''Critical sensibility''''

According to Griffin, critical sensibility is "an obligation to critique dominant voices, especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints; a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; This means that both sides of a dialogue are equal to one another. No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other, and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering. This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in Utterance Chains.

==Ethics==

When communicating, we must understand that morals do not apply for all people. Sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication, but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to. There are several times where most people would justify a "white lie", or a lie that causes no harm. For instance, if your mother was in the hospital, you could tell her she still looked beautiful, even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better. Other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called "consequential ethics".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; According to Sissela Bok, "lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations". Bok believes in the "principle of veracity" which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

== Critiques ==
According to theorist Leslie Baxter, there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | year = 2004 | title = A Tale of Two Voices: Relational Dialectics Theory | url = | journal = Journal of Family Communication | volume = 4 | issue = 3/4| pages = 181–192 | doi = 10.1207/s15327698jfc0403&amp;4_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter claims that her work has been "too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties", and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties. Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between "two voices". Lastly, Baxter has stated that future research should focus on discourse through time, such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over a longer period of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8287">The '''Sippewissett Salt Marsh''' is located along the lower eastern [[Buzzards Bay]] shoreline of [[Cape Cod]], about 5 miles north of [[Woods Hole]] and 1 mile southwest of West [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]], in the United States. The marsh has two regions, the Great Sippewisset Marsh to the north and Little Sippewisset Marsh to the south, separated from each other by a narrow tongue of land (Saconesset Hills). The marsh extends into an [[estuary]] in which the [[intertidal zone]] provides a dynamic environment that supports a diverse ecology, including threatened and endangered species such as the roseate tern (''[[Sterna dougallii]]'').&lt;ref name="United State Fish and Wildlife Service"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|title=Northeast Coastal Areas Study Significant Coastal Habitats (Sippewisset Marshes)|journal=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Conservation Library|url=http://library.fws.gov/pubs5/necas/web_link/35_sippewisset.htm|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecology of the salt marsh is based in and supported by the [[microbial mats]] which cover the ground of the marsh.

==Description==
[[File:Sippewissett Marsh.png|thumb|The Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh]]
The Sippewissett Salt Marsh houses a diverse, laminated intertidal [[microbial mat]] around 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The mat is characterized by regular influx of sea water, high amounts of sulfide and iron, and the production of methane. The mat contains four or five distinctly colored layers. The color of each layer can be attributed to the microbial community composition and the biogeochemical processes they perform at each of the layers. The mats are often coated by green macro- and microalgae that adhere to the surface.&lt;ref name=Teal/&gt; The top, green-brown layer is composed of [[cyanobacteria]] and [[diatom]] species. A blue-green intermediate layer is formed by ''[[Oscillatoria]]'' species. [[Purple sulfur bacteria]] are found in the pink central layer. Below the pink layer, an orange-black layer is formed predominately by a single species of purple sulfur bacteria, ''Thiocapsa pfennigii,'' and [[spirochetes]]. The thin, bottom layer is made up of [[green sulfur bacteria]] belonging to the ''Prosthecochloris'' genus, though this layer is not always present. Below the mat is iron sulfide-rich sediments and remnants of decaying mats.&lt;ref name=nicholson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0378-1097(87)90021-8 |title=Structure of a microbiol mat at Great Sippewissett Marsh, Cape Cod, Massachusetts |year=1987 |last1=Nicholson |first1=J |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Green layer===
The top 1&amp;nbsp;mm of the green layer is often gold due to the dominant cyanobacteria and diatom species.  Specific cyanobacteria identified are ''[[Lyngbya]]'', a sheeted cyanobacterium, and ''[[Nostoc]]'' and ''Phormidium'', which are filamentous cyanobacteria, and ''Spirulina'' spp. Diatom species identified include ''Navicula''. Below this top gold layer extends 5&amp;nbsp;mm and is dominated by ''[[Lyngbya]]'' and ''[[Oscillatoria]]'' species&lt;ref name=Buckley&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01517.x |title=Vertical distribution of methane metabolism in microbial mats of the Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh |year=2008 |last1=Buckley |first1=Daniel H. |last2=Baumgartner |first2=Laura K. |last3=Visscher |first3=Pieter T. |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=967–77 |pmid=18218028}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The green layer is also composed of green sulfur bacteria which oxidize sulfur during their growth and are strict photolithotrophs.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Pink layer===
The pink layer extends 3&amp;nbsp;mm below the green layer. The color is due to the presence of carotinoids which are the primary pigments of the phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria.&lt;ref name="Woods Hole"&gt;{{cite web |first=Woods |last=Hole |title=Microbial Diversity Course |url=http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~schauder/mats/microbial_mats.html |year=1997 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128071902/http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~schauder/mats/microbial_mats.html |archivedate=28 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amoebobacter, Thiocapsa, Chromatium,'' and ''Thiocystis'' are among the species of purple sulfur bacteria identified.&lt;ref name=nicholson/&gt; Purple sulfur bacteria can use a number of different electron donors for their anaerobic phototrophic growth, including: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen.  Their diverse use of many electron donors makes this layer stand out in the microbial mat community.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Black layer===
The bottom layer makes up the lower 2&amp;nbsp;mm of the mat before the depth drops below the [[chemocline]]. The black color is due to the high amounts of iron sulfide generated by the green sulfur-reducing bacteria.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; The layer consists mostly of green sulfur bacteria belonging to the ''Prosthecochloris'' genus, which are a small group of [[prosthecate bacteria]] containing many knobby projections.&lt;ref name=nicholson/&gt; Organisms in this layer decompose organic matter formed by the upper layers, thus recycling the matter.&lt;ref name="Woods Hole"/&gt;

===Gray layer===
The thin, bottommost layer lies below the chemocline and contains fewer organisms than the slightly thicker black layer. The gray color is due to the presence of pyrite. Here, the empty shells of diatoms can be found. Microbial species here are dominated by methylotrophic methanogens which generate the methane observed in the salt marsh. This layer is not active year round; the organisms are largely dormant in the winter.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;

==Metabolism==
The metabolism of the organisms throughout each layer of the microbial mats are tightly coupled to each other and play important roles in providing nutrients for the plants and animals that live in the marsh. The cyanobacteria and diatom algae present in the mat are [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[photoautotrophs]] whose energy is derived from the light with oxygen as the [[electron acceptor]] and use hydrogen gas and iron as [[electron donors]].

Purple sulfur bacteria are [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] or [[microaerophilic]] photoautotrophs, and use hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen as electron donors.

Spirochaetes in the orange-black layer are [[chemoheterotrophic]] and use iron as an electron donor.&lt;ref name=Zaar&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12610722 |year=2003 |last1=Zaar |first1=A |last2=Fuchs |first2=G |last3=Golecki |first3=JR |last4=Overmann |first4=J |title=A new purple sulfur bacterium isolated from a littoral microbial mat, ''Thiorhodococcus drewsii'' sp. nov |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=174–83 |doi=10.1007/s00203-002-0514-3 |journal=Archives of Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Sippewissett Salt Marsh has served as a hallmark for studies done on estuarine environments. Scientists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]],
the Boston University Marine Program, and the Marine Biological Laboratory have been studying Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh extensively since 1970 to gain a better understanding of microbial diversity and the effects they have on geochemical cycling and nutrient cycling for other organisms.&lt;ref name=Teal&gt;{{cite book |last=Teal |first=J.M. |title=The Ecology of Regularly Flooded Salt Marshes of New England: A Community Profile |series=Biological Reports |year=1986 |volume=85 |issue=7.4 |url=http://library.fws.gov/BiologicalReports/85_7.4.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2012 |oclc=13823654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sippewissett salt marsh is of particular importance for research, as it is one of the few generally undisturbed salt marshes in New England.

A '''solar chimney'''{{snd}} often referred to as a '''thermal chimney'''{{snd}} is a way of improving the natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] of [[building]]s by using [[convection]] of [[air]] heated by [[passive solar]] [[energy]]. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural [[Natural ventilation#Stack driven ventilation|stack ventilation]] through a building.

The [[Solar power|solar]] [[chimney]] has been in use for centuries, particularly in the [[Middle east]] and [[Near East]] by the [[Persian people|Persians]], as well as in [[Europe]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Description==
In its simplest form, the solar chimney consists of a black-painted [[chimney]]. During the day solar energy heats the chimney and the air within it, creating an [[updraft]] of air in the chimney. The [[suction]] created at the chimney's base can be used to ventilate and cool the building below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Solar powered Air Conditioning | url = http://www.sxlist.com/techref/other/spac.htm#Vent | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most parts of the world it is easier to harness [[wind power]] for such ventilation as with a [[windcatcher]], but on hot windless days a Solar chimney can provide ventilation where otherwise there would be none.

There are however a number of solar chimney variations. The basic design elements of a solar chimney are:

* The solar collector area: This can be located in the top part of the chimney or can include the entire shaft. The orientation, type of glazing, insulation and thermal properties of this element are crucial for harnessing, retaining and utilizing solar gains.
* The main ventilation shaft: The location, height, cross section and the thermal properties of this structure are also very important.
* The inlet and outlet air apertures: The sizes, location as well as aerodynamic aspects of these elements are also significant.

A [[principle]] has been proposed for [[solar power]] generation, using a large [[greenhouse]] at the base rather than relying solely on heating the chimney itself. (For further information on this issue, see [[Solar updraft tower]].)

Solar chimneys are painted black so that they absorb the sun's heat more effectively. When the air inside the chimney is heated, it rises and pulls cold air out from under the ground via the heat exchange tubes.

== Solar chimney and [[sustainable architecture]] ==
[[File:solarchimney.svg|right|thumb|268px|This solar chimney draws air through a geothermal heat exchange to provide passive home cooling.&lt;ref&gt;"A Theory of Power" {{ISBN|0-595-33030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vail | first = Jeff | title =  Passive Solar &amp; Independence | date = 2005-06-28 | url = http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/06/passive-solar-independence.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Solar chimneys, also called heat chimneys or heat stacks, can also be used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.

A solar chimney can serve many purposes.  Direct gain warms air inside the chimney causing it to rise out the top and drawing air in from the bottom. This drawing of air can be used to ventilate a home or office, to draw air through a geothermal heat exchange, or to ventilate only a specific area such as a composting toilet.

Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by [[convection]] and escape to the outside. At the same time cooler air can be drawn in through vents at the lower level.  Trees may be planted on that side of the building to provide shade for cooler outside air.

This natural ventilation process can be augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has to be higher than the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a [[glazing in construction|glazed]] surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface is more important than the diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the [[prevailing wind]].

To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through [[Earth cooling tubes|underground ducts]] before it is allowed to enter the building. The solar chimney can be improved by integrating it with a [[trombe wall]]. The added advantage of this design is that the system may be reversed during the cold season, providing solar heating instead.

A variation of the solar chimney concept is the solar [[attic]]. In a hot sunny climate the attic space is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads to the need for increased [[air conditioning]]. By integrating the attic space with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murti Nugroho | first = Agung | author2=Mohd Hamdan bin Ahmad |author3=Makmal Sain Bangunan  | title = Possibility to Use Solar Induced Ventilation Strategies in Tropical Conditions by Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulation | url = http://eprints.utm.my/2315/1/17-Appendix_B.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a solar chimney may benefit natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies of buildings thus help reduce energy use, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and pollution in general. Potential benefits regarding natural ventilation and use of solar chimneys are:

[[Image:Solar chimney TAS model.jpg|thumb|300px|CAD (TAS) Solar Chimney model]]
* improved ventilation rates on still, hot days
* reduced reliance on wind and wind driven ventilation
* improved control of air flow through a building
* greater choice of air intake (i.e. leeward side of building)
* improved air quality and reduced noise levels in urban areas
* increased night time ventilation rates
* ventilation of narrow, small spaces with minimal exposure to external elements

Potential benefits regarding passive cooling may include:

* improved passive cooling during warm season (mostly on still, hot days)
* improved night cooling rates
* enhanced performance of thermal mass (cooling, cool storage)
* improved thermal comfort (improved air flow control, reduced draughts)

==Precedent Study: The Environmental Building==
The [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) office building in Garston, Watford, United Kingdom, incorporates solar-assisted passive ventilation stacks as part of its ventilation strategy.

Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim to reduce energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions without the use of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.

The building utilizes five vertical shafts as an integral part of the ventilation and cooling strategy. The main components of these stacks are a south facing glass-block wall, thermal mass walls and stainless steel round exhausts rising a few meters above roof level. The chimneys are connected to the curved hollow concrete floor slabs which are cooled via night ventilation. Pipes embedded in the floor can provide additional cooling utilizing groundwater.

On warm windy days air is drawn in through passages in the curved hollow concrete floor slabs. Stack ventilation naturally rising out through the stainless steel chimneys enhances the air flow through the building. The movement of air across the chimney tops enhances the stack effect.
During warm, still days, the building relies mostly on the stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of the building. Low-energy fans in the tops of the stacks can also be used to improve airflow.

Overnight, control systems enable ventilation paths through the hollow concrete slab removing the heat stored during the day, which then remains cold for the following day. The exposed curved ceiling gives more surface area than a flat ceiling would, acting as a [[heat sink]], again providing summer cooling.
Research based on actual performance measurements of the passive stacks found that they enhanced the cooling ventilation of the space during warm and still days and may also have the potential to assist night-time cooling due to their thermally massive structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ní Riain | first = C. | author2=M.

==Passive down-draft cool tower==
[[Image:Zion Visitors Center Cool Tower.PNG|thumb|right|245px|Cool tower at Zion National Park's Visitor Center provides cool air]]
A technology closely related to the solar chimney is the evaporative down-draft cooltower. In areas with a hot, arid climate this approach may contribute to a sustainable way to provide [[air conditioning]] for buildings.

The principle is to allow water to evaporate at the top of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. [[Evaporation]] cools the incoming air, causing a [[downdraft]] of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Torcellini | first = Paul A. | author2=Ron Judkoff |author3=Sheila J.

The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL).

The principle of the downdraft cooltower has been proposed for solar power generation as well. (See [[Energy tower (downdraft)|Energy tower]] for more information.)

Evaporation of moisture from the pads on top of the Toguna buildings built by the Dogon people of Mali, Africa contribute to the coolness felt by the men who rest underneath. The women's buildings on the outskirts of town are functional as more conventional solar chimneys.

'''''Star Walk''''' is an application developed for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] by [[Vito Technology]] presented in the mobile software market since 2001.

The objective of ''Star Walk'' is to help [[astronomy]] amateurs, students and professionals locate and identify over 200,000 stars, [[planets]], [[constellations]] and [[satellites]] in the night sky. Since its release ''Star Walk'' has been downloaded more than 5 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 of Apple's Favorite Apps|url=http://money.cnn.com/gallery/magazines/fortune/2013/04/08/17-of-apples-favorite-apps.fortune/9.html|publisher=Money.cnn.com|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
[[File:StarWalk-iPad-screenshot.png|left|upright|thumb|300px|''Time Machine'' will help users explore the map of the night sky of tomorrow or years ago.]]

The application allows users to explore [[astronomical objects]] in real time, watch moon phases, [[meteor showers]], [[iridium flares]], see daily [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]] times, elevation angle, and day length. Most of the objects in the application are complemented with extensive information about them.

''Star Walk'' shows users a list of upcoming celestial events which they can add to the calendar and set a reminder for.

Also, the application is equipped with time machine feature which gives an opportunity to explore the map of the night sky in the past and future.
Besides, ''Star Walk'' uses iOS device camera for [[augmented reality]] feature. It combines the image data from camera with the star map to give the user a real time view of [[celestial objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jason|title=iPad App Review Marathon Live (Part 2)|url=https://gizmodo.com/5509335/ipad-app-review-marathon-live-part-2|publisher=Gizmodo.com|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''style''' is a set of linguistic variants with specific [[social]] meanings. In this context, social meanings can include group membership, personal attributes, or beliefs. [[Variation (linguistics)|Linguistic variation]] is at the heart of the concept of linguistic style—without variation there is no basis for distinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur [[Syntax|syntactically]], [[Lexicon|lexically]], and [[Phonology|phonologically]].

Many approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of [[indexicality]], indexical order, stance-taking, and [[language ideology|linguistic ideology]]. Note that a style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use different styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style.

==Origins==
[[William Labov]] first introduced the concept of style in the context of sociolinguistics in the 1960s, though he did not explicitly define the term.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;Labov, W. (1966). The social stratification of English in New York City.[Washington]: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov primarily studied individual linguistic variables, and how they were associated with various social groups (e.g. social classes). He summed up his ideas about style in five principles:&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1984. "Field Methods of the Project in Linguistic Change and Variation." In John Baugh and Joel Sherzer, eds., Language in Use, Prentice-Hall: 28-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
;"There are no single style speakers." : [[#Style-shifting|Style-shifting]] occurs in all speakers to a different degree; interlocutors regularly and consistently change their linguistic forms according to context.
;"Styles can be ranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech." : Style-shifting correlates strongly with the amount of attention paid to speech. According to studies conducted by Labov, this was one of the single most important factors that determined whether or not an interlocutor would make a style-shift.
;"The vernacular, in which the minimum attention is paid to speech, provides the most systematic data for linguistic analysis." : Labov characterized the vernacular as the original base mode of speech, learned at a very young age, on which more complex styles build later in life. This "basic" style has the least variation, and provides the most general account of the style of a given group.
;"Any systematic observation of a speaker defines a formal context where more than the minimum attention is paid to speech." : In other words, even formal face-to-face interviews severely limit a speaker’s use of their vernacular style. An interlocutor’s vernacular style is most likely displayed if they do not perceive outside observers, and are not paying immediate attention to their own speech.
;"Face-to-face interviews are the only means of obtaining the volume and quality of recorded speech that is needed for quantitative analysis." : Quantitative analysis requires the kind of data that must be obtained in a very obvious, formal way.

Labov’s work primarily attempted to linked linguistic variants as a function of formality (a proxy for attention to speech) to specific social groups. In his study of /r/-variation in New York Department stores, he observed that those with a lower social class are less likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in words like ''fourth'' and ''floor'', while those with a higher social class are more likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in their less careful speech. However, once forced to pay attention to language, they style-shift in a way indicative of their social aspirations. That is, those with a middle social class often alter their pronunciation of /r/ in a way that is generally indicative of a higher social standing, while those with a lower or higher social class more or less maintain their original pronunciation (presumably because they were either happy with their current position in the social hierarchy or resigned to it).&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William.. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern approaches==

===Indexical order===
[[Penelope Eckert|Penny Eckert's]]&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;Eckert, Penelope. Variation and the indexical field. Journal of Sociolinguistics, 2008, 12: 453–476.&lt;/ref&gt; characterization of style as related to indexicality marked the beginning of a new approach to linguistic style. She builds on [[Michael Silverstein|Michael Silverstein's]] notion of [[Indexicality|indexical]] order: the notion that linguistic variables index a social group, which by association leads to the indexing of certain traits stereotypically associated with members of that group.  For example, in New York in the 1960s, a study by Labov&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; showed that the clear articulation of postvocalic [r] in words like "fourth" and "floor" indexed a higher class (in New York), whereas the absence of postvocalic [r] indexed a lower class.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; However, the presence of lack of postvocalic [r] can also function as a higher order indexical that points indirectly to traits stereotypically associated with members of the upper or lower class.  In this way, not articulating the [r] in the word "fourth" could index, for example, a lack of education (the trait) in addition to a lower social class (the group). According to this theory, any linguistic variable has its own indexical field spanning any number of potential meanings; the meanings actually associated with the variable are determined by social context and the style in which the variable is being used.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; These indexical fields are fluid and often change depending on their usage in different contexts or in combination with other variables. This view of style revolves around variation, and interpretation of variation as a purely indexical system built from [[Ideology|ideological]] connections.

===Ideology===
In [[Judith Irvine]]'s conception of style she emphasizes the fact that a style is defined only within a social framework.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;[[Judith Irvine|Irvine, Judith]]. Style as distinctiveness: The culture and ideology of linguistic differentiation. In Penelope Eckert and John Rickford (eds.) Style and Sociolinguistic Variation. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2001, 21–43.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant and the social meanings it indexes are not inherently linked, rather, the social meanings exist as ideologically mediated interpretations made by members of the social framework. She highlights the fact that social meanings such as group membership mean nothing without an [[ideology]] to interpret them.

[[Mary Bucholtz|Mary Bucholtz's]] approach to style also relies heavily on ideology. She defines style as "a unidimensional continuum between vernacular and standard that varies based on the degree of speaker self-monitoring in a given speech context".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~tylers/notes/emotion/Bucholtz_2009_reading_notes_Schnoebelen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum depends on the ideology of the speaker, for they self-monitor depending on their ideologies concerning particular words. Bucholtz explains the ideology of gendered slang, in particular, the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] slang for "dude", guey. Guey indexes a stance of cool solidarity, and indirectly, [masculinity]. Ochs's framework for stance dictates that stances are ideologically connected with social groups. Bucholtz argues that ideology connects the stylistic feature of using guey with particular groups of people based on age, gender (male), and race. She also defines the concept of stylization as a set of deviations from the style one would expect from a situation according to the ideology of the style and how it matches up to the situation at hand. This leads to the [[indexicality|indexing]] of groups with which the style is associated, and thus simplifies the indexical field at hand.

===Stance-taking===
Other theories on style often incorporate the role of stance-taking. These theories maintain that style is best viewed as consisting of smaller, more variable units known as stances. In this view, a stance is essentially a form of contextualization; it indicates the position of an interlocutor with respect to a particular utterance, conversation or other interlocutors.&lt;ref name="Johnstone"&gt;Johnstone, Barbara. "Stance, Style, and the Linguistic Individual" Sociolinguistic Perspectives on Stance,. Ed. Alexandra Jaffe. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An interlocutor's use of language could imply, for instance,  that they feel a certain way about an issue at hand, or that they do not care for the subject, or the people around them; these positions with respect to the context are different stances.

According to stance theory, a given interlocutor uses certain variations among linguistic variables to take a stance or stances in an interaction. The set of stances interlocutors tend to repeat or use the most often in certain contexts (or in general) comprise their style. [[File:Stances.png|thumb|400px|Robert Podesva's depiction of the indexical relationships between linguistic resources, acts or activities, stance and style.]] This approach focuses more on interaction and reaction in a linguistic context, rather than a static identity or social group. Linguistic variables do not index specific social groups by themselves, but instead combine with other linguistic variables to index various stances and styles, which are in turn associated with social groups.&lt;ref name="Kiesling"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. A variable, a style, a stance: Word-final -er and ethnicity in Australian English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, Sam. 2011. Personal style and epistemic stance in classroom discussion. Language and Literature 20(3). 207-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;  Kiesling writes:

{{cquote|In this view, personal styles are composed of a set, or repertoire, of stances, and a way of speaking represents not simply a personal style but a stance that a person tends to adopt repeatedly over time ... Because some stances are more favored by one group than another, this gives the appearance that a linguistic item directly indexes ...  that group, where in actuality it also, or primarily, indexes a stance … &lt;ref name=Kiesling/&gt;}}

In this model of linguistic variation, stances are an important middle step between linguistic variables and a style or characteristic social group.

==Emergence of new styles==

===Performative creation of new styles===
The [[Performativity|performative]] creation of style is the result of a desire to project a certain social image or [[#Style and stance|stance]]. [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|Interlocutors]] who wish to present in a certain manner may consciously alter their linguistic style to affect how they appear to others. An example of this performative style is exemplified by non-linguistic situations. In one study, Eckert interviewed several female students at [[Palo Alto High School]] in California. "New-wave" teens who wished to be distinctive adapted a more rebellious fashion style, wearing mostly dark clothes and pegged jeans, whereas popular, "[[preppy]]" girls tended towards light pastel colors and straight designer jeans.  However, a couple girls wished to portray themselves as unique without losing their popular [[Conformity|conformist]] [[Social identity theory|social identity]]. The table below compares resulting styles:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| eye makeup!! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| general color scheme !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| pants
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "New-wave" girls|| dark/black || black || black, pegged
|-
| style="text-align:left;"|  "Preppy" girls|| light/none || pastels || blue designer straight-cut
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "Preppy but unique" girls || light/none || pastels || blue, pegged
|}

As Eckert demonstrates, the "preppy" girls who wished to maintain a slightly distinctive style combined certain aspects of the "preppy" style with the "new-wave" style. They maintained their color choices and shied away from dark eye-makeup—but wore blue pegged jeans instead of the standard designer jeans of their group. This is because they perceive that the eye makeup indexes an "adult" or "slutty" characteristic, while the all-black color scheme is "scary".

In the same way, interlocutors often choose to performatively create their own linguistic style to suit the self-image they desire. In a [[#Gay styles|case study conducted by Podesva]], he studies the style of a gay lawyer, who combines certain aspects of common professional and gay linguistic features to create his own style, indexing both a "professional lawyer" characteristic and a unique "gay" characteristic with his speech.

===Nonperformative emergence of new styles===
Styles are not necessarily consciously created; there are a number of processes that contribute to the construction of meaning for both individual speech variants and styles. Obviously, individual variants can be adopted by multiple styles. When a variant is newly adopted by a style, it changes both the perception of the variant and the perception of the style. In the Eckertian view, a person's linguistic style identifies their position in an indexical field of social meanings. These social meanings are created by a continual analysis and interpretation of the linguistic variants that are observed based on who uses them.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

==Style-shifting==
Style shifting refers to a single speaker changing style in response to context. As noted by Eckert and Rickford,&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-59789-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eckert, Penelope |author2=Rickford, John |title=Style and sociolinguistic variation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-521-59789-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in sociolinguistic literature terms style and '''register''' sometimes have been used interchangeably. Also, various connotations of style are a subject of study in [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]].

Style-shifting is a manifestation of intraspeaker (within-speaker) variation, in contrast with interspeaker (between-speakers) variation. It is a voluntary act which an individual effects in order to respond to or initiate changes in sociolinguistic situation (e.g., interlocutor-related, setting-related, topic-related).

[[William Labov]], while conducting [[Sociolinguistics#Traditional sociolinguistic interview|sociolinguistic interviews]], designated two types of spoken style, casual and formal, and three types of reading style (a reading passage, a word list, and a [[minimal pair]] list). Analysing style-shifting Labov postulated that "styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech" (1972, as quoted in&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Milroy, Lesley |author2=Gordon, John |title=Sociolinguistics: Method and Interpretation |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-631-22225-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), casual style requiring the least amount of conscious self-monitoring. Such style-shifting is often referred to as responsive (produced in response to normative pressures).&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"/&gt;

In recent developments of stylistic variation analysis scholars such as [[Allan Bell (Sociolinguist)|Allan Bell]], [[Barbara Johnstone]], Natalie Schilling-Estes have been focusing on initiative dimension of style-shifting, which occurs when speakers proactively choose among various linguistic resources (e.g. dialectal, archaic or [[vernacular]] forms) in order to present themselves in a specific way. In initiative style-shifting speakers actively engage in  social practices to construct social meaning.

There have been a large number of suggested motivations for this phenomenon:
;Attention to speech model : In the attention to speech model it is proposed that the style a speaker uses is dependent on how much attention the speaker is paying to their own speech, which in turn is dependent on the formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Labov1972a"&gt;Labov, William. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labov1972b"&gt;Labov, William.. Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society,1972, 1.97-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each speaker has one most natural style, which is defined as the style the speaker uses when paying the least attention (i.e. in the most casual situations). Criticisms of this model include that it is difficult to quantify attention paid to speech&lt;ref name="Kies"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. 1998. Men’s identities and sociolinguistic variation: The case of fraternity men. Journal of Sociolinguistics 2/1.69-99&lt;/ref&gt; and the model suggests that a speaker has only one style for a given level of formality.&lt;ref name="Hindle"&gt;Hindle, D. The social and situational conditioning of phonetic variation. Dissertation. University of Pennsylvania, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Communication accommodation theory : Communication accommodation theory (CAT) seeks to explain style-shifting in terms of two processes: convergence, in which the speaker attempts to shift their speech to match that of the interlocuter to gain social approval, and divergence, in which the speaker attempts to distance themselves from the interlocuter by shifting their speech away from that of the interlocuter.&lt;ref name="Schilling-Este"&gt;Kiesling, S. F., and Schilling-Estes, N. Language Style as Identity Construction: A Footing and Framing Approach. Poster presented at NWAVE 27, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Two specific shortcomings of this basic form of CAT include its inability to explain situations in which convergence occurs when the motivation is clearly not social approval (e.g. in arguments)&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, D., Mortimer, L., Grebel, M. Verbal aggressive behavior in delinquent boys. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 1968 73.454-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., and Kendon, A. The experimental analysis of social performance. Advances in experimental social psychology, Berkowitz, L. (ed.), 1967 vol. 3, 55-98. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that non-convergent speech is often used to maintain social distance in asymmetric relationships (e.g. employer-employee).&lt;ref&gt;Montepare, J. M., and Vega, C. Women’s vocal reactions to intimate and casual male friends. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 1988 14.103-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Audience design model : The audience design model is very similar to communication accommodation theory with an added component: the audience design model proposes the existence of nonpresent reference groups, with which a speaker may converge or diverge.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, Allan. Language style as audience design. Language in Society, 1984 13.145-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speakers constantly negotiating their relationship, not only with the audience, but also with other nonpresent people or groups that come up in the discourse.&lt;ref name=Schilling-Este/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BellJohnson"&gt;Bell, Allan, and Johnson, Gary. Towards a sociolinguistics of style. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.1: A Selection of Papers from NWAVE, 1997, 25. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Style-shifting as an act of identity: Style shifting can be a creative process, in which speakers shape their speech to associate or disassociate themselves with specific social groups. Furthermore, a speaker does not have an underlying style. Rather, the casual speech style that some sociolinguists consider fundamental is no more fundamental than any other style.&lt;ref name="LePage"&gt;LePage, R.B., and Andrée Tabouret-Keller. Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press,1985&lt;/ref&gt;
;Footing and framing model : A footing is a role that a speaker occupies and may be described as follows:{{Quote| &lt;br&gt;"[footings] may change many times during the course of a single interaction, and speakers often balance a number of roles simultaneously, since footing exist on a number of different levels, from the personal interactional (e.g. the role of `friend') to the institutional (e.g. `CEO of a corporation') to the sociocultural (e.g. `Native American male')."&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;}}By style shifting speakers are able to cast themselves in different footings. Also central to this model is the frame of the discourse, which is the feeling of the interactants about what kind of interaction is occurring (e.g. formal interview, casual conversation, political discussion, etc.). Different frames are being continuously foregrounded and backgrounded relative to one another throughout the discourse. The footings that speakers adopt through style-shifting are dependent on which frames are most prominent at any given time.&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving, Forms of talk. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style matching==
Style matching is defined as the matching of behaviors between a speaker and an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;Niederhoffer, Kate G. Pennebaker, James W. Linguistic Style Matching in Social Interaction. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, Vol.21No.4,December 2002. 337-360 {{doi|10.1177/026192702237953}} 2002 Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The premise of the theory is that individuals have the ability to strategically negotiate the social distance between themselves and their interaction partners.  This can be done linguistically, [[paralinguistic]]ally, and non-verbally, for example, by varying speech style, rate, pitch, and [[gaze]].

One theory behind linguistic style matching suggests that the words one speaker uses prime the listener to respond in a specific way. In this fashion, an interlocutor is influenced by her partner’s language at the word level in natural conversation in the same way that one’s non-verbal behavior can be influenced by another’s movement.

Additionally, Kate G. Niederhoffer&lt;ref name=N/&gt; proposes a coordination-engagement hypothesis, which suggests that the degree of engagement should be predictive of both linguistic and nonverbal coordination. There exists an interactional complexity whereby people can converge on some communicative features to meet social needs, but diverge on others for identity management. For example, one can diverge in accent but converge in [[lexical diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Fuller (1996). When cultural maintenance means linguistic convergence: Pennsylvania German evidence for the Matrix Language Turnover hypothesis. Language in Society, 25 , pp 493-514 {{doi|10.1017/S0047404500020790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals in two-person interactions exhibit linguistic style matching on both the conversational level and on a turn-by-turn level.&lt;ref name=N/&gt; This coordinated use of language occurs at a remarkably basic level (e.g., classes of words) and appears to occur independently of the perceived quality of an interaction, the length of the interaction, whether the interaction is face-to-face or on an Internet-like chat, etc.  Socially, two people appear to fall into this coordinated way of interacting almost immediately even if they have never spoken to one another before. The listener is influenced by many linguistic primes set up by the speaker. All of this occurs on an unconscious level and is sensitive to the power differential between the participants, with less dominant participants generally being more attentive to more dominant participants’ words.

==Case studies==

===Urban styles===
An opposition between urban and suburban linguistic variables is common to all metropolitan regions of the United States. Although the particular variables distinguishing urban and suburban styles may differ from place to place, the trend is for urban styles to lead in the use of nonstandard forms and [[negative concord]].
In Penny Eckert’s study of Belten High in the Detroit suburbs, she noted a stylistic difference between two groups that she identified: school-oriented jocks and urban-oriented, school-alienated burnouts.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; The variables she analyzed were the usage of negative concord and the mid and low vowels involved in the [[Northern Cities Shift]], which consists of the following changes: æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, ə &gt; a, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ  ([y] here is equivalent to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol [j]). All of these changes are urban-led, as is the use of negative concord.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Burnouts.PNG|thumb|400px|alt=burnouts diagram|Use of Detroit variables involved in the Northern Cities Shift (NCS) by gender and social category. Black = greatest use, gray = second greatest use.]] --&gt;The older, mostly stabilized changes, æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, and ə &gt; a, were used the most by women, while the newer changes, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ were used the most by burnouts. Eckert theorizes that by using an urban variant such as [foyt], they were not associating themselves with urban youth. Rather, they were trying to [[indexicality|index]] traits that were associated with urban youth, such as "tough" and "street-smart".

This theory is further supported by evidence from a subgroup within the burnout girls, which Eckert refers to as ‘burned-out’ burnout girls. She characterizes this group as being even more anti-establishment than the ‘regular’ burnout girls. This subgroup led overall in the use of negative concord as well as in female-led changes. This is unusual because negative concord is generally used the most by males. ‘Burned-out’ burnout girls were not indexing masculinity &amp;mdash; this is shown by their use of female-led variants and the fact that they were found to express femininity in non-linguistic ways. This shows that linguistic variables may have different meanings in the context of different styles.

===Gay styles===

There is some debate about what makes a style "gay." In stereotypically flamboyant gay speech, the phonemes /s/ and /l/ have a greater duration.&lt;ref name="Christ"&gt;Crist, Sean. 1997. Duration of Onset Consonants in Gay Male Stereotyped Speech. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.3.53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; People are also more likely to identify those with higher frequency ranges as gay.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, Henry, Ron Smyth, and Greg Jacobs. 2000. Vowel and Sibilant Duration in Gay- and Straight-sounding Male Speech. Paper presented at the International Gender and Language Association Conference 1, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are many different styles represented within the gay community. There is much linguistic [[variation (linguistics)|variation]] in the gay community, and each subculture appears to have its own distinct [[feature (linguistics)|features]]. According to Podesva et al., "gay culture encompasses reified categories such as leather daddies, clones, drag queens, circuit boys, guppies (gay yuppies), gay prostitutes, and activists both mainstream and radical, as well as more local communities of practice which may not even have names."&lt;ref name="Podesva"&gt;Podesva, Robert J., Sarah J. Roberts and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. 2002. Sharing resources and indexing meanings in the production of gay styles. In Kathryn Campbell-Kibler, Robert J. Podesva, Sarah J. Roberts and Andrew Wong (eds.) Language and Sexuality: Contesting Meaning in Theory and Practice. Stanford , California : CSLI Press. 175–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, each of these sub-cultures speaks with a different style than all the other sub-cultures.

There are also many features that are fairly prevalent in all of society but can index homosexuality in particular contexts. "Cooperative discourse" is often considered a feature of gay linguistic style, but is also used by some straight men, as well as by women.&lt;ref&gt;Leap, William L. 1996. Word’s Out: Gay Men’s English. Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with an approach to style that emphasizes stance.

Podesva et al.&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt; performed a study describing a sub-style within gay culture that some gay activists, lawyers, or other professionals use. The gay lawyer in their study does not want to appear "too gay," lest he also convey frivolity or other characteristics that he deemed unprofessional. It was important to him that he appear rational, educated, and competent as a lawyer. This is in line with the audience approach to style in which styles receive their meaning as a result of their opposition to other styles in their social sphere (in this case other gay styles). The lawyer's high release of word final stops, a variable also often found in the language of geek-girls and Orthodox Jews, indexes a desire to appear educated and not "too gay."  This actually indexes his gay [[identity (social science)|identity]] because he is tailoring his gay style (or lack thereof).&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;

A '''sustainability report''' is an organizational report that gives information about economic, environmental, social and governance performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalreporting.org/information/sustainability-reporting/Pages/default.aspx |title=Sustainability Reporting |publisher=Globalreporting.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability reporting''' is not just report generation from collected data; instead it is a method to internalize and improve an organization’s commitment to [[sustainable development]] in a way that can be demonstrated to both internal and external stakeholders.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== History ==
Corporate ''sustainability reporting'' has a history going back to [[environmental reporting]]. The first environmental reports were published in the late 1980s by companies in the [[chemical industry]] which had serious [[image problem]]s. The other group of early reporters was a group of committed small and medium-sized businesses with very advanced environmental management systems. Additionally, the [[tobacco industry]] adopted such reporting much earlier than the rest of the corporate world, in an attempt to attract new investors at a time when ethical investing was becoming increasingly popular.

Non-financial reporting, such as sustainability and [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] reporting, is a fairly recent trend which has expanded over the last twenty years. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report and there are a wide array of ratings and standards around. There are a variety of reasons that companies choose to produce these reports, but at their core they are intended to be "vessels of transparency and accountability". Often they also intended to improve internal processes, engage stakeholders and persuade investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosie Bristow for the Guardian Professional Network |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/online-panel-discussion-sustainability-reporting |title=Online discussion: sustainability reporting &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives ==
Organizations can improve their sustainability performance by measuring ([[EthicalQuote|EthicalQuote (CEQ))]], monitoring and reporting on it, helping them have a positive impact on society, the economy, and a sustainable future. The key drivers for the quality of sustainability reports are the guidelines of the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResources/2011/G3.1SustainabilityReportingMostCompleteGuidanceEver.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425140841/http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResources/2011/G3.1SustainabilityReportingMostCompleteGuidanceEver.htm |date=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ACCA) award schemes or rankings. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090903224518/http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/ReportingFrameworkDownloads GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines] enable all organizations worldwide to assess their sustainability performance and disclose the results in a similar way to financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResource/2011/SustainabilityExpertsCallforSmarterRegulationonTransparency.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest database of corporate sustainability reports can be found on the website of the [http://www.unglobalcompact.org/participants/search United Nations Global Compact] initiative.

Brock]] - second edition 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist in Syriac studies is known as a '''Syriacist'''. Specifically, British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by this designation, at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

At universities Syriac studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], [[Aramaic studies]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Leiden]], [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. [[Aramaic studies]] (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Orientalia christiana periodica - Volume 74 - Page 564 Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 2008 "(a question those of us in Syriac studies are too often asked). Then, posing the question, why study Syriac, he situates the field within the broader academy. While most students learn Syriac within a biblical studies program, Syriac also impacts ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences for Syriac studies include the Symposium Syriacum,&lt;ref&gt;VI Symposium Syriacum 1992: University of Cambridge 1994 Page 14 "René Lavenant, Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 1994 "must have felt in 1892: Syriac studies were very much alive then — however restricted the number of scholars working in the field at the time; Syriac studies are even more alive today — as the large registration at this conference ..."&lt;/ref&gt; the Section "Bible and Syriac Studies in Context" at the International Meetings of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]],&lt;ref name=sbl1&gt;http://www.sbl-site.org/meetings/Congresses_CallForPaperDetails.aspx?MeetingId=22&amp;VolunteerUnitId=594&lt;/ref&gt; and the Section "Syriac Literature and Interpretations of Sacred Texts" at the Annual Meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature.&lt;ref name=sbl1/&gt;  

Syriac academic journals include the annual ''Oriens Christianus'' ([[Wiesbaden]]) and ''Syriac Studies Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern churches review - Volume 1 - Page 370 1966 "... assisted by periodicals devoted to Christian oriental studies; the most important for Syriac studies are the annual Oriens Christianus (Wiesbaden) and 370 Syriac Studies Today by Robert Murray, SJ."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37806">'''Traditional ecological knowledge''' ('''TEK''') describes indigenous and other forms of traditional knowledge regarding sustainability of local resources. As a field of study in anthropology, TEK refers to "a cumulative body of knowledge, belief, and practice, evolving by  accumulation of TEK and handed down through generations through traditional songs, stories and beliefs. It is concerned with the relationship of living beings (including human) with their traditional groups and with their environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=F.|date=1993|title=Traditional ecological knowledge in perspective|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/52/5/432/236145|journal=Traditional Ecological Knowledge: Concepts and Cases|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge is commonly used in [[natural resource management]] as a substitute for baseline environmental data to measure changes over time in remote regions that have little recorded scientific data.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, M.M.R. 1992. The nature and utility of traditional ecological knowledge. ''Northern Perspectives'', 20(1):9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional knowledge in this field in management and science is controversial since methods of acquiring and accumulating the knowledge, although often including forms of [[empirical research]] and [[experimentation]], differ from those used to create and [[Validity (logic)|validate]]  [[ecology|scientific ecological knowledge]] .&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, D. (2004). Coming full circle: indigenous knowledge, environment, and our future. ''American Indian Quarterly'', 28(3 &amp; 4), 385-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, C. D., Ghimire, K. (2003). Synergy between traditional ecological knowledge and conservation science supports forest preservation in Ecuador. ''Conservation Ecology'', 8(1): 1&lt;/ref&gt; Non-tribal government agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency have established integration programs with some tribal governments in order to utilize TEK in environmental plans and climate change tracking.

There is a debate whether   Indigenous populations retain an [[intellectual property]] right over traditional knowledge and whether use of this knowledge requires prior permission and license.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, T. (2004). Indigenous traditional knowledge and intellectual property rights. Library of Parliament: PRB 03-38E. Parliamentary Research Branch Political and Social Affairs Division.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially complicated because TEK is most frequently preserved as [[oral tradition]] and as such may lack [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] confirmed [[documentation]]. Ironically, those same methods that might resolve the issue of documentation compromise the very nature of traditional knowledge.

Traditional knowledge is often used to sustain local populations and maintain resources necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS - Science and Human Rights Program. 2008. 10 February 2009 &lt;http://shr.aaas.org/tek/connection.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it can be weakened or invalidated in the context of rapid [[climate change]], [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]], or other situations in which significant alterations of [[ecosystem]]s render it weak or obsolete {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

TEK can also be referred to as '''traditional environmental knowledge''' which emphasizes the different components and interactions of the environment. More specifically it contains the knowledge of species of both animals and plants, and biophysical characteristics of the environment through space and time.

== Development of the field ==
{{close paraphrasing|section|date=April 2017}}
The earliest systematic studies of traditional ecological knowledge were conducted in anthropology. Ecological knowledge was studied through the lens of ethnoecology, "an approach that focuses on the conceptions of ecological relationships held by a people or a culture," in understanding how systems of knowledge were developed by a given culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b10756577a.pdf|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Perspective|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=1993|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold C. Conklin|Harold Colyer Conklin]], an American anthropologist who pioneered the study of [[ethnoscience]], took the lead in documenting indigenous ways of understanding the natural world. Conklin and others documented how traditional peoples, such as Philippine horticulturists, displayed remarkable and exceptionally detailed knowledge about the natural history of places where they resided. Direct involvement in gathering, fashioning products from, and using local plants and animals created a scheme in which the biological world and the cultural world were tightly intertwined. Although the field of TEK began with documentation of lists of species used by different indigenous groups and their "taxonomies of plants, animals, and later, of other environmental features such as soils," the shift from documentation to consideration of functional relationships and mechanisms gave rise to the field as it is recognized today. In emphasizing the study of adaptive processes, which argues that social organization itself is an ecological adaptational response by a group to its local environment, human-nature relations and the practical techniques on which these relationships and culture depended, the field of TEK could analyze a broad range of questions related to [[cultural ecology]] and [[ecological anthropology]], .&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umanitoba.ca/institutes/natural_resources/canadaresearchchair/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%20And%20Nature%20Traditional%20Ecological%20Knowledge.pdf|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1980s a growing body of literature on traditional ecological knowledge documented both the environmental knowledge held by   diverse indigenous peoples and their ecological relations.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The studies included examining "cultivation and biodiversity conservation in tropical ecosystems, and traditional knowledge and management systems in coastal fisheries and lagoons, semi-arid areas, and the Arctic." What these studies illustrated was that a variety of "traditional peoples had their own understandings of ecological relationships and distinct traditions of resource management." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rise of traditional ecological knowledge at this time led to international recognition of its potential applications in resource management practices and sustainable development. The 1987 report by the World Commission on Environment and Development reflects the consensus at the time. The report points out that the successes of the 20th century (decreases in infant mortality, increases in life expectancy, increases in literacy, and global food production) have given rise to trends that have caused environmental decay "in an ever more polluted world among ever decreasing resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf|title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future|last=|first=|date=March 20, 1987|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hope, however, existed for traditional lifestyles. The report declared that tribal and indigenous peoples had lifestyles that could provide modern societies with lessons in the management of resources in complex forest, mountain, and dryland ecosystems.

=== Differences  from science===
Fulvio Mazzocchi of the [[National Research Council (Italy)|Italian National Research Council]]'s Institute of Atmospheric Pollution contrasts traditional knowledge from scientific knowledge as follows:

{{quote|Traditional knowledge has developed a concept of the environment that emphasizes the symbiotic character of humans and nature. It offers an approach to local development that is based on co‐evolution with the environment, and on respecting the carrying capacity of ecosystems. This knowledge—based on long‐term empirical observations adapted to local conditions—ensures a sound use and control of the environment, and enables indigenous people to adapt to environmental changes. Moreover, it supplies much of the world's population with the principal means to fulfil their basic needs, and forms the basis for decisions and strategies in many practical aspects, including interpretation of meteorological phenomena, medical treatment, water management, production of clothing, navigation, agriculture and husbandry, hunting and fishing, and biological classification systems.... Beyond its obvious benefit for the people who rely on this knowledge, it might provide humanity as a whole with new biological and ecological insights; it has potential value for the management of natural resources, and might be useful in conservation education as well as in development planning and environmental assessment....Western science is positivist and materialist in contrast to traditional knowledge, which is spiritual and does not make distinctions between empirical and sacred. Western science is objective and quantitative as opposed to traditional knowledge, which is mainly subjective and qualitative. Western science is based on an academic and literate transmission, while traditional knowledge is often passed on orally from one generation to the next by the elders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazzocchi|first=Fulvio|date=2006-05-01|title=Western science and traditional knowledge|url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/7/5/463|journal=EMBO Reports|language=en|volume=7|issue=5|pages=463–466|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400693|issn=1469-221X|pmc=1479546|pmid=16670675}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aspects of traditional ecological knowledge ==
The aspects of traditional ecological knowledge provide different typologies in how it is utilized and understood. These are good indicators in how it is used from different perspectives and how they are interconnected, providing more emphasis on "cooperative management to better identify areas of difference and convergence when attempting to bring two ways of thinking and knowing together."&lt;ref&gt;Houde, N. (2007) Ecology &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factual observations ===
The first aspect of traditional ecological knowledge incorporates the factual, specific observations generated by recognition, naming, and classification of discrete components of the environment.  This aspect is about understanding the interrelationship with species and their surrounding environment. It is also a set of both empirical observations and information emphasizing the aspects of animals and their behavior, and habitat, and the physical characteristics of species, and animal abundance. This type of "empirical knowledge consists of a set of generalized observations conducted over a long period of time and reinforced by accounts of other TEK holders."&lt;ref&gt;Usher, P.J. 2000. Traditional Ecological Knowledge in environmental assessment and management&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management systems===
The second aspect refers to the ethical and sustainable use of resources in regards to management systems. This is achieved through strategic planning to ensure resource conservation. More specifically this face involves  dealing with pest management, resource conversion, multiple cropping patterns, and methods for estimating the state of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes 1988, Gunn et all. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of ignorance toward traditional ecological knowledge is at the fault of management, these people are used to growing up in a more modern advanced system, they tend to ignore it.

===Past and current uses===
The  third face refers to time dimension aspect of traditional ecological knowledge, focusing on the past and current uses of the environment transmitted through oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Usher 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Oral history is also used to transmit cultural heritage through generation to generation to maintain the sense of family and community.

===Ethics and values===
The fourth face refers to value statements and connections between the belief system and the organization of facts. In regards to TEK it refers to environmental ethics that keeps exploitative abilities in check. This face also refers to the expression of values concerning the relationship with the habitats of species and their surrounding environment - the human-relationship environment.

===Culture and identity===
The fifth face refers to the role of language and images of the past giving life to culture.&lt;ref&gt;Houde 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Aboriginals (original inhabitants) and their environment are vital to sustaining the cultural components that define them. This face reflects the stories, values, and social relations that reside in places as contributing to the survival, reproduction, and evolution of aboriginal cultures, and identities. It also stresses "the restorative benefits of cultural landscapes as places for renewal"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Sheppard 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
This   aspect  is a culturally based cosmology that is the foundation of the other aspects. The combination relates to the assumptions and beliefs about how things work, and explains the way in which things are connected, and gives principles that regulate human-animal relations and the role of humans in the world. From an anthropological perspective, cosmology attempts to understand the human-animal relationship and how these directly influence social relationships, obligations toward community members, and management practices.

==Ecosystem management theory==
{{Main|Ecosystem management}}

Ecosystem management is a multifaceted and holistic approach to natural resource management. It incorporates both  science and traditional ecological knowledge to collect data from long term measures that science cannot. This is achieved by scientists and researchers collaborating with Indigenous peoples through a consensus decision-making process while meeting the socioeconomic, political and cultural needs of current and future generations.

==Traditional knowledge and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency==
{{POV section|date=April 2017}}

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was one of the first federal agencies to develop formal policies detailing how it would collaborate with tribal governments and acknowledge tribal interests in enacting its programs "to protect human health and the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/tribal/epa-policy-administration-environmental-programs-indian-reservations-1984-indian-policy|title=EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations (1984 Indian Policy)|last=EPA, OITA, AIEO|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognizing tribal peoples connection to the environment the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has sought to develop environmental programs that integrate traditional ecological knowledge into the "agency's environmental science, policy, and decision-making processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://semspub.epa.gov/work/HQ/500024668.pdf|title=Consideration of Tribal Treaty Rights and Traditional Ecological Knowledge|last=Woolford|first=James|date=January 17, 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although TEK is not currently recognized as an important component of mainstream environmental decision making, scientists are working on developing core science competency programs that align with TEK and promote self-sufficiency and determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region9/tribal/web/pdf/tribal-ecological-knowledge-env-sci-policy-dm.pdf|title=Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in Environmental Science, Policy and Decision-Making|last=|first=|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] issued Executive Order 13175, which required federal departments and agencies to consult with Indian Tribal governments in the development of policies that would have Tribal implications.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/pdf/tek-j-sepez.pdf|title=Traditional Environmental Knowledge in Federal Natural Resource Management Agencies|last=Sepez|first=Jennifer|last2=Lazrus|first2=Heather|date=Winter 2005|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal Implications are defined by the EPA as having "substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-13175-consultation-and-coordination-indian-tribal|title=Summary of Executive Order 13175 - Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments|last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Federal agency of the U.S. government, the EPA was required to establish a set of standards for the consultation process. As its initial response, the agency developed a set of standards that would allow for meaningful communication and coordination between the agency and tribal officials prior to the agency taking actions or implementing decisions that may affect tribes. The standards also designated EPA consultation contacts to promote consistency and coordination of the consultation process, and established management oversight and reporting to ensure accountability and transparency.

One form of consultation has been EPA Tribal Councils. In 2000, the EPA's Office of Research and Development formed the EPA Tribal Science Council. The council, made up of representatives from tribes across the nation, is meant to provide a structure for tribal involvement in EPA's science efforts, and serve as a vehicle through which EPA may gain an understanding of the scientific issues that are of highest priority to tribes at a national level. The Council also offers tribes an opportunity to influence EPA’s scientific agenda by raising these priority issues to an EPA-wide group.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-02/documents/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title=Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2014|website=www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of importance for tribal members at the initial gathering of the EPA Tribal Science Council was the inherent differences in tribal traditional lifeways and western science. These lifeways include "spiritual, emotional, physical, and mental connections to the environment; connections which are based on intrinsic, immeasurable values"; and an understanding that the earth’s resources will provide everything necessary for human survival.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The EPA's Tribal Science Council, however, was meant to act as a meeting place where both groups could "share information that may contribute to environmental protection for all peoples with neither culture relinquishing its identity." In an effort to protect TTL the Council identified subsitence as a critical area for investigation. The EPA-Tribal Science Council defined subsistence as: the "relationships between people and their surrounding environment, a way of living. Subsistence involves an intrinsic spiritual connection to the earth, and includes an understanding that the earth’s resources will provide everything necessary for human survival. People who subsist from the earth’s basic resources remain connected to those resources, living within the circle of life. Subsistence is about living in a way that will ensure the integrity of the earth’s resources for the beneficial use of generations to come." Because TTL or TEK is specific to a location and includes the relationships between plants and animals, and the relationship of living beings to the environment, acknowledgment of subsitence as a priority allows for the knowledge and practices of TTL to be protected. For example, as part of their deliberation regarding subsistence, the Council agreed to identify resource contamination as “the most critical tribal science issue at this time.” Because tribal people with subsistence lifestyles rely the environment for traditional techniques of farming, hunting. fishing, forestry, and medicines, and ceremonies, contaminants  disproportionately impact tribal peoples and jeopardizes their TTL. As the EPA Council stated, "Tribal subsistence consumption rates are typically many times higher than those of the general population, making the direct impact of resource contamination a much more immediate concern."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As native peoples struggle with tainted resources, the Council has made progress in investigating its impacts.

Despite such efforts, there are still barriers to progress within the EPA-Tribal Science Council. For example, one obstacle has been the nature of TTL. Tribal Traditional Lifeways are passed down orally, from person to person, generation to generation, whereas western science relies on the written word, communicated through academic and literate transmission.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Endeavors to bring together western scientists and tribal people have also been hindered by Native American's perceptions that scientific analysis are put in a metaphorical “black box” that shuts out tribal input. Regardless, the EPA has recognized the ability of indigenous knowledge to advance scientific understanding and provide new information and perspectives that may benefit the environment and human health.

The integration of TTL into the EPA's risk assessment paradigm is one example of how the EPA-Tribal Science Council has been able to enact change in EPA culture. The risk assessment paradigm is an "organizing framework for the scientific analysis of the potential for harmful impacts to human health and the environment as a result of exposure to contaminants or other environmental stressors." Risk assessment has been used by the EPA to establish "clean-up levels at hazardous waste sites, water quality and air quality criteria, fish advisories, and bans or restricted uses for pesticides and other toxic chemicals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region9/tribal/web/pdf/tribal-ecological-knowledge-env-sci-policy-dm.pdf|title=Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in Environmental Science, Policy and Decision-Making|last=|first=|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal people are concerned, however, that current risk assessment methodologies do not afford complete value to tribal culture, values, and/or life ways. The Tribal Science Council seeks to incorporate TTL into exposure assumptions existent in the EPA risk assessment model. A long-term goal for the  EPA’s Tribal Science Council, however, is a complete shift in decision-making assessments from risk to preserving a healthy people and environment. As stated above, tribal people do not accept a separation of the human and ecological condition when they characterize risk. Through EPA initiated seminar, workshops, and projects, tribes have been able to engage in dialogue about the integration of Tribal Traditional Lifeways into EPA risk assessment and decision-making. This has occurred in a number of ways: inclusion of unique tribal cultural activities such as native basketry, the importance of salmon and other fishes, native plant medicine, consumption of large amounts of fish and game, and sweat lodges as exposures for estimating potential risk to people or to communities. Although these types of tribal specific activities may be included in EPA's risk assessment, there is no assurance that they will be included nor is there consistency in how they may be applied at different sites across the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In July 2014, the EPA announced its “Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples," setting forth its principles for programs related to [[federally recognized tribes]] and indigenous peoples in order to "support the fair and effective implementation of federal environmental laws, and provide protection from disproportionate impacts and significant risks to human health and the environment."&lt;ref name="Policy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/partners/web/pdf/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title= EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2014|website=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 17 principles were #3 ("The EPA works to understand definitions of human health and the environment from the perspective of federally recognized tribes, indigenous peoples throughout the United States, and others living in Indian country"); #6 ("The EPA encourages, as appropriate and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, the integration of traditional ecological knowledge into the agency’s environmental science, policy, and decision-making processes, to understand and address environmental justice concerns and facilitate program implementation"); and #7 ("The EPA considers confidentiality concerns regarding information on sacred sites, cultural resources, and other traditional knowledge, as permitted by law.").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-02/documents/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title=EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=McCarthy|first=Gina|date=|website=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this policy identifies guidelines and procedures for the EPA in regards to environmental justice principles as they relate to tribes and indigenous peoples, the agency noted that they are in no way applicable as [[United States administrative law#Rulemaking|rules or regulations]]. They cannot be applied to particular situations nor change or substitute any law, regulation, or any other legally-binding requirement and is not legally enforceable.&lt;ref name="Policy"/&gt;

==Effects on environmental degradation on traditional knowledge==
In some areas, [[environmental degradation]] has led to a decline in traditional ecological knowledge. For example, at the [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation|Aamjiwnaang]] community of [[Anishnaabe]] First Nations people in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], Canada, residents suffer from a "noticeable decrease in [[Human sex ratio|male birth ratio]] ..., which residents attribute to their proximity to petrochemical plants":&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoover|first=Elizabeth|year=2012|title=Indigenous Peoples of North America: Environmental Exposures and Reproductive Justice|jstor=23323091|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|pages=1645–1649|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In addition to concerns about the physical reproduction of community members, indigenous people are concerned about how environmental contamination impacts the reproduction of cultural knowledge. In Aamjiwnaang, oral traditions once passed down from grandfathers during fishing or grandmothers during berry picking and medicine gathering are being lost as those activities are no longer practiced because of concerns about these foods being contaminated. Rocks once used for sweat lodges are no longer being collected from local streams because the streams have become contaminated. The cedar used for making tea, smudging, and washing babies contains vanadium at concentrations as high as 6 mg/kg..., reflecting local releases to air of &gt; 611 tons of vanadium between 2001 and 2010.... At Akwesasne, community members report a loss of language and culture around subsistence activities like fishing, which have been largely abandoned because of fears of exposure to contaminants.&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;}}

==Climate change==
[[File:Indigenous people and Climate Change.pdf|thumb|upright|Indigenous people and Climate Change: fact sheet about the health impacts of climate change on indigenous populations.]]

The rising temperature poses as threats for ecosystems because it harms the livelihoods of certain tree and plant species. The combination of the rise in temperatures and change in precipitation levels affects plant growth locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Threats and Solutions|url=https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/threats-solutions/|website=The Nature Conservancy|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has wiped out much of the salmonids and acorns which make up a significant portion of the Karuk people's food. The increase in temperatures has stunted the wild rice's ability to grow and that has a negative influence on the Anishinaabe people's lifestyle.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples, Lands, and Resources|url=http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/sectors/indigenous-peoples#|website=Global Change|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ojibwe people are also affected by the rising temperature's effect on rice growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warming also affects insects and animals. The change in temperatures can affect many aspects from the times that insects emerge throughout the year to the changes in the habitats of animals throughout seasonal changes. In Maine, the loss of certain habitats and the increase in temperatures, especially in the colder seasons, encourages the survival of ticks that harm the moose population.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

As the temperature gets hotter, wild fires become more likely. Not only are different aspects of the environment are affected, but together, the health of the ecosystem is affected by climate change and so the environmental resources available to the indigenous people can change in the amount available and the quality of the resources.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

The [[Navajo Nation]] peoples in the Southwestern United States are victims to the pollution in the air. Climate change increases chances for droughts which lead to the dangers of airborne dust to be picked up from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

	Water resources are also affected. In particular, about a third of the Navajo Nation people need to physically attain their own water. Damage to their water resources poses as dangers to overall health and crop failures. In Arizona, the Fort Apache reservation's children are victims to the rising temperatures in their water which allows more impurities to grow in the water and causes them to have diarrhea and stomach problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sea ice levels decrease, Alaska Native peoples experience changes in their daily lives; fishing, transportation, social and economic aspects of their lives become more unsafe. The Native peoples residing on the Gulf and West Coasts are affected by the rising sea temperatures because that makes the fish and shellfish, that they rely on for food and cultural activities, more susceptible to contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defrosting of soil has caused damages to buildings and roadways. Water contamination becomes exacerbated as clean water resources dwindle.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

Climate changes undermine the daily lives of the Native peoples on many levels. For example, to immediately deal with these conditions, the indigenous people adjust when they harvest and what they harvest and also adjust their resource use. Climate change can change the accuracy of the information of traditional ecological knowledge. The indigenous people have relied deeply on indicators in nature to plan activities and even for short- term weather predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinyeta|first1=Kirsten|last2=Lynn|first2=Kathy|title=Exploring the role of traditional ecological knowledge in climate change initiative|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo37896/pnw_gtr879.pdf|publisher=Portland, OR: U. S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of even more increasing unfavorable conditions, the indigenous people relocate to find other ways to survive. As a result, there is a loss of cultural ties to the lands they once resided on and there is also a loss to the traditional ecological knowledge they had with the land there.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt; Climate change adaptations not properly structured or implemented can harm the indigenous people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raygorodetsky|first1=Gleb|title=Why Traditional Ecological Knowledge Holds the Key to Climate Change|url=https://unu.edu./publications/articles/why-traditional-knowledge-holds-the-key-to-climate-change.html|website=United Nations University|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has mentioned that it would take traditional ecological knowledge into consideration in planning adaptations to climate change. The [[National Resource Conservation Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has used methods of the indigenous people to combat climate change conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moffa|first1=Anthony|title=Traditional Ecological Rulemaking|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moffa.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Study: Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska===

In one study, villagers of Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska reported that over the last twenty years of their lives, the weather has become more difficult to predict, the colder season has shortened, there is more difficulty in predicting the amount of plants available for harvests, there are differences in animal migrations, there are more sightings of new species than before, and the activities of hunting and gathering have become not as predictable nor occur as often due to more limited availability to do so. The residents saw a noticeable change in their climate which also affected their livelihoods. The plants and animals are not as consistent with their availability which affects the residents' hunting and gathering because there is not as much to hunt or gather. The appearance of new species of plants and animals is also a physical and nutritional safety concern because they are not traditionally part of the land.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;

'''White-nose syndrome''' ('''WNS''') is an emerging disease in North American [[bat]]s which by 2018 has killed millions of bats in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=deathtoll&gt;{{cite news|title=NUSGS report on white-nose syndrome|url=https://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/white-nose_syndrome/|date=May 2018 |accessdate=2018-07-07|publisher=US Geological Survey|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is named for a distinctive [[fungus|fungal]] [[hypha|growth]] around the muzzles and on the wings of hibernating bats. It was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in [[Schoharie County, New York]].&lt;ref name=science2009&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18974316 |doi=10.1126/science.1163874 |title=Bat White-Nose Syndrome: An Emerging Fungal Pathogen? |year=2009 |last1=Blehert |first1=D.

{{As of| 2017}}, fifteen bat species, including three endangered species and one threatened species have been affected by WNS or exposed to the causative fungus, ''[[Pseudogymnoascus destructans]]'', with impacts varying widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/about/bats-affected-wns |title=Bats affected by WNS |publisher=White-Nose Syndrome |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012 four species have suffered substantial declines and extinction of at least one species was predicted.&lt;ref name=Langwig_2012 /&gt; Declines included species already listed as endangered in the US, such as the [[Indiana bat]], whose [[hibernacula (zoology)|hibernacula]], in many states, have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unexplained "White Nose" Disease Killing Northeast Bats |publisher=Environment News Service |date=2008-01-31 |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2008/2008-01-31-094.asp |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The once-common [[little brown bat]] has suffered a major population collapse in the northeastern US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frick|first=W.

Beyond the direct effect on bat populations, WNS has broader ecological implications. The Forest Service estimated in 2008 that the die-off from white-nose syndrome means that at least 2.4 million pounds of insects (1.1 million kg) will go uneaten and become a financial burden to farmers, possibly leading to crop damage or having other economic impact in [[New England]].&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe20080207&gt;{{cite news |title=Die-off of bats could hurt area crops |author=Daley, Beth |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/02/07/die_off_of_bats_could_hurt_area_crops/ |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that bats save farmers in the U.S. 3 billion dollars annually in pest control services.

==Research==
[[File:A Million Bats Dead from Mysterious Disease.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3:34|2009 [[VOA]] report about the disease]] 
Biologists of the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] have been collecting information at each site in regard to the number of bats affected, the geographic extent of the outbreaks and samples of affected bats. They developed a geographic database to track the location of sites, where WNS has been found.&lt;ref name=US&gt;US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Northeast Region, "White-Nose Syndrome in bats: Something is killing our bats." http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html (accessed April 14, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Fish and Wildlife Service has been partnering with the Northeastern [[Cave Conservancy]] to track movements of cavers that have visited affected sites in New York.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

In 2009, the Service advised closing caves to explorers in 20 states, from the Midwest to New England. This directive was supposed to be extended to 13 southern states. One Virginia scientist stated, "If it gets into caves more to our south, in places like Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Alabama, we’re going to be talking deaths in the millions."&lt;ref name = Economist/&gt; In March 2012, WNS was discovered on some [[tri-colored bats]] (''Perimyotis subflavus'') in [[Russell Cave]] in [[Jackson County, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=ala/&gt;

[[File:Geomyces destructans.gif|thumb|''Pseudogymnoascus destructans'']]

===Infection===
A laboratory experiment suggests that physical contact is required for one bat to infect another, because bats in mesh cages adjacent to infected bats did not contract the fungus. This implies that the fungus is not [[airborne disease|airborne]], or at least, is not transmitted from bat to bat through the air.&lt;ref name=Lorch_2011 /&gt; The primary way this fungus is spread is through bat-to-bat contact or infected cave-to-bat contact. The role of humans in the spread of the disease is debated. It is likely the fungus was brought to North America by human activities, because no bats normally migrate between Europe and North America, and the fungus was first discovered in New York where there are major trans-Atlantic air and shipping terminals. Geographical translocation of bats by ship and airplane have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geographic Translocation of Bats: Known and Potential Problems|journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 1080-6040|pmc = 2873759|pmid = 12533276|pages = 17–21|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.3201/EID0901.020104|first = Denny G.|last = Constantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown the fungus can persist on human clothing and thus could be carried between locations by people, but as of 2016 it has not been demonstrated that this has played any role in the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|title=Bureau Land Management: "How is White-Nose Syndrome Spread?"|publisher=|access-date=2016-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301104331/http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|archive-date=2016-03-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = White-Nose Syndrome|url = http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|website = www.blm.gov|date = 2014-11-28|access-date = 2016-02-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301104331/http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|archive-date = 2016-03-01|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Signs of disease====
The signs observed with WNS include unusual winter behavior like abnormally frequent or abnormally long arousal from [[torpor]] (temporary hibernation), flying, loss of body fat, damage and scarring of the wing membranes, and death.
As early as 2011 it was hypothesized that prematurely expending the fat reserves for winter survival may be a cause for death.&lt;ref name=usfws2011&gt;{{cite web|title=A National Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies, and Tribes in Managing White-Nose Syndrome in Bats|url=https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/sites/default/files/white-nose_syndrome_national_plan_may_2011.pdf|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=10 January 2015|pages=21|format=pdf|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathophysiology====

Until December 2014 the cause for the abnormal behavior was unclear, as no physiological data linking altered behavior to hypothesized increased energy demands existed. 
 
The Fish and Wildlife Service published a case control study in December 2014:  Of 60 little brown bats, 39 bats were randomly assigned to infection by applying conidia to skin of the dorsal surface of both wings and 21 bats remained controls. All were observed for 95 days and euthanized. 32 bats developed WNS (30 mild to moderate and 2 moderate to severe). The remaining seven infected bats were PCR-positive with normal wing histology.
Infected bats with WNS had higher proportions of lean tissue mass to fat tissue mass than uninfected bats in measuring an increase in total body water volume as a percent of body mass. Infected bats used twice as much energy as healthy bats, and starved to death. Direct calculations of energy expenditure failed for most bats, because isotope concentrations were indistinguishable from background. There was also no difference in torpor durations in this experiment; the average torpor duration for infected bats was 9.1 days with an average arousal of 54 min. Average torpor duration for control bats was 8.5 days with an average arousal duration of 55 min.&lt;ref name=Verant&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Michelle L Verant, Carol U Meteyer, John R Speakman, Paul M Cryan, Jeffrey M Lorch, David S Blehert|title=White-nose syndrome initiates a cascade of physiologic disturbances in the hibernating bat host|journal=BMC Physiology|date=9 December 2014|volume=14|issue=10|doi=10.1186/s12899-014-0010-4|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/14/10|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infected bats suffered [[respiratory acidosis]] with an almost 40% higher mean pCO₂ than healthy bats, and [[potassium]] concentration was significantly higher.&lt;ref name=Verant/&gt;
Hence the following model of infection exists:
''Pseudogymnoascus destructans'' colonizes and eventually invades the wing epidermis. This causes increased energy expenditure, and an elevated blood pCO₂ and bicarbonate called chronic respiratory acidosis, possibly due to diffusion problems. Hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium) ensues because of an acidosis-induced extracellular shift of potassium. Dying, infected cells could also leak their (intracellular) potassium into the blood. The damaged wing epidermis might stimulate increased frequencies of arousal from torpor, which removes excess CO₂ and normalizes blood pH, at the expense of hydration and fat reserves. With worsening wing damage, the effects are exacerbated by water and electrolyte loss across the wound (hypotonic dehydration), which stimulates more frequent arousals in a positive feedback loop that ultimately leads to death.&lt;ref name=Verant/&gt;

===Geographical spread===

As of April 2014, the syndrome had been confirmed in 25 states and 5 Canadian provinces. 
The causative fungus has been confirmed in three additional states: [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/about/where-is-it-now |title=Where is it now? |publisher=White-Nose Syndrome |date=|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A little brown bat (''Myotis lucifugus'') was found in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state infected with white-nose syndrome in March 2016.  Researchers suspect through DNA analysis that the source of infection in this individual originated in the Eastern U.S.  This has been the westernmost case discovered in North America thus far.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/news/deadly-bat-fungus-washington-state-likely-originated-eastern-us|title=Deadly Bat Fungus in Washington State Likely Originated in Eastern U.S.|website=www.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A second case of white-nose syndrome was detected in Washington in April 2017. The infected bat was a [[Yuma myotis]] (''Myotis yumanensis''), which was the first time the disease has been found in this species.&lt;ref name="WNS May17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/blog/researchers-work-stop-spread-white-nose-syndrome-washington |title=Researchers work to stop the spread of white-nose syndrome in Washington |last=Froschauer| first=Ann |date=May 11, 2017 |website= white-nose syndrome.org|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the fungus was found on bats in six north Texas counties, bringing the number of states with the fungus to 33.  Three bat species tested positive.&lt;ref name="Texas Parks and Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fungus that Causes White-nose Syndrome in Bats Detected in Texas|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/newsmedia/releases/?req=20170323c|website=Texas Parks and Wildlife|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife|accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, it was announced that bats in [[Kansas]] were documented with white-nose syndrome, making it the first time infected bats were found in Kansas.&lt;ref name="Kansas 2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ksal.com/bat-disease-detected-in-kansas/| title=Bat Disease Detected in Kansas| author=Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism| date=2 April 2018| website=KSAL.com| publisher=Rocking M Media| access-date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced that bats in [[Manitoba]] were found to be infected with white-nose syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=43983&amp;posted=2018-05-18|title=Province of Manitoba {{!}} News Releases {{!}} White-nose Bat Syndrome Found in Manitoba|work=Province of Manitoba|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decontamination===

The fungus ''[[Pseudogymnoascus destructans]]'', or a closely related species of fungus, has been found in soil samples from infected caves and suggests that it can be transported from cave to cave by soil, such as that carried by human clothing.&lt;ref name=Linder_2022&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linder|first=Daniel|author2=Blehert |title=DNA-based detection of the fungal pathogen Geomyces destructans in soils from bat hibernacula|journal=Mycologia|date=2011-03-18|volume=103|issue=2|pages=241–246|pmid=20952799|url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/103/2/241.full|doi=10.3852/10-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precautionary decontamination methods are being encouraged to inhibit the possible spread of spores by humans. The WNS Decontamination Team, a sub-group of the Disease Management Working Group, published a national decontamination protocol on March 15, 2012. They revised the protocol on June 25, 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=WNS Decontamination Team|title=National White-Nose Syndrome Decontamination Protocol v 06.25.2012|url=http://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/sites/default/files/resource/national_wns_revise_final_6.25.12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, based upon laboratory tests, a recommendation was issued to increase the temperature of the hot water treatment for submersible gear to {{convert|60|C|F|abbr=on}} for 20 minutes (up from {{convert|50|C|F|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Geboy|first=Richard|title=National Decontamination Protocol Update |publisher= Midwest Regional WNS Coordinator, US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|url=http://caves.org/WNS/Decon%20Update.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other guidance in the existing protocol should be followed.
 
As of 2008, cave management and preservation organizations had begun requesting that cave visitors limit their activities and disinfect clothing and equipment that has been used in possibly infected caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Something is killing our bats: The white-nose syndrome mystery |publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service |url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current protocol goes further, and indicates that in many cases it is inappropriate to reuse even disinfected gear, and that new gear should be used.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|see p.3 flow chart}}

In some cases, access to caves is being closed entirely.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news |author=Munger, Edward, Jr. |title=Group asking cavers to keep out |url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2008/feb/14/0214_caves/ |work=[[Daily Gazette]] |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] Commissioner Basil Seggos, "Research ... demonstrates that white-nose syndrome makes bats highly susceptible to disturbances. Even a single, seemingly quiet visit can kill bats that would otherwise survive the winter. If you see hibernating bats, assume you are doing harm and leave immediately." When hibernating bats are disturbed, it raises their body temperatures, depleting fat reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEC Reminds the Public to Avoid Seasonal Caves and Mines to Protect Bat Populations|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/press/108239.html|publisher=[[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]]|accessdate=1 November 2016|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''World Christian Encyclopedia''''' is a [[reference work]] published by [[Oxford University Press]], known for providing membership statistics for major and minor world [[religion]]s in every country of the world, including historical data and projections of future populations.

The first edition, by [[David B. Barrett]], was published in 1982. The second edition ({{ISBN|978-0195079630}}), by Barrett, [[George Thomas Kurian]], and [[Todd M. Johnson]], was published in 2001. The research team was originally based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and later relocated to [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garrison |first=David |date=Fall 2004 |title=Church Planting Movements: The Next Wave? |journal=International Journal of Frontier Missions |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118 |url=http://www.ijfm.org/PDFs_IJFM/21_3_PDFs/118_Garrison.pdf |accessdate= 2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, the encyclopedia includes membership data for numerous non-Christian religions. However, the work has been described as serving as "an informational undergirding for [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard N. |last=Ostling |authorlink=Richard Ostling |title=Researcher tabulates world's believers |work= |publisher=Associated Press |date=2001-05-19 |accessdate=2007-11-28 |url=http://www.adherents.com/misc/WCE.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The data incorporated into the ''World Christian Encyclopedia'' have been made available online at the [http://worldchristiandatabase.org/ World Christian Database] (WCD). One study found that the WCD's data was "highly correlated with other sources that offer cross-national religious composition estimates" but the database "consistently gives a higher estimate for percent Christian in comparison to other cross-national data sets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hsu |first=Becky |author2=Amy Reynolds |author3=Conrad Hackett |author4= James Gibbon  |year=2008 |title=Estimating the Religious Composition of All Nations: An Empirical Assessment of the World Christian Database |journal=[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=691–692 |url=http://www.conradhackett.com/uploads/2/6/7/2/2672974/evaluating_world_christian_database.pdf |accessdate=2012-01-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
