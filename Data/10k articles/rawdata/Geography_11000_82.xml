'''Alleghenia''' ([[minor planet designation]]: '''457 Alleghenia'''), provisional designation 1900 FJ, is a carbonaceous [[asteroid]] from the outer region of the [[asteroid belt]], about 34 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 15 September 1900, by German astronomers [[Max Wolf]] and [[Friedrich Schwassmann]] at [[Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory|Heidelberg Observatory]] in southern Germany.&lt;ref name="MPC-Alleghenia" /&gt;

The [[C-type asteroid|C-type]] asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 5 years and 5 months (1,987 days). Its orbit is [[orbital inclination|tilted]] by 13 degrees to the plane of the [[ecliptic]] and shows an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.17. Based on assumptions made by the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'', the body has a low [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.06, a typical value for a carbonaceous asteroid.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; In 2014, photometric [[light-curve]] observations at the Los Algarrobos Observatory (OLASU, [[IAU code#I00–I99|I38]]), Uruguay, has given a [[rotation period]] of {{val|21.953|0.001}} hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]. It was the last among the first 500 numbered asteroids to have its period measured for the first time ''(also see [[398 Admete]])''.&lt;ref name="Alvarez-2015a" /&gt;

The minor planet was named by Max Wolf in honor and gratitude of U.S. optician [[John Brashear]] at [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]] in Pennsylvania, who equipped Wolf's new telescope with state of the art optics (lenses for the 16-inch photographic doublet). Some of the finest astronomy equipment of the early 20th century were produced at Allegheny by Brashear. The body was the first discovery Wolf made with his new instrument.{{efn|name=Cite-Wolf}} Wolf also expressed his gratitude by granting the naming of another of his discoveries to the American optician, who named it [[484 Pittsburghia]], after his home city. Brashear is also honored by [[Brashear (Martian crater)|a Martian]] and [[Brashear (lunar crater)|a lunar]] crater.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The minor planet [[5502 Brashear]] was later directly named after the famous American astronomer and instrument builder.

The '''A3036''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[London]], [[England]].

It starts at the southern tip of the [[County Hall]] roundabout {{nowrap|({{coord|51.5003|-0.1168|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A3036 road (northeastern end)}}),}} where the [[A302 road|A302]] [[Westminster Bridge]], [[York Road, Lambeth|York Road]] and [[A23 road|A23]] [[Westminster Bridge Road]] all intersect.

This stretch of the route is called [[Lambeth Palace Road]] and heads southwest, past [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and the [[Lambeth Palace|Palace]] itself, at the roundabout junction with the [[A3203 road|A3203]] at [[Lambeth Bridge]], where it runs along the south side of the [[Thames]].

After this, the road is called [[Albert Embankment]] and continues to run alongside the river, until it passes the [[MI6]] headquarters at the major junction known as [[Vauxhall#Vauxhall Cross|Vauxhall Cross]], where the [[A202 road|A202]] [[Vauxhall Bridge]], Durham Street and Harleyford Road, the [[A203 road|A203]] [[South Lambeth Road]], and the [[A3205 road|A3205]] Nine Elms Lane all converge.

From [[Vauxhall]], the route is then called Wandsworth Road until it crosses the [[A3216 road|A3216]] Queenstown Road / Cedars Road junction in [[Battersea]]. At that point the street name changes to [[Lavender Hill]], continuing until [[Clapham Junction]].

The [[A3 road|A3]] follows roughly the same southwesterly course as this route and after [[St John's Hill]], [[Clapham Junction]], the two routes merge at the [[Wandsworth]] one-way system {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4596|-0.1799|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A3036 road (southwestern end)}}),}} where the road continues as the A3.

In his ''Zayn al-akbar'', Gardīzī took a dispassionate view of history which was fairly remarkable for its time.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gardizi "''GARDĪZĪ, ABŪ SAʿĪD ʿABD-al-ḤAYY'' GARDĪZĪ,ABŪ SAʿĪD ʿABD-al-ḤAYY b.

Included is a history of the Arab invasion of Khurasan, which it is believed Gardizi was using al-Sallami as a source. His history concerning the Turks was written using [[Ibn Khordadbeh]], al-Djayhani and Ibn al-Mukaffa as sources.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Gardizi'', W. Barthold, ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol.II, p. 978.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been a student of [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|al-Biruni]], since the ''Zayn al-akbar'' contains information concerning Indian festivals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His style of Persian is simple but mature and provides one of the classical examples of Persian prose-writing.

'''Abu al-Qasim az-Zayyani''' or, in full, '''Abu al-Qasim ibn Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Ibrahim az-Zayyani''' was a Moroccan [[historian]], [[geographer]], [[poet]] and [[Diplomat|statesman]] from the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Zayanes|zayane]] tribe in [[Morocco]] (1734/35&amp;ndash;1833).&lt;ref&gt;Amira K. Bennison ''Jihad and its interpretations in pre-colonial Morocco'', Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7007-1693-9}}, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook diplomatic missions to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court and engineered government attempts to bring tribes under central authority. His writings include several historical accounts of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] and [[Alaouite Dynasty|Alaouite]] dynasties. Az-Zayyani wrote fifteen works in the field of history and geography. Some authors even consider him the greatest historian of Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Lakhdar, ''La vie littéraire au Maroc sous la dynastie alaouite'', Rabat, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Az-Zayyani has left his genealogy which, according to his grandfather, goes back to Sanhaj, the ancestor of the [[Sanhaja|Sanhaja tribes]], by Zayyan, the eponymous ancestor of the tribe itself, by Amalu, father of Zayyan and by al-yasa', who would have converted to Islam in the reign of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (eighth century AD). He cites as the guarantor of this ancestry the great Berber genealogist Sabiq ibn Sulayman al-Matmati.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=146}}

== Biography ==
On his return from the journey he made among the Zayyans in 1689, the [[Alaouite dynasty|Alaouite]] Sultan [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Isma'il]] brought back to [[Meknes]] az-Zayyani's grandfather, who became his Imam and died in this city the same year as him 1727.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=145–146}} His son Ahmed then moved to Fez, where the future historian (az-Zayyani) was to be born eight years later.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=146}}

Abu'l-Qasim az-Zayyani was born in [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]] in 1734/35. He was from the zayyan tribe, a big Berber tribe in Moroccan [[Middle Atlas]], where his grandfather Ali ibn Ibrahim who was a Jurisconsult and a valuable genealogist lived in the [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiyya]] of Aroggo, near Adekhsan.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=145}} Among his grandfather's work was a book on [[Berber people|Berber]] genealogy.&lt;ref name="HoffmanMiller2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Katherine E. Hoffman; Susan Gilson Miller|title=Berbers and Others: Beyond Tribe and Nation in the Maghrib|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-ziBn5HakEC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=3 December 2012|date=24 May 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35480-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu'l-Qasim made his islamic studies in Fez, which he completed in 1785. He was then twenty-three years old. He had taken courses in the mosques of [[University of Al Quaraouiyine|al-Qarawiyyin]] and al-Andalusiyyin and frequented the two madrasas of al-Sahrij and al-'Attarin. His principal masters were, first of all, Ahmed ibn at-Tahir ach-Chargi, then the biographer Muhammad ibn at-Tayyib al-Qadiri, Abd al-Qadir Boukhiris, Mohammed Bennani, and above all the famous jurisconsult Abu Hafs 'Umar al-Fasi, to the lessons of which were pressed the already known [[Ulama|ulema]], like Abd as-Salam Hassin, al-'Arbi al-Qosantini, Muhammad Sahnun, al-Walid al-'Iraqi, Yahia ach-Chafchawani, Muhammad al-Huwwari and Muhammad ibn Abd as-Salam al-Fasi.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=146–147}}

During the reign of Sultan [[Abdallah of Morocco|'Abd Allah]], the year in which his studies ended, az-Zayyani accompanied his father and mother, who had resolved to accomplish the pilgrimage; He was their only son and they wanted to settle with him definitively in [[Medina]].{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=147}} Thus the two houses and the library of the historian's father were sold. They first went to [[Cairo]] to join the caravan of the Egyptian pilgrims; But instead of gaining the Hijaz by land, they preferred to embark on the sea for Arabia by renting a boat.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=147–148}} The journey was less fatiguing, and at the same time afforded the opportunity of making a commercial operation which might be fruitful. They bought, with all the money they had, various merchandise, which they carried from Cairo to Suez on renting camels.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=148}} But bad luck had already begun to fall on az-Zayyani: during the crossing would happen the first of seven ''nakabat'' (calamities) who struck him during his life.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=148}} Arrived in view of [[Yanbu|yanbu']], the ship that carried pilgrims traffickers broke on the reefs, and the cargo was lost: passengers and crew escaped death.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=148}} The Moroccan family landed on Arab land in the utmost destitution. Fortunately, az-Zayyani's mother had sewed three hundred pieces of gold in her belt to counteract a misadventure that was always possible in such a distant journey. She handed them over to her husband, who hired a mount to [[Jeddah]] and [[Mecca]], and all three went on their pilgrimage. Then they continued on Medina with the Egyptian caravan and visited the tomb of the Prophet. But with such precarious resources they could no longer think of settling in the city. It was therefore necessary to return to Morocco. After having bought, with the sum which remained to them, some provisions of road, they returned slowly to Egypt, by land route, with the caravan of the pilgrims of this country. Arrived in Cairo, they could get some money, which allowed them to rest a little before getting back on the road.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=148}} 

== Death ==
According to the author of ''salwat al-anfas'', [[Muḥammad ibn Jaʿfar al-Kattānī|al-Kattānī]]. Az-zayyani died at the time of the [[Asr prayer|Asr]] of Sunday 17 November 1833. He would have lived thus ninety-nine years. He was buried, by order of the sultan, in the zawiyya of the [[Nasiriyya]] Sufi order, which is in Fes, in the district of es-Siaj.{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1922|p=165}}

[[American Samoa]] is administratively divided into three [[district]]s and two "unorganized" atolls.  For statistical purposes, the [[United States Census Bureau]] reckons these five places as [[county equivalent|county equivalents]].  Locally, the districts and unorganized atolls are subdivided into 14 so-called ''counties'' (which are ''not'' the above county equivalents used by the Bureau) and 74 villages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbar.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10229&amp;catid=201&amp;Itemid=172&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Björnlandet''' is a [[national park]] in [[Västerbotten County]], northern [[Sweden]]. It was established in 1991 and covers an area of {{convert|11|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.

Geographically it lies in southernmost [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappland]], about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the hamlet ([[tätort|locality]]) of [[Fredrika, Sweden|Fredrika]], in [[Åsele Municipality]].

The park is notable for its large primeval forest and a geography that is distinguished by steep ravines and precipices. The fauna is comparatively of lower interest, due to the harsh climate and environment.

'''California Citrus State Historic Park''' is an [[open-air museum]] in the [[state park]] system of [[California]], USA, interpreting the historic [[cultural landscape]] of the [[citrus production|citrus industry]].  The story of the citrus industry's role in the history and development of California is told in the visitor center. The California Citrus State Historic Park is in the city of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] in [[Riverside County, California]], United States.&lt;ref name="Website"&gt;{{cite web | title = California Citrus SHP | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=649 | publisher = California State Parks | accessdate = 2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{convert|248|acre|ha|adj=on}} park was established in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = California State Park System Statistical Report: Fiscal Year 2009/10 | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/795/files/09-10%20statistical%20report%20final%20online.pdf | publisher = California State Parks | page = 22 | accessdate = 2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[California State Historic Park]] recaptures the time when "Citrus was King" in California, especially the [[Orange (fruit)#Navel oranges|Navel orange]] from Riverside, and recognizing the importance of the citrus industry in [[Southern California]].

==History==
In the early 1900s, an effort to promote citrus ranching in the state brought hundreds of would-be citrus barons to California for the "second Gold Rush." The lush groves of oranges, lemons and grapefruit gave California another legacy&amp;mdash;its lingering image as the Golden State&amp;mdash;the land of sunshine and opportunity.

In 1873, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] forever changed the history of Southern California when it sent two small Navel orange trees to Riverside resident [[Eliza Tibbets]]. Those trees, growing in near perfect soil and weather conditions, produced an especially sweet and flavorful fruit. Word of this type of orange quickly spread, and a great agricultural industry was born.&lt;ref name="Website" /&gt;

==Open-air museum and visitor center==
[[File:OrangeGrov.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An orange grove in California]]
The design of the park is reminiscent of a 1900s city park, complete with an activity center, interpretive structure, amphitheater, picnic area, and demonstration groves of citrus tree orchards. The land contained within the park still continues to produce high-quality fruits.&lt;ref name="Website" /&gt;

The park's visitor center houses a museum about California's citrus industry, and antique citrus grove farm equipment is on display around the park.&lt;ref name="Website" /&gt;

In 2002 [[Huell Howser]] Productions, in association with [[KCET]]/Los Angeles, featured the park in ''California's Golden Parks''; the 28 minute program is available as a VHS videorecording.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|79370034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed for closure===
In January 2008 the California Citrus State Historic Park became one of the 48 [[List of California state parks|California state parks]] proposed for closure by California's Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as part of a deficit reduction program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs5.com/local/California.parks.budget.2.627476.html CBS5.com: List Of Calif. Parks To Close In Budget Proposal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223141631/http://cbs5.com/local/California.parks.budget.2.627476.html |date=February 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To keep the park open, the city of Riverside has proposed to enter into a 40-year lease with the state.  A bill to approve the lease, authored by Assemblyman [[Kevin Jeffries]], was tabled until January 2010 due to lack of support.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jim. ''Citrus park proposed closure''.  The Press~Enterprise, September 5, 2009, Section D.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diyu''' ({{zh|c=地獄}}) is the realm of the dead or "[[hell]]" in [[Chinese mythology]]. It is loosely based on a combination of the Buddhist concept of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]], traditional Chinese beliefs about the afterlife and a variety of popular expansions and reinterpretations of these two traditions.

Diyu is typically depicted as a subterranean maze with various levels and chambers, to which souls are taken after death to atone for the sins they committed when they were alive. The exact number of levels in Diyu and their associated deities differ between Buddhist and Taoist interpretations. Some speak of three to four "courts"; others mention "Ten Courts of Hell", each of which is ruled by a judge (collectively known as the Ten [[Yama (East Asia)#Yama in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese mythology|Yama]] Kings); others Chinese legends speak of the "Eighteen Levels of Hell". Each court deals with a different aspect of atonement and different punishments; most legends claim that sinners are subjected to gruesome tortures until their "deaths", after which they are restored to their original state for the torture to be repeated.

==Ten Courts of hell==
[[Image:Hells judges.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ming dynasty]] (16th century) glazed earthenware figurines representing three of the ten Yama Kings.]]

The concept of the "Ten Courts of the hell" ({{zh|t={{linktext|十|殿|閻|羅}}|p=Shídiàn Yánluó}}) began after [[Chinese folk religion]] was influenced by Buddhism. In Chinese mythology, the [[Jade Emperor]] put [[Yama (East Asia)#Yama in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese mythology|Yama]] in charge of overseeing the affairs of Diyu. There are 12,800 hells located under the earth – eight dark hells, eight cold hells and 84,000 miscellaneous hells located at the edge of the universe. All will go to Diyu after death but the period of time one spends in Diyu is not indefinite – it depends on the severity of the sins one committed. After receiving due punishment, one will eventually be sent for [[reincarnation]]. In the meantime, souls pass from stage to stage at Yama's decision. Yama also reduced the number of hells to ten. He divided Diyu into ten courts, each overseen by a "Yama King", while he remained as the sovereign ruler of Diyu.

==Capital==
{{Main|Youdu}}

Among the various other geographic features believed of Diyu, the capital city has been thought to be named [[Youdu]]. It is generally conceived as being similar to a typical Chinese capital city, such as [[Chang'an]], but surrounded with and pervaded with darkness.

==Eighteen Levels of Hell==
[[File:The ghost of Yue Fei.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The headless ghost of [[Yue Fei]] confronting the recently deceased spirit of [[Qin Hui]] in the Sixth Court. The plaque held by the attendant on the left reads: "Qin Hui's ten wicked crimes." From a 19th-century Chinese [[Hell Scroll (Nara National Museum)|Hell Scroll]].]]

The concept of the eighteen hells started in the [[Tang dynasty]]. The Buddhist text ''Wen Diyu Jing'' (問地獄經) mentioned 134 worlds of hell, but was simplified to the Eighteen Levels of Hell for convenience. Sinners feel pain and agony just like living humans when they are subjected to the tortures listed below. They cannot "die" from the torture because when the ordeal is over, their bodies will be restored to their original states for the torture to be repeated. The following is a list of common punishments and tortures in the hells:

* Mountain of Knives: Sinners are thrown off cliffs and land on mountainous terrain with sharp blades sticking out. Some depictions show offenders climbing trees with knives or sharp thorns sticking out of trunks and branches.
* Cauldron torture: Sinners are fried in cauldrons of oil.
* Dismemberment: Sinners are dismembered by various means, including sawing, slicing into half, mashing/pounding into pulp, being crushed by rocks/boulders, being run over by vehicles, etc.
* Grinding torture: Sinners are put into a grinding machine and ground into a bloody pulp.
* Burning: Sinners are set aflame or cast into infernos.
* ''[[Creations of Daji#The Bronze Toaster|Paolao]]'' torture: Sinners are stripped naked and tied to a large hollow metal cylinder with a fire lit at its base.
* Boiling liquid torture: Boiling liquids are forced down sinners' throats or poured on parts of their bodies.
* Tortures involving removal of body parts or organs: Tongue ripping, eye gouging, teeth extraction, heart digging, disembowelment, skinning, etc.
* Ice World: Sinners are frozen in ice. Some depictions show unclothed sinners suffering frostbite in an icy world. Their bodies eventually fall apart or break into pieces.
* Scales and hooks torture: Sinners are pierced with hooks and hung upside-down. Some depictions show sinners having nails hammered into their bodies.
* Pool of Blood: Sinners are cast into a pool of filthy blood, where they drown. Blood spills from all [[Body orifice|bodily orifices]].
* Tortures involving animals: Sinners are trampled by cattle, gored by animals with horns or tusks, mauled or eaten by predators, stung or bitten by poisonous species, etc.
* [[Avīci]]: The period of suffering in this chamber is the longest. It is reserved for sinners who have committed heinous crimes, including the [[Anantarika-karma|Five Grave Offences]].

Some literature refers to eighteen types of hells or to eighteen hells for each type of punishment. Some religious or literature books say that wrongdoers who were not punished when they were alive are punished in the hells after death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;res=962317 Xue, Fucheng.

The '''English Channel''' ({{lang-fr|la Manche}}, "The Sleeve"; {{lang-de|Ärmelkanal}}, "Sleeve Channel"; {{lang-br|Mor Breizh}}, "Sea of Brittany"; {{lang-kw|Mor Bretannek}}, "British Sea"; {{lang-nl|Het Kanaal}}, "The Channel"), also called simply '''the Channel''', is the body of water that separates southern [[England]] from northern [[France]] and links the southern part of the [[North Sea]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is the busiest shipping area in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/busiest-shipping-lane|title=Busiest shipping lane|author=|date=|website=guinnessworldrecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
[[File:Carte de la Manche.png|upright=2|thumb|Map with French nomenclature]]

[[File:Osborne-iow-3Ja10-10876.jpg|thumb|right|[[Osborne House]], the summer retreat of [[Queen Victoria]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Starting from the late 18th century, settlements on and around the English Channel coastline in England grew rapidly into thriving [[seaside resort]]s, bolstered by their association with royalty and the middle and upper classes.]]
Until the 18th century, the English Channel had no fixed name either in English or in French. It was never defined as a political border, and the names were more or less descriptive. It was not considered as the property of a nation. Before the development of the modern nations, British scholars very often referred to it as "Gaulish" (''Gallicum'' in Latin) and French scholars as "British" or "English".&lt;ref&gt;MORIEUX&lt;/ref&gt; 
The name "English Channel" has been widely used since the early 18th century, possibly originating from the designation {{lang|nl|Engelse Kanaal}} in Dutch sea maps from the 16th century onwards. In modern Dutch, however, it is known as {{lang|nl|Het Kanaal}} (with no reference to the word "English").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|language = Dutch
|trans-title=Foreign Geographical Names
|publisher = Nederlandse Taalunie 
|year = 2012
|accessdate = 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it has also been known as the "British Channel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/maps6489.html |title=A chart of the British Channel, Jefferys, Thomas, 1787 |publisher=Davidrumsey.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "British Sea". It was called {{lang|la|Oceanus Britannicus}} by the 2nd-century geographer [[Ptolemy]]. The same name is used on an Italian map of about 1450, which gives the alternative name of {{lang|it|canalites Anglie}}—possibly the first recorded use of the "Channel" designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/m/001hrl000003686u00013000.html |title=Map Of Great Britain, Ca. 1450 |date=26 March 2009 |work=The unveiling of Britain |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=1 November 2013 |quote=This may also be the first map to name the English Channel: "britanicus oceanus nunc canalites Anglie"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon texts often call it ''Sūð-sǣ'' ("South Sea") as opposed to ''Norð-sǣ'' ("North Sea" = [[Bristol Channel]]). The [[common word]] ''channel'' was first recorded in Middle English in the 13th century and was borrowed from Old French ''chanel'', variant form of ''chenel'' "canal".

The French name {{lang|fr|la Manche}} has been in use since at least the 17th century.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; The name is usually said to refer to the Channel's sleeve ({{lang-fr|link=no|la manche}}) shape. Folk etymology has derived it from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word meaning ''channel'' that is also the source of the name for [[the Minch]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Room A. ''Placenames of the world: origins and meanings'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but this name was never mentioned before the 17th century, and French and British sources of that time are perfectly clear about its etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotgrave R., ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'', London, A. Islip, 1611, art. « Manche ».
&lt;/ref&gt; The name in Breton (''Mor Breizh'') means "Breton Sea", and its Cornish name (''Mor Bretannek'') means "British Sea".

The [[Strait of Dover]] (French: ''Pas de Calais''), at the Channel's eastern end, is its narrowest point, while its widest point lies between [[Lyme Bay]] and the Gulf of [[Saint Malo]], near its midpoint.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt; It is relatively shallow, with an average depth of about {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} at its widest part, reducing to a depth of about {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} between [[Dover]] and [[Calais]]. Eastwards from there the adjoining North Sea reduces to about {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Broad Fourteens]] where it lies over the watershed of the former land bridge between [[East Anglia]] and the [[Low Countries]]. It reaches a maximum depth of {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the submerged valley of [[Hurd's Deep]], {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} west-northwest of [[Guernsey]].&lt;ref&gt;"English Channel" ''The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia including Atlas.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|Bay of the Seine2}} &lt;!-- term redirect to section --&gt;
The eastern region along the French coast between [[Cherbourg]] and the mouth of the [[Seine river]] at [[Le Havre]] is frequently referred to as the ''Bay of the Seine'' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Baie de Seine}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Allied Invasion Force.jpg]] + [[commons:File:Carte de la Manche.png|French map of Channel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three French river mouths.JPG|thumb|Three French river mouths. Top to bottom: the [[River Somme|Somme]], the [[Authie (river)|Authie]] and the [[Canche]]]]
There are several major islands in the Channel, the most notable being the [[Isle of Wight]] off the English coast, and the [[Channel Islands]], British [[Crown dependencies]] off the coast of France. The coastline, particularly on the French shore, is deeply indented; several small islands close to the coastline, including [[Chausey]] and [[Mont Saint-Michel]], are within French jurisdiction. The [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in France juts out into the Channel, whilst on the English side there is a small parallel [[strait]] known as the [[Solent]] between the Isle of Wight and the mainland. The [[Celtic Sea]] is to the west of the Channel.

The Channel acts as a funnel that amplifies the tidal range from less than a metre as observed at sea{{clarify|date=December 2017}} to more than 6 metres as observed in the [[Channel Islands]], the west coast of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] and the north coast of [[Brittany]]. The time difference of about six hours between high water at the eastern and western limits of the Channel is indicative of the tidal range being amplified further by [[resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the UK [[Shipping Forecast]] the Channel is divided into the following areas, from the east:
* [[Dover]]
* [[Isle of Wight|Wight]]
* [[Isle of Portland|Portland]]

=== Geological origins ===
The Channel is of geologically recent origin, having been dry land for most of the [[Pleistocene]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/English-Channel|title=English Channel {{!}} channel, Europe|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Devensian glaciation]] (the most recent [[glacial period]], which ended around 10,000 years ago), [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] were part of [[continental Europe]], linked by an unbroken [[Weald-Artois Anticline]], a ridge that acted as a natural dam holding back a large freshwater [[pro-glacial lake]] in the [[Doggerland]] region, now submerged under the [[North Sea]]. During this period the North Sea and almost all of the British Isles were covered by ice. The lake was fed by meltwater from the Baltic and from the Caledonian and Scandinavian [[ice sheet]]s that joined to the north, blocking its exit. The sea level was about {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower than it is today. Then, between 450,000 and 180,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, at least two catastrophic [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s breached the [[Weald–Artois anticline]].

The first flood would have lasted for several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second.&lt;ref name="Gupta Nature"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta |first=Sanjeev |author2=Jenny S.

The flow eroded the retaining ridge, causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water into the Atlantic. After multiple episodes of changing sea level, during which the ''Fosses Dangeard'' were largely infilled by various layers of sediment, another catastrophic flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley, the [[Lobourg Channel]], some 500 m wide and 25 m deep, from the southern North Sea basin through the centre of the Straits of Dover and into the English Channel. It left streamlined islands, longitudinal erosional grooves, and other features characteristic of catastrophic [[megaflood]] events, still present on the sea floor and now revealed by high-resolution sonar.&lt;ref&gt;Two-stage opening of the Dover Strait and the origin of island Britain.

The flooding destroyed the ridge that connected Britain to continental Europe, although a land connection across the southern [[North Sea]] would have existed intermittently at later times when periods of [[glaciation]] resulted in lowering of sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/title,89282,en.html |title=The Doggerland project |author=Professor Bryony Coles |publisher=University of Exeter |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[last glacial period]], rising sea levels finally severed the last land connection.

=== Ecology ===
As a busy shipping lane, the Channel experiences environmental problems following accidents involving ships with toxic cargo and oil spills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/guernsey/4668664.stm| title=Tanker wreck starts leaking oil| date=1 February 2006| publisher=BBC| accessdate=1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, over 40% of the UK incidents threatening pollution occur in or very near the Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/pacops_final_report_2006.pdf| title=Annual Survey of Reported Discharges| publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]| year=2006| accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the  recent occurrences was the [[MSC Napoli|MSC ''Napoli'']], which  on 18 January 2007 was beached with nearly 1700&amp;nbsp;tonnes of dangerous cargo in Lyme Bay, a protected World Heritage Site coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ship-disasters.com/commercial-ship-disasters/container-ship-disasters/msc-napoli/|title=MSC Napoli {{!}} Ship Disasters|website=www.ship-disasters.com|language=en-US|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had been damaged and was en route to [[Portland Harbour]].

Successful invasions include the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, while the concentration of excellent harbours in the Western Channel on Britain's south coast made possible the largest invasion of all time, the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944. Channel [[list of naval battles|naval battles]] include the [[Battle of the Downs]] (1639), [[Battle of Goodwin Sands]] (1652), the [[Battle of Portland]] (1653), the [[Battle of La Hougue]] (1692) and the engagement between [[USS Kearsarge (1861)|USS ''Kearsarge'']] and [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] (1864).

In more peaceful times the Channel served as a link joining shared cultures and political structures, particularly the huge [[Angevin Empire]] from 1135 to 1217. For nearly a thousand years, the Channel also provided a link between the [[Modern Celts|Modern Celtic]] regions and languages of [[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]]. Brittany was founded by [[Ancient Britons|Britons]] who fled [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] after Anglo-Saxon encroachment. In Brittany, there is a region known as "[[Cornouaille]]" (Cornwall) in French and "Kernev" in [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Kernow", the Cornish for Cornwall.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times there was also a "[[Domnonia]]" (Devon) in Brittany as well.

In 55 BC [[Julius Caesar]] invaded, claiming that the Britons had aided the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] against him the previous year. He was more successful in 54 BC, but Britain was not fully established as part of the Roman Empire until completion of the invasion by [[Aulus Plautius]] in 43 AD. A brisk and regular trade began between ports in Roman [[Gaul]] and those in Britain. This traffic continued until the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in 410 AD, after which the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early Anglo-Saxons]] left less clear historical records.

In the power vacuum left by the retreating Romans, the Germanic [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]] began the next great migration across the North Sea. Having already been used as mercenaries in Britain by the Romans, many people from these tribes crossed during the [[Migration Period]], conquering and perhaps displacing the native [[Celt]]ic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The attack on [[Lindisfarne]] in 793 is generally considered the beginning of the [[Viking Age]]. For the next 250&amp;nbsp;years the Scandinavian raiders of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark dominated the North Sea, raiding monasteries, homes, and towns along the coast and along the rivers that ran inland. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' they began to settle in Britain in 851. They continued to settle in the [[British Isles]] and the continent until around 1050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Duchy of Normandy|fiefdom of Normandy]] was created for the [[Viking]] leader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]] (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]] [[Charles the Simple]] through the [[Treaty of St.-Claire-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name "Normandy" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. "Northman") origins.

The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's inhabitants and became the [[Normans]] – a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Hiberno-Norse]], [[Orkney|Orcadians]], [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]], and indigenous [[Franks]] and [[Gauls]].

Rollo's descendant [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]] became king of England in 1066 in the [[Norman Conquest]] beginning with the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of [[John of England|King John]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], while insular Normandy (the [[Channel Islands]]) remained under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.

With the rise of [[William the Conqueror]] the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia's trade south, toward the [[Mediterranean]] and the Orient.

Although the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for [[Chausey]]) are [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]]. Thus the [[Loyal toast]] in the Channel Islands is ''La Reine, notre Duc'' ("The Queen, our Duke"). The British monarch is understood to ''not'' be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris of 1259]], the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to [[Salic Law]] which excludes inheritance through female heirs.

French Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1346–1360 and again in 1415–1450.

=== England and Britain: Naval superpower ===
From the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent [[sea power]] of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] with [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] second in command, and the following stormy weather. Over the centuries the [[Royal Navy]] slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The building of the [[British Empire]] was possible only because the [[Royal Navy]] eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, especially the Channel and the North Sea. During the [[Seven Years' War]], France attempted to [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|launch an invasion of Britain]]. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759.

Another significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Battle of Trafalgar]] took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], ending [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.

=== First World War ===
The exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the First Sea Lord [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] in the years before [[World War I]]. "Five keys lock up the world! Singapore, the Cape, [[Alexandria]], Gibraltar, Dover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Geoffrey Miller| url=http://www.manorhouse.clara.net/book3/chapter2.htm| title=The Millstone: Chapter 2| accessdate=1 November 2008}} quoting Fisher, ''Naval Necessities I'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 25 July 1909 [[Louis Blériot]] made the first Channel crossing from [[Calais]] to [[Dover]] in an aeroplane. Blériot's crossing signalled the end of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.

Because the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed [[submarine warfare]], which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The [[Dover Patrol]] was set up just before the war started to escort cross-Channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.

On land, the German army attempted to capture Channel ports in the [[Race to the Sea]] but although the trenches are often said to have stretched "from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel", they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in [[Flanders]] was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.

At the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of [[U-boat]]s through the Dover Strait with [[naval mine]]fields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a {{convert|25|km|mi}} stretch of light steel netting called the [[Dover Barrage]], which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - The Dover Barrage|website=www.firstworldwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 1917, the Germans restarted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| archive-url=https://archive.is/20080310175335/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| dead-url=yes| archive-date=10 March 2008| title=U-Boat warfare at the Atlantic during World War I| publisher=German Notes| accessdate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.

The [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of [[convoy]]s and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights. A German attack on these vessels resulted in the [[Battle of Dover Strait (1917)|Battle of Dover Strait in 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E_TE_ARPXdMC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%22Dover+Barrage%22+1917#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dover%20Barrage%22%201917&amp;f=false |first=Robert M. |last=Grant, |title=U-Boats Destroyed: The Effect of Anti-Submarine Warfare 1914–1918 |publisher=Periscope Publishing Ltd |year=2002 |isbn=1-904381-00-6 |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage, by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the [[Admiralty M-N Scheme]] but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sotonwss.org.uk/blackjack/Sep09BJ.pdf|title=''Black Jack'' (Quarterly Magazine Southampton Branch World Ship Society) Issue No: 152 Autumn 2009: (p.6) SHOREHAM TOWERS – One of the Admiralty's greatest engineering secrets, Reproduced from Engineering &amp; Technology IET Magazine May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second World War ===

During the [[Second World War]], naval activity in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] was primarily [[Battle of the Atlantic|limited to the Atlantic]]. During the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940, the German forces succeeded in capturing both [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Boulogne]] and [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Calais]], thereby threatening the line of retreat for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. By a combination of hard fighting and German indecision, the port of [[Dunkirk]] was kept open allowing 338,000 Allied troops to be evacuated in [[Operation Dynamo]]. More than 11,000 were evacuated from [[Le Havre]] during [[Operation Cycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_cycle.html |title=Operation Cycle, the evacuation from Havre, 10-13 June 1940|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further 192,000 were evacuated from ports further down the coast in [[Operation Ariel]] in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_aerial.html Operation Aerial, the evacuation from north western France, 15–25 June 1940].

Despite these early successes against shipping, the Germans did not win the [[air supremacy]] necessary for [[Operation Sealion]], the projected cross-Channel invasion.

The Channel subsequently became the stage for an intensive coastal war, featuring submarines, [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], and [[Fast Attack Craft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] was the site of an ill-fated [[Dieppe Raid]] by Canadian and British armed forces. More successful was the later [[Operation Overlord]] ([[D-Day]]), a massive invasion of [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied France by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops. [[Caen]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Carentan]], [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the fight for the province, which continued until the closing of the so-called [[Falaise pocket|Falaise gap]] between [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]] and [[Montormel]], then liberation of [[Le Havre]].

The Channel Islands were the only part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by Germany]] (excepting the part of [[Egypt]] occupied by the [[Afrika Korps]] at the time of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], which was a protectorate and not part of the Commonwealth). The German occupation of 1940–1945 was harsh, with some island residents being taken for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labour]] on the Continent; native Jews sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]; [[partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance and retribution; accusations of [[collaborationism|collaboration]]; and slave labour (primarily Russians and eastern Europeans) being brought to the islands to build fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisjersey.co.uk/hmd/html/organisationtodt.html |title=Occupation Memorial HTML Library |publisher=Thisisjersey.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114235621/http://www.thisisjersey.co.uk/hmd/html/organisationtodt.html |archivedate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World War II: British Channel Islands--German Fortifications (1941-43) |work= |publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing |date=4 May 2013 |url=http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/cou/eng/ci/w2b-cif.html |accessdate=6 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Navy]] blockaded the islands from time to time, particularly following the [[Invasion of Normandy|liberation of mainland Normandy]] in 1944. Intense negotiations resulted in some [[Red Cross]] humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the occupation, particularly in the final months, when the population was close to starvation. The German troops on the islands surrendered on 9 May 1945, a day after the final surrender in mainland Europe.

The English Channel coast is far more densely populated on the English shore.

* English
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] – "het Kanaal" (the Channel)

Dutch previously had a larger range, and extended into parts of modern-day France. For more information, please see [[French Flemish]].

In December 2002 the [[MV Tricolor|MV ''Tricolor'']], carrying £30m of luxury cars sank {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of Dunkirk after collision in fog with the container ship ''Kariba''. The cargo ship ''Nicola'' ran into the wreckage the next day. There was no loss of life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The shore-based long range traffic control system was updated in 2003 and there is a series of Traffic Separation Systems in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/dops_-_dover_strait_tss_chartlet.htm|title=Chartlets published by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101007103452/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/dops_-_dover_strait_tss_chartlet.htm|archivedate=7 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the system is inherently incapable of reaching the levels of safety obtained from aviation systems such as the [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]], it has reduced accidents to one or two per year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Marine [[GPS]] systems allow ships to be preprogrammed to follow navigational channels accurately and automatically, further avoiding risk of running aground, but following the fatal collision between Dutch Aquamarine and Ash in October 2001, Britain's [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] (MAIB) issued a safety bulletin saying it believed that in these most unusual circumstances GPS use had actually contributed to the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources/SB_%202_2001_%20Ash_and_Dutch_Aquamarin.pdf| title=Safety Bulletin 2| year=2001| format=PDF| publisher=[[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]]| accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were maintaining a very precise automated course, one directly behind the other, rather than making use of the full width of the traffic lanes as a human navigator would.

A combination of radar difficulties in monitoring areas near cliffs, a failure of a CCTV system, incorrect operation of the anchor, the inability of the crew to follow standard procedures of using a GPS to provide early warning of the ship dragging the anchor and reluctance to admit the mistake and start the engine led to the MV ''Willy'' running aground in Cawsand bay, [[Cornwall]] in January 2002. The MAIB report makes it clear that the harbour controllers were informed of impending disaster by shore observers before the crew were themselves aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources/willy.pdf| title=Report on the Investigation of the grounding of MV ''Willy''| format=PDF| publisher=[[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]]| date=October 2002| accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of [[Kingsand]] was evacuated for three days because of the risk of explosion, and the ship was stranded for 11 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1742910.stm| title=Picture gallery: Cornwall's stranded tanker| publisher=BBC| date=5 January 2002| accessdate=1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1745945.stm| date=6 January 2002| title=Salvage team hunts for leak| publisher=BBC| accessdate=1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1759670.stm| title=Stranded tanker safe in port| date=14 January 2002| publisher=BBC| accessdate=1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of ferry routes crossing the [[Strait of Dover]] has reduced since the [[Channel Tunnel]] opened. Current cross-channel ferry routes are:
*[[Port of Dover|Dover]]–[[Calais]]
*Dover–[[Dunkirk]]
*[[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]–[[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]]
*[[Plymouth]]–[[Roscoff]]

=== Channel Tunnel ===
{{main|Channel Tunnel}}

Many travellers cross beneath the Channel using the Channel Tunnel, first proposed in the early 19th century and finally opened in 1994, connecting the UK and France by rail. It is now routine to travel between Paris or [[Brussels]] and London on the [[Eurostar]] train. Freight trains also use the tunnel. Cars, coaches and lorries are carried on [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]] trains between [[Folkestone]] and [[Calais]].

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Le Mont Saint-Michel.jpg|thumb|The [[Mont Saint-Michel]] is one of the most visited and recognisable landmarks on the English Channel.]]

The coastal resorts of the Channel, such as [[Brighton]] and [[Deauville]], inaugurated an era of aristocratic tourism in the early 19th century, which developed into the seaside tourism that has shaped resorts around the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Short trips across the Channel for leisure purposes are often referred to as [[Booze cruise|Channel Hopping]].

== History of Channel crossings ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
As one of the narrowest and most well-known international waterways lacking dangerous currents, the Channel has been the first objective of numerous innovative sea, air, and [[human power]]ed crossing technologies.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Pre-historic people sailed from the mainland to England for millennia. At the end of the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]], lower sea levels even permitted [[Doggerland|walking across]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/title,89282,en.html|title=University of Exeter|first=Debbie|last=Robinson|website=humanities.exeter.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usask"&gt;[http://geochemistry.usask.ca/bill/courses/Climate/Coastal%20catastrophe%20prt.pdf Patterson, W, "Coastal Catastrophe" (paleoclimate research document), University of Saskatchewan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409025923/http://geochemistry.usask.ca/bill/courses/Climate/Coastal%20catastrophe%20prt.pdf |date=9 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Andriel crossed the English Channel aboard the ''[[Steam ship Élise|Élise]]'', ex the Scottish p.s. "Margery" in March 1816, one of the earliest seagoing voyages by [[steamboat|steam ship]].

The paddle steamer ''Defiance'', Captain William Wager, was the first steamer to cross the Channel to Holland, arriving there on 9 May 1816.&lt;ref name="Mariner Mirror"/&gt;

On 10 June 1821, English-built [[paddle steamer]] ''Rob Roy'' was the first passenger ferry to cross channel. The steamer was purchased subsequently by the French postal administration and renamed ''Henri IV'' and put into regular passenger service a year later. It was able to make the journey across the Straits of Dover in around three hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingandboating.co.uk/history-channel-ferry.html|title=The History of the Channel Ferry|website=www.sailingandboating.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1843, because of difficulties with Dover harbour, the South Eastern Railway company developed the [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]-[[Folkestone]] route as an alternative to Calais-Dover. The first ferry crossed under the command of [[Captain Hayward]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theotherside.co.uk/tm-heritage/background/ferries.htm] Channel ferries &amp; ferry ports
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 a Welsh coracle piloted by Bernard Thomas of Llechryd crossed the English Channel to France in 13½ hours. The journey was undertaken to demonstrate how the [[Bull Boat]]s of the [[Mandan]] Indians of [[North Dakota]] could have been copied from coracles introduced by [[Prince Madog]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts7.html|title=Wales on Britannia: Facts About Wales &amp; the Welsh|website=www.britannia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Gilbert|title='Coracle king' to hang up paddle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/7331209.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mountbatten class hovercraft]] (MCH) entered commercial service in August 1968, initially between Dover and Boulogne but later also [[Ramsgate]] ([[Pegwell Bay]]) to Calais. The journey time Dover to Boulogne was roughly 35&amp;nbsp;minutes, with six trips per day at peak times. The fastest crossing of the English Channel by a commercial car-carrying hovercraft was 22&amp;nbsp;minutes, recorded by the ''Princess Anne'' MCH SR-N4 Mk3 on 14 September 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/15/newsid_3025000/3025267.stm| title=Hovercraft deal opens show| publisher=BBC News| date=15 June 1966| accessdate=1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By air ===
{{Main|List of English Channel crossings by air}}
The first aircraft to cross the Channel was a [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] in 1785, piloted by [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard|Jean Pierre François Blanchard]] (France) and [[John Jeffries]] (US).&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9015591 Blanchard, Jean-Pierre-François]." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Online. Retrieved 17 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blériot]] (France) piloted the first airplane to cross in 1909.

=== By swimming ===
{{Main|List of successful English Channel swimmers}}
The sport of Channel swimming traces its origins to the latter part of the 19th century when Captain [[Matthew Webb]] made the first observed and unassisted swim across the Strait of Dover, swimming from England to France on 24–25 August 1875 in 21&amp;nbsp;hours 45&amp;nbsp;minutes.

In 1927, at a time when fewer than ten swimmers (including the first woman, [[Gertrude Ederle]] in 1926) had managed to emulate the feat and many dubious claims were being made, the [[Channel Swimming Association]] (CSA) was founded to authenticate and ratify swimmers' claims to have swum the Channel and to verify crossing times. The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and was succeeded by two separate organisations: [[CSA (Ltd)]] and the [[Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation]] (CSPF). Both observe and authenticate cross-Channel swims in the Strait of Dover. The Channel Crossing Association was set up at about this time to cater for unorthodox crossings.

The team with the most number of Channel swims to its credit is the [[The Serpentine|Serpentine]] Swimming Club in London,&lt;ref&gt;serpentineswimmingclub.com {{cite web| url=http://serpentineswimmingclub.com/long-distance-swimmers| title=Serpentine Swimming Club | accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the International [[Sri Chinmoy]] Marathon Team.&lt;ref&gt;srichinmoyraces.org {{cite web| url=http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/channel/channel_swimmers/channel_swimmers_list| title=Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team | accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2005, 811 people had completed 1,185 verified crossings under the rules of the CSA, the CSA (Ltd), the CSPF and Butlins.

The number of swims conducted under and ratified by the Channel Swimming Association to 2005 was 982 by 665 people. This includes 24 two-way crossings and three three-way crossings.

The number of ratified swims to 2004 was 948 by 675 people (456 men, 214 women). There have been 16 two-way crossings (9 by men and 7 by women). There have been three three-way crossings (2 by men and 1 by a woman). (It is unclear whether this last set of data is comprehensive or CSA only.)

The Strait of Dover is the busiest stretch of water in the world. It is governed by International Law as described in ''Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/dops_-_all-sar_cnis_unorthodox_crossings.htm| title=Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme| publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]| accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states: "[In] exceptional cases the French Maritime Authorities may grant authority for unorthodox craft to cross French territorial waters within the Traffic Separation Scheme when these craft set off from the British coast, on condition that the request for authorisation is sent to them with the opinion of the British Maritime Authorities."

The CCA, CSA, and CS&amp;PF are the organisations escorting channel swims, because their pilots have the experience, qualifications, and equipment to guarantee the safety of the swimmers they escort.

The fastest verified swim of the Channel was by the Australian [[Trent Grimsey]] on 8 September 2012, in 6 hours 55 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-sport/trent-grimsey-breaks-channel-swim-record-20120909-25lsh.html|title=Trent Grimsey breaks channel swim record|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dover.uk.com/channelswimming/records.php|title=Channel swimming records - Dover.UK.com|website=www.dover.uk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; beating the previous record set in 2007 by Bulgarian swimmer [[Petar Stoychev]].

There may have been some unreported swims of the Channel, by people intent on entering Britain in circumvention of immigration controls. A failed attempt to cross the Channel by two Syrian refugees in October 2014 only came to light when their bodies were later discovered on the shores of the North Sea in Norway and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Wetsuitmen|

A '''geologic hazard''' is one of several types of adverse [[geology|geologic]] conditions capable of causing damage or loss of property and life. These [[hazard]]s consist of sudden phenomena and slow phenomena:

'''Sudden phenomena include:'''
* [[avalanche]]s (snow, rock, or air &amp; snow) and its runout
* [[earthquake]]s and earthquake-triggered phenomena such as [[tsunami]]s
* [[forest fire]]s (espec. in Mediterranean areas) leading to [[deforestation]]
* [[geomagnetic storms]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/a_geohazards.html ''Geologic Hazards'' NationalAtlas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430002306/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/a_geohazards.html |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ice jam]]s (Eisstoß) on rivers or [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s below a [[glacier]]
* [[landslide]] (lateral displacement of earth materials on a slope or hillside)
* [[mudflow]]s (avalanche-like muddy flow of soft/wet soil and sediment materials, narrow landslides)
* [[pyroclastic flows]]
* [[rockfall|rock falls]], [[rock slide]]s, ([[rock avalanche]]) and [[debris flow]]s
* torrents ([[flash flood]]s, rapid floods or heavy current creeks with irregular course)
* [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], [[lahar]]s and [[ash fall]]s.

'''Gradual or slow phenomena include:'''
* [[alluvial fan]]s (e.g. at the exit of [[canyon]]s or [[side valley]]s)
* [[caldera]] development (volcanoes)
[[Image:Norris geyser basin.jpg|thumb|right|Norris geyser at [[National Park|Yellowstone NP]], Sept.2003]]
* [[geyser]] [[deposition (geology)|deposit]]s
* ground settlement due to consolidation of compressible soils or due to collapseable soils (''see also [[Soil compaction|compaction]])
* ground [[subsidence]], [[sag (geology)|sag]]s and [[sinkhole]]s
* [[liquefaction]] (settlement of the ground in areas underlain by loose saturated sand/silt during an earthquake event)
* [[sand dune]] migration
* shoreline and stream [[erosion]]
* [[thermal spring]]s
Sometime the hazard is instigated by man through the careless location of developments or construction in which the conditions were not taken into account.

==Geologic hazard evaluation and mitigation==
Geologic hazards are typically evaluated by [[engineering geologists]] who are educated and trained in interpretation of landforms and earth process, earth-structure interaction, and in geologic hazard mitigation. The engineering geologist provides recommendations and designs to mitigate for geologic hazards. Trained hazard mitigation planners also assist local communities to identify strategies for mitigating the effects of such hazards and developing plans to implement these measures. Mitigation can include a variety of measures:
* Geologic hazards may be avoided by relocation.
* The [[slope stability|stability of sloping earth]] can be improved by the construction of [[retaining wall]]s, which may use techniques such as [[slurry wall]]s, [[shear pin]]s, [[tieback (geotechnical)|tiebacks]], [[soil nailing|soil nail]]s or [[soil anchor]]s. Larger projects may use [[gabion]]s and other forms of [[earthworks (engineering)|earth buttress]].
* Shorelines and streams are protected against [[Tidal scour|scour]] and erosion using [[revetment]]s and [[riprap]].
* The [[soil]] or rock itself may be improved by means such as dynamic compaction, injection of [[grout]] or concrete, and [[mechanically stabilized earth]].
* Additional mitigation methods include [[deep foundation]]s, [[tunnel]]s, surface and [[drainage|subdrain]] systems, and other measures.
*Planning measures include regulations prohibiting development near hazard-prone areas and adoption of [[building codes]].

The '''Geology of China''' (中国地质, ''Zhōngguó dì zhì'') (or the [[Geology|geological structure]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]) can be divided into several parts.  The historical centre of Chinese culture is on the [[loess]] plateau, the world's largest [[Quaternary]] loess deposit, and on the [[alluvial]] lands at the east of it.  The alluvial East China plain extends from just south of [[Beijing]] in the north, to the [[Yangtze River|Yangzi]] river delta in the south, punctuated only by the igneous [[Shandong]] highlands and peninsula.  South of the Yangzi river, most of the landscape is mountainous, dominated by sedimentary deposits and by the Yangzi [[craton]].  The most famous scenery in China is found in the [[karst]] landscapes of [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces.  The alluvial [[Sichuan]] basin is surrounded by mountains, the [[Qinling]] mountains to the north and the [[Himalaya]] to the west and southwest.  Much of Northeast China, or [[Manchuria]], is dominated by alluvial plains, but the border regions with Korea are also highly mountainous. In the west, most of the [[Tibet]]an plateau is in China, and averages over 4000 metres in [[elevation]].  The [[Yunnan]]-[[Guizhou]] plateau is also an extension of the Tibetan plateau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.datapages.com/data/doi/10.1306/3D9336BA-16B1-11D7-8645000102C1865D] {{doi|10.1306/3D9336BA-16B1-11D7-8645000102C1865D}} Outline of Chinese Geology J. Marvin Weller (2) AAPG Bulletin Volume 28 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geoscience==
It was not until late in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911) that the government formulated a policy to introduce foreign science and technology into China. Modern geologic ideas were introduced with the establishment of technical schools and the translation into Chinese of works by [[James D. Dana]] and [[Charles Lyell]] during the 1870s. Early in the twentieth century, foreign geology teachers were brought to China and Chinese students were sent to foreign countries to study geology. This infusion successfully developed the modern teaching and practice of geology in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hess.metapress.com/content/e6337776367421x4/  A History of Geology and Geological Education in China (to 1949)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712234452/http://hess.metapress.com/content/e6337776367421x4/ |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information infrastructure==
The China Geological Survey (CGS) constructed its geological survey information infrastructure to meet the needs of international cooperation and coordination, disseminate public geoscience knowledge and information, and to promote the sustainable development of the national economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/application/geology/geomorphology/ma04239abs.htm] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main line of the geological survey informationization is the informationization of whole procedure of the geological survey including project application, designing, implement, data processing and providing the geoscience information to the public; The construction of information standardization, basic network, technological development and project management system make up of its technological support; The construction of national basic geoscience database is the data support.

== Geological parks==
{{see also|National Geoparks of China|World Heritage Sites in China}}
China has 44 national geological parks managed since 1999 by the Chinese [[Ministry of Land and Resources]] in cooperation with [[UNESCO]] to find a way to protect geological sites of importance while encouraging both tourism and scientific research. Zhangjiajie Gritstone-peak Forest, China's best preserved cluster of volcanoes and geological features in Hunan Province, in 2001 became among the first nationally designated geological park. In February 2004, UNESCO announced the World Network of Geological Parks as well as its first geology park conference to be held in Beijing from June 27–29, 2004. Of the 28 original UNESCO World Geoparks, eight are in China. Currently there 26 World Geoparks in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/geoparks/members/ Geopark Members] Unesco.org&lt;/ref&gt; including the following:

*Shilin Geopark in China's Yunnan Province, featuring a carbonate peak forest landform, which brings about the formation of various karst landscapes, such as stone teeth, corroded gullies and corroded funnels.
*Huangshan Geopark in Anhui Province, famed for its grand and steep mountains, with 72 peaks of over 1,000 meters high. The geopark is picturesque with green and straight pines, jagged rocks of grotesque shapes, wide and imposing cloud sea, as well as many gushing warm springs.
*Other world-class Chinese geology parks include Lushan Geopark in Jiangxi Province, Yuntaishan Geopark and Songshan Geopark in central China's Henan Province, Danxia Geopark in Guangdong, Zhangjiajie Geopark in Hunan, and Wudalianchi Geopark in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.

The majority group in the region consists of [[Slavic Muslims]] with different identifications (mainly Albanian in Albania, Turkish in Macedonia) while there are also Orthodox Macedonian (some in [[Albania]] identifying as [[Bulgarians in Albania|Bulgarian]]) and Muslim Albanian minorities. The region was divided in 1925 between Albania and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

The region, like neighboring Albanian and Macedonian regions, has historically been economically linked to the city of [[Debar]], which was traditionally referred to by inhabitants as simply "the City".&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40/&gt;

== History ==

===Ottoman period===
The Islamization process is held to have occurred in Golloborda relatively late in Ottoman times.&lt;ref name=Toncheva40to42&gt;Toncheva, Veselka (2013). "The Slavonic Community from the Golo Bardo Region, Republic of Albania: Traditions, Music, Identity". ''Our Europe. Ethnography – Ethnology – Anthropology of Culture''. Volume 2. Pages 40-42&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1519, the region was still entirely Christian.&lt;ref name=Limanovski258&gt;Limanoski Niyazi (1993), Islamizatsijata i etnichkite promeni vo Makedonija [Islamization and Ethnical Changes in Macedonia], Skopje: Makedonska kniga (in Macedonian). Page 258&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have held that the Islamization process in Golloborda to have occurred in the late 18th century,&lt;ref name=Limanovski258/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toncheva40to42/&gt; whereas others asserted that the impetus to mass Islamization in the region was the ''bedel'' tax, imposed only on Christians because they were not drafted and initiated in the region in the year 1832. According to this second theory, this tax was particularly harsh and caused many families to turn to Islam as a means of avoiding it.&lt;ref name=Toncheva40to42/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stamatov&gt;[http://macedonia.kroraina.com/ssd/index.htm Stamatov Stefan (1938), Grad Debar i negovoto osnovavane] [City of Debar and its Founding], Parvo prilozhenie na periodichnoto spisanie "Debarski glas", Sofia: Debarsko blagotvoritelno bratstvo (in Bulgarian). Page 23&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, a mass emigration process occurred, and many Muslim families settled elsewhere, including in [[Debar]], in [[Struga]]'s Drimkol region, and in [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref name=Stamatov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toncheva40to42/&gt;&lt;ref name=Limanovski260&gt;Limanoski Niyazi (1993), Islamizatsijata i etnichkite promeni vo Makedonija [Islamization and Ethnical Changes in Macedonia], Skopje: Makedonska kniga (in Macedonian). Page 260&lt;/ref&gt; The families that settled in Debar became Albanized, but retain memory of their origins which are denoted by their last names, including Klenja, Trebishta, Ostreni, Torbaçi, Serpetova, and others.&lt;ref name=Limanovski260/&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
In 1913, the majority of the region was awarded to [[Albania]] while six villages were assigned to the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40&gt;Toncheva, Veselka (2013). "The Slavonic Community from the Golo Bardo Region, Republic of Albania: Traditions, Music, Identity". ''Our Europe. Ethnography – Ethnology – Anthropology of Culture''. Volume 2. Pages 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the border that divided the region in pieces, the region remained culturally and economically unified at this time, and Debar served as the unifying point for the entire region.&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40/&gt; There were plenty of migratory movements across the border during this period, and during [[King Zogu]]'s reign, people on both sides of the Albanian-Yugoslav border running through the region would cross it to cultivate farmland on the other side.&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40/&gt; During this period, the official border changed a number of times—at one point, it ran between [[Klenjë|Klenja]] and [[Stëblevë|Steblevo]], but now these two towns are both in Albania.&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40/&gt;&lt;ref name=Risteski28to30&gt;Risteski Lyupcho S. (2006), Zhivot na granitsa [Life on the Border] in: A. Svetieva (ed.) Golo Brdo. Zhivot na granitsa, Skopje: Institut za etnologija i antropologija, pp. 26–34 (in Macedonian). Pages 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Under Communism ===
The fates of the two sides of the region diverged much more sharply after the rise of [[communism]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]]. In 1948, the regime of [[Enver Hoxha]] in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] closed down the border, and a barbed wire fence was erected on the border, accompanied by guard posts.&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40/&gt; The Albanian communist state was extremely suspicious of Gollobordian communities, a fact one Macedonian author attributed to their "weak Albanian patriotism".&lt;ref name=Risteski28to30/&gt; This new heavy enforcement of the border caused many people to lose contact with their relatives who lived on the other side.&lt;ref name=Toncheva39to40/&gt;

== Demographics ==

Both Muslims and Christians today live in harmony and celebrate the holidays of both faiths together.&lt;ref name=Toncheva44&gt;Toncheva, Veselka (2013). "The Slavonic Community from the Golo Bardo Region, Republic of Albania: Traditions, Music, Identity". ''Our Europe. Ethnography – Ethnology – Anthropology of Culture''. Volume 2. Pages 44&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian ethnologist Veselka Toncheva believes that this phenomenon, seen elsewhere in post-communist Albania, cannot be attributed solely to the anti-religious policies of communist leader [[Enver Hoxha]], but also due to the perception of local communities as whole units of which local Christians and local Muslims both are part.&lt;ref name=Toncheva44/&gt;

=== Albania ===
In the region of Gollobordë, villages located on the Albanian side of the border have the following population demographics:

'''Hans Steffen Hoffman''' (20 July 1865, in [[:de:Fürstenwerder|Fürstenwerder]], [[Prussia]] &amp;ndash; 7 April 1936, in [[Davos]], Switzerland) was a [[Germans|German]] geographer and explorer of the [[Aysén Region]] in western [[Patagonia]]. Steffen also worked as a [[teacher]], [[encyclopedist]] and historian. [[Steffen Glacier]] on the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field]] is named after him.

==Biography==
His work in [[Chile]] began in 1889 when he was contracted by the Chilean government of [[Manuel Balmaceda]] to work at the [[UMCE|Pedagogical Institute]] of the [[University of Chile]] as a teacher of history and geography among other things. He was later contracted to join the Chilean boundary commission to explore areas disputed by [[Argentina]] in what is now the [[Aysén Region]] of Chile.

The areas to be explored were those affected by article 1 of the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]]:
:''"The boundary between Chile and the Argentine Republic is from north to south, as far as the [[52nd parallel south|52nd parallel]] of latitude, the Cordillera de los Andes. The boundary-line shall run in that extent over the highest summits of the said Cordilleras which divide the waters, and shall pass between the sources (of streams) flowing down to either side. …"''
This article led to dispute between whether the [[continental divide]] would serve as a boundary favouring Chile or the highest peaks favouring Argentina. The two interpretations coincided for most of the boundary but in the Aysén Region there were great differences. Before the explorations of Steffen, Chile had made only limited hydrographic surveys along the intricate Pacific coast of Aysén. The inland areas in dispute had been mainly explored by Argentines, notably [[Francisco Perito Moreno]].

Between 1893 and 1894 he explored with the [[Chilean Navy]] the basins of the [[Palena River|Palena]] and [[Puelo River]]s. He explored the [[Manso River (Argentina)|Manso]], [[Aisén River|Aisén]] and [[Cisnes River]]s from 1896 to 1898. He then moved on to explore the channels south of [[Taitao Peninsula]] ([[46th parallel south|46°S]]) mapping and describing the [[Gulf of Penas]], and then exploring and naming [[Baker River (Chile)|Baker]], [[Bravo River|Bravo]] and [[Pascua River]]s. He also crossed the [[Isthmus of Ofqui]]. Following the Pascua River, Steffen and his companions were the first to arrive at [[O'Higgins Lake]] from the Pacific as well the first to explore its western arms.

'''ISO 3166-2:GL''' is the entry for [[Greenland]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Greenland, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[municipalities of Greenland|5 municipalities]]. The [[Northeast Greenland National Park]] and the [[Thule Air Base]], which are unincorporated and not part of any municipality, are not listed.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GL}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Greenland. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (kl): [[Greenlandic language|Kalaallisut]]

'''John Norden''' ({{circa|1547}}{{snd}}1625) was an English [[cartographer]], [[chorography|chorographer]] and [[antiquarian|antiquary]]. He planned (but did not complete) a series of county maps and accompanying [[English county histories|county histories]] of England, the ''[[Speculum Britanniae]]''. He was also a prolific writer of devotional works.

==Life==
Norden is known to have been born in [[Somerset]], to a "genteel" family, but his family background is otherwise obscure. He entered [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hart Hall]], Oxford, in 1564; and graduated BA in 1568 and MA in 1573. He subsequently led a peripatetic existence, but for much of his life had his home in [[Middlesex]] on the outskirts of London: he was living in [[Walham Green]], Middlesex, in 1592; by 1607 he was at [[Hendon]], Middlesex, where he remained until 1619; and in the latter year he moved to the parish of [[St Giles in the Fields]], where he eventually died in 1625. He was married and had at least two sons, John Norden junior, and Josias.

==Chorography and cartography==

===The ''Speculum Britanniae''===
The first instalment of Norden's chorographical project was published in 1593 as the ''Speculum Britanniae: the First Parte: an Historicall, &amp; Chorographicall Discription of Middlesex''. The manuscript in the [[British Library]] (Harleian MS 570) has corrections in [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burleigh]]'s handwriting.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Norden, John|volume=19|page=740|first=Charles Raymond |last=Beazley|authorlink=Raymond Beazley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1595 he wrote a manuscript "Chorographical Description" of [[Middlesex]], Essex, [[Surrey]], Sussex, [[Hampshire]], [[Wight]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]], dedicated, and perhaps presented, to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] (now British Library Add. MS 21853). In 1596 he published his ''Preparative to the Speculum Britanniae'', dedicated to Burleigh. In 1598 there appeared the only other part of the project to reach print in his lifetime, ''Speculi Britaniae Pars: the Description of Hartfordshire''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He also completed accounts of five other counties in manuscript. Three of these were printed many years after his death: Essex, edited for the [[Camden Society]] in 1840 by [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Sir Henry Ellis]] from a manuscript at [[Hatfield House]]; Northamptonshire, known to have been finished in 1610, but not published until 1720; and [[Cornwall]], likewise finished in 1610, but published in 1728. The other two counties were [[Kent]] and Surrey: even the manuscripts for these are now lost, although the Surrey text would presumably have overlapped with that in the "Chorographical Description" of 1595.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Later survey work===
In 1600 Norden was appointed surveyor of the crown woods and forests in Berkshire, Devon, and Surrey; in 1605 he obtained the surveyorship of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]; and in 1607, after a careful survey, he composed his valuable ''Description of the Honor of Windsor'', with fine maps and plans in colour, dedicated to [[James I of England|James I]]. In 1608 he was mainly occupied with the surveying of crown woods, especially in Surrey, Berkshire and Devon, and with the writing of his works on forest culture ''Considerations touching... raising... of Coppices'', and ''Relation of... Proceedings upon... Commission concerning new forests'', to which he added in 1613 his Observations concerning Crown Lands and Woods.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1612 he was made surveyor of the royal castles in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Berkshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall; in 1616 and 1617 he appears surveying the soke of Kirketon in Lindsey, as well as various manors and lands belonging to Prince Charles, afterwards [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. His last works were a survey of Sheriff Hutton manor, Yorks, in 1624, and ''England, an intended guide for English travellers'', a series of tables to accompany [[John Speed|Speed's]] county maps, executed in 1625, shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Cartography===
Norden's maps of [[City of London|London]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] (in his ''Speculum Britanniae'' of 1593) are the best representations known of the English metropolis under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s; his maps of Middlesex (also from the ''Speculum Britanniae'' of 1593), of Essex (1594), of Hertfordshire (1598) and of Cornwall (published in 1728; see above) are also notable. In the last of these the roads are indicated for the first time in English cartography.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Norden also executed maps of Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex, for the fifth edition (1607) of [[William Camden|Camden]]'s ''Britannia''; and maps of Middlesex, Essex, Sussex, Surrey and Cornwall for [[John Speed]] (1610).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Several important cartographical works are lost. These include Norden's ''Map ... of Battles fought in England from ... William the Conqueror to Elizabeth'', in 16 sheets, formerly in the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian Gallery]], Oxford, of which elements are probably preserved in the ''Invasions of England'', an appendix to Speed's ''Prospect of the most Famous Parts of the World'' (1635); and his ''View of London'', in 8 sheets, made {{circa|lk=no|1604}}–6, and ''View of London Bridge'', published in 1624. An earlier ''View of London'' by Norden (1600), and an 1804 reprint of the ''View of London Bridge'', are held in the [[Frederick Crace|Crace]] collection at the [[British Library]]. A map of Surrey by Norden, said to have been copied by Speed and Kip in Camden's ''Britannia'' of 1607, has also disappeared.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Devotional writings==
Norden frequently experienced difficulty in finding patronage for his cartographical and chorographical work. A steadier source of income was his devotional writing, of which he published twenty-four volumes between 1582 and his death. ''A Pensive Mans Practise'', first published in 1584, reached more than forty editions in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He always kept the two areas of his professional life quite separate, and when in the late 1590s a series of dedications in his devotional works to the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] placed him in political difficulties with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] he attempted to deny authorship, claiming that the devotional books were the work of "another of my name ... [a] Norden pretender". This denial has caused historians some difficulty, but Frank Kitchen has established beyond doubt that there was only one John Norden.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Li Daoyuan''' ({{zh|t=酈道元|s=郦道元|p=Lì Dàoyuán}}; 466 or 472 in [[Zhuo County]], [[Hebei]] – 527) was a Chinese geographer, writer, and politician during the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]]. He is known as the author of the ''[[Commentary on the Water Classic]]'' (''Shuijingzhu''), a monumental work on China's geography in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Jing2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jing|first=Anning|title=The Water God's Temple of the Guangsheng Monastery: Cosmic Function of Art, Ritual and Theater|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XisCyZQIFDkC&amp;pg=PA108|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11925-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Li Daoyuan used his position as an official with business in different places to carry field investigations. He is known to have visited the area belonging to the present-day [[Henan]], [[Shandong]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Jiangsu]] provinces.&lt;ref name="chinaculture1"&gt;China Culture.org. "[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_madeinchina/2005-09/02/content_72434.htm Li Daoyuan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203150120/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_madeinchina/2005-09/02/content_72434.htm |date=2008-12-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaculture2"&gt;China Culture.org.

Another source for his knowledge was the study of ancient geographical books he had access to, like the ''[[Shan Hai Jing|Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' (''Shanhaijing'') completed by the time of the early [[Western Han Dynasty]]) and the ''[[Water Classic]]'' (''Shuijing''), written by Sang Qin during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] and later commentated on by Jin dynasty writer [[Guo Pu]]. Li vastly expanded the ''Water Classic'', doing his own research and fieldwork. The original ''[[Water Classic]]'' has not survived but covered 127 rivers and streams and contained about 10,000 characters;&lt;ref name="chinaculture1"/&gt; Li Daoyuan's ''Commentary on the Waterways Classic'' ([[Shui Jing Zhu]], discusses 1252 watercourses and contains about 300,000 characters in total.&lt;ref name=chinaculture2/&gt; The book maps and describes the rivers and streams along with the history, geography and culture of the surrounding region.

|url=http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&amp;dyna=%AD%F0&amp;king=%BE%CB%A9v&amp;reign=%A4%B8%A9M&amp;yy=9&amp;ycanzi=&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=&amp;dcanzi=%A4%FE%A4%C8|title=兩千年中西曆轉換|publisher=www.sinica.edu.tw|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[courtesy name]] '''Hongxian''' (弘憲), formally '''Duke Zhongyi of Zhao''' (趙忠懿公), was an official of the [[History of China|Chinese]] dynasty [[Tang Dynasty]], serving as a [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] during the reign of [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]].

== Background ==
Li Jifu was born in 758, during the reign of [[Emperor Suzong of Tang|Emperor Suzong]].&lt;ref name=BT148&gt;''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷148|vol. 148]].&lt;/ref&gt;  His family claimed ancestry from [[Li Mu]], a prominent general of the [[Warring States period]] state [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], and traced its ancestry through a line of officials of [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Han Dynasty]], [[Cao Wei]], [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)]], [[Northern Wei]], and [[Sui Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Book of Tang]]'', vol. 72.{{cite web |url=http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/072.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120085821/http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/072.htm |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}{{cite web |url=http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/table/form52.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620180609/http://sidneyluo.net/a/a17/table/form52.htm |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His grandfather Li Zai (李載) was not recorded to have carried any official titles, but his father Li Qiyun (李栖筠) was a prominent official during the reign of Emperor Suzong's son [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Emperor Daizong]] and served as chief imperial censor, carrying the title of Duke of Zanhuang.&lt;ref name=NBT146&gt;''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:新唐書/卷146|vol. 146]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Li Jifu himself was said to be studious in his youth and capable in writing.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;

== During Emperor Dezong's reign ==
In 784, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]], when Li Jifu was 26, Li Jifu became a ''Taichang Boshi'' (太常博士), a consultant at the ministry of worship (太常寺, ''Taichang Si''), and became known for his knowledge, especially the past Tang tradition, and was often praised for it.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;  In 786, when Emperor Dezong's wife [[Empress Wang (Dezong)|Empress Wang]] died, the regulation on the proper rituals were missing — as there had not been an empress who was mourned since the times of Emperor Suzong's father [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]].  Li Jifu planned the mourning ceremonies for Empress Wang, and was much praised by Emperor Dezong.&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;

Later, in addition to his ''Taichang Boshi'' title, Li Jifu was also made ''Tuntian Yuanwailang'' (屯田員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (工部, ''Gongbu''); he later became ''Jiabu Yuanwailang'' (駕部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of rite (禮部, ''Lǐbu'').  He was respected and treated well by the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]]s [[Li Mi (chancellor)|Li Mi]] and [[Dou Can]], but after [[Lu Zhi (Tang Dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] became chancellor, he suspected Li Jifu of engaging in partisanship and had him demoted to serve as the secretary general of Ming Prefecture (明州, in modern [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]]); later, after a general pardon had been issued, Li Jifu was promoted to be the prefect of Zhong Prefecture (忠州, in modern [[Chongqing]]).&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;  When Lu was himself exiled, it was said that Lu's rival chancellors wanted to harm him, and then intentionally had him demoted to be the secretary general of Zhong Prefecture — i.e., to serve as Li Jifu's subordinate.  Lu's family and friends were concerned deeply, but Li Jifu showed respect to Lu as if Lu were still a chancellor and caused him no harm.  The two eventually became friends.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷236|vol. 236]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Li Jifu served as Zhong Prefecture for six years without further movement, and was later removed on account of illness.  He later served as the prefect of either Liu Prefecture (柳州, in modern [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]])&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt; or Chen Prefecture (郴州, in modern [[Chenzhou]], [[Hunan]]), before serving as the prefect of Rao Prefecture (饒州, in modern [[Shangrao]], [[Jiangxi]]).  Previously, after four successive prefects had died, the fort that served as headquarters of Rao Prefectures had been abandoned as there were rumors that it was cursed.  When Li Jifu arrived, he removed the thorns that had grown up around the fort and moved in with no ill consequences, and the people were comforted.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;

== During Emperor Xianzong's reign ==

=== Prior to chancellorships ===
After Emperor Dezong's grandson [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]] became emperor in 805, Li Jifu was recalled to serve as ''Kaogong Langzhong'' (考功郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Lìbu, note different tone than the ministry of rites) and put in charge of drafting edicts.  Shortly after he arrived at the capital [[Chang'an]], he was made ''Hanlin Xueshi'' (翰林學士), an imperial scholar, and soon was further made ''Zhongshu Sheren'' (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, ''Zhongshu Sheng'').  During that time, he made several suggestions that caused him to gain further approval by Emperor Xianzong:&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;

* Early in Emperor Xianzong's reign, a long-time minor official at the legislative bureau, Hua Huan (滑渙), who was a close associate to the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] general Liu Guangqi (劉光琦), had much power due to his association with Liu, and Li suggested Hua's removal — which Emperor Xianzong carried out in 806.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷237|vol. 237]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* When the [[Li Qi (Tang Dynasty)|Li Qi]] the military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'') of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]) requested to also be the director of the salt and iron monopoly, Li Jifu pointed out that Li Qi was ambitious and rebellious and that giving him the economic benefits of running the monopolies would further strengthen him in case of a rebellion, and thus opposed the request.  Emperor Xianzong agreed with Li Jifu.&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;
* When the warlord [[Liu Pi (official)|Liu Pi]], who controlled Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]]), resisted Emperor Xianzong's rule, Li Jifu advised military action against Liu Pi,&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt; and further suggested diverting Liu's attention by directing southern troops through the [[Three Gorges]] while the main forces under [[Gao Chongwen]] were heading over the mountains.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;
* When, even before the campaign ultimately succeeded, another general who fought Liu Pi along with Gao, Yan Li (嚴礪), requested that a senior official be put in charge of Xichuan, Li Jifu pointed out that such a move would damage Gao's morale, and under Li Jifu's suggestion, Emperor Xianzong eventually made Gao the military governor of Xichuan while carving out six prefectures from Xichuan, transferring them to its neighbor Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern [[Mianyang]], [[Sichuan]]), and making Yan the military governor of Dongchuan.&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;
* When [[Tufan]] sought a formal treaty of friendship, Li Jifu pointed out that at the time Tang was allied with [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] against Tufan — and that such a treaty would cause Nanzhao to suspect Tang's good faith and damage the relationship with Nanzhao.  When Tufan further offered to return a number of towns that it had captured from Tang previously, Li Jifu pointed out that at that time, Tang had insufficient troops to defend them.  Emperor Xianzong thus declined Tufan's proposal.&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;

=== First chancellorship ===
In 807, when [[Du Huangchang]] was removed from his chancellor position, Li Jifu was made ''Zhongshu Shilang'' (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, and made ''de facto'' chancellor with the title ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' (同中書門下平章事), along with [[Wu Yuanheng]].  It was said that he was greatly touched and stated to his subordinate [[Pei Ji (Late Tang)|Pei Ji]]:&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt;

{{quote|I, Li Jifu, was left out in the wild in the [[Yangtze River]]-[[Huai River]] region for 15 years, and now that I have received such great imperial grace, I need to repay it.  The only way to do so is to recommend talented people to serve as officials.  I do not know the young officials well.  You, sir, are good at judging people; please find them for me.}}

Pei wrote out a list of over 30 people, and within a month, Li Jifu had them put into appropriate positions.  It was believed at the time that Li Jifu was a good judge of character.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt;  As he believed that the military governors at the time had too much power over their domains, he advocated granting the prefects under them greater power.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;  However, it was also said that Li Jifu, around that time, falsely accused fellow chancellor [[Zheng Yin (Middle Tang)|Zheng Yin]] of leaking secrets to the warlord Lu Congshi (盧從史), the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern [[Changzhi]], [[Shanxi]]), and that Emperor Xianzong did not act against Zheng only after the accusation was shown to be unreasonable by the imperial scholar [[Li Jiang]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt;

Late in 807, Li Jifu submitted a 10-volume work titled the ''Records of ''Yuanhe'' Imperial Accounts'' (''Yuanhe'' (元和) being Emperor Xianzong's [[era name]]) that contained detail accounts of the state of the various circuits of the empire, including the population and revenues.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt;

In 808, at a special [[imperial examinations]] where Emperor Xianzong ordered that low-level officials submit honest opinions about the government, several of the examinees — [[Niu Sengru]], [[Li Zongmin]], and Huangfu Shi (皇甫湜) stated, without using any veiled language, the issues they saw with the governance at the time.  The officials that Emperor Xianzong put in charge of the examinations, Yang Yuling (楊於陵) and [[Wei Guanzhi]] ranked them high.  However, Li Jifu saw these as severe criticisms of himself, and, weeping, accused the reviewing officials, the imperial scholars Pei Ji and [[Wang Ya]], of conflict of interest — as Huangfu was a nephew of Wang's.  As a result of Li Jifu's accusations, Wang, Pei, Yang, and Wei were all demoted, and it was said that while no harm came to Niu, Li Zongmin, and Huangfu at that time, they were effectively stuck at the positions they previously served without promotion.  As a result, they all sought positions as staff members of military governors.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt;  (However, Li Jifu's biographies in the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' viewed this event as part of the conspiracy by the senior official Pei Jun (裴均) to harm Li Jifu and to have Pei Jun made chancellor.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;)

Soon thereafter, there was another incident in which Li Jifu and the official Dou Qun (竇群) came into conflict.  Li Jifu had previously recommended the officials Yang Shi'e (羊士諤) and Lü Wen (呂溫), and because Dou was also friendly with Yang and Lü, he recommended them as well, without first informing Li Jifu.  Li Jifu became displeased and refused to act on Dou's recommendations, thus drawing Dou's resentment.  When Dou later found out that one Chen Keming (陳克明) — whom Dou believed to be a sorcerer but who could have been a physician — was visiting Li Jifu's household because Li Jifu was ill — he submitted an accusation to Emperor Xianzong that Li Jifu was associating with sorcerers.  When Emperor Xianzong investigated and found no proof of Li Jifu's guilt, Dou and his associates were exiled, but Li Jifu felt insecure and offered to resign, recommending Pei Ji to succeed him.  Emperor Xianzong agreed, and, in late 808, made Pei Ji chancellor and made Li Jifu the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]), and granted him various medical ingredients from the imperial pharmacy.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ237/&gt;

=== Between the chancellorships ===
While Li Jifu was at Huainan, it was said that he built Pingjin Dam (平津堰) and two ponds named Furen (富人) and Guben (固本), for irrigation purposes.  When the Yangtze-Huai region suffered a great drought, particularly hurting Li Jifu's neighboring circuits Zhexi (浙西, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang) and Zhedong (浙東, headquartered in modern [[Shaoxing]], [[Zhejiang]]), the central government agencies in charge did not act, and it was only after an extensive report by Li Jifu that Emperor Xianzong ordered disaster relief.  It was also said that Li Jifu often sent suggestions about important matters of state to Emperor Xianzong.&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;

In late 810, Pei Ji was removed from his chancellor position on account of illness, and in spring 811, Li Jifu was recalled to again serve as ''Zhongshu Shilang'' and chancellor.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ238&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷238|vol. 238]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also given the additional titles of ''Jinzi Guanglu Daifu'' (金紫光祿大夫), ''Shang Zhuguo'' (上柱國), and imperial scholar of Jixian Palace.  He was also put in charge of editing the imperial history and created the Duke of Zhao.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;

=== Second chancellorship ===
It was said that the people of the time looked forward to Li Jifu's return to chancellorship with great expectations.  However, it was also said that soon after his return to chancellorship, fellow chancellor [[Li Fan (Tang Dynasty)|Li Fan]] was removed, and Pei Ji was further demoted, due to his machinations.  Further, it was also said that he began to try to hide his acts from Emperor Xianzong.&lt;ref name=NBT146/&gt;  However, he was credited with advocating a major streamlining of government that saved expenses.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ238/&gt;

In 811, also at Li Jifu's recommendation — as Li Jifu pointed out that the imperial princes, due to various restrictions, were having difficulty finding appropriate husbands for their daughters and getting the marriages approved —  Emperor Xianzong created many princes' daughters ladies and ordered the government agencies to find appropriate gentlemen for them to marry.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ238/&gt;  However, by this point, Emperor Xianzong had heard that Li Jifu was using his office for personal vengeance, and so decided to make Li Jiang a chancellor as well to create a power balance.  Thereafter, Li Jifu and Li Jiang often had disputes, causing a rift between the two.  In 812, when the chancellors met with Emperor Xianzong, Li Jifu made a comment that the realm was becoming peaceful and that Emperor Xianzong should seek out some pleasure — when Li Jiang commented that there was still much warfare and natural disasters to deal with and it was no time to seek pleasure.  Emperor Xianzong approved of Li Jiang's remarks.  Li Jifu further became distressed when Emperor Xianzong criticized another chancellor, [[Yu Di]], for proposing harsh punishments — as Li Jifu had just himself proposed the same kind of harsher punishments.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ238/&gt;  On another occasion, however, when Emperor Xianzong met the chancellors, he commented to Li Jifu that he had just read in the imperial archives about the faithfulness of Li Jifu's father Li Qiyun and was impressed — causing Li Jifu to be touched, and he wept and thanked Emperor Xianzong.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;

Later in 812, when the warlord [[Tian Ji'an]], the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern [[Handan]], [[Hebei]]), died, Li Jifu advocated preparing for a campaign to retake Weibo by force, but Li Jiang advocated another strategy — simply refusing to commission Tian Ji'an's son [[Tian Huaijian]] as his successor and waiting for someone else to rise against Tian Huaijian from within Weibo itself.  Emperor Xianzong agreed with Li Jiang, and eventually, when Tian Ji'an's relative [[Tian Hongzheng|Tian Xing]] rose against Tian Huaijian, Emperor Xianzong commissioned Tian Xing as the new military governor as per Li Jiang's argument, overruling Li Jifu's argument that Tian Xing needed to be observed first; Weibo then began to follow imperial orders.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ238/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ239&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷239|vol. 239]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 813, when [[Huigu]] forces approached Tang borders and announced that they were going through Tang territory to attack Tufan, the border people were alarmed, believing that Huigu might be intending to attack them instead.  Li Jifu advocated not becoming overly alarmed, but simply repairing 11 border posts to watch them.  In 814, he further advocated the reestablishment of You Prefecture (宥州, in modern [[Yulin, Shaanxi]]), a special prefecture to settle the surrendered non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] tribes.  Emperor Xianzong approved his proposals.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ239/&gt;

In 814, when the warlord [[Wu Shaoyang]] the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern [[Zhumadian]], [[Henan]]), died, Li Jifu advocated preparing for military action to retake Zhangyi by force, rather than allowing Wu Shaoyang's son [[Wu Yuanji]] to succeed Wu Shaoyang — pointing out that, by contrast to the warlords north of the [[Yellow River]], Zhangyi was surrounded by circuits loyal to the imperial government.  By Li JIfu's recommendation, the headquarters of Zhangyi's neighbor Heyang Circuit (河陽, then-headquartered in modern [[Jiaozuo]], [[Henan]]), which was under imperial control and which was stationed in order to protect the eastern capital Luoyang from Weibo, was moved to Ru Prefecture (汝州, in modern [[Pingdingshan]], [[Henan]]), to prepare for action against Zhangyi.  When Wu Shaoyang's subordinate Yang Yuanqing met Li Jifu, Li Jifu persuaded him to report to the imperial government the strengths and weaknesses of the Zhangyi forces, for the imperial government to further prepare for the campaign.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ239/&gt;  While still preparing for the campaign, Li Jifu died.  Initially, the officials in charge of awarding [[posthumous names]] proposed ''Jingxian'' (敬憲, "alert and knowledgeable").  One of the junior officials, Zhang Zhongfang (張仲方) objected, arguing that that was too flattering.  Emperor Xianzong was displeased and exiled Zhang, but subsequently changed Li Jifu's posthumous name to ''Zhongyi'' ("faithful and benevolent").&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;  His sons Li Dexiu (李德修) and [[Li Deyu]] both later served in the imperial government, with Li Deyu becoming a prominent chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Xianzong's grandsons [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]] and [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]].&lt;ref&gt;''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷174|vol. 174]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written works ==
Li Jifu wrote commentaries on the ''[[I Ching]]''.  He also compiled a number of historical events from the [[Eastern Han]], Cao Wei, Jin, [[Northern Zhou]], and Sui, commenting on their successes and failures and the reasons, into a 30-volume work known as the ''Summaries of the Six Dynasties'' (六代略).  In addition to his ''Records of Yuanhe Imperial Accounts'', he also wrote a 54-volume work on the geographical features and histories of the various circuits, including maps, titling the work the ''Yuanhe Maps of the Commanderies and Principalities'' (元和郡國圖).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Old Book of Tang'' specifies 54 volumes, but an alternate name is '[[Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties]]' (元和郡縣圖志) which is listed as being 40 volumes plus a 2 volume table of contents.&lt;/ref&gt;  He further wrote a one-volume summary of imperial offices' responsibilities entitled the ''Key Points on Selecting Officials for the Hundred Offices'' (百司舉要).  He submitted these works to the emperor, but the works were also commonly known at the time.&lt;ref name=BT148/&gt;

{{Infobox Chinese|title=Little Cambodia|pic=Flag of Cambodia.svg|piccap=Cambodian enclaves are made up mostly of refugees from the country of [[Cambodia]] since the 1980s.}}
The term '''Little Cambodia''' (or '''Cambodia Town''') refers to an [[ethnic enclave]] of people from the country of [[Cambodia]].

Cambodian presence in the West traces back to the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonisation of Cambodia]] from the 1860s to mid-1950s, in which a number of Cambodians migrated to [[France]] as students or workers. This group formed the basis of the [[Cambodians in France|Cambodian population in France]].

While some were able to flee to France shortly after the [[Khmer Rouge]] took over in 1975, most Cambodians left their country after the regime in the 1980s, with most arriving in the [[United States]] (specifically to [[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]], [[California]]; [[Lowell, MA|Lowell]], [[Massachusetts]] and the [[New York City]] borough of the [[Bronx]]), as well as [[France]] (specifically to [[Paris]] and the surrounding [[Île-de-France]] region).&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/nyregion/thecity/20camb.html?_r=0|title=Little Cambodia, Growing Still Littler|work=[[New York Times]]|date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
===United States===
====Bronx, New York====
In [[the Bronx]], Little Cambodia is known for its "... spicy Cambodian noodle soup made with beef, shrimp and fish balls." The Cambodian population was mainly concentrated in the neighbourhoods of [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] and [[Bronx Park East]] areas. The Cambodian population in the Bronx and New York City has declined since the 1980s, as many of the Cambodian immigrants moved to California, Massachusetts and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

====Chamblee, Georgia====
* [[Buford Highway]] near [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], nicknamed "Chambodia" for the city is named [[Chamblee, Georgia]]. This is a common misnomer. There are actually very few Khmer businesses in the Buford Highway area. It is predominantly Chinese, Vietnamese, and Mexican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wpsrv/travel/index/stories/becton04181999.htm|title=Atlanta's 'Chambodia,' a 'Burb With a Global Flavor|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long Beach, California====
[[Cambodia Town, Long Beach, California]] "... is a neighborhood in Long Beach's East Side centered on Anaheim Street between Atlantic and Junipero."  The community has been around since 1959 which was made up of students from the nearby universities such as the [[University of Southern California]], [[UCLA]], and [[California State University at Los Angeles]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoeba.com/blog/2010/05/eric-s-blog/cambodia-town-long-beach-s-little-phnom-phen.html|title=Cambodia Town - Long Beach's Little Phnom Phen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lowell, Massachusetts====
* A business community in the Lower Highlands neighborhood of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lowellma.gov/newsitems/4-15-2012-CambodiaTown/|publisher=City of Lowell|title=City of Lowell Recognizes Cambodia Town|date=|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====White Center, Washington====
* White Center, a suburb of [[Seattle]], has a significant Cambodian-American community (642 Cambodian-Americans; 4.8% of the city's population). There are several Cambodian grocery stores, and [[Cambodian New Year]] is celebrated in this city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_QTP8&amp;prodType=table Race Reporting for the Asian Population by Selected Categories: 2010  more information], [[U.S. Census Bureau]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eskenazi, Stuart.

===France===
{{main|Cambodians in France}}
====Lognes====
With Asians comprising over 40% of the city's population, the Parisian suburb of [[Lognes]] has the highest proportion of [[Asians in France]] than any other city in the country. Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian business districts and community services are found throughout the commune. Cambodian community organisations, Buddhist temples and businesses are scattered around Lognes and Cambodians form the largest Asian group in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2005/09/30/comment-lognes-est-devenue-la-premiere-ville-asiatique-de-france_694539_3224.html Comment Lognes est devenue la première ville asiatique de France], [[Le Monde]]. 30 September 2005, (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mikea Forest''' (or '''Forêt des Mikea''') is a forested region of southwestern [[Madagascar]], between [[Manombo]] and [[Morombe]].&lt;ref name=GS451-452&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|Soarimalala|2005|pp=451–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, it stretches from [[Route Nationale 9 (Madagascar)|Route Nationale 9]] to the west coast and from [[Mangoky]] south to the [[Manombo River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicoll|2005|p=1436}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies at the transition between [[Madagascar dry deciduous forest|dry deciduous forest]], which is more common further north in Madagascar, and [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny forest]], which is dominant in southwestern Madagascar.&lt;ref name=GS451-452/&gt;  Its underlying geology is unconsolidated sand,&lt;ref name=2003DuPuy&gt;{{Harvnb|Du Puy|Moat|2003|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the region contains several freshwater lakes.&lt;ref name=2003Fenn&gt;{{Harvnb|Fenn|2005|p=1526}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forêt des Mikea is one of the largest remaining continuous forest blocks in western and southern Madagascar, but it is not protected and it is threatened by human development.&lt;ref name=GS462&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|Soarimalala|2005|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transitional terrain is one of the least protected of Madagascar's habitats.&lt;ref name=2003DuPuy/&gt;  This soil composition has resulted in a collection of plant and animal species, even distinct from adjacent vegetation on limestone.&lt;ref name=2003DuPuy&gt;{{Harvnb|Du Puy|Moat|2003|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small terrestrial mammals found here include the rodents ''[[Macrotarsomys bastardi]]'', ''[[Macrotarsomys petteri]]'', and the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''); the tenrecs ''[[Tenrec ecaudatus]]'', ''[[Setifer setosus]]'', ''[[Echinops telfairi]]'', ''[[Geogale aurita]]'', and ''[[Microgale jenkinsae]]''; and the shrew ''[[Suncus madagascariensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|Soarimalala|2005|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Macrotarsomys petteri'' and ''Microgale jenkinsae'' are unique to the forest and were only discovered in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=GS462/&gt;  The popular [[ring-tailed lemur]] (''Lemur catta'') also occurs in Mikea Forest, though it seems to always have been present in very low densities.  Since the habitat has started to disappear, the remaining populations appear to have become isolated.&lt;ref name="2006Gould"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|2006|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2000, of the 27&amp;nbsp;[[threatened species]] of bird in Madagascar, only two (''[[Monias benschi]]'' and ''[[Uratelornis chimaera]]'') were not found in protected areas, but both were fairly common within the unprotected forests of Mikea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hawkins|Goodman|2003|p=1043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Monias benschi'' had an estimated population of 115,000, while the ''Uratelornis chimaera'' population was estimated at fewer than 15,000.&lt;ref name=2003Hawkins&gt;{{Harvnb|Hawkins|Seddon|2003|p=1098}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A survey published in 2005 reported that 59&amp;nbsp;species of reptile were identified near the eastern shore of Lake Ranobe in the southern Mikea Forest, five of which were [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|D'Cruze|Sable|2005|6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these species include ''[[Matoatoa brevipes]]'', ''[[Oplurus fierinensis]]'', ''[[Furcifer antimena]]'', ''[[Furcifer belalandaensis]]'', ''[[Phelsuma standingi]]'', and ''[[Pyxis arachnoides]]''.  The flora includes the [[Adansonia|baobab]]s ''[[Adansonia za]]'' and ''[[Adansonia rubrostipa|A. rubrostipa]]''.&lt;ref name=2003Fenn/&gt;

Between the 1960s and the 2000s, forest cover had declined by 16% and [[deforestation]] was accelerating, having doubled in the last five years of that time period.  The factors behind the deforestation at that time were [[slash and burn]] agriculture for [[maize]] cultivation in the northern regions of the forest and [[charcoal]] production in the southern regions.  As of 2000, recommendations had been made to establish a large [[protected area]], to provide aid to improve agriculture, and to establish a network of community-based conservation areas.&lt;ref name=2003Hawkins/&gt;  In 2001, [[Madagascar National Parks]], known then as ANGAP, was considering a new national park in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicoll|2005|p=1437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008, a [[national park]] encompassing {{convert|184,630|ha|sqmi}} in two parcels had been submitted to the Supreme Council for Nature Protection (a state entity that deals with natural resource management) and was in the process of being finalized.&lt;ref name=FASR9&gt;{{Harvnb|Blanc-Pamard|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Numa Numa''' is a mission on [[Bougainville Island]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. It has a nearby harbour known as the Numa Numa Harbour on the eastern coast of Bougainville Island on the [[Pacific Ocean]] and is located near Wakunai, Teperoi and Casuarina Island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mapcarta.com/16524490 Mapcarta: Numa Numa, Papua New Guinea]&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby is the [[Wakunai Airport]].

Numa Numa borders the [[Numa Numa Trail]], that starts running from Numa Numa on the east coast over the central mountains of Bougainville to Torokina on the western coast. The trail was central to the Torokina perimeter defence during the initial phases of the Bougainville campaign during World War II with a number of battles fought along the trail.

After the [[Spanish conquest of El Salvador|Spanish conquest]], the land was baptized by Spanish conquistadors as "Provincia De Nuestro Señor Jesucristo El Salvador Del Mundo" ("Province of Our Lord Jesus Christ, The Savior Of The World"), now abbreviated as "República de El Salvador". The country borders the [[Pacific Ocean]] between [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]]. With a population of approximately 5.8 million people, it is the most densely populated nation in Central America and is undergoing rapid [[industrialization]].

The '''prehistory of the Levant''' includes the various cultural changes that occurred, as revealed by archaeological evidence, prior to recorded traditions in the area of the [[Levant]]. Archaeological evidence suggests that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and other hominid species originated in Africa (see [[Recent African origin of modern humans|hominid dispersal]]) and that one of the routes taken to colonize Eurasia was through the Sinai desert and the Levant, which means that this is one of the most important and most occupied locations in the history of earth. 
Not only have many cultures and traditions of humans lived here, but also many species of the genus ''[[Homo]]''. In addition, this region is one of the centers for the development of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Yosef|first1=Yosef|title=The Natufian culture in the Levant, threshold to the origins of agriculture.|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|date=1998|issue=6.5|pages=159–177|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6505(1998)6:5&lt;159::aid-evan4&gt;3.0.co;2-7|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultures==
The earliest traces of the human occupation in the Levant are documented in [[Ubeidiya]] Israel in the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan Valley]] of the [[Southern Levant]], dated to the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] period, {{circa|1.4&amp;nbsp;million years ago|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Yosef|title=The lower paleolithic of the Near East|date=1994|issue=8|pages=211–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stone tool|lithic]] assemblages relate to the Early [[Acheulian]] culture. Later Acheulian sites include [[Bnot Ya'akov Bridge|Gesher Benot Ya'akov]], [[Tabun Cave]] and others dated to the time span of {{circa|1,400,000|250,000 years ago}}.  This layer contains the world's first signs of [[domestication|domesticated]] [[dog]]s and controlled usage of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goren-Inbar |first1=Naama |last2=Alperson |first2=Nira |last3=Kislev |first3=Mordechai E. |last4=Simchoni |first4=Orit |last5=Melamed |first5=Yoel |last6=Ben-Nun |first6=Adi |last7=Werker |first7=Ella |date=30 April 2004 |title=Evidence of Hominin Control of Fire at Gesher Benot Ya`aqov, Israel |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5671 |pages=725–727 |doi=10.1126/science.1095443 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/304/5671/725.short |accessdate=February 7, 2001 |pmid=15118160|bibcode = 2004Sci...304..725G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Serpell, The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour, and interactions with people, pp 10-12. Cambridge University Press, 1995, see also [Haaretz http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/tourist-tip-of-the-day/tourist-tip-237-the-prehistoric-man-museum-at-ma-ayan-baruch.premium-1.524213]&lt;/ref&gt; Lower Palaeolithic human remains from the Southern Levant are scarce; they include isolated teeth from 'Ubeidiya, long bone fragments from Gesher Benot Ya'akov, and a fragmentary skull from [[Zuttiyeh Cave]]  ("The [[Galilee Man]]").

The [[Middle Palaeolithic]] period ({{circa|250,000|48,000&amp;nbsp;BCE}}) is represented in the Levant by the [[Mousterian]] culture, known from numerous sites (both caves and open-air sites) through the region. The chronological subdivision of the [[Mousterian]] is based on the stratigraphic sequence of the Tabun Cave. Middle Paleolithic human remains include both the [[Neanderthal]]s (in [[Kebara Cave]], [[Amud Cave]] and Tabun), and [[Homo sapiens|anatomically modern humans]] (AMH) from [[Jebel Qafzeh remains|Jebel Qafzeh]] and [[Es Skhul|Skhul Cave]].

The [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period is dated in the Levant to {{circa|48,000|20,000&amp;nbsp;BCE}}.

[[Epi-Palaeolithic]] period ({{circa|20,000|9,500&amp;nbsp;[[Calibrated years|cal.]]&amp;nbsp;BCE}}) is characterized by significant cultural variability and wide spread of the [[microlith]]ic technologies. Beginning with the appearance of the Kebaran culture (18,000–12,500&amp;nbsp;BCE) a microlithic toolkit was associated with the appearance of the bow and arrow into the area.  Kebaran shows affinities with the earlier Helwan phase in the Egyptian Fayyum, and may be associated with a movement of people across the Sinai associated with the climatic warming after the Late Glacial Maxima of 20,000 BCE.  Kebaran affiliated cultures spread as far as Southern Turkey.  The latest part of the period ({{circa|12,500|9,500&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|cal.|calibrated years before present}}&amp;nbsp;BCE}}) is the time of flourishing of the [[Natufian]] culture and development of [[sedentism]] among the [[hunter-gatherers]].

=== Natufian===
{{Main|Natufian culture}}
This Culture existed from about 13,000 to 9,800 BCE in the Levant. A lot of archaeological excavations of this culture creates a relatively well defined understanding of these people. Two of the most significant aspects of this Culture were their large community sizes and their sedentary lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Yosef|first1=Ofer|title=The origins of sedentism and farming communities in the Levant.|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|date=1989|pages=447–498|doi=10.1007/bf00975111|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Late Natufian experienced a slight reversal in this trend (possibly a result of the cold climatic period the [[Younger Dryas]]) as their community size shrank and they became more nomadic, it is believed that this culture continued through and was the foundation for the [[Neolithic Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Yosef|first1=Ofer|title=On the nature of transitions: the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic and the Neolithic Revolution|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date=1998|volume=8|pages=141–163|doi=10.1017/s0959774300001815|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12211496/S0959774300001815a%202.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neolithic period ===

The [[Neolithic period]] is traditionally divided to the Pre-Pottery ([[PPNA|A]] and [[PPNB|B]]) and [[Pottery Neolithic|Pottery]] phases. PPNA developed from the earlier Natufian cultures of the area.  This is the time of the [[Neolithic revolution|agricultural transition]] and development of [[farming]] economies in the [[Near East]], and the region's first known [[Megalith#Middle Eastern megaliths|megaliths]] (and Earth's oldest known megalith, other than [[Gobekli Tepe]], which is in the [[Northern Levant]] and from an unknown culture) with a burial chamber and [[archaeoastronomy|tracking of the sun or other stars]].

In addition, the Levant in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic was involved in large scale, far reaching trade. Obsidian found in the Chalcolithic levels at Gilat, Israel have had their origins traced via elemental analysis to three sources in Southern Anatolia: Hotamis Dağ, Göllü Dağ, and as far east as Nemrut Dağ itself {{cvt|500|km}} East of the other two sources. This is indicative of a very large trade circle reaching as far as the Northern Fertile Crescent at Nemrut Dağ and as far north as Hotamis Dağ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yellin|first1=Joseph|last2=Levy|first2=Thomas E.|last3=Rowan|first3=Yorke M.|title=New Evidence on Prehistoric Trade Routes: The Obsidian Evidence from Gilat, Israel|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|date=1996|volume=23|issue=3|pages=361–368|doi=10.1179/009346996791973873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ghassulian]] period created the basis of the Mediterranean economy which has characterised the area ever since.  A [[Chalcolithic]] culture, the [[Ghassulian]] economy was a mixed agricultural system consisting of extensive cultivation of grains (wheat and barley), intensive [[horticulture]] of vegetable crops, commercial production of vines and olives, and a combination of [[transhumance]] and [[nomadic pastoralism]].  The Gassulian culture, according to [[Juris Zarins]], developed out of the earlier [[Munhata]] phase of what he calls the ''"circum Arabian nomadic pastoral complex"'', probably associated with the first appearance of [[Semitic languages|Semites]] in this area.

Geographically the area is divided between a coastal plain, hill country to the East and the Jordan Valley joining the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.  Rainfall decreases from the north to the south, with the result that the northern region of Israel has generally been more economically developed than the southern one of Judah.

The area's location at the center of three [[trade route]]s linking three continents made it the meeting place for religious and cultural influences from [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Asia Minor]]:

# A Coastal Route (the "''[[Via Maris]]''"): connecting [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and the [[Philistine]] coast north to [[Jaffa|Joppa]] and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], travelling north through [[Byblos]] to [[Phoenicians|Phoenicia]] and [[Anatolia]].
# A Hill Route: travelling through the [[Negev]], [[Kadesh Barnea]], to [[Hebron]] and [[Jerusalem]], and thence north to [[Samaria]], [[Shechem]], [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]], [[Beth Shean]] and [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], and thence to [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and [[Damascus]].
# The [[King's Highway (ancient)|"Kings Highway"]]: travelling north from [[Eilat]], east of the Jordan through [[Amman]] to [[Damascus]], and connected to the "[[frankincense]] road" north from [[Yemen]] and South Arabia.

The area seems to have suffered from acute periods of desiccation, and reduced rainfall which has influenced the relative importance of settled versus nomadic ways of living.  The cycle seems to have been repeated a number of times during which a reduced rainfall increases periods of fallow, with farmers spending increasing amounts of time with their flocks and away from cultivation.  Eventually they revert to fully nomadic cultures, which, when rainfall increases settle around important sources of water and begin to spend increasing amounts of time on cultivation.  The increased prosperity leads to a revival of inter-regional and eventually international trade.  The growth of villages rapidly proceeds to increased prosperity of market towns and city states, which attract the attention of neighbouring great powers, who may invade to capture control of regional trade networks and possibilities for tribute and taxation.  Warfare leads to opening the region to pandemics, with resultant depopulation, overuse of fragile soils and a reversion to nomadic pastoralism.

==Early and Middle Bronze Age==

The urban development of Canaan lagged considerably behind that of Egypt and Mesopotamia and even that of Syria, where from 3,500 BCE a sizable city developed at [[Hamoukar]].  This city, which was conquered, probably by people coming from the Southern Iraqi city of [[Uruk]], saw the first connections between Syria and Southern Iraq that some&lt;ref&gt;Bright, John (2000)"A History of Israel" (John Knox Press Westminster)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albright, William F. "From Abraham to Ezra"&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested lie behind the patriarchal traditions.  Urban development again began culminating in the [[Early Bronze Age]] development of sites like [[Ebla]], which by 2,300 BCE was incorporated once again into an Empire of [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]], and then [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] (Biblical Accad).  The archives of Ebla show reference to a number of Biblical sites, including [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Jerusalem]], and a number of people have claimed, also to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], mentioned in the patriarchal records.  The collapse of the Akkadian Empire, saw the arrival of peoples using [[Khirbet Kerak]] Ware pottery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientneareast.net/wares_kerak.html See]&lt;/ref&gt; coming originally from the [[Zagros Mountains]], east of the [[Tigris]].  It is suspected by some [https://web.archive.org/web/20070615144724/http://www.hindunet.org/saraswati/html/urseals.htm] that this event marks the arrival in Syria and Palestine of the [[Hurrians]], people later known in the Biblical tradition possibly as [[Horites]].

The following [[Middle Bronze Age]] period was initiated by the arrival of "[[Amorites]]" from Syria in Southern Iraq, an event which people like Albright (above) associated with the arrival of Abraham's family in Ur.  This period saw the pinnacle of urban development in the area of Syria and Palestine.  Archaeologists show that the chief state at this time was the city of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], which may have been the capital of the region of Israel.  This is also the period in which Semites began to appear in larger numbers in the Nile delta region of Egypt.

A massive launch pedestal, made up of steel plates, acts as the base on which the vehicle is integrated."&lt;ref name="ISRO facility info"&gt;Public domain text sourced from the link - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090816101611/http://www.isro.org/GroundFacilities/launchfacility.aspx ISRO Launch Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The spacecraft is integrated to the vehicle in a clean room, set up inside the MST. However, in the case of GSLV, the spacecraft is interfaced with the payload adopter and then encapsulated in the heat shield in the preparation facility itself. The encapsulated assembly is moved to the launch pad for integrating with the 3rd stage of GSLV. The umbilical tower houses the feed lines for liquid propellants and high-pressure gases, checkout cables, and chilled air duct for supplying cool air to the satellite and equipment bay."&lt;ref name="ISRO facility info"/&gt;

The first launch pad is undergoing major expansion with PIF (PSLV Integration Facilities) project worth {{INRConvert|475|c|lk=on}} . Once complete, the first launch pad is expected to cater to around 15 launches per year.

The '''Serra do Divisor National Park''' ({{lang-pt|Parque Nacional da Serra do Divisor}})  is a {{Convert|8463|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} [[National park (Brazil)|national park]] on the westernmost point of [[Brazil]], in the [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Acre (state)|Acre]], near the [[Peru]]vian border. It also has the highest point in that state, reaching 609 meters above sea level. It has been nominated by the Brazilian government as a Tentative [[World Heritage Site]] since 1998.

==Location==
[[File:West Acre Brazil conservation units 2016.svg|thumb|300px|Conservation units in the west of Acre.&lt;br/&gt;9. Serra do Divisor National Park]]

The Serra do Divisor National Park is divided between the municipalities of [[Rodrigues Alves, Acre|Rodrigues Alves]] (13.45%), [[Porto Walter]] (26.99%), [[Marechal Thaumaturgo]] (4.73%), [[Mâncio Lima]] (31.71%) and [[Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre|Cruzeiro do Sul]] (23.12%) in the state of Acre.
It has an area of {{convert|846633|ha}}.{{sfn|PARNA da Serra do Divisor – ISA|loc=Informações gerais}}
The park is bounded to the west by the border with Peru, which runs along the Serra Divisor mountain range.
It adjoins the [[Alto Juruá Extractive Reserve]] along its southeast border.
The [[Juruá River]] defines the eastern boundary of the southern section of the park.
The [[Azul River (Acre)|Azul River]] defines the eastern boundary of the northern section.{{sfn|PARNA da Serra do Divisor – ISA|loc=Informações gerais (mapa)}}
The conservation unit would be included in the proposed [[Western Amazon Ecological Corridor]].{{sfn|Ayres|Da Fonseca |Rylands|Queiroz|2005|p=32}}

Main access is by boat, on the Moa or Jurua rivers, from the City of [[Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre|Cruzeiro do Sul]]. It has no tourism infrastructure.

==History==

The Serra do Divisor National Park was created by decree 97.839 on 16 June 1989 to protect and preserve sample of ecosystems, ensure preservation of its natural resources, and allow controlled use by the public, education and scientific research.{{sfn|PARNA da Serra do Divisor – ISA|loc=Historico Juridico}}
The consultative council was created on 5 July 2002.
The management plan was approved on 24 December 2002.{{sfn|PARNA da Serra do Divisor – ISA|loc=Historico Juridico}}
In 2013, [[Rainforest Trust]] launched a campaign to fund the establishment of another national park in the same area on the Peruvian side of the border.{{sfn|Rhett Butler|2013}}
The conservation unit is supported by the [[Amazon Region Protected Areas Program]].{{sfn|Full list: PAs supported by ARPA}}

==Environment==

The park is in the [[Southwest Amazon moist forests]] ecoregion.{{sfn|Southwest Amazon moist forests – Myers}}

=== Climate ===
The climate is hot and humid tropical, with one to two month dry season. The average temperature in a year is over {{convert|24|C}}.
Annual rainfall is {{convert|1750|to|2000|mm}}.

===Terrain===
Altitudes range from {{convert|200|to|600|m}}. Hilly and mountainous with large [[alluvial plains]] and some low tabular plateaus. Separating the two basins of Rio [[Ucayali]] (Peru) and [[Juruá River|Juruá]] (Brazil), the Park shelters main sources of Jurua 's left margin affluent. It is structured in four main hill [[massif]]s (Serras da Jaquirana, do Moa, do Jurua-Mirim &amp; do Rio Branco), separated by flat plains and valleys of the corresponding affluent of the Juruá basin. Margins of the lower section of the Juruá and [[Moa River|Moa]] rivers are regularly to permanently inundated, having many lakes, [[igapó]]s and [[igarapé]]s. Higher up, are found some tabular well drained areas (250 m). Higher still, the landscape is mostly made of hills of up to 300 m with poorly marked valleys. The four sierras culminate up to 600 m, with asymmetric [[limestone]] crests dividing the basins.

===Wild life===
Vegetation: Rapid ecological assessment survey in 1991 characterised 10 forest types within the Park and recorded biodiversity. Most of the area is covered by open rainforest with palm trees or bamboos, dense and open sub-mountain rainforests, and dense and open alluvial rainforests (Periodically-inundated forests). All forest types show quite differentiated structure, flora and tree species dominance. Open forest grows on poorly drained, wet or inundated soils. Palm-trees become more frequent on wetter soils. On dryer soils grow the dense lowland rainforests (Not-flooded forests) Open sub-mountain forests grow on the lower hillsides. Dense sub-mountain forests appear on the higher slopes. On the tops grows a " Low forest" with typical and rare sub-Andean species. Open alluvial forests grow on river margins frequently inundated by muddy waters. Dense alluvial forests appear in less frequently inundated areas.

Fauna: Rapid Ecological Assessment allowed to count in one month: 43 large mammal species, more than 100 amphibian and 30 reptile species, 485 bird species, 6 families, 33 genres and 55 species of bats, 21 genres and 64 species of [[Hymenoptera|Hymenopteres]], and finally: 29 spider families (in the northern sector of the park, only). Of these, 17 mammals, 4 reptiles and 20 birds are considered to be threatened or rare species. Two new bird species were discovered. Local Population 1.200 families.

==People==

Amazonian population live within or just at the margin of the Park's limits, most of whom have been collecting [[rubber]] for several generations. Low rubber prices induced these populations to start new and unsustainable activities, like cow ranching, timber cutting, commercial hunting and fishing and animal capturing, as well as [[fossils]] and stones trade. These activities are still incipient. It is planned to remove most of the population towards other, more favourable areas. The remaining population, having deep knowledge of the area, may be involved in the Park's surveillance, maintenance and tourism activities.

'''Stan Openshaw''' (born 10 August 1946) is a retired British [[geographer]]. His last post was professor of [[human geography]] based in the [[School of Geography, University of Leeds|School of Geography]] at the [[University of Leeds]]. After eighteen years at [[Newcastle University]], including three years as professor of [[quantitative geography]], he moved to work in Leeds in 1992. Stan was a researcher in computer-based [[geography]] and his work aimed to automate aspects of geographical research and reduce subjectivity in geographical analyses. He worked on geographical information systems, analysis technology and models. He debated the direction geography should take putting forward a view that the subject needed an applied and scientific edge that harnessed the growing power of computers to make positive impacts to help us avoid and mitigate risk and cope better with disasters.

In 1992 he set up the [[Centre for Computational Geography]] (CCG)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk
| title       = Centre for Computational Geography Web Site
| accessdate  = 18 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[inter-disciplinary]] unit at the [[University of Leeds]], an organisation dedicated to bringing computers to bear on complex social and physical problems. Stan directed the CCG for seven years until suffering a severely disabling stroke in 1999 after which he was retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title       = University of Leeds The Reporter Issue 474, 3 December 2001 Professor Stanley Openshaw Article (following Stan's official retirement)
| accessdate  = 24 May 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stan became a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and a [[Chartered Statistician]] in 1993, a Fellow of the [[Institute of Statisticians]] in 1983 and was a Member of the [[British Computer Society]] from 1983.

In 2012 at the GISRUK conference in Lancaster a special session was arranged to celebrate his work and geographical career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.lancs.ac.uk/gisruk2012/openshaw.php
| title      =  GISRUK 2012 Special Session in Celebration of Stan Openshaw's Work
| accessdate  = 7 November 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his major, disabling stroke in 1999 Stan has struggled to communicate verbally and get around.
  
==Education==
* PhD, Geography, [[Newcastle University]], 1974
* B.A. (first class) honours degree, Geography, [[Newcastle University]], 1968
* Stan was a pupil at [[Argyle House School]] in Sunderland

==Scholarship==
Stan's "Southern – [[East Lothian]]" B.A. Honours Geography Thesis has six chapters describing the physical and socio-economic geography of the region in the south east of [[Scotland]]. It contains tables of data, maps, aerial and ground level photographs, diagrams, statistical analysis, considerable description and details of two surveys (one about tourism which Stan aimed at tourists in Dunbar, and another about agriculture which Stan aimed at farmers). It may be that there is more than one copy of this thesis produced in 1968 and submitted to [[Newcastle University]], but it would not be surprising for Stan to have kept a copy. A copy is stored with other artefacts of Stan's in a collection called "The Stan Openshaw Collection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/people/s.openshaw/collection/
| title       = The Stan Openshaw Collection
| accessdate  = 18 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the physical manifestation of which resides for the time being at the [[University of Leeds]].

Stan's "Processes in [[urban morphology]] with special reference to [[South Shields]]" PhD Thesis is archived at the [[British Library]] as [[microfilm]] no. : D10191/74. The thesis submitted to Newcastle University was completed in December 1973. It was compiled over several years (and for at least the latter part) whilst Stan worked in the Planning Department at Durham County Council. Stan wrote an abstract of the thesis and keeps it with his copy of the work. The abstract has now been reproduced on-line on his [[Centre for Computational Geography|CCG]] PhD Web Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/people/s.openshaw/projects/phd/
| title       = Stan Openshaw's PhD Web Page
| accessdate  = 24 May 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stan's research career blossomed in the Department of Town and Country Planning at [[Newcastle University]], where, during the 1970s he worked on zone design methodology, for regional based administration, and for the analysis of socio-economic data in geographical and planning contexts. During the same period he developed a way to estimate death or kill rates of various nuclear bombing strategies evolving computerised techniques for identifying locations with the highest concentration of something. In the 1980s he pioneered the use of [[multimedia]] [[geographical information systems]] by spearheading the [[BBC Domesday Project]].

Stan strove to remove human bias from the scientific process and was a strong believer in human-competitive machine intelligence. In the late 1980s and through the 1990s he worked to develop automated geographical analysis tools and "geographical explanation machines", which aimed to assist human researchers in the formation of hypotheses about the causes of [[geographical clusters]] and patterns in data. Stan introduced [[genetic programming]] to geography and demonstrated the predictive capabilities of [[artificial intelligence]] techniques and the modelling and inference capabilities of [[fuzzy logic]]. Perhaps his best known contributions, however, were to the field of [[geodemographics]] and [[location modelling]], working on the classification of groups of people and the development of [[spatial analysis|spatial interaction model]] technology for analysing networks of demand and supply.

In 1996, as the World Wide Web began to blossom, Stan encouraged a growing global community of computational geographers to meet for a first international [[GeoComputation]] conference which was hosted at the University of Leeds in 1997. The event was a great success and initialised a series of international conferences that is still on-going (see the [http://www.geocomputation.org GeoComputation Conference Series Home Page] for details).

The '''Taiwan Strait''', or '''Formosa Strait''', is a {{convert|180|km}}-wide [[strait]] separating the island of [[Formosa|Taiwan]] from [[mainland China]]. The strait is part of the [[South China Sea]] and connects to the [[East China Sea]] to the north.&lt;ref name="IHO"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf |title = Limits of Oceans and Seas |id = Special Publication No. 23 |edition=3rd |year = 1953 |publisher = [[International Hydrographic Organization]] |location = [[Monaco]] |page = 33 |accessdate = 7 February 2010}} The [[East China Sea]] is bounded on the south by "The Northern limit of the [[South China Sea]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;From [[Cape Fugui|Fuki Kaku]] the North point of [[Formosa]] to [[Kiushan Tao]] (Turnabout Island) on to the South point of [[Pingtan Island|Haitan Tao]] (25°25' N) and thence Westward on the parallel of 25°24' North to the coast of [[Fujian|Fukien]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, thence from [[Cape San Diego|Santyo]] the Northeastern point of Formosa to the West point of [[Yonaguni|Yonakuni Island]] and thence to [[Hateruma|Haderuma Sima]] (24°03′ N, 123°47′ E)."&lt;/ref&gt; The narrowest part is {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/chpt01-1.htm |title = Geography |publisher = [[Government Information Office]] |accessdate = 23 January 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229223825/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/chpt01-1.htm |archivedate = 29 December 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of China's [[Fujian]] Province is west of the strait, having the main islands of [[Kinmen]], [[Xiamen Island|Xiamen]] (a major city overspilling into the mainland and including [[Gulangyu Island]]), [[Pingtan Island|Pingtan]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] just off its coast. The [[Penghu]] or Pescadores Islands lie in the east of the strait. Fishermen use the strait as a fishing resource.  All of Fujian's rivers (the largest being the [[Min River (Fujian)|Min]] and, second-largest, the [[Jiulong River|Jiulong]]) run into the strait, except the [[Ting River|Ting]]. Taiwan's government administers Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.  The strait is on the continental shelf, it is almost entirely less than 150&amp;nbsp;m deep, with a brief ravine of that depth off the south-west of Taiwan. It hosts major shipping lanes including over a bank, around 25&amp;nbsp;m in depth (40&amp;ndash;60km north of the Penghu archipelago).&lt;ref&gt;http://map.openseamap.org Sea depth map.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Strait has been the theatre for several military confrontations between the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLAN]] and [[ROCN]] since the last days of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 when the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) forces led by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] retreated across the Strait and relocated [[Government of the Republic of China|their government]] to their final stronghold of Taiwan.  A theoretical median maritime border known as the cross-strait median ({{lang|zh-hant|海峽中線}}) also exists on the water to prevent certain transportation from passing.&lt;ref&gt;Chinareviewnews.com. "[http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1010/1/9/2/101019206.html?coluid=5&amp;kindid=23&amp;docid=101019206&amp;mdate=0711085827 Chinareviewnews.com]." ''大公報文章："海峽中線"應該廢除.''

As part of the People's Republic of China's National Expressway Plan, a tunnel or possibly a bridge, was [[Taiwan Strait Tunnel Project|proposed]] in 2005 to link the city of [[Fuzhou]] with [[Taipei]] across the strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.czstation.net/upimg/allimg/081208/1304390.jpg |work = China Rail Department |location = China |title = Medium to Long Term Rail Network Plan for PRC |first = China |last = China |date = 1 December 2008 |accessdate = 24 May 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070149/http://www.czstation.net/upimg/allimg/081208/1304390.jpg |archivedate = 23 July 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; If such an extreme construction were ever built, it would by far exceed the length of any man-made tunnel in the world today. Engineers in Beijing state that a tunnel is technically feasible. However, the [[Republic of China]] government in Taiwan has refused to open direct links out of concern for Taiwan's security and in fear that by doing so it would have to recognize the People's Republic of China's [[one-China policy]], since [[Two Chinas|China split into two]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and they still have an [[cross-strait relations|adversarial relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Front_Page/GA14Aa01.html |title = Mainland to triple highway network |last = Wu |first = Zhong |date = 14 January 2005 |work = The Standard |accessdate = 13 December 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223090134/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Front_Page/GA14Aa01.html |archive-date = 23 December 2007 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/08/china.johngittings |newspaper = The Guardian  |location = London |title = Plans unveiled in China for Taiwan tunnel |first = John |last = Gittings |date = 8 April 2002 |accessdate = 24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas (Tom) Henry Manning''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (11 December 1911 – 8 November 1998) was a British-Canadian [[Arctic]] explorer, [[Biology|biologist]], [[Geography|geographer]], [[Zoology|zoologist]], and author.  Appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]], Manning held the positions of vice-chairman and Executive Director of the [[Arctic Institute of North America]]. Nicknamed the ''Lone Wolf of the Arctic'', he was known for travelling alone with dog sled and canoe.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Early years==
Manning, son of a well-to-do farmer and a well-known cricketer, was born 11 December 1911 in Dalling, [[Northampton]], England.  He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/25/world/thomas-manning-86-explorer-known-as-lone-wolf-of-arctic.html|title=Thomas Manning, 86, Explorer Known as Lone Wolf of Arctic|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|date=25 November 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1931, he travelled in [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. The following year, he hiked from France to Norway, then hiked and rode reindeer through Sweden and Finland.  After arriving in the former USS.R, he was arrested and imprisoned, before being deported.&lt;ref name="aina" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1933, Manning travelled to [[Hudson Bay]]'s [[Southampton Island]].  Here, he surveyed and conducted geographical research for the Royal Geographical Society, and studied birds for the [[British Museum]]. Three years later, he led the British-Canadian Arctic Expedition, serving as the expedition's surveyor and zoologist.&lt;ref name="aina"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macpherson|first=Andrew H.|date=March 1999|title=Thomas Henry Manning (1911–1998)|journal=Arctic|publisher=Arctic Institute of North American|volume=52|issue=1|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic52-1-104.pdf|doi=10.14430/arctic913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Manning was commissioned as a lieutenant with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].  He worked as a [[cipher]] officer and developed arctic clothing.  In 1942, he was seconded to the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] to consult on the construction of an airfield on Southampton Island, and in 1944, he was seconded to the Geodetic Service of Canada for photo surveys. He retired from military service as a lieutenant commander in 1945.&lt;ref name="aina" /&gt;

After the war, Manning worked for the Canadian Geodetic Survey, [[Defence Research Board]], [[National Museum of Canada]], and the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]]. He led several expeditions during this time. Manning was director of the Arctic Institute of North America in 1955–1956.&lt;ref name="Doris" /&gt;

He was mentor to and lifelong friend of the zoologist, Andrew Hall Macpherson.&lt;ref name="Macpherson "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=F.L. |date=December 2002|title=Andrew Hall Macpherson (1932–2002) |journal=Arctic|publisher=Arctic Institute of North America|volume=55|issue=4|url=http://www.aina.ucalgary.ca/scripts/minisa.dll/144/proe/proarc/se+arctic,+v.+55,+no.++4,+Dec.+2002,*?COMMANDSEARCH|doi=10.14430/arctic724}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, the wildlife artist Brenda Carter worked as Manning's research assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureartists.com/artists/artist_biography.asp?ArtistID=214|title=Brenda Carter|publisher=natureartists.com|accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning met Ella Wallace Jackson (1906–2006), a nurse, only once, in 1935.  Sent via [[Morse code]], she received his proposal in April 1938. Three months later, "Jackie" arrived in [[Cape Dorset]], and they were married.  They honeymooned for a year and a half while mapping [[Baffin Island]],&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; and gathering bird specimens.  They travelled in Manning's small boat, the ''Polecat'', stocked with flour, butter, jam, milk, tobacco, pemmican, 800 litres of fuel, seven dogs, four puppies, and a sled. Years later, Ella published two books with accounts of their travels, ''Igloo for the night'' (1946), and ''A summer on Hudson Bay.'' (1949). They separated amicably in the late 1960s, but did not divorce.&lt;ref name="globeandmail" /&gt;

In his later years, Manning donated his collection of several thousand books to the [[Baffin Island]] [[Inuit]] community in [[Iqaluit]]; the Thomas Manning collection is housed at its Centennial Library.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassholidays.com/1st/frameset.htm?/canada/gbp/can_provinces_cityresort.htm|title=Iqaluit, Nunavut|publisher=1stclassholidays.com|accessdate=20 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, he donated $645,000 to the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] at Cambridge University's [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] Memorial Library where the Thomas H. Manning Polar Archives are named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/|title=The Thomas H. Manning Polar Archives|date=2 October 2008|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning died 8 November 1998 at a hospital in [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]] near his farm at [[Merrickville-Wolford, Ontario|Merrickville]], Canada. Through his estate, a $25,000 bequest was made to the Merrickville Historical Society to assist in archives conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merrickvillehistory.org/newsletters/newsletter-3-2.html|title=2005 Merit Award Recognition |publisher=merrickvillehistory.org|accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William E. Doolittle''' (born September 3, 1947 in Texas, USA) is an American [[geographer]] who is prominent among the fourth generation of the [[Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography]]. He is currently the [[Erich Zimmermann|Erich W. Zimmermann]] Regents Professor in Geography at the [[Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin]].  He specializes in landscapes and [[agricultural technology]] in the American Southwest and Mexico.

==Background==
Doolittle attended Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas and obtained a B.A. in Government and Geography (1974).  
He then studied at the University of Missouri, Columbia (M.A.  1976) and received his Ph.D. in 1979 from the [[University of Oklahoma]], studying with [[Billie Lee Turner II|B.L.Turner II]], reportedly struggling financially with a family to support.&lt;ref&gt;http://capeaag.wordpress.com/cape-honors/william-e-doolittle/&lt;/ref&gt; He taught for one year at [[Mississippi State University]]. He joined the [[University of Texas at Austin|UT]] Geography Department in 1981. He has served as an undergraduate advisor, graduate advisor (receiving UT's Outstanding Graduate Advisor Award in 2004), and Department chair.

He was a visiting professor at [[Brown University]] in 1997, and a Fulbright Senior Specialist at [[Stockholm University]] in 2007.

He has graduated a number of doctoral students: Dean P. Lambert (1992), [[Andrew Sluyter]] (1995), Emily H. Young (1995), Norman D. Johns (1996), Michael D. Myers (1998), Eric P. Perramond (1999), Phil L. Crossley  (1999); Claudia L. Oakes (2000), Michael D. Pool (2002), [[Bella Bychokova]] Jordan (2002), Jerry O. (Joby) Bass (2003), Maria G. Fadiman (2003), W. Stuart Kirkham (2005), and Matthew Fry (2008).

'''WorldMap''' is a [[World Wide Web|web]] platform for creating, displaying, analyzing, and searching [[spatial data]] and other data forms across multiple disciplines.

WorldMap is a collaboratively edited, [[multilingual]], free [[internet]] mapping [[electronic media]] site open to everyone that is housed at the Center for Geographic Analysis at [[Harvard University]] and accessible at the WorldMap website makes it possible for those who are not experts in [[GIS]] and web mapping to explore, visualize, and share their research materials in a GIS spatial framework, enhancing their ability to conduct academic research, community service projects, and instructional activities.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Konrad|title=Using the WorldMap Platform|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=14 March 2012|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/using-the-worldmap-platform/38992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruell|first=Peter|title=Map Making Made Easy|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=17 January 2012|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/01/map-making-made-easy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WorldMap site allows users to add their own map layers and data sets, symbolize them, edit them, add overlays, add [[multimedia]] content (images, video, text), control access, and share or publish them.

The purposes of WorldMap are simple: to enable one to explore the development of [[human civilization]] in all its diversity and complexity in spatial data contexts, to take advantage of the knowledge of others to enhance one's particular interests, and to create a [[sustainable]] and [[scalable]] platform in which students, scholars, organizations, and ordinary citizens can participate in creating and sharing any work that can be usefully represented spatially.

==Overview==

Worldmap is an [[open-source software|open-source]] and [[open access]] online platform for visualizing and sharing [[spatial data]]. Worldmap was launched in July 2011 by the Center for Geographic Analysis at [[Harvard University]]. The site was created following the success of the AfricaMap project here, that launched in [[beta version]] in November 2009 to bring together a range of cross-disciplinary materials on [[Africa]], within an online mapping environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Ben |last2=Guan |first2=Wendy |editor1-last=Li |editor1-first=Songnian |editor2-last=Dragicevic |editor2-first=Suzana |editor3-last=Veenendaal |editor3-first=Bert |title= Advances in Web-based GIS, Mapping Services and Applications |publisher= CRC Press|year=2011 |chapter= Jump-starting the next level of online geospatial collaboration: Lessons from AfricaMap|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; AfricaMap demonstrated that there is a large amount of detailed mapping data on Africa that can be brought together in one place, that web technologies are mature enough to be able to handle a large volume of [[data]] (hundreds of [[gigabytes]] in this case), and that users can explore these data smoothly on top of [[high resolution]] imagery such as [[Google]] satellite view. WorldMap, in which AfricaMap is now located, has data that range from detailed street maps, to [[language]] and [[ethnicity]] groupings, historic and scholarly maps, [[environmental science|environment]], [[transportation]] systems, World Census and other [[demographic]] and [[economic]] data, [[political systems]], [[institutions]] and [[infrastructure]], [[urban planning]], [[archaeology]], cultural sites, [[crisis]] areas, and health and disease. AfricaMap also includes data from the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]] that allows users to display and analyze results along with other data. A searchable [[gazetteer]] in AfricaMap includes over 2 million place names readable in a multiplicity of languages.

From the outset, collaborations with other institutions interested in the potentials of the AfricaMap (and WorldMap) platform were sought. These encouraged the creation of new data and in some cases, direct links to other sites were employed to display of these data spatially in concert with additional data layers. These collaborations include, among others, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database at [[Emory University]], the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and social crisis mapping such as [[Ushahidi]]. In other cases, such as the [[ATLA Religion Database]] and the [[Human Relations Area Files]] at [[Yale University]], associated data were first geo-referenced and then uploaded directly to the AfricaMap website. In still other cases available open source data were downloaded and entered into the system, as with a spatialized version of Wikipedia and various environmental and boundary data, or brought in from government and other sources, as in JapanMap which integrates detailed data on the 2005 tsunami among other things.

As a result, users creating maps within the WorldMap system now are able to draw on an array of global and local mapping data already brought into the system – environmental (rivers, soils, [[climate]], [[eco-systems]]), sociological ([[population density]], administrative boundaries), cultural ([[language]], religion, [[ethnicity]]), historical (early maps, period mapping, trade routes), [[transportation]] systems, and [[health]] (U.S. and U.N. global [[census]] surveys, among others). Data uploaded to WorldMap by users often are made available by them to other users, encouraging collaborations and cross-disciplinary engagements employing the same resource data. In short, WorldMap grows [[Wiki]]-style as new data are added, with the creators of these data retaining editorial control.

WorldMap is being used by several organizations. The Institute of Advanced Studies at the [[United Nations University]] (the research arm of the U. N.) is addressing the illicit trade of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in East Africa.&lt;ref name="Ruell 2012a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruell|first=Peter|title=New Tool to Battle Illegal Trade in Animals|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=9 May 2012|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/05/new-tool-to-battle-illegal-trade-in-animals/|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Newsweek]]/[[The Daily Beast]] project, “Get on the Map! For Women and Girls, is promoting  Women in the World. The Virtue Foundation is mapping  Global Health Data at the local level in Ghana.  A non-profit music support group, “The Singing Wells,” in Nairobi, [[Kenya]] is helping to  preserve and share East African Music. Virtual Kenya also has created an instance of Worldmap on their own site to  explore  environmental issues. [[Cornell University]]’s College of Human Ecology, under  [[epidemiologist]] Julia Finkelstein, is developing a new WorldMap instance called GlobalHealthMap, based on the current WorldMap system but also interoperable with it.

==Technology==

WorldMap is a [[federated]] system with collaborations in place already with an array of other universities and institutions and is based on a [[geospatial]] [[infrastructure]] platform developed by the Center for Geographic Analysis.&lt;ref name=Gangai&gt;{{cite web|last=Gangal|first=Sanjay|title=WorldMap by the Center for Geographic Analysis CGA at Harvard|url=http://www10.giscafe.com/blogs/gissanjay/2012/05/17/worldmap-by-the-center-for-geographic-analysis-cga-at-harvard/|year=2012|publisher=GIS Café|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WorldMap platform is built on [[Open-source software|open source]] software&lt;ref name=Pickle&gt;{{cite web|last=Pickle|first=Eddie|title=Worldmap: Supporting Academic Collaboration with Open Source Geonode|url=http://geonode.org/2011/02/worldmap/ |date=February 2011|publisher=Geonode|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the source code that makes it work can be examined, improved upon, and extended by researchers and developers around the world with new functionality often added rapidly at relatively low cost. WorldMap benefits from using mapping [[API]]s such as [[Google]], [[OpenStreetMaps]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] for providing general purpose map backdrops, but the system is not dependent on any particular web map API. WorldMap is hosted on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]’s EC2 [[cloud]] [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name="Guan et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guan|first=W. W.|title=Worldmap - a geospatial framework for collaborative research|journal=Annals of GIS|volume=18|issue=2|pages=121–134|year=2012|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19475683.2012.668559#preview|doi=10.1080/19475683.2012.668559|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WorldMap platform uses an open source software stack that is being improved and extended by geospatial developers in the US and abroad; [[The World Bank]] and the U.S. federal government are major contributors to core components of the WorldMap platform, specifically GeoNode and [[GeoServer]].  The fact that WorldMap is capable of supporting a large volume of data and a large number of users is due in part to the design of its servers that use [[Database caching|caching]], but also because its [[service-oriented architecture|service-oriented]]-architecture allows data holdings to be distributed across many servers. The system handles a variety of spatial input formats including [[shapefile]], [[GeoTIFF]], web map services ([[Web Map Service|WMS]]), ESRI REST services, [[georeference]]d [[YouTube]] videos and [[Picasa]] photos, and [[GeoRSS]] feeds. A user can select several local or remote data layers to overlay and control the transparency of overlaid layers, allowing for visual investigations of spatial patterns and relationships between data sets. Images, video and text can also be added by users to their Worldmap projects through linked [[URLs]] to sites such as [[Flickr]] or uploads to the WorldMap site directly. Users also are encouraged to adopt an appropriate [[Creative Commons]] license to define the type of attribution.

Among the important recent projects created in World Map is TweetMap, developed in a collaboration between Todd Mostak and the Center for Geographic Analysis. This project supports [[Twitter]] storage, query, analysis, display, and download of massive [[Twitter]] geo-spatial data sets consisting of [[1,000,000,000|billions]] of features.  The underlying platform, called MapD, works by parallelizing processes across commodity [[GPU]] cards, achieving speedups over traditional databases by a factor of a million using inexpensive hardware.&lt;ref name=Engelhardt&gt;{{cite web|last=Engelhardt|first=Allan|title=Massively Parallel Database for Analytics|url=http://www.cybaea.net/Blogs/Data/Massively-parallel-database-for-analytics.html|date=22 July 2009|publisher=CYBAEA Data and Analysis|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other applications, TweetMap can be used for tracking earthquakes and epidemics such as influenza in real time.

==History==

WorldMap has its origins in AfricaMap,&lt;ref name="Mapping Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mapping Africa|journal=Harvard Magazine|date=March–April 2009|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/03/mapping-africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WorldMap: Supporting Academic Collaboration with Open Source|url=http://geonode.org/2011/02/worldmap/|publisher=Geonode|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    a website begun in 2007 by art historian [[Suzanne Blier]] with [[Harvard University]] Provost funds in Innovative Computing and was developed in 2008 and 2009 by GIS scientists Ben Lewis and Wendy Guan with input from Blier and [[Sinologist]], Peter Bol, the Director of the Center for Geographic Analysis, to make a broad range of materials on Africa available within an online mapping environment.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Guan 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis, who built the first peer-to-peer GIS system{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, established with Scott Melby the Geonomy Project&lt;ref name=Geens&gt;{{cite web|last=Geens|first=Stefan|title=Geonomy|url=http://ogleearth.com/2007/01/geonomy/|date=2 January 2007|publisher=Ogleearth|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which AfricaMap's innovative technical features in part were based. These include a large searchable place name gazetteer overlaid on Google Maps, using tile services to displaying the many layers simultaneously with transparency control and pre-cached tiles.

As users with varied interests saw how the initial AfricaMap site handled and displayed data,&lt;ref name="Schutzberg 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutzberg|first=Adena|title=Harvard's AfricaMap Launches|journal=Directions Magazine|date=19 December 2008|url=http://apb.directionsmag.com/entry/harvards-africamap-launches/160357%20Directions%20Magazine|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they sought similar online mapping applications for their own research interests; out of this soon came Boston Research Map ([[sociology]]), VermontMap ([[geology]]), ParisMap ([[history]]) and ChinaMap ([[history]] and [[political science]]). To meet the needs of these diverse new projects, and to add new capabilities, a decision was made to build a system that other users could use to create their own custom mapping applications and load their own data. By July 2011 the system had been redesigned by Ben Lewis and Matt Bertrand with new enhanced features and re-launched as WorldMap.

AfricaMap has its origins in an earlier on-line mapping and media project called The Baobab Project (Baobab: Roots of Creativity in African Material Culture), founded by Blier at Harvard in 1993 with a grant from the Seaver Institute. Baobab, designed by Michael Roy as an interactive website, included an image and ethnographic database based on [[GIS]], along with narrative-form case studies framed around the questions concerning the social roots of creativity (why certain cultures, places, and periods encouraged creativity and innovation in the arts). Multi-media case studies on the now defunct site, described as ""one of the largest academic studies of African art" addressed a variety of themes ranging from Islam and art to architectural planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Art on the Internet|url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/africa/art.html|publisher=Stanford University Libraries and Instructional Research|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources: African Arts|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/africa/resources_arts.html|publisher=PBS (Public Broadcasting Service)|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy of content and quality==

Paper maps and online mapping projects such as [[Google Earth]]  are carefully and deliberately created by experts, conveying  accuracy even if mediated through political agendas and time. Conversely, WorldMap base mapping and projects may lack source data or include factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Some of this is encouraged, as for example the inclusion of [[ethnicity]] maps that are known to have biases and inaccuracies based in part on the fact that people's identities are complex and constantly shifting, rarely conforming to precisely configured spaces. For this reason WorldMap includes sometimes multiple different renderings of the same kinds of information so that users can pick and chose between them - or create their own. As a  consequence of its open structure, WorldMap cannot guarantee the accuracy of its content or source data, although users are encouraged to enter and cite data as accurately as possible. In order to improve the system, WorldMap is developing a [[crowd-sourced]] application that will allow users to rank mapping data in the system and to comment on it.

At the same time, WorldMap has become part of several book publications by scholars with these projects also part of the larger review process: [[Jill Lepore]] on the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]]&lt;ref name="Lapore 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapore|first=Jill|title=New York Burning: Liberty, Slavery, and Conspiracy in Eighteenth Century Manhattan|year=2006|publisher=Vintage Publishing|isbn=978-1400032266}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Colin Gordon on St. Louis Neighborhoods&lt;ref name="Gordon 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Colin|title=Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the American City|year=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Sampson on Chicago neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Sampson 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sampson|first=Robert|title=The Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zona Austral''' (''Southernmost Zone'') is one of the five [[natural region]]s into which [[CORFO]] divided [[continental Chile]] in 1950 corresponding to the [[Chile]]an portion of [[Patagonia]]. It is surrounded by the [[Zona Sur]] and the [[Chacao Channel]] to the north, the Pacific Ocean and [[Drake's Passage]] to the south and west, and the [[Andean mountains]] and [[Argentina]] to the east. If excluding [[Chiloé Archipelago]] Zona Austral covers all of Chilean [[Patagonia]].

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
In the far south (Chile Austral), which extends from Valdivia through the Chacao Channel to [[Cape Horn]], the Andes and the South Pacific meet. This district of the country is mountainous, heavily forested and inhospitable. The deeply indented coastline is filled with islands which preserve the general outline of the continent southward to the Fuegian archipelago, the outside groups forming a continuation of the [[Chilean Coast Range]]. The heavy and continuous rainfall throughout this region, especially in the latitude of [[Chiloé]], gives rise to a large number of rivers and lakes. Farther south this excessive precipitation is in the form of snow in the [[Andes]], forming [[glacier]]s at a comparatively low level which in places discharge into the inlets and bays of the sea. The extreme southern part of this region extends eastward to the Atlantic entrance to the Strait of Magellan, and includes the greater part of the [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]] with all the islands lying south and west of it. There are some comparatively level stretches of country immediately north of the Strait, partly forested and partly grassy plains, where sheep farming has been established with some degree of success, but the greater part of this extreme southern territory is mountainous, cold, wet and inhospitable. The perpetual snow-line here descends to 1,000 to 1,200 m (3,500 to 4,000&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea-level, and the forest growth does not rise above an altitude of 300 to 450 m (1,000 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Chile |volume=6 |page=142 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountains====
From the latitude of [[Michinmahuida]] volcano southwards a well-defined western [[longitudinal valley]], occupied by the [[Carretera Austral]], divides the Andes into two chains, the eastern being the main chain, to which belong mounts Ventisquero Sur, Barros Arana and Alto Nevado, while the western chain, broken into imposing blocks, contains several high volcanic peaks such as [[Corcovado (volcano)|Corcovado]], [[Yanteles]] and [[Melimoyu]].

An important transverse mountain range of the Andes separates the valleys of the rivers [[Simpson River|Simpson]] and [[Ibáñez River|Ibañez]]. This section is dominated by the active [[Mount Hudson|Hudson]] volcano and the jagged [[Cerro Castillo]].

Southward from General Carrera lake is found a wide oblique opening in the range, through which flows the river Baker. The main chain of the Andes in the west is an enormous rugged mass of ice and snow of an average height of 2700&amp;nbsp;m (9000&amp;nbsp;ft.), sending glaciers to all the western fjords. [[Monte San Valentin]] (4,058 m [13,314&amp;nbsp;ft.]) is the culminating point of the Andes in the region extending from [[49th parallel south|49°]] to [[46th parallel south|46° S]] latitude [[Monte San Lorenzo]], detached from the main chain of the Andes, is 3,706 m (12,156&amp;nbsp;ft.) high.

The section from [[48th parallel south|48°]] to [[52nd parallel south|52° S]] latitude is a continuous ice-capped mountain range, and some of the glaciers extend from the eastern lakes to the western channels, where they reach the sea-level. The highest mountain in the section is [[Lautaro (volcano)|Lautaro]] volcano, but the most famous compose the [[Cordillera del Paine]] in the south and the [[Mount Fitz Roy|Fitz Roy]] group in the north. The southernmost part of this zone is formed by two small parallel ranges called [[Cordillera Sarmiento]] and [[Cordillera Riesco]], which are separated by the [[Fjord of the Mountains]].

From the 52 deg. S. lat. up to Strait of Magellan, the western slope of the Cordillera does not, properly speaking, exist. Abrupt walls overlook the Pacific, and great longitudinal and transversal channels and fjords run right through the heart of the range, cutting it generally in a direction more or less oblique to its axis, the result of movements of the Earth's crust. This region is not fully explored, and all that is known of it is that it is principally composed of the same rocks as the Fuegian Andes, and that the greater part of its upper valleys is occupied by glaciers that reach down to the sea amid dense forest.

The Cordillera of the Andes in Tierra del Fuego is formed of crystalline schists, and culminates in the snow-capped peaks of [[Mount Darwin (Andes)|Mount Darwin]] and [[Monte Sarmiento]] in the [[Cordillera Darwin]], which contains glaciers of greater extent than those of [[Mont Blanc]]. The extent of the glaciers is considerable in this region, which, geographically, is more complex than was formerly supposed. Although, in the explored portion of the Fuegian chain, the volcanoes which have been mentioned from time to time have not been met with, there seem to have existed to the south, on the islands, many neo-volcanic rocks, some of which appear to be contemporaneous with the basaltic sheet that covers a part of eastern Patagonia.

Farther south the Andes terminates in Cape Horn. In this section the mountains are composed principally of crystalline rocks, and their heights are inconsiderable when compared with those of the northern Andes.

====Coasts====
The continental coastline features numerous inlets and fjords, from which the mountains seem to rise straight up to great elevations; this is, for example, the case with the [[Cerro Macá]] (2,300 meters) near [[Puerto Aisén, Chile|Puerto Aisén]]. The rest of the land consists of literally thousands of islands forming numerous archipelagos interwoven with sometimes-narrow channels, which provide the main routes of navigation. The grouping of such islands shows that they are in part the summits of a submerged mountain chain, a continuation southward of the [[Chilean Coast Range]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Three groups of these, called [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]], [[Guaitecas Archipelago|Guaitecas]] and [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]] archipelagoes, lie North of the [[Taitao Peninsula]].

The largest island of this portion of Austral Chile is [[Chiloé]], which is inhabited. Some of the smaller islands of these groups are also inhabited, though the excessive rainfall of these latitudes and the violent westerly storms render them highly unfavourable for human occupation. Some of the smallest islands are barren rocks, but the majority of them are covered with forests. These archipelagoes are separated from the mainland in the north by the gulfs of [[Gulf of Ancud|Ancud]] and [[Gulf of Corcovado|Corcovado]], 30 to 35&amp;nbsp;mi wide, which appear to be a submerged part of the great [[Chilean Central Valley]], and farther south by the narrower [[Moraleda Channel]], which terminates southward in a confusing network of passages between the mainland and the islands of the Chonos group.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Below the Taitao peninsula is the broad open [[Gulf of Penas]], which carries the coast-line eastward fully 100&amp;nbsp;mi and is noticeably free from islands, with some exceptions. The northern entrance to [[Messier Channel]] is through this gulf. Messier, [[Pitt Channel|Pitt]], [[Sarmiento Channel|Sarmiento]] and [[Smyth Channel|Smyth's]] Channels, which form a comparatively safe and remarkably picturesque inside route for ships, about 338&amp;nbsp;mi in length, separate another series of archipelagoes from the mainland. These channels are in places narrow and tortuous. Among the islands which thickly fringe this part of the coast, the largest are Merino Jarpa (lying within [[Baker Channel]]), [[Prat Island|Prat]], [[Campana Island|Campana]] (part of [[Guayaneco Archipelago]]), [[Little Wellington Island|Little Wellington]], [[Wellington Island|Wellington]] and [[Mornington Island (Chile)|Mornington]] (of the [[Wellington Archipelago]]), [[Madre de Dios Island|Madre de Dios]], [[Duke of York Island (Chile)|Duke of York]], [[Chatham Island (Chile)|Chatham]], [[Hanover Island|Hanover]], Cambridge, [[Contreras Island|Contreras]], Rennell and the [[Queen Adelaide Archipelago]], a group of small barren rocks and islands lying immediately north of the Pacific entrance to the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The large number of English names on this coast is due to the fact that the earliest detailed survey of this region was made by English naval officers; the charts prepared from their surveys are still in use and form the basis of all subsequent maps.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Belonging to the [[Tierra del Fuego]] archipelago south of the Strait of Magellan are [[Desolación Island|Desolación]], [[Santa Inés Island|Santa Inés]], [[Clarence Island, Chile|Clarence]], [[Capitán Aracena Island|Capitán Aracena]], [[Dawson Island|Dawson]], [[Londonderry Island|Londonderry]], [[Hoste Island|Hoste]], [[Navarino Island|Navarino]] and [[Wollaston Islands]], with innumerable smaller islands and rocks fringing their shores and filling the channels between them.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The far south contains large expanses of pastures that are best suited for raising sheep, mainly on [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]]. The area's other main economic activity is oil and natural gas extraction from the areas around the Strait of Magellan. This strait is one of the world's important sea-lanes because it unites the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through a channel that avoids the rough open waters off [[Cape Horn]]. The channel is perilous, however, and Chilean pilots guide all vessels through it.

===Hydrography===

====Rivers====
{{see also|HydroAysen}}
The [[Comau Fjord]] and [[Vodudahue River]] traverse the densely wooded country in a north-westerly direction from the Andes to the north-eastern shore of the Gulf of Chacao. This area is home to [[Pumalín Park]]. Continuing southward, the [[Yelcho River|Yelcho]] is the next important river to traverse this region. Forming part of its basin is the [[Futaleufú River]], which drains a large area of [[Argentina|Argentine]] territory. Yelcho flows north-west from [[Yelcho Lake]] to the Gulf of Corcovado. The [[Palena River|Palena]] is another river of the same character, having its source in a large frontier lake, which is called General Paz or General Vintter in Argentina and Palena in Chile. It flows for some distance through Argentine territory before crossing into Chile. It receives one large tributary from the south, the [[Pico River]], and enters an estuary of the Gulf of Corcovado a little north of the [[44th parallel south|44th parallel]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[Cisnes River|Cisnes]] is wholly a Chilean river, draining an extensive Andean region between the [[44th parallel south|44th]] and [[45th parallel south|45th parallels]] and discharging into the [[Puyuhuapi Channel]], which separates [[Magdalena Island, Aisén Region|Magdalena Island]] from the mainland. The [[Aisén River]] also has its source near the [[46th parallel south|46th parallel]], and drains a mountainous region as far north es the [[45th parallel south|45th parallel]], receiving numerous tributaries, and discharging a large volume of water into the [[Aysén Fjord]]. The next large river is the [[Baker River (Chile)|Baker River]], through which the waters of lakes [[Buenos Aires/General Carrera Lake|General Carrera]] and [[Pueyrredón/Cochrane Lake|Cochrane]], find their way to the Pacific. Both of these large lakes are crossed by the boundary line. The Baker discharges into [[Baker Channel]]. The course of the river from lake General Carrera is south and south-west, the short range of mountains in which are found the cerros [[Monte San Valentin|San Valentín]] and [[Cerro Arenales|Arenales]] forcing it southward for an outlet. Baker inlet also receives the waters of still another large Argentine-Chilean lake, [[O'Higgins Lake]]. Its north-west arm drains into the [[Pascua River]]. After a short north-westerly course the river discharges into Baker Inlet in lat. 48° 13′ S., long. 73° 24′ W. South of Pascua river there are no large rivers on this coast, but the narrow fjords penetrate deeply into the mountains and bring away the drainage of their snow-capped, storm-swept elevations. A peculiar network of fjords and connecting channels terminating inland in a peculiarly shaped body of water with long, widely branching arms, called Worsley Sound, Obstruction Sound and [[Última Esperanza Sound]], covers an extensive area between the [[51st parallel south|51st]] and [[53rd parallel south|53rd parallels]], and extends nearly to the Argentine frontier. It has the characteristics of a tidewater river and drains an extensive region.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A noteworthy peculiarity of southern Chile, from the Taitao peninsula to Tierra del Fuego, is the large number of glaciers formed on the western and southern slopes of the Andes and other high elevations, which discharge direct into these deeply cut estuaries. Some of the larger lakes of the Andes have glaciers discharging into them. The formation of these icy streams at comparatively low levels, with their discharge direct into tidewater estuaries, is a phenomenon not to be found elsewhere in the same latitudes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Lakes====
[[Image:Lago Gral. Carrera 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[General Carrera Lake]]]]
The great Andean lakes of [[Palena Lake|Palena]] (near the [[44th parallel south|44th parallel]]), General Carrera (in lat 46° 30′ S.), Cochrane (47° 15′ S.) and O'Higgins ([[49th parallel south|49° S.]]), lie partly within Chilean territory. In Argentina are called, respectively, General Paz (also is known as General Vintter), Buenos Aires, Pueyrredón and San Martín. Towards the coast, other important lakes are [[Presidente Rios Lake]], [[Laguna San Rafael]] and [[Yulton Lake]].

Southward from the southern portion of [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] (about [[51st parallel south|51° S.]] lat.), lakes include [[Del Toro Lake|Del Toro]] and [[Sarmiento Lake|Sarmiento]]. The former overflows into Última Esperanza Sound.

In the extreme south of Chile mainland is [[Laguna Blanca (Chile)|Laguna Blanca]], a large fresh-water lake in lat. 52° 30′ S.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Notable lakes in Tierra del Fuego include [[Fagnano Lake|Fagnano]] (shared with Argentina), [[Blanco Lake, Chile|Blanco]] and [[Ofhidro Lake|Ofhidro]].

===Climate===

In the northern part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. For instance, Puerto Aisén, at 45° 24′ south latitude, receives 2,973.3 millimeters of rain per year. However, unlike in [[Valdivia, Chile#Climate|Valdivia]], the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Aisén. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average 13.6&amp;nbsp;°C in the summer months and 4.7&amp;nbsp;°C in the winter months. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country have given way to others better adapted to a generally colder climate.

The southern part of the far south includes the city of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], which, with about 125,000 inhabitants, is the southernmost city in the world with over 100,000 inhabitants (see [[Southernmost settlements]]). It receives much less precipitation; its annual total is only 438.5 millimeters, or a little more than what Valdivia receives in the month of June alone. This precipitation is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, with the two main summer months receiving a monthly average of 31 millimeters and the winter months 38.9 millimeters, some of it in the form of snow. Temperatures are colder than in the rest of the country. The summer months average 11.1&amp;nbsp;°C, and the winter months average 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C. The virtually constant wind from the South Pacific Ocean makes the air feel much colder.{{fact|date=December 2017}}
