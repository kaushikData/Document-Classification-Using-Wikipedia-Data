In [[mathematics]], an '''abstract simplicial complex''' is a purely combinatorial description of the geometric notion of a [[simplicial complex]], consisting of a family of non-empty [[finite set]]s closed under the operation of taking non-empty [[subset]]s.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, JM, Introduction to Topological Manifolds, Springer 2011, {{ISBN|1-4419-7939-5}}, p153&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[matroid]]s and [[greedoid]]s, abstract simplicial complexes are also called '''independence systems'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Bernhard Korte|Korte, Bernhard]] |author2=[[László Lovász|Lovász, László]] |author3=Schrader, Rainer| year = 1991| title = Greedoids | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 3-540-18190-3 |page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

An abstract simplex can be studied algebraically by forming its [[Stanley–Reisner ring]]; this sets up a powerful relation between [[combinatorics]] and [[commutative algebra]].

==Definitions==
A [[family of sets|family]] {{math|Δ}} of non-empty [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is an '''abstract simplicial complex''' if, for every set {{mvar|X}} in {{math|Δ}}, and every non-empty subset {{math|''Y'' ⊂ ''X''}}, {{mvar|Y}} also belongs to {{math|Δ}}.

The finite sets that belong to {{math|Δ}} are called '''faces''' of the complex, and a face {{mvar|Y}} is said to belong to another face {{mvar|X}} if {{math|''Y'' ⊂ ''X''}}, so the definition of an abstract simplicial complex can be restated as saying that every face of a face of a complex {{math|Δ}} is itself a face of {{math|Δ}}. The '''vertex set''' of {{math|Δ}} is defined as {{math|''V''(Δ) {{=}} ∪Δ}}, the union of all faces of {{math|Δ}}. The elements of the vertex set are called the '''vertices''' of the complex.   For every vertex ''v'' of {{math|Δ}}, the set {''v''} is a face of the complex, and every face of the complex is a finite subset of the vertex set.  

The maximal faces of {{math|Δ}} (i.e., faces that are not subsets of any other faces) are called '''facets''' of the complex. The '''dimension of a face''' {{mvar|X}} in {{math|Δ}} is defined as {{math|dim(''X'') {{=}} {{!}}''X''{{!}} − 1}}: faces consisting of a single element are zero-dimensional, faces consisting of two elements are one-dimensional, etc. The '''dimension of the complex''' {{math|dim(Δ)}} is defined as the largest dimension of any of its faces, or infinity if there is no finite bound on the dimension of the faces.

The complex {{math|Δ}} is said to be '''finite''' if it has finitely many faces, or equivalently if its vertex set is finite. Also, {{math|Δ}} is said to be '''pure''' if it is finite-dimensional (but not necessarily finite) and every facet has the same dimension. In other words, {{math|Δ}} is pure if {{math|dim(Δ)}} is finite and every face is contained in a facet of dimension {{math|dim(Δ)}}.

One-dimensional abstract simplicial complexes are mathematically equivalent to [[simple graph|simple]] [[undirected graph]]s: the vertex set of the complex can be viewed as the vertex set of a graph, and the two-element facets of the complex correspond to undirected edges of a graph. In this view, one-element facets of a complex correspond to isolated vertices that do not have any incident edges. 

A '''subcomplex''' of {{math|Δ}} is a simplicial complex ''L'' such that every face of ''L'' belongs to {{math|Δ}}; that is, {{math|''L'' ⊂ Δ}} and ''L'' is a simplicial complex. A subcomplex that consists of all of the subsets of a single face of {{math|Δ}} is often called a '''simplex''' of {{math|Δ}}. (However, some authors use the term "simplex" for a face or, rather ambiguously, for both a face and the subcomplex associated with a face, by analogy with the non-abstract (geometric) [[simplicial complex]] terminology. To avoid ambiguity, we do not use in this article the term "simplex" for a face in the context of abstract complexes.)

The '''[[d-skeleton]]''' of {{math|Δ}} is the subcomplex of {{math|Δ}} consisting of all of the faces of {{math|Δ}} that have dimension at most ''d''. In particular, the [[skeleton (topology)|1-skeleton]] is called the '''underlying graph''' of {{math|Δ}}. The 0-skeleton of {{math|Δ}} can be identified with its vertex set, although formally it is not quite the same thing (the vertex set is a single set of all of the vertices, while the 0-skeleton is a family of single-element sets).

The '''link''' of a face {{mvar|Y}} in {{math|Δ}}, often denoted {{math|Δ/''Y''}} or {{math|lk&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}, is the subcomplex of {{math|Δ}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta/Y := \{ X\in \Delta \mid X\cap Y = \varnothing,\, X\cup Y \in \Delta \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the link of the empty set is {{math|Δ}} itself.

Given two abstract simplicial complexes, {{math|Δ}} and {{math|Γ}}, a '''simplicial map''' is a function {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} that maps the vertices of {{math|Δ}} to the vertices of {{math|Γ}} and that has the property that for any face {{mvar|X}} of {{math|Δ}}, the image set {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''X'')}} is a face of {{math|Γ}}.  There is a category SCpx with abstract simplicial complexes as objects and simplicial maps as morphisms.  This is equivalent to a suitable category defined using non-abstract [[simplicial complexes]].   

Moreover, the categorical point of view allows us to tighten the relation between the underlying set ''S'' of an abstract simplicial complex {{math|Δ}} and the vertex set {{math|''V''(Δ) ⊂ ''S''}} of {{math|Δ}}: for the purposes of defining a category of abstract simplicial complexes, the elements of ''S'' not lying in {{math|''V''(Δ)}} are irrelevant.  More precisely, SCpx is equivalent to the category where:
* an object is a set ''S'' equipped with a collection of non-empty finite subsets {{math|Δ}} that contains all singletons and such that  if {{mvar|X}} is in {{math|Δ}} and {{math|''Y'' ⊂ ''X''}} is non-empty, then {{mvar|Y}} also belongs to {{math|Δ}}.
* a morphism from {{math|(S,Δ)}} to {{math|(T,Γ)}} is a function {{math|''f'' : ''S'' → ''T''}} such that the image of any element of {{math|Δ}} is an element of {{math|Γ}}.

==Geometric realization==
We can associate to an abstract simplicial complex ''K'' a topological space |''K''|, called its '''geometric realization''', which is the carrier of a [[simplicial complex]]. The construction goes as follows.

First, define |''K''| as a subset of {{math|[0, 1]&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} consisting of functions {{math|''t'' : ''S'' → [0, 1]}} satisfying the two conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in S}t_s=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{s\in S:t_s&gt;0\}\in K&lt;/math&gt;
Now think of {{math|[0, 1]&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as the [[direct limit]] of {{math|[0, 1]&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where ''A'' ranges over finite subsets of ''S'', and give {{math|[0, 1]&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} the [[final topology|induced topology]].  Now give |''K''| the subspace topology.

Alternatively, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are the faces of {{mvar|K}} and whose [[morphism]]s are inclusions. Next choose a [[total order]] on the vertex set of {{mvar|K}} and define a functor ''F'' from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; to the category of [[topological space]]s as follows. For any face {{math|''X'' ∈ ''K''}} of dimension ''n'', let {{math|''F''(''X'') {{=}} Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} be the standard ''n''-simplex. The order on the vertex set then specifies a unique bijection between the elements of {{mvar|X}} and vertices of {{math|Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ordered in the usual way {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If {{math|''Y'' ⊂ ''X''}} is a face of dimension {{math|''m'' &lt; ''n''}}, then this bijection specifies a unique ''m''-dimensional face of {{math|Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Define {{math|''F''(''Y'') →  ''F''(''X'')}} to be the unique [[affine transformation|affine linear]] embedding of {{math|Δ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as that distinguished face of {{math|Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, such that the map on vertices is order preserving.

We can then define the geometric realization |''K''| as the [[colimit]] of the functor ''F''. More specifically |''K''| is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of the [[disjoint union]]

:&lt;math&gt;\coprod_{X \in K}{F(X)}&lt;/math&gt;

by the equivalence relation which identifies a point {{math|''y'' ∈ ''F''(''Y'')}} with its image under the map {{math|''F''(''Y'') → ''F''(''X'')}}, for every inclusion {{math|''Y'' ⊂ ''X''}}.

If ''K'' is finite, then we can describe |''K''| more simply. Choose an embedding of the vertex set of ''K'' as an [[affinely independent]] subset of some Euclidean space {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of sufficiently high dimension ''N''. Then any face {{math|''X'' ∈ ''K''}} can be identified with the geometric simplex in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} spanned by the corresponding embedded vertices. Take |''K''| to be the union of all such simplices.

If ''K'' is the standard combinatorial ''n''-simplex, then |''K''| can be naturally identified with {{math|Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Examples==
* As an example, let ''V'' be a finite subset of ''S'' of cardinality {{math|''n'' + 1}} and let ''K'' be the [[power set]] of ''V''. Then ''K'' is called a '''combinatorial''' ''n''-'''simplex''' with vertex set ''V''. If {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''S'' {{=}} {0, 1, ..., ''n''},}} ''K'' is called the '''standard''' combinatorial ''n''-simplex.
* The [[clique complex]] of an undirected graph has a simplex for each [[clique]] (complete subgraph) of the given graph. Clique complexes form the prototypical example of [[flag complex]]es, complexes with the property that every set of elements that pairwise belong to simplexes of the complex is itself a simplex.
* In the theory of [[partially ordered set]]s ("posets"), the '''order complex''' of a poset is the set of all finite chains. Its [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] groups and other topological invariants contain important information about the poset.
* The [[Vietoris–Rips complex]] is defined from any metric space ''M'' and distance δ by forming a simplex for every finite subset of ''M'' with diameter at most δ. It has applications in [[homology theory]], [[hyperbolic group]]s, [[image processing]], and [[mobile ad hoc network]]ing. It is another example of a flag complex.
* Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a square-free [[monomial ideal]] in a polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;S = K[x_1, \dots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; (that is, a monomial ideal generated by products of subsets of variables). Then the exponent vectors of those square-free monomials of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that are not in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; determine an abstract simplicial complex via the map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in \{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{i \in [n] : a_i = 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, there is a bijection between (non-empty) abstract simplicial complexes on {{math| ''n''}} vertices and square-free monomial ideals in {{math| ''S''}}. If &lt;math&gt;I_{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; is the square-free ideal corresponding to the simplicial complex &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; then the quotient &lt;math&gt;S/I_{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Stanley–Reisner_ring| Stanley–Reisner ring]] of &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Enumeration==
The number of abstract simplicial complexes on up to ''n'' elements is one less than the ''n''th [[Dedekind number]]. These numbers grow very rapidly, and are known only for {{math|''n'' ≤ 8}}; they are (starting with ''n'' = 0):
:1, 2, 5, 19, 167, 7580, 7828353, 2414682040997, 56130437228687557907787 {{OEIS|id=A014466}}. This corresponds to the number of nonempty [[antichain]]s of subsets of an {{math| ''n''}} set.

The number of abstract simplicial complexes on exactly ''n'' labeled elements is given by the sequence "1, 2, 9, 114, 6894, 7785062, 2414627396434, 56130437209370320359966"  {{OEIS|id=A006126}}, starting at ''n'' = 1. This corresponds to the number of antichain covers of a labeled ''n''-set; there is a clear bijection between antichain covers of an ''n''-set and simplicial complexes on ''n'' elements described in terms of their maximal faces.

The number of abstract simplicial complexes on  exactly ''n'' unlabeled elements is given by the sequence "1, 2, 5, 20, 180, 16143" {{OEIS|id=A006602}} , starting at ''n'' = 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10787">[[File:quadratic root.svg|thumb|right|Algebraic operations in the solution to the [[quadratic equation]]. The radical sign, √ denoting a [[square root]], is equivalent to [[exponentiation]] to the power of ½. The [[Plus-minus sign|±&amp;nbsp;sign]] means the equation can be written with either a + or with a – sign.]]
In [[mathematic]]s, a basic '''algebraic operation''' is any one of the traditional [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]]s of [[arithmetic]], which are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]], raising to an integer [[exponentiation|power]], and taking [[nth root|root]]s (fractional power). These operations may be performed on [[number]]s, in which case they are often called [[arithmetic operations]]. They may also be performed, in a similar way, on [[variable (mathematics)|variables]], [[algebraic expression]]s,&lt;ref&gt;William Smyth, ''Elementary algebra: for schools and academies'', Publisher Bailey and Noyes, 1864, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=BqQZAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=ex07zH_ljg&amp;dq=%22Algebraic%20operations%22&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Algebraic%20operations%22&amp;f=false Algebraic Operations]"&lt;/ref&gt; and, more generally on elements of [[algebraic structure]]s, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Nelson Robinson, ''New elementary algebra: containing the rudiments of science for schools and academies'', Ivison, Phinney, Blakeman, &amp; Co., 1866, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKZXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Elementary%20algebra%20notation&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=Elementary%20algebra%20notation&amp;f=false page 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''algebraic operation'' may also be used for operations that may be defined by compounding basic algebraic operations, such as the [[dot product]]. In [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]], ''algebraic operation'' is also used for the operations that may be defined by purely [[algebra|algebraic methods]]. For example, [[exponentiation]] with an [[integer]] or [[rational number|rational]] exponent is an algebraic operation, but not the general exponentiation with a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] exponent. Also, the [[derivative]] is an operation that is not algebraic.

==Notation==
Multiplication symbols are usually omitted, and implied, when there is no operator between two variables or terms, or when a [[coefficient]] is used. For example, 3 × ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is written as 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2 × ''x'' × ''y'' is written as 2''xy''.&lt;ref&gt;Sin Kwai Meng, Chip Wai Lung, Ng Song Beng, "Algebraic notation", in ''Mathematics Matters Secondary 1 Express Textbook'', Publisher Panpac Education Pte Ltd, {{ISBN|9812738827}}, 9789812738820, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nL5ObMmDvPEC&amp;lpg=PR9-IA8&amp;ots=T_h6l40AE5&amp;dq=%22Algebraic%20notation%22%20multiplication%20omitted&amp;pg=PR9-IA8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Algebraic%20notation%22%20multiplication%20omitted&amp;f=false page 68]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes multiplication symbols are replaced with either a dot, or center-dot, so that ''x'' × ''y'' is written as either ''x'' . ''y'' or ''x'' · ''y''. [[Plain text]], [[programming languages]], and [[calculators]] also use a single asterisk to represent the multiplication symbol,&lt;ref&gt;William P. Berlinghoff, [[Fernando Q. Gouvêa]], ''Math through the Ages: A Gentle History for Teachers and Others'', Publisher MAA, 2004, {{ISBN|0883857367}}, 9780883857366, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JAXNVaPt7uQC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;ots=-P78Lrz792&amp;dq=calculator%20asterisk%20multiplication&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=calculator%20asterisk%20multiplication&amp;f=false page 75]&lt;/ref&gt; and it must be explicitly used; for example, 3''x'' is written as 3 * ''x''.

Rather than using the [[obelus]] symbol, ÷, division is usual represented with a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]], a horizontal line, e.g. {{sfrac|3|''x'' + 1}}. In plain text and programming languages a slash (also called a [[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]]) is used, e.g. 3 / (''x'' + 1).

Exponents are usually formatted using superscripts, e.g. ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In [[plain text]], and in the [[TeX]] mark-up language, the [[caret]] symbol, ^, represents exponents, so ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is written as ''x'' ^ 2.&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Bangia, ''Dictionary of Information Technology'', Publisher Laxmi Publications, Ltd., 2010, {{ISBN|9380298153}}, 9789380298153, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQa5I2sHPKEC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;ots=s6pWav1Z_D&amp;dq=%22plain%20text%22%20math%20caret%20exponent&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q=exponentiation%20caret&amp;f=false page 212]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Grätzer, ''First Steps in LaTeX'', Publisher Springer, 1999, {{ISBN|0817641327}}, 9780817641320, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLdg5ZdDKToC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=V9DFIaAAh0&amp;dq=tex%20math&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=subscripts%20and%20superscripts%20caret&amp;f=false page 17]&lt;/ref&gt; In programming languages such as [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

The [[plus-minus sign]], ±, is used as a shorthand notation for two expressions written as one, representing one expression with a plus sign, the other with a minus sign. For example, ''y'' = ''x'' ± 1 represents the two equations ''y'' = ''x'' + 1 and ''y'' = ''x'' − 1. Sometimes it is used for denoting a positive-or-negative term such as ±''x''.

==Arithmetic vs algebraic operations==

[[Image:L'Hospital - Analyse des infiniment petits pour l'intelligence des lignes courbes, 1715 - 1425244.jpg |thumb|''Analyse des infiniment petits pour l'intelligence des lignes courbes'', 1715 edition]]

'''''Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes''''' (literal translation: ''Analysis of the infinitely small to understand curves''), 1696, is the first [[textbook]] published on the [[infinitesimal calculus]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. It was written by the French mathematician [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital]], and treated only the subject of [[differential calculus]].  Two volumes treating the differential and [[integral calculus]], respectively, had been authored by [[Johann Bernoulli]] in 1691&amp;ndash;1692, and the latter was published in 1724 to become the first published textbook on the integral calculus.

In this book is the first appearance of [[L'Hôpital's rule]]. The rule is believed to be the work of [[Johann Bernoulli]] since l'Hôpital, a nobleman, paid Bernoulli a retainer of 300[[French franc|₣]] per year to keep him updated on developments in calculus and to solve problems he had. Moreover, the two signed a contract allowing l'Hôpital to use Bernoulli's discoveries in any way he wished.&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli, e: The Story of a Number. P. 116. Princeton University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Truesdell [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226604 The New Bernoulli Edition] Isis, Vol. 49, No. 1. (Mar., 1958), pp. 54&amp;ndash;62, discusses the strange agreement between Bernoulli and l'Hôpital on pages 59&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these problems was that of limits of indeterminate forms. When l'Hôpital published his book, he gave due credit to Bernoulli and, not wishing to take credit for any of the mathematics in the book, he published the work anonymously. Bernoulli, who was known for being extremely jealous, claimed to be the author of the entire work. Nevertheless, the rule was named for l'Hôpital, who never claimed to have invented it in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, Ross L. and George B. Thomas, Jr. Calculus. 2nd Edition. P. 390. Addison Wesley, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7000">The '''autoepistemic logic''' is a [[logic|formal logic]] for the representation and reasoning of knowledge about knowledge. While [[propositional logic]] can only express facts, autoepistemic logic can express knowledge and lack of knowledge about facts.

The [[stable model semantics]], which is used to give a semantics to [[logic programming]] with [[negation as failure]], can be seen as a simplified form of autoepistemic logic.

==Syntax==

The [[syntax]] of autoepistemic logic extends that of propositional logic by a [[modal operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To clarify, the modal operator &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is a medium white square; this is not a browser rendering issue&lt;/ref&gt; indicating knowledge: if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, &lt;math&gt;\Box F&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is known. As a result, &lt;math&gt;\Box \neg F&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;\neg F&lt;/math&gt; is known and &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box F&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is not known.

This syntax is used for allowing reasoning based on knowledge of facts. For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box F \rightarrow \neg F&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is assumed false if it is not known to be true. This is a form of [[negation as failure]].

==Semantics==

The semantics of autoepistemic logic is based on the ''expansions'' of a theory, which have a role similar to models in [[propositional logic]]. While a propositional model specifies which axioms are true or false, an expansion specifies which formulae &lt;math&gt;\Box F&lt;/math&gt; are true and which ones are false. In particular, the expansions of an autoepistemic formula &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; makes this distinction for every subformula &lt;math&gt;\Box F&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. This distinction allows &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to be treated as a [[propositional formula]], as all its subformulae containing &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; are either true or false. In particular, checking whether &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; [[logical consequence|entails]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in this condition can be done using the rules of the propositional calculus. In order for an initial assumption to be an expansion, it must be that a subformula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is entailed if and only if &lt;math&gt;\Box F&lt;/math&gt; has been initially assumed true.

In terms of [[possible world semantics]], an expansion of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; consists of an '''[[S5 (modal logic)|S5]]''' model of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in which the possible worlds consist only of worlds where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is true. [The possible worlds need not contain all such consistent worlds; this corresponds to the fact that modal propositions are assigned truth values before checking derivability of the ordinary propositions.] Thus, autoepistemic logic extends '''S5'''; the  extension is proper, since &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box \neg p&lt;/math&gt; are tautologies of autoepistemic logic, but not of '''S5'''.

For example, in the formula &lt;math&gt;T = \Box x \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;, there is only a single “boxed subformula”, which is &lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there are only two candidate expansions, assuming it true or false, respectively. The check for them being actual expansions is as follows.

&lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt; is false : with this assumption, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; becomes tautological, as &lt;math&gt;\Box x \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box x \vee x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box x&lt;/math&gt; is assumed true; therefore, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not entailed. This result confirms the assumption implicit in &lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt; being false, that is, that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not currently known. Therefore, the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt; is false is an expansion.

&lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt; is true : together with this assumption, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; entails &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; therefore, the initial assumption that is implicit in &lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt; being true, i.e., that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is known to be true, is satisfied. As a result, this is another expansion.

The formula &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has therefore two expansions, one in which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not known and one in which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is known. The second one has been regarded as unintuitive, as the initial assumption that &lt;math&gt;\Box x&lt;/math&gt; is true is the only reason why &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is true, which confirms the assumption. In other words, this is a self-supporting assumption. A logic allowing such a self-support of beliefs is called ''not strongly grounded'' to differentiate them from ''strongly grounded'' logics, in which self-support is not possible. Strongly grounded variants of autoepistemic logic exist.

==Generalizations==
In [[uncertain inference]], the known/unknown duality of truth values is replaced by a degree of certainty of a fact or deduction; certainty may vary from 0 (completely uncertain/unknown) to 1 (certain/known). In [[probabilistic logic network]]s, truth values are also given a probabilistic interpretation (''i.e.'' truth values may be uncertain, and, even if almost certain, they may still be "probably" true (or false).)

[[Image:Nombre pentagon cent.svg|240px|right]]

A '''centered pentagonal number''' is a [[centered polygonal number|centered]] [[figurate number]] that represents a [[pentagon]] with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in successive pentagonal layers. The centered pentagonal number for ''n'' is given by the formula 

:&lt;math&gt;P_{n}={{5n^2 - 5n + 2} \over 2},  n\geq1&lt;/math&gt;

The first few centered pentagonal numbers are

[[1 (number)|1]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[16 (number)|16]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[51 (number)|51]], [[76 (number)|76]],
[[106 (number)|106]], [[141 (number)|141]], [[181 (number)|181]], [[226 (number)|226]], [[276 (number)|276]],
[[331 (number)|331]], [[391 (number)|391]], [[456 (number)|456]], [[526 (number)|526]], [[601 (number)|601]],
681, 766, 856, 951, 1051, 1156, 1266, 1381, 1501, 1626, 1756, 1891, 2031, 2176, 2326, 2481, 2641, 2806, 2976 {{OEIS|A005891}}.

The parity of centered pentagonal numbers follows the pattern odd-even-even-odd, and in base 10 the units follow the pattern 
1-6-6-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6318">In number theory, the  '''Chevalley–Warning theorem''' implies that certain [[polynomial|polynomial equations]] in sufficiently many variables over a [[finite field]] have solutions. It was proved by {{harvs|txt|first=Ewald |last=Warning|year=1935}} and a slightly weaker form of the theorem, known as '''Chevalley's theorem''', was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Claude Chevalley|last=Chevalley|year=  1935}}. Chevalley's theorem implied Artin's and Dickson's conjecture that finite fields are [[quasi-algebraically closed field]]s {{harv|Artin|1982|loc=page x}}.

== Statement of the theorems ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite field and &lt;math&gt;\{f_j\}_{j=1}^r\subseteq\mathbb{F}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]&lt;/math&gt; be a set of polynomials such that the number of variables satisfies 

:&lt;math&gt;n&gt;\sum_{j=1}^r d_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total degree]] of &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt;. The theorems are statements about the solutions of the following system of polynomial equations

:&lt;math&gt;f_j(x_1,\dots,x_n)=0\quad\text{for}\, j=1,\ldots, r.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''Chevalley–Warning theorem'' states that the number of common solutions &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Or in other words, the cardinality of the vanishing set of &lt;math&gt;\{f_j\}_{j=1}^r&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''Chevalley's theorem'' states that if the system has the trivial solution &lt;math&gt;(0,\dots,0) \in \mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if the polynomials have no constant terms, then the system also has a non-trivial solution &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \mathbb{F}^n \backslash \{(0,\dots,0)\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Chevalley's theorem is an immediate consequence of the Chevalley–Warning theorem since &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is at least 2. 

Both theorems are best possible in the sense that, given any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the list &lt;math&gt;f_j = x_j, j=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; has total degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and only the trivial solution. Alternatively, using just one polynomial, we can take ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the degree ''n'' polynomial given by the [[Field norm|norm]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where the elements ''a'' form a basis of the finite field of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Warning proved another theorem, known as Warning's second theorem, which states that if the system of polynomial equations has the trivial solution, then it has at least &lt;math&gt;q^{n-d}&lt;/math&gt; solutions where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the finite field and &lt;math&gt;d := d_1 + \dots + d_r&lt;/math&gt;. Chevalley's theorem also follows directly from this.

==Proof of Warning's theorem==
''Remark:'' If &lt;math&gt;i&lt;q-1&lt;/math&gt; then 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}}x^i=0&lt;/math&gt;
so the sum over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt; of any polynomial in &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; of degree less than &lt;math&gt;n(q-1)&lt;/math&gt; also vanishes.

The total number of common solutions modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f_1, \ldots, f_r = 0&lt;/math&gt; is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}^n}(1-f_1^{q-1}(x))\cdot\ldots\cdot(1-f_r^{q-1}(x)) &lt;/math&gt;
because each term is 1 for a solution and 0 otherwise.
If the sum of the degrees of the polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is less than ''n'' then this vanishes by the remark above.

== Artin's conjecture ==

It is a consequence of Chevalley's theorem that finite fields are [[quasi-algebraically closed]]. This had been conjectured by [[Emil Artin]] in 1935. The motivation behind Artin's conjecture was his observation that quasi-algebraically closed fields have trivial [[Brauer group]], together with the fact that finite fields have trivial Brauer group by [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]].

== The Ax–Katz theorem ==

The '''Ax–Katz theorem''', named after [[James Ax]] and [[Nicholas Katz]], determines more accurately a power &lt;math&gt;q^b&lt;/math&gt; of the cardinality &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt; dividing the number of solutions; here, if &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the largest of the &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;, then the exponent &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be taken as the [[ceiling function]] of 

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{n - \sum_j d_j}{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Ax–Katz result has an interpretation in [[étale cohomology]] as a divisibility result for the (reciprocals of) the zeroes and poles of the [[local zeta-function]]. Namely, the same power of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; divides each of these [[algebraic integer]]s.

* When focused on educating a population, data literacy involves "...  the knowledge of what data are, how they are collected, analyzed, visualized and shared, and is the understanding of how data are applied for benefit or detriment, within the cultural context of security and privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Crusoe, D. |title=Data Literacy defined pro populo: To read this article, please provide a little information.|journal=The Journal of Community Informatics|date=November 2016|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* When focused on citizen-design, data literacy is "... the ability to ask and answer real-world questions from large and small data sets through an inquiry process, with consideration of ethical use of data. It is based on core practical and creative skills, with the ability to extend knowledge of specialist data handling skills according to goals. These include the abilities to select, clean, analyse, visualise, critique and interpret data, as well as to communicate stories from data and to use data as part of a design process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wolff, A. |author2=Gooch, D. |author3=Cavero, J. |author4=Rashid, U. |author5=Kortuem, G. |title=Creating an understanding of data literacy for a data-driven society|journal=The Journal of Community Informatics|date=November 2016|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* When focused narrowly on the skills employers hope to find in their workers, data literacy means "... competence in finding, manipulating, managing, and interpreting data, including not just numbers but also text and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Jeanne|title=Data Is Useless Without the Skills to Analyze It|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/09/data_is_useless_without_the_skills.html|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The discrete ''q''-Hermite polynomials are given in terms of [[basic hypergeometric function]]s and the [[Al-Salam–Carlitz polynomials]] by 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h_n(x;q)=q^{\binom{n}{2}}{}_2\phi_1(q^{-n},x^{-1};0;q,-qx) = x^n{}_2\phi_0(q^{-n},q^{-n+1};;q^2,q^{2n-1}/x^2) = U_n^{(-1)}(x;q)  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \hat h_n(x;q)=i^{-n}q^{-\binom{n}{2}}{}_2\phi_0(q^{-n},ix;;q,-q^n) = x^n{}_2\phi_1(q^{-n},q^{-n+1};0;q^2,-q^{2}/x^2) = i^{-n}V_n^{(-1)}(ix;q)  &lt;/math&gt;
and are related by
:&lt;math&gt;h_n(ix;q^{-1}) = i^n\hat h_n(x;q)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Eberhard Knobloch''' (born 6 November 1943 in [[Görlitz]]) is a German [[historian of science]] and [[historian of mathematics|mathematics]].

== Career ==

From 1962 to 1967 Knobloch studied classics and mathematics at the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[Technical University of Berlin]], after which he passed his state examination as a high school teacher and even as a high school teacher in ancient languages at Goethe began high school in Berlin before 1970 as a research assistant in the history of science back to the TU Berlin was, where he in 1972 with a thesis on Leibniz's combinatorial in Scriba, Christoph received his doctorate.

From 1973 he was professor of [[mathematics]] at the College of Education in Berlin . In 1976 he qualified as a professor in Berlin and was a visiting scholar at [[Oxford]], [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]]. Since 1976 he is head of the math sections of the Academy edition of the works of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (and later the technical-scientific parts). In 1981 he became professor of history of science at the Technical University of Berlin (since 2002 academy professor); retiring in 2009. In 1984 he was a visiting professor at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Leningrad. Since 1999 he has been a regular guest professor at [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] in Xian, [[China]]. He also was a visiting professor at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] in Paris.

Besides the Leibniz Edition, he also oversaw the Tschirnhaus edition of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and worked at Kepler with edition. He is also director of the Alexander von Humboldt Research Centre of the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences]]. He also dealt with Renaissance technology (such as military engineer [[Taccola|Mariano Taccola]]), the notebooks of [[Leonhard Euler]] and Jesuit scholars like [[Christopher Clavius]].
Knobloch assisted the Dieter Lelgemann surveyors to decode and interpret the [[Ptolemy]] chart with [[Susudata]]. 

He is a member of the [[International Academy of the History of Science]] in Paris (corresponding member since 1984, member since 1988, 2001 to 2005 as Vice President and later its president). Since 1996, a member of the Leopoldina, corresponding member of the [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]], Member of [[Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea]] since 1997 and the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences . From 2001 to 2005 he was president of the German National Committee for the History of Science. In 2006 he became president of the European Society for the History of Science.

Given a [[vector space]] ''X'' then a [[convex function]] mapping to the [[extended reals]], &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, has an ''effective domain'' defined by

The effective domain is equivalent to the projection of the [[Epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}&lt;/math&gt; onto ''X''.  That is

Note that if a convex function is mapping to the normal [[real number line]] given by &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; then the effective domain is the same as the normal definition of the domain.

A function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper convex function]] if and only if ''f'' is convex, the effective domain of ''f'' is nonempty and &lt;math&gt;f(x) &gt; -\infty&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Rockafellar" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''finite lattice representation problem''', or '''finite congruence lattice problem''', asks whether every finite [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] is [[isomorphic]] to the [[congruence lattice]] of some finite [[Universal algebra|algebra]].

== Background ==
A [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] is called [[Algebraic lattice|algebraic]] if it is [[Complete lattice|complete]] and [[Compact element|compactly generated]].  In 1963, Grätzer and Schmidt proved that every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the [[congruence lattice]] of some [[universal algebra|algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Grätzer and E. T. Schmidt, ''Characterizations of congruence lattices of abstract algebras'', Acta Sci. Math. (Szeged) '''24''' (1963), 34–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus there is essentially no restriction on the shape of a congruence lattice of an algebra. The finite lattice representation problem asks whether the same is true for finite lattices and finite algebras. That is, does every finite lattice occur as the congruence lattice of a ''finite'' algebra?

In 1980, Pálfy and Pudlák proved that this problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding whether every finite lattice occurs as an interval in the [[subgroup lattice]] of a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref&gt;Pálfy and Pudlák. ''Congruence lattices of finite algebras and intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups.'' Algebra Universalis 11(1), 22–27 (1980). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02483080 DOI]&lt;/ref&gt;  For an overview of the group theoretic approach to the problem, see Pálfy (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Péter Pál Pálfy. ''Intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups.'' In Groups ’93 Galway/St. Andrews, Vol. 2, volume 212 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., pages 482–494. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pálfy (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Péter Pál Pálfy. ''Groups and lattices.'' In Groups St. Andrews 2001 in Oxford. Vol. II, volume 305 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., pages 428–454, Cambridge, 2003. Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem should not be confused with the [[congruence lattice problem]].

== Significance ==
This is among the oldest unsolved problems in [[universal algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Berman. [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17739547/diss/berman-phd-thesis.pdf ''Congruence lattices of finite universal algebras.''] PhD thesis, University of Washington, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bjarni Jónsson. ''Topics in universal algebra.'' Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 250. Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph McKenzie. ''Finite forbidden lattices.'' In: Universal algebra and lattice theory
(Puebla, 1982), Lecture Notes in Math., vol. 1004, pp. 176–205. Springer, Berlin
(1983). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BFb0063438 DOI]&lt;/ref&gt; Until it is answered, the theory of finite algebras is incomplete since, given a finite algebra, it is unknown whether there are, ''a priori'', any restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5697">'''HOL''' ('''Higher Order Logic''') denotes a family of [[Proof assistant|interactive theorem proving systems]] using
similar [[Higher-order logic|(higher-order)]] logics and implementation strategies.  
Systems in this family follow the [[LCF (theorem prover)|LCF]] approach as they are implemented as a library in some programming language.
This library implements an [[abstract data type]] of proven [[theorem]]s so that new objects of this type can only be created using the functions in the library which correspond to [[inference rule]]s in [[higher-order logic]].  As long as these functions are correctly implemented, all theorems proven in the system must be valid.  In this way, a large system can be built on top of a small trusted kernel.

Systems in the HOL family use the [[ML programming language]] or its successors. ML was originally developed along with LCF to serve the purpose of a meta-language for theorem proving systems; in fact, the name stands for "Meta-Language".

== Underlying Logic ==

&lt;!--''There should be more information on the HOL logic here.''--&gt;

HOL systems use variants of [[classical logic|classical]] [[Higher-order logic]], which has simple axiomatic foundations with few axioms and well-understood semantics&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Peter B. (2002). ''An introduction to mathematical logic and type theory: to truth through proof''. Second edition. Applied Logic Series, 27. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-0763-7}}. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt;.
The logic used in HOL provers is closely related to Isabelle/HOL&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nipkow, Markus Wenzel, and Lawrence C. Paulson. 2002. Isabelle/HOL: A Proof Assistant for Higher-Order Logic. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;, the most widely used logic of [[Isabelle (proof assistant)]].

== Members of HOL Family of Provers ==

There are four HOL systems (sharing essentially the same logic) that are still maintained and developed.

*The first, HOL4 stems from the HOL88 system, which was the culmination of the original HOL implementation effort, led by [[Mike Gordon (computer scientist)|Mike Gordon]]. HOL88 included its own ML implementation, which was in turn implemented on top of [[Common Lisp]]. The implementations following HOL88 (HOL90, hol98 and HOL4) all used [[Standard ML]] as the implementation language.  The hol98 system is tied to the [[Moscow ML]] implementation of [[Standard ML]]; HOL4 can be built with either [[Moscow ML]] or [[Poly/ML]]. Of these four systems, only HOL4 is being maintained and developed. All come with large libraries of theorem proving code. These implement extra automation on top of the very simple core code. HOL4 is BSD licensed.&lt;ref&gt;http://hol-theorem-prover.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The second current implementation is [[HOL Light]]. This started as an experimental "minimalist" version of HOL. Although it has subsequently grown into another mainstream HOL variant, its logical foundations remain unusually simple. HOL Light used to be implemented in [[Caml Light]], but now uses [[OCaml]]. HOL Light is available under the new BSD license.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/hol-light/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The third current implementation is [http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/index/ ProofPower] a collection of tools designed to provide special support for working with the [[Z notation]] for formal specification. 5 of the 6 tools are GNU GPL v2 licensed. The sixth (PPDaz) has a proprietary license.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/getting/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The fourth is [http://proof-technologies.com/holzero/index.html HOL Zero], a minimalist implementation focused on trustworthiness. HOL Zero is GNU GPL 3+ licensed&lt;ref&gt;See LICENSE file in the [http://proof-technologies.com/holzero-0.5.3.tgz tarball].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although HOL is a predecessor of [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]], various HOL derivatives such as HOL4 and HOL Light remain active and in use.

== Selected Formal Proof Developments ==

&lt;!--''There should be more projects listed here.''--&gt;

CakeML&lt;ref&gt;https://cakeml.org/&lt;/ref&gt; project developed a formally proven compiler for [[ML (programming language)]].
Previously, HOL was used to developed a formally proven [[LISP]] implementation running on ARM, x86 and PowerPC&lt;ref&gt;Magnus O. Myreen, Michael J. C. Gordon:
Verified LISP Implementations on ARM, x86 and PowerPC. TPHOLs 2009: 359-374.&lt;/ref&gt;.

HOL was also used to develop formal semantics for x86 multiprocessors &lt;ref&gt;Peter Sewell, Susmit Sarkar, Scott Owens, Francesco Zappa Nardelli, Magnus O. Myreen:
x86-TSO: a rigorous and usable programmer's model for x86 multiprocessors. Commun. ACM 53(7): 89-97 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as semantics of machine code for [[Power Architecture|POWER]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12870">In [[theoretical physics]], '''Hamiltonian field theory''' is the field-theoretic analogue to classical [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. It is a formalism in [[classical field theory]] alongside [[Lagrangian field theory]], and has applications in [[quantum field theory]] also.

==Definition==

The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] for a system of discrete particles is a function of their [[generalized coordinates]] and conjugate momenta, and possibly, time. For continua and fields, Hamiltonian mechanics is unsuitable but can be extended by considering a large number of point masses, and taking the continuous limit, that is, infinitely many particles forming a continuum or field. Since each point mass has one or more [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], the field formulation has infinitely many degrees of freedom.

===One scalar field===

The Hamiltonian density is the continuous analogue for fields; it is a function of the fields, the conjugate "momentum" fields, and possibly the space and time coordinates themselves. For one [[scalar field]] {{math|''φ''('''x''', ''t'')}}, the Hamiltonian density is defined from the [[Lagrangian density]] by&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It is a standard abuse of notation to abbreviate all the derivatives and coordinates in the Lagrangian density as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} (\phi, \partial_\mu \phi, x_\mu)&lt;/math&gt;
The {{math|''μ''}} is an index which takes values 0 (for the time coordinate), and 1, 2, 3 (for the spatial coordinates), so strictly only one derivative or coordinate would be present. In general, all the spatial and time derivatives will appear in the Lagrangian density, for example in Cartesian coordinates, the Lagrangian density has the full form:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left(\phi, \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}, x,y,z,t\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Here we write the same thing, but using ∇ to abbreviate all spatial derivatives as a vector.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}(\phi, \pi, \mathbf{x},t) = \dot{\phi}\pi - \mathcal{L}(\phi, \nabla\phi, \partial \phi/\partial t , \mathbf{x},t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|∇}} the [[gradient operator|"del" or "nabla" operator]], {{math|'''x'''}} is the [[position vector]] of some point in space, and {{math|''t''}} is [[time]]. The Lagrangian density is a function of the fields in the system, their space and time derivatives, and possibly the space and time coordinates themselves. It is the field analogue to the Lagrangian function for a system of discrete particles described by generalized coordinates.

As in Hamiltonian mechanics where every generalized coordinate has a corresponding generalized momentum, the field {{math|''φ''('''x''', ''t'')}} has a '''conjugate momentum field''' {{math|''π''('''x''', ''t'')}}, defined as the partial derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the time derivative of the field,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{\phi}} \,,\quad \dot{\phi}\equiv\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the overdot&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is standard notation in this context, most of the literature does not explicitly mention it is a partial derivative. In general total and partial time derivatives of a function are not the same.&lt;/ref&gt; denotes a [[partial derivative|''partial'']] time derivative {{math|∂/∂''t''}}, not a [[total derivative|total]] time derivative {{math|''d''/''dt''}}.

===Many scalar fields===

For many fields {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''('''x''', ''t'')}} and their conjugates {{math|''π&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''('''x''', ''t'')}} the Hamiltonian density is a function of them all:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}(\phi_1,  \phi_2, \ldots, \pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x},t)= \sum_i\dot{\phi_i}\pi_i - \mathcal{L}(\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots \nabla\phi_1,\nabla\phi_2,\ldots, \partial \phi_1/\partial t ,\partial \phi_2/\partial t ,\ldots, \mathbf{x},t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where each conjugate field is defined with respect to its field,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_i(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{\phi}_i} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, for any number of fields, the [[volume integral]] of the Hamiltonian density gives the Hamiltonian, in three spatial dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \int \mathcal{H} \ d^3 x \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Hamiltonian density is the Hamiltonian per unit spatial volume. The corresponding [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] is [energy][length]&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, in [[SI units]] Joules per metre cubed, J m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Tensor and spinor fields===

The above equations and definitions can be extended to [[vector field]]s and more generally [[tensor field]]s and [[spinor field]]s. In physics, tensor fields describe [[boson]]s and spinor fields describe [[fermion]]s.

==Equations of motion==

The [[equations of motion]] for the fields are similar to the Hamiltonian equations for discrete particles. For any number of fields:

{{equation box 1
|indent = :
|background colour = white
|border colour =black
|border = 1
|title = '''Hamiltonian field equations'''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\dot{\phi}_i = +\frac{\delta\mathcal{H}}{\delta \pi_i}\,,\quad \dot{\pi}_i = - \frac{\delta\mathcal{H}}{\delta \phi_i} \,, &lt;/math&gt;
}}

where again the overdots are partial time derivatives, the [[variational derivative]] with respect to the fields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{\delta \phi_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi_i} - \nabla\cdot \frac{\partial }{\partial (\nabla \phi_i)} - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \frac{\partial }{\partial (\partial\phi_i/\partial t)} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

with · the [[dot product]], must be used instead of simply [[partial derivative]]s. In [[tensor index notation]] (including the [[summation convention]]) this is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{\delta \phi_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi_i} - \partial_\mu \frac{\partial }{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi_i)} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[four gradient]].

==Phase space==

The fields {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and conjugates {{math|''π&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} form an infinite dimensional [[phase space]], because fields have an infinite number of degrees of freedom.

==Poisson bracket==

For two functions which depend on the fields {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''π&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, their spatial derivatives, and the space and time coordinates,

:&lt;math&gt; A = \int d^3 x \mathcal{A}\left(\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots,\pi_1,\pi_2,\ldots,\nabla\phi_1,\nabla\phi_2,\ldots,\nabla\pi_1,\nabla\pi_2,\ldots,\mathbf{x},t\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; B = \int d^3 x \mathcal{B}\left(\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots,\pi_1,\pi_2,\ldots,\nabla\phi_1,\nabla\phi_2,\ldots,\nabla\pi_1,\nabla\pi_2,\ldots,\mathbf{x},t\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the fields are zero on the boundary of the volume the integrals are taken over, the field theoretic [[Poisson bracket]] is defined as (do not be confused with the [[commutator]] from quantum mechanics).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; [A,B]_{\phi,\pi} = \int d^3 x \sum_i \left(\frac{\delta \mathcal{A}}{\delta \phi_i}\frac{\delta \mathcal{B}}{\delta \pi_i}-\frac{\delta \mathcal{B}}{\delta \phi_i}\frac{\delta \mathcal{A}}{\delta \pi_i}\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{F}/\delta f &lt;/math&gt; is the [[variational derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta f} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial f} - \sum_i \nabla_i \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial (\nabla_i f)} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Under the same conditions of vanishing fields on the surface, the following result holds for the time evolution of {{math|''A''}} (similarly for {{math|''B''}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dA}{dt} = [A,H] + \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be found from the total time derivative of {{math|''A''}}, [[integration by parts]], and using the above Poisson bracket.

==Explicit time-independence==

The following results are true if the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities are explicitly time-independent (they can still have implicit time-dependence via the fields and their derivatives),

===Kinetic and potential energy densities===

The Hamiltonian density is the total energy density, the sum of the kinetic energy density (calligraphic T) and the potential energy density (calligraphic V),

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{T}+\mathcal{V}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Continuity equation===

Taking the partial time derivative of the definition of the Hamiltonian density above, and using the [[chain rule]] for [[implicit differentiation]] and the definition of the conjugate momentum field, gives the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \mathbf{S}=0&lt;/math&gt;

in which the Hamiltonian density can be interpreted as the energy density, and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\nabla\phi)}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

the energy flux, or flow of energy per unit time per unit surface area.

==Relativistic field theory==
'''Covariant Hamiltonian field theory''' is the [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] formulation of Hamiltonian field theory.

Hamiltonian field theory usually means the symplectic [[Hamiltonian system|Hamiltonian formalism]] when applied to [[classical field theory]], that takes the form of the instantaneous Hamiltonian formalism on an infinite-dimensional [[phase space]], and where [[canonical coordinates]] are field functions at some instant of time.&lt;ref&gt;Gotay, M., A multisymplectic framework for classical field theory and the calculus of variations. II. Space + time decomposition, in "Mechanics, Analysis and Geometry: 200 Years after Lagrange" (North Holland, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This Hamiltonian formalism is applied to [[quantum field theory|quantization of fields]], e.g., in quantum [[gauge theory]]. In Covariant Hamiltonian field theory,  [[canonical momenta]] ''p&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' corresponds to derivatives of fields with respect to all world coordinates ''x&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Giachetta, G., Mangiarotti, L., [[Gennadi Sardanashvily|Sardanashvily, G.]], "Advanced Classical Field Theory", World Scientific, 2009, {{ISBN|978-981-283-895-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Covariant Hamilton equations are equivalent to the [[Lagrangian system | Euler-Lagrange equations]] in the case of hyperregular [[Lagrangian system | Lagrangians]]. Covariant Hamiltonian field theory is developed in the Hamilton–De Donder,&lt;ref&gt;Krupkova, O., Hamiltonian field theory, J. Geom. Phys. '''43''' (2002) 93.&lt;/ref&gt; polysymplectic,&lt;ref&gt;Giachetta, G., Mangiarotti, L., [[Gennadi Sardanashvily|Sardanashvily, G.]], Covariant Hamiltonian equations for field theory, J. Phys. '''A32''' (1999) 6629; [http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9904062 arXiv: hep-th/9904062].&lt;/ref&gt; multisymplectic&lt;ref&gt;Echeverria-Enriquez, A., Munos-Lecanda, M., Roman-Roy, N., Geometry of multisymplectic Hamiltonian first-order field theories, J.

A phase space of covariant Hamiltonian field theory is a finite-dimensional [[symplectic manifold|polysymplectic]] or [[symplectic manifold|multisymplectic]] manifold.

[[Non-autonomous mechanics|Hamiltonian non-autonomous mechanics]] is formulated as covariant Hamiltonian field theory on [[fiber bundles]] over the time axis, i.e. the [[real line]] ℝ.

In mathematical physics, '''inversion transformations''' are a natural extension of [[Poincaré transformation]]s to include all [[conformal map|conformal]] [[bijection|one-to-one]] transformations on coordinate [[space-time]]. They are less studied in physics because unlike the rotations and translations of Poincaré symmetry an object cannot be physically transformed by the inversion symmetry. Some physical theories are invariant under this symmetry, in these cases it is what is known as a 'hidden symmetry'. Other hidden symmetries of physics include [[gauge symmetry]] and [[general covariance]].

==Early use==
In 1831 the mathematician [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus]] began to publish on transformations of the plane generated by inversion in a circle of radius ''R''. His work initiated a large body of publications, now called [[inversive geometry]]. The most prominently named mathematician became [[August Ferdinand Möbius]] once he reduced the planar transformations to [[complex number]] arithmetic. In the company of physicists employing the inversion transformation early on was [[Lord Kelvin]], and the association with him leads it to be called the [[Kelvin transform]].

==Transformation on coordinates==
In the following we shall use imaginary time (&lt;math&gt;t'=it&lt;/math&gt;) so that space-time is Euclidean and the equations are simpler. The Poincaré transformations are given by the coordinate transformation on space-time parametrized by the 4-vectors&amp;nbsp;''V''

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime = O_\mu ^\nu V_\nu +P_\mu \,  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an [[orthogonal matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-vector. Applying this transformation twice on a [[4-vector]] gives a third transformation of the same form. The basic invariant under this transformation is the space-time length given by the distance between two [[space-time]] points given by 4-vectors ''x'' and&amp;nbsp;''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;r = |x - y |. \, &lt;/math&gt;

These transformations are subgroups of general 1-1 conformal transformations on space-time. It is possible to extend these transformations to include all 1-1 conformal transformations on [[space-time]]

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime =\left( A_\tau ^\nu V_\nu +B_\tau \right) \left( C_{\tau \mu
}^\nu V_\nu +D_{\tau \mu }\right) ^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

We must also have an equivalent condition to the orthogonality condition of the Poincaré transformations:

:&lt;math&gt;AA^T+BC=DD^T+CB \, &lt;/math&gt;

Because one can divide the top and bottom of the transformation by &lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; we lose no generality by setting &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the unit matrix. We end up with

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime =\left( O_\mu ^\nu V_\nu +P_\tau \right) \left( \delta _{\tau
\mu} + Q_{\tau \mu }^\nu V_\nu \right) ^{-1}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Applying this transformation twice on a 4-vector gives a transformation of the same form. The new symmetry of 'inversion' is given by the 3-tensor &lt;math&gt;Q.&lt;/math&gt; This symmetry becomes Poincaré symmetry if we set &lt;math&gt;Q=0.&lt;/math&gt; When &lt;math&gt;Q=0&lt;/math&gt; the second condition requires that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal matrix. This transformation is 1-1 meaning that each point is mapped to a unique point only if we theoretically include the points at infinity.

==Invariants==
The invariants for this symmetry in 4 dimensions is unknown however it is known that the invariant requires a minimum of 4 space-time points. In one dimension, the invariant is the well known [[cross-ratio]] from [[Möbius transformation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-X)(y-Y)}{(x-Y)(y-X)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the only invariants under this symmetry involve a minimum of 4 points, this symmetry cannot be a symmetry of point particle theory. Point particle theory relies on knowing the lengths of paths of particles through space-time (e.g., from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;). The symmetry can be a symmetry of a [[string theory]] in which the strings are uniquely determined by their endpoints. The [[propagator]] for this theory for a string starting at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;(x,X)&lt;/math&gt; and ending at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;(y,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a conformal function of the 4-dimensional invariant. A string field in endpoint-string theory is a function over the endpoints.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x,X). \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Physical evidence==
Although it is natural to generalize the Poincaré transformations in order to find hidden [[symmetries]] in physics and thus narrow down the number of possible theories of [[high-energy physics]], it is difficult to experimentally examine this symmetry as it is not possible to transform an object under this symmetry. The indirect evidence of this symmetry is given by how accurately fundamental theories of physics that are invariant under this symmetry make predictions. Other indirect evidence is whether theories that are invariant under this symmetry lead to contradictions such as giving probabilities greater than 1. So far there has been no direct evidence that the fundamental constituents of the Universe are strings. The symmetry could also be a [[broken symmetry]] meaning that although it is a symmetry of physics, the Universe has 'frozen out' in one particular direction so this symmetry is no longer evident.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8895">In mathematics, the '''Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma''' is a result named after [[William B. Johnson (mathematician)|William B. Johnson]] and [[Joram Lindenstrauss]] concerning low-distortion [[embedding]]s of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The lemma states that a set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are [[Stretch factor|nearly preserved]]. The map used for the embedding is at least [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]], and can even be taken to be an [[orthogonal projection]].

The lemma has uses in [[compressed sensing]], [[manifold learning]], [[dimensionality reduction]], and [[graph embedding]]. Much of the data stored and manipulated on computers, including text and images, can be represented as points in a high-dimensional space (see [[vector space model]] for the case of text). However, the essential algorithms for working with such data tend to become bogged down very quickly as dimension increases.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, writing about [[nearest neighbor search]] in high-dimensional data sets, [[Jon Kleinberg]] writes: "The more sophisticated algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in ''n'' at the expense of an exponential dependence on the dimension ''d''; indeed, even the average case analysis of heuristics such as k-d trees reveal an exponential dependence on ''d'' in the query time. {{citation

Also, the lemma is tight up to a constant factor, i.e. there exists a set of points of size ''m'' that needs dimension

:&lt;math&gt; O\left(\frac{\log(m)}{\varepsilon^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

in order to preserve the distances between all pair of points.&lt;ref&gt;

== Lemma ==
Given &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt;, and a number &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 8 \ln (m)/\varepsilon^2&lt;/math&gt;, there is a linear map &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;(1-\varepsilon)\|u-v\|^2 \leq \|f(u) - f(v)\|^2 \leq (1+\varepsilon)\|u-v\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;u,v \in X&lt;/math&gt;. 

The formula can be rearranged:&lt;math display="block"&gt;(1+\varepsilon)^{-1}\|f(u)-f(v)\|^2 \leq \|u-v\|^2 \leq (1-\varepsilon)^{-1}\|f(u)-f(v)\|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

One proof of the lemma takes ''ƒ'' to be a suitable multiple of the orthogonal projection onto a random subspace of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt;, and exploits the phenomenon of [[concentration of measure]].

Obviously an orthogonal projection will, in general, reduce the average distance between points, but the lemma can be viewed as dealing with ''relative distances'', which do not change under scaling. In a nutshell, you roll the dice and obtain a random projection, which will reduce the average distance, and then you scale up the distances so that the average distance returns to its previous value. If you keep rolling the dice, you will, in polynomial random time, find a projection for which the (scaled) distances satisfy the lemma.

== Alternate statement ==
A related lemma is the distributional JL lemma. This lemma states that for any 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ε'', ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/2 and positive integer ''d'', there exists a distribution over '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k'' × ''d''&lt;/sup&gt; from which the matrix ''A'' is drawn such that for ''k'' = ''O''(''ε''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;log(1/''δ'')) and for any unit-length  vector ''x'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, the claim below holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; P(|\Vert Ax\Vert_2^2-1|&gt;\varepsilon)&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;

One can obtain the JL lemma from the distributional version by setting &lt;math&gt;x = (u-v)/\|u-v\|_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; 1/n^2&lt;/math&gt; for some pair ''u'',''v'' both in ''X''. Then the JL lemma follows by a union bound over all such pairs.

== Speeding up the JL transform ==
Given ''A'', computing the matrix vector product takes ''O''(''kd'') time. There has been some work in deriving distributions for which the matrix vector product can be computed in less than ''O''(''kd'') time. There are two major lines of work. The first, ''Fast Johnson Lindenstrauss Transform'' (FJLT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In [[computer science]] and [[graph theory]], '''Karger's algorithm''' is a [[randomized algorithm]] to compute a [[minimum cut]] of a connected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. It was invented by [[David Karger]] and first published in 1993.&lt;ref name="karger1993"&gt;{{cite conference

|date=1993
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the algorithm is based on the concept of [[Edge contraction|contraction of an edge]] &lt;math&gt;(u, v)&lt;/math&gt; in an undirected graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt;. Informally speaking, the contraction of an edge merges the nodes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; into one, reducing the total number of nodes of the graph by one. All other edges connecting either &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are "reattached" to the merged node, effectively producing a [[multigraph]]. Karger's basic algorithm iteratively contracts randomly chosen edges until only two nodes remain; those nodes represent a [[Cut (graph theory)|cut]] in the original graph. By iterating this basic algorithm a sufficient number of times, a minimum cut can be found with high probability.

==The global minimum cut problem ==
{{main|Minimum cut}}
A ''cut'' &lt;math&gt;(S,T)&lt;/math&gt; in an undirected graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of the vertices &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; into two non-empty, disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;S\cup T= V&lt;/math&gt;. 
The ''cutset'' of a cut consists of the edges &lt;math&gt;\{\, uv \in E \colon u\in S, v\in T\,\}&lt;/math&gt; between the two parts.
The ''size'' (or ''weight'') of a cut in an unweighted graph is the cardinality of the cutset, i.e., the number of edges between the two parts, 
:: &lt;math&gt;w(S,T) = |\{\, uv \in E \colon u\in S, v\in T\,\}|\,.&lt;/math&gt;
There are &lt;math&gt;2^{|V|}&lt;/math&gt; ways of choosing for each vertex whether it belongs to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; or to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, but two of these choices make &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; empty and do not give rise to cuts. Among the remaining choices, swapping the roles of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; does not change the cut, so each cut is counted twice; therefore, there are &lt;math&gt;2^{|V|-1}-1&lt;/math&gt; distinct cuts.
The ''minimum cut problem'' is to find a cut of smallest size among these cuts. 

For weighted graphs with positive edge weights &lt;math&gt;w\colon E\rightarrow \mathbf R^+&lt;/math&gt; the weight of the cut is the sum of the weights  of edges between vertices in each part
:: &lt;math&gt;w(S,T) = \sum_{uv\in E\colon u\in S, v\in T} w(uv)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which agrees with the unweighted definition for &lt;math&gt;w=1&lt;/math&gt;.

A cut is sometimes called a “global cut” to distinguish it from an “&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; cut” for a given pair of vertices, which has the additional requirement that &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\in T&lt;/math&gt;. Every global cut is an &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; cut for some &lt;math&gt;s,t\in V&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the minimum cut problem can be solved in [[polynomial time]] by iterating over all choices of &lt;math&gt;s,t\in V&lt;/math&gt; and solving the resulting minimum &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; cut problem using the [[max-flow min-cut theorem]] and a polynomial time algorithm for [[maximum flow]], such as the [[push–relabel maximum flow algorithm|push-relabel algorithm]], though this approach is not optimal.  Better deterministic algorithms for the global minimum cut problem include the [[Stoer–Wagner algorithm]], which has a running time of &lt;math&gt;O(mn+n^2\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="simplemincut"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoer | first1 = M. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = F. | doi = 10.1145/263867.263872 | title = A simple min-cut algorithm | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 585 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraction algorithm==

The fundamental operation of Karger’s algorithm is a form of [[edge contraction]]. The result of contracting the edge &lt;math&gt;e=\{u,v\}&lt;/math&gt; is new node &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt;. Every edge &lt;math&gt;\{w,u\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{w,v\}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;w\notin\{u,v\}&lt;/math&gt; to the endpoints of the contracted edge is replaced by an edge &lt;math&gt;\{w,uv\}&lt;/math&gt; to the new node. Finally, the contracted nodes  &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with all their incident edges are removed. In particular, the resulting graph contains no self-loops. The result of contracting edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;G/e&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Edge contraction in a multigraph.svg|150px|The marked edge is contracted into a single node.]]

The contraction algorithm repeatedly contracts random edges in the graph, until only two nodes remain, at which point there is only a single cut. 

[[File:Single run of Karger’s Mincut algorithm.svg|frame|center|Successful run of Karger’s algorithm on a 10-vertex graph. The minimum cut has size 3.]]

    '''procedure''' contract(&lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;):
    '''while''' &lt;math&gt;|V| &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt;
        choose &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random
        &lt;math&gt;G \leftarrow G/e&lt;/math&gt;
    '''return''' the only cut in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;

When the graph is represented using [[adjacency list]]s or an [[adjacency matrix]], a single edge contraction operation can be implemented with a linear number of updates to the data structure, for a total running time of &lt;math&gt;O(|V|^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, the procedure can be viewed as an execution of [[Kruskal’s algorithm]] for constructing the [[minimum spanning tree]] in a graph where the edges have weights &lt;math&gt;w(e_i)=\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; according to a random permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Removing the heaviest edge of this tree results in two components that describe a cut. In this way, the contraction procedure can be implemented like [[Kruskal’s algorithm]] in time &lt;math&gt;O(|E|\log |E|)&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[File:Spanning tree interpretation of Karger’s algorithm.svg|frame|center|The random edge choices in Karger’s algorithm correspond to an execution of Kruskal’s algorithm on a graph with random edge ranks until only two components remain.]]

The best known implementations use &lt;math&gt;O(|E|)&lt;/math&gt; time and space, or &lt;math&gt;O(|E|\log |E|)&lt;/math&gt; time and &lt;math&gt;O(|V|)&lt;/math&gt; space, respectively.&lt;ref name=karger1993/&gt;

===Success probability of the contraction algorithm===

In a graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n=|V|&lt;/math&gt; vertices, the contraction algorithm returns a minimum cut with polynomially small probability &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Every graph has &lt;math&gt;2^{n-1} -1 &lt;/math&gt; cuts,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Therefore, the success probability for this algorithm is much better than the probability for picking a cut at random, which is at most &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{2}/( 2^{n-1} -1 )&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the [[cycle graph]] on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices has exactly &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; minimum cuts, given by every choice of 2 edges. The contraction procedure finds each of these with equal probability.

To establish the bound on the success probability in general, let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; denote the edges of a specific minimum cut of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The contraction algorithm returns &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if none of the random edges belongs to the cutset of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the first edge contraction avoids &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, which happens with probability &lt;math&gt;1-k/|E|&lt;/math&gt;. The minimum degree of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is at least &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (otherwise a minimum degree vertex would induce a smaller cut), so &lt;math&gt;|E|\geq nk/2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the probability that the contraction algorithm picks an edge from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is
::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{|E|} \leq \frac{k}{nk/2} = \frac{2}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
The probability &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; that the contraction algorithm on an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex graph avoids &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the recurrence &lt;math&gt;p_n \geq \bigl(1- \frac{2}{n}\bigr) p_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which can be expanded as
:::&lt;math&gt;
p_n \geq \prod_{i=0}^{n-3} \Bigl(1-\frac{2}{n-i}\Bigr) =
 \prod_{i=0}^{n-3} {\frac{n-i-2}{n-i}}
      = \frac{n-2}{n}\cdot \frac{n-3}{n-1} \cdot \frac{n-4}{n-2}\cdots \frac{3}{5}\cdot \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3}
      = \binom{n}{2}^{-1}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Repeating the contraction algorithm===

[[File:10 repetitions of Karger’s contraction procedure.svg|thumb|10 repetitions of the contraction procedure. The 5th repetition finds the minimum cut of size 3.]]

By repeating the contraction algorithm &lt;math&gt; T = \binom{n}{2}\ln n &lt;/math&gt; times with independent random choices and returning the smallest cut, the probability of not finding a minimum cut is
:::&lt;math&gt;
\left[1-\binom{n}{2}^{-1}\right]^T
      \leq \frac{1}{e^{\ln n}} = \frac{1}{n}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total running time for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; repetitions for a graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges is &lt;math&gt; O(Tm) = O(n^2 m \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Karger–Stein algorithm ==
An extension of Karger’s algorithm due to [[David Karger]] and [[Clifford Stein]] achieves an order of magnitude improvement.&lt;ref name= "faster"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Karger | first1 = David R. | authorlink1 = David Karger| last2 = Stein | first2 = Clifford| authorlink2 = Clifford Stein | doi = 10.1145/234533.234534 | title = A new approach to the minimum cut problem | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 601 | year = 1996 | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/courses/ieor6614.S09/Contraction.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea is to perform the contraction procedure until the graph reaches &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; vertices.

    '''procedure''' contract(&lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;):
    '''while''' &lt;math&gt;|V| &gt; t&lt;/math&gt;
        choose &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random
        &lt;math&gt;G \leftarrow G/e&lt;/math&gt;
    '''return''' &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;

The probability &lt;math&gt;p_{n,t}&lt;/math&gt; that this contraction procedure avoids a specific cut &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex graph is
:::
&lt;math&gt;
p_{n,t} \ge \prod_{i=0}^{n-t-1} \Bigl(1-\frac{2}{n-i}\Bigr) = \binom{t}{2}\Bigg/\binom{n}{2}\,.   
&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is approximately &lt;math&gt;t^2/n^2&lt;/math&gt; and becomes less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt; t= n/\sqrt 2 &lt;/math&gt;. 
In particular, the probability that an edge from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is contracted grows towards the end. This motivates the idea of switching to a slower algorithm  after a certain number of contraction steps.

    '''procedure''' fastmincut(&lt;math&gt;G= (V,E)&lt;/math&gt;):
    '''if''' &lt;math&gt;|V| \le 6&lt;/math&gt;:
        '''return''' mincut(&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;)
    '''else''':
        &lt;math&gt;t\leftarrow \lceil 1 + |V|/\sqrt 2\rceil&lt;/math&gt;
        &lt;math&gt;G_1 \leftarrow &lt;/math&gt; contract(&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
        &lt;math&gt;G_2 \leftarrow &lt;/math&gt; contract(&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
        '''return''' min {fastmincut(&lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;), fastmincut(&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;)}

=== Analysis ===

The probability &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; the algorithm finds a specific cutset &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;  is given by the recurrence relation
:::&lt;math&gt;P(n)= 1-\left(1-\frac{1}{2} P\left(\Bigl\lceil 1 + \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr\rceil \right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
with solution &lt;math&gt;P(n) = O\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The running time of fastmincut satisfies
:::&lt;math&gt;T(n)= 2T\left(\Bigl\lceil 1+\frac{n}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr\rceil\right)+O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;
with solution &lt;math&gt;T(n)=O(n^2\log n)&lt;/math&gt;. 
To achieve error probability &lt;math&gt;O(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm can be repeated &lt;math&gt;O(\log n/P(n))&lt;/math&gt; times, for an overall running time of &lt;math&gt;T(n) \cdot \frac{\log n}{P(n)} = O(n^2\log ^3 n)&lt;/math&gt;. This is an order of magnitude improvement over Karger’s original algorithm.

=== Finding all min-cuts ===
'''Theorem:''' With high probability we can find all min cuts in the running time of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2\ln ^3 n)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' We know that &lt;math&gt;P(n) = O\left(\frac{1}{\ln n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore after running this algorithm &lt;math&gt;O(\ln ^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; times the probability of missing a specific min-cut is 
::::&lt;math&gt;\Pr[\text{miss a specific min-cut}] = (1-P(n))^{O(\ln ^2 n)} \le \left(1-\frac{c}{\ln n}\right)^{\frac{3\ln ^2 n}{c}} \le e^{-3\ln n} = \frac{1}{n^3}&lt;/math&gt;.
And there are at most &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; min-cuts, hence the probability of missing any min-cut is
:::&lt;math&gt;\Pr[\text{miss any min-cut}] \le \binom{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^3} = O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of failures is considerably small when ''n'' is large enough.∎

=== Improvement bound ===
To determine a min-cut, one has to touch every edge in the graph at least once, which is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time in a [[dense graph]]. The Karger–Stein's min-cut algorithm takes the running time of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2\ln ^{O(1)} n)&lt;/math&gt;, which is very close to that.

and classical communication is allowed]]
'''LOCC''', or '''local operations and classical communication''', is a method in [[quantum information theory]] where a local (product) operation is performed on part of the system, and where the result of that operation is "communicated" classically to another part where usually another local operation is performed conditioned on the information received. 

== Mathematical Properties == 
The formal definition of the set of LOCC operations is complicated due to the fact that later local operations depend in general on all the previous classical communication and due to the unbounded number of communication rounds. For any finite number &lt;math&gt;r\geq1&lt;/math&gt; one can define &lt;math&gt;LOCC_r&lt;/math&gt;, the set of LOCC operations that can be achieved with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; rounds of classical communication. The set becomes strictly larger whenever &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is increased and care has to be taken to define the limit of infinitely many rounds. In particular, the set LOCC is not topologically closed, that is there are quantum operations that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by LOCC but that are not themselves LOCC.&lt;ref name="CLMOW2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Chitambar, E.; Leung, D.; Mancinska, L.; Ozols, M. &amp; Winter, A. |title=Everything You Always Wanted to Know About LOCC (But Were Afraid to Ask) |journal=Commun. Math. Phys. |volume=328 |page=303 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s00220-014-1953-9 |arxiv=1210.4583|bibcode=2014CMaPh.328..303C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''one-round LOCC'' &lt;math&gt;LOCC_1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Quantum instrument|quantum instrument]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{E}_x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, for which the trace-non-increasing [[completely positive map]]s (CPMs) &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_x &lt;/math&gt; are local for all measurement results &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_x = \bigotimes_{j}({\cal E}_x^j)&lt;/math&gt; and there is one site &lt;math&gt;j=K&lt;/math&gt; such that only at &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; the map &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_x^K&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_x = \bigotimes_{j\not=K}({\cal T_j^x})\otimes{\cal E}_K&lt;/math&gt; is not trace-preserving. This means that the instrument can be realized by the party at site &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; applying the (local) instrument &lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{E}_x^K\right\}&lt;/math&gt; and communicating the classical result &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to all other parties, which then each perform (conditioned on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) trace-preserving (deterministic) local quantum operations &lt;math&gt;{\cal T}_x^j&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;LOCC_r&lt;/math&gt; are defined recursively as those operations that can be realized by following up a operation &lt;math&gt;LOCC_{r-1}&lt;/math&gt; with a &lt;math&gt;LOCC_1&lt;/math&gt;-operation. here it is allowed that the party, which performs the follow-up operations depends on the result of the previous rounds. Moreover, we allow also "coarse-graining", i.e., discarding some of the classical information encoded in the measurement results (of all rounds).

The union of all &lt;math&gt;LOCC_r&lt;/math&gt; operations is denoted by &lt;math&gt;LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; and contains instruments that can be approximated better and better with more LOCC rounds. It topological closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}}&lt;/math&gt; contains ''all'' such operations.

It can be shown that all these sets are different&lt;ref name="CLMOW2012"/&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;LOCC_r\subset LOCC_{r+1}\subset LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}\subset\overline{LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The set of all LOCC operations is contained in the set &lt;math&gt;SEP&lt;/math&gt; of all ''separable operations''. &lt;math&gt;SEP&lt;/math&gt; contains all operations that can be written using [[Quantum_operation#Kraus_operators|Kraus operators]] that have all product form, i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;
{\cal E} (\rho) = \sum_l K^l_1\otimes K^l_2\dots\otimes K_N \rho (K^l_1\otimes K^l_2\dots\otimes K_N)^\dagger,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\sum_l K^l_1\otimes K^l_2\dots\otimes K_N(K^l_1\otimes K^l_2\dots\otimes K_N)^\dagger=1&lt;/math&gt;. Not all operations in &lt;math&gt;SEP&lt;/math&gt; are LOCC, 
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}}\subset SEP,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., there are examples that cannot be implemented locally even with infinite rounds of communication.&lt;ref name="CLMOW2012" /&gt; 

LOCC are the "free operations" in the [[Quantum_entanglement#Entanglement_as_a_Resource|resource theories of entanglement]]: Entanglement cannot be produced from separable states with LOCC and if the local parties in addition to being able to perform all LOCC operations are also furnished with some entangled states, they can realize more operations than with LOCC alone.

== Examples == 
LOCC operations are useful for ''state preparation'', ''state discrimination'', and ''entanglement transformations''.

===State preparation===
Alice and Bob are given a two quantum systems in the product state &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle_A\otimes |0\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;. There task is to produce the separable state &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{1}{2}|00\rangle\langle00|+\frac{1}{2}|11\rangle\langle11|&lt;/math&gt;. With local operations alone this cannot be achieved, since they do not allow to produce the (classical) correlations present in &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. But with LOCC (with one round of communication) &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be prepared: Alice throws an unbiased coin (that shows heads or tails each with 50% probability) and flips her qubit (to &lt;math&gt;|1&gt;_A&lt;/math&gt;) if the coin shows "tails", otherwise it is left unchanged. She then sends the result of the coin-flip (classical information) to Bob who also flips his qubit if he receives the message "tails". The resulting state is &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. In general, ''all'' [[Separable state|separable states]] (and only these) can be prepared from a product states with LOCC operations alone.&lt;ref name="CLMOW2012" /&gt;

===State discrimination===
Given two quantum states &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; on a bi- or multipartite [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;{\cal H}={\cal H}_A\otimes{\cal H}_B\otimes\dots{\cal H}_Z\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, the task is to determine which one of two (or more) possible states &lt;math&gt;\psi_1, \psi_2&lt;/math&gt; it is. As a simple example, consider the two [[Bell state]]s 

:&lt;math&gt;
 |\psi_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|0\rangle_A\otimes|0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A\otimes|1\rangle_B\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 |\psi_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|0\rangle_A\otimes|1\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A\otimes|0\rangle_B\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Let's say the two-[[qubit]] system is separated, where the first qubit is given to Alice and the second is given to Bob. Without communication, Alice and Bob cannot distinguish the two states, since for all local measurements all measurement statistics are exactly the same (both states have the same reduced density matrix). E.g., assume that Alice measures the first qubit, and obtains the result 0. Since this result is equally likely to occur (with probability 50%) in each of the two cases, she does not gain any information on which Bell pair she was given and the same holds for Bob if he performs any measurement. But now let Alice send her result to Bob over a classical channel. Now Bob can compare his result to hers and if they are the same he can conclude that the pair given was &lt;math&gt;|\psi_1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, since only this allows for a joint measurement outcome &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle_A\otimes|0\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;. Thus with LOCC and two measurements these two states can be distinguished perfectly. Note that with global ([[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal]] or [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]]) measurements, a single measurement (on the joint [[Hilbert space]]) is sufficient to distinguish these two (mutually [[Orthogonality#Orthogonal_states_in_quantum_mechanics|orthogonal]]) states. 

There are quantum states that cannot be distinguished with LOCC operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Charles H. Bennett, David P. DiVincenzo, Christopher A. Fuchs, Tal Mor, Eric Rains, Peter W. Shor, John A. Smolin, and William K. Wootters |title=Quantum nonlocality without entanglement |journal=Phys. Rev. A |volume=59 |pages=1070 |year=1999 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.59.1070 |arxiv= quant-ph/9804053|bibcode=1999PhRvA..59.1070B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entanglement transformations===
While LOCC cannot ''generate'' entangled states out of product states, they can be used to transform entangled states into other entangled states. The restriction to LOCC severely limits which transformations are possible.

====Entanglement conversion====

Nielsen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. A. Nielsen |title=Conditions for a Class of Entanglement Transformations |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=83 |pages=436 - 439 |year=1999 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.436 |arxiv=quant-ph/9811053|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83..436N }}&lt;/ref&gt; has derived a general condition to determine whether one pure state of a bipartite quantum system may be transformed into another using only LOCC. Full details may be found in the paper referenced earlier, the results are sketched out here.

Consider two particles in a [[Hilbert spaces|Hilbert space]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with particle states &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with [[Schmidt decomposition]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi\rangle=\sum_i\sqrt{\omega_i}|i_A\rangle\otimes|i_B\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
|\phi\rangle=\sum_i\sqrt{\omega_i'}|i_A'\rangle\otimes|i_B'\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\omega_i}&lt;/math&gt;'s are known as [[Schmidt decomposition|Schmidt coefficients]]. If they are ordered largest to smallest (i.e., with &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&gt;\omega_d&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can only be transformed into &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; using only local operations if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in the range &lt;math&gt;1\leq k \leq d&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^k\omega_i\leq\sum_{i=1}^k\omega_i'
&lt;/math&gt;

In more concise notation:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi\rangle\rightarrow|\phi\rangle\quad\text{iff}\quad\omega \prec \omega'
&lt;/math&gt;

This is a more restrictive condition than that local operations cannot increase [[Quantum_entanglement#Entanglement_measures|entanglement measures]]. It is quite possible that &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; have the same amount of entanglement but converting one into the other is not possible and even that conversion in either direction is impossible because neither set of Schmidt coefficients [[Majorization|majorises]] the other. For large &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; if all [[Schmidt decomposition|Schmidt coefficients]] are non-zero then the probability of one set of coefficients [[Majorization|majorising]] the other becomes negligible. Therefore, for large &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; the probability of any arbitrary  state being convertible into another via LOCC becomes negligible.

The operations described so far are deterministic, i.e., they succeed with probability 100%. If one is satisfied by ''probabilistic'' transformations, many more transformations are possible using LOCC.&lt;ref name="Vidal2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guifré Vidal |title=Entanglement Monotones |journal=J. Mod. Opt. |volume=47 |page=355 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/09500340008244048 |arxiv=quant-ph/9807077}}&lt;/ref&gt; These operations are called ''stochastic LOCC'' (SLOCC). In particular for multi-partite states the convertibility under SLOCC is studied to gain a qualitative insight into the entanglement properties of the involved states.&lt;ref name="GoWa2013"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=G. Gour and N. R. Wallach |title=Classification of Multipartite Entanglement of All Finite Dimensionality |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=111 |page=060502 |year=2013 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.060502 |arxiv=1304.7259|bibcode=2013PhRvL.111f0502G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Going beyond LOCC: Catalytic conversion====
If entangled states are available as a resource, these together with LOCC allow a much larger class of transformations. This is the case even if these resource states are not consumed in the process (as they are, for example, in [[quantum teleportation]]). Thus transformations are called ''entanglement catalysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=D. Jonathan and M. B. Plenio |title=Entanglement-assisted local manipulation of pure quantum states |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=83 |page=3566 |year=1999 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.3566 |arxiv=quant-ph/9905071|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.3566J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this procedure, the conversion of an initial state to a final state that is impossible with LOCC is made possible by taking a tensor product of the initial state with a "catalyst state" &lt;math&gt;|c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and requiring that this state is still available at the end of the conversion process. I.e., the catalyst state is left unchanged by the conversion and can then be removed, leaving only the desired final state. Consider the states,
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle=\sqrt{0.4}|00\rangle+\sqrt{0.4}|11\rangle+\sqrt{0.1}|22\rangle+\sqrt{0.1}|33\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle=\sqrt{0.5}|00\rangle+\sqrt{0.25}|11\rangle+\sqrt{0.25}|22\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|c\rangle=\sqrt{0.6}\mid\uparrow\uparrow\rangle+\sqrt{0.4}\mid\downarrow\downarrow\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
These states are written in the form of [[Schmidt decomposition]] and in a descending order. We compare the sum of the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:::{| class="wikitable"

In the table, red color is put if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k\omega_i&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k\omega'_i&lt;/math&gt;, green color is put if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k\omega_i&lt;\sum_{i=0}^k\omega'_i&lt;/math&gt;, and white color is remained if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k\omega_i=\sum_{i=0}^k\omega'_i&lt;/math&gt;. After building up the table, one can easily to find out whether &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are convertible by looking at the color in the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; direction. &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be converted into &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by LOCC if the color are all green or white, and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be converted into &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by LOCC if the color are all red or white. When the table presents both red and green color, the states are not convertible.

Now we consider the product states &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle |c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle |c\rangle&lt;/math&gt;：
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|\psi\rangle |c\rangle &amp;=
\sqrt{0.24}|00\rangle\mid\uparrow\uparrow\rangle+\sqrt{0.24}|11\rangle\mid\uparrow\uparrow\rangle+

&amp;+\sqrt{0.06}|22\rangle\mid\uparrow\uparrow\rangle+\sqrt{0.06}|33\rangle\mid\uparrow\uparrow\rangle+
\sqrt{0.04}|22\rangle\mid\downarrow\downarrow\rangle+\sqrt{0.04}|33\rangle\mid\downarrow\downarrow\rangle\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|\phi\rangle |c\rangle &amp;=
\sqrt{0.30}|00\rangle\mid\uparrow\uparrow\rangle+\sqrt{0.20}|00\rangle\mid\downarrow\downarrow\rangle+

&amp;+\sqrt{0.10}|11\rangle\mid\downarrow\downarrow\rangle+\sqrt{0.10}|22\rangle\mid\downarrow\downarrow\rangle\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we make up the table:
:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle |c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle |c\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
|- style="background: green; color: white"
| 0 || 0.24 || 0.30
|- style="background: green; color: white"
| 1 || 0.48 || 0.50
|- style="background: green; color: white"
| 2 || 0.64 || 0.65
|- 
| 3 || 0.80 || 0.80
|- style="background: green; color: white"
| 4 || 0.86 || 0.90
|- style="background: green; color: white"
| 5 || 0.92 || 1.00
|- style="background: green; color: white"
| 6 || 0.96 || 1.00
|- 
| 7 || 1.00 || 1.00
|}
The color in the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; direction are all green or white, therefore, according to the Nielsen's theorem, &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle |c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is possible to be converted into &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle |c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by the LOCC. The ''catalyst'' state &lt;math&gt;|c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is taken away after the conversion. Finally we find &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle\overset{|c\rangle}{\rightarrow}|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by the LOCC.

O’Donnell and H. Pye, "A Brief Historical Review of the Important Developments in Lanczos Potential Theory", ''EJTP'', '''7''' (2010) pp. 327–350. {{url|http://www.ejtp.com/articles/ejtpv7i24p327.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso"&gt;M.

==Definition==
The Lanczos tensor can be defined in a few different ways.  The most common modern definition is through the Weyl–Lanczos equations, which demonstrate the generation of the Weyl tensor from the Lanczos tensor.&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso" /&gt;  These equations, presented below, were given by Takeno in 1964.&lt;ref name="Takeno" /&gt;  The way that Lanczos introduced the tensor originally was as a [[Lagrange multiplier]]&lt;ref name="Lanczos1949" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "The Splitting of the Riemann Tensor", ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', '''34''' (1962) pp. 379–389. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.34.379}}&lt;/ref&gt; on constraint terms studied in the [[variational methods in general relativity|variational approach to general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "A Remarkable Property of the Riemann–Christoffel Tensor in Four Dimensions", ''Annals of Mathematics'', '''39''' (1938) pp. 842–850. {{url|https://www.jstor.org/stable/1968467}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under any definition, the Lanczos tensor ''H'' exhibits the following symmetries:
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{abc}+H_{bac}=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{abc}+H_{bca}+H_{cab}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The Lanczos tensor always exists in four dimensions&lt;ref name="BC1983"&gt;F. Bampi and G. Caviglia, "Third-order tensor potentials for the Riemann and Weyl tensors", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''15''' (1983) pp. 375–386. {{doi|10.1007/BF00759166}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not generalize to higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;S. B. Edgar, "Nonexistence of the Lanczos potential for the Riemann tensor in higher dimensions", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''26''' (1994) pp. 329–332. {{doi|10.1007/BF02108015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This highlights the [[spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|specialness of four dimensions]].&lt;ref name="O'DonnellPye" /&gt;  Note further that the full [[Riemann tensor]] cannot in general be derived from derivatives of the Lanczos potential alone.&lt;ref name="BC1983" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Massa and E. Pagani, "Is the Riemann tensor derivable from a tensor potential?", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''16''' (1984) pp. 805–816. {{doi|10.1007/BF00762934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Einstein field equations]] must provide the [[Ricci tensor]] to complete the components of the [[Ricci decomposition]].

===Weyl–Lanczos equations===

The Weyl–Lanczos equations express the Weyl tensor entirely as derivatives of the Lanczos tensor:&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;P. O’Donnell, "A Solution of the Weyl–Lanczos Equations for the Schwarzschild Space–Time", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''36''' (2004) pp. 1415–1422. {{doi|10.1023/B:GERG.0000022577.11259.e0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{abcd}=
H_{abc;d}+H_{cda;b}+H_{bad;c}+H_{dcb;a} 
+ (H^e{}_{(ac);e} + H_{(a|e|}{}^e{}_{;c)})g_{bd} 
+ (H^e{}_{(bd);e} + H_{(b|e|}{}^e{}_{;d)})g_{ac}
- (H^e{}_{(ad);e} + H_{(a|e|}{}^e{}_{;d)})g_{bc} 
- (H^e{}_{(bc);e} + H_{(b|e|}{}^e{}_{;c)})g_{ad}
-\frac{2}{3} H^{ef}{}_{f;e}(g_{ac}g_{bd}-g_{ad}g_{bc})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the Weyl tensor, the semicolon denotes the [[covariant derivative]], and the subscripted parentheses indicate [[symmetric tensor|symmetrization]].  Although the above equations can be used to define the Lanczos tensor, they also show that it is not unique but rather has [[gauge freedom]] under an [[affine group]].&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Hammon and L. K. Norris "The Affine Geometry of the Lanczos ''H''-tensor Formalism", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'','''25''' (1993) pp. 55–80. {{doi|10.1007/BF00756929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If &lt;math&gt;\Phi^a&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary [[vector field]], then the Weyl–Lanczos equations are invariant under the gauge transformation

:&lt;math&gt;H'_{abc} = H_{abc}+\Phi_{[a} g_{b]c}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripted brackets indicate [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetrization]].  An often convenient choice is the Lanczos algebraic gauge, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_a=-\frac{2}{3}H_{ab}{}^b,&lt;/math&gt; which sets &lt;math&gt;H'_{ab}{}^b=0.&lt;/math&gt;  The gauge can be further restricted through the Lanczos differential gauge &lt;math&gt;H_{ab}{}^c{}_{;c}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  These gauge choices reduce the Weyl–Lanczos equations to the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{abcd}=H_{abc;d}+H_{cda;b}+H_{bad;c}+H_{dcb;a}
+H^e{}_{ac;e}g_{bd}+H^e{}_{bd;e}g_{ac}-H^e{}_{ad;e}g_{bc}-H^e{}_{bc;e}g_{ad}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Wave equation==
The Lanczos potential tensor satisfies a wave equation&lt;ref&gt;P. Dolan and C. W. Kim  "The wave equation for the Lanczos potential", ''Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A'', '''447''' (1994) pp. 557-575. {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1994.0155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Box H_{abc} = &amp; J_{abc}\\
&amp; {}- 2{R_c}^d H_{abd}+{R_a}^d H_{bcd}+{R_b}^d H_{acd}\\
&amp; {}+ \left( H_{dbe}g_{ac}-H_{dae}g_{bc} \right)R^{de}+\frac{1}{2}RH_{abc},\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is the [[d'Alembert operator]] and
:&lt;math&gt;J_{abc} = R_{ca;b}-R_{cb;a}-\frac{1}{6}\left( g_{ca}R_{;b}-g_{cb}R_{;a} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
is known as the [[Cotton tensor]].  Since the Cotton tensor depends only on [[covariant derivative]]s of the [[Ricci tensor]], it can perhaps be interpreted as a kind of matter current.&lt;ref name="Roberts1996"&gt;Mark D. Roberts, "The Physical Interpretation of the Lanczos Tensor." ''Nuovo Cim.B'' '''110''' (1996) 1165-1176. {{doi|10.1007/BF02724607}} {{arXiv|gr-qc/9904006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The additional self-coupling terms have no direct electromagnetic equivalent.  These self-coupling terms, however, do not affect the [[vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solutions]], where the Ricci tensor vanishes and the curvature is described entirely by the Weyl tensor.  Thus in vacuum, the [[Einstein field equations]] are equivalent to the [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] wave equation &lt;math&gt;\Box H_{abc} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; in perfect analogy to the vacuum wave equation &lt;math&gt;\Box A_{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt; of the electromagnetic four-potential.  This shows a formal similarity between [[gravitational wave]]s and [[electromagnetic wave]]s, with the Lanczos tensor well-suited for studying gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. López-Bonilla, G. Ovando and J. J. Peña, "A Lanczos Potential for Plane Gravitational Waves." ''Foundations of Physics Letters'' '''12''' (1999) 401-405. {{doi|10.1023/A:1021656622094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weak field approximation where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}=\eta_{ab}+h_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, a convenient form for the Lanczos tensor in the Lanczos gauge is&lt;ref name="Roberts1996" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4H_{abc} \approx h_{ac,b}-h_{bc,a}-\frac{1}{6}(\eta_{ac}{h^d}_{d,b}-\eta_{bc}{h^d}_{d,a}) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
The most basic nontrivial case for expressing the Lanczos tensor is, of course, for the [[Schwarzschild metric]].&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso" /&gt;  The simplest, explicit component representation in [[natural units]] for the Lanczos tensor in this case is
:&lt;math&gt;H_{trt}=\frac{GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
with all other components vanishing up to symmetries.  This form, however, is not in the Lanczos gauge.  The nonvanishing terms of the Lanczos tensor in the Lanczos gauge are
:&lt;math&gt;H_{trt}=\frac{2GM}{3r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{r\theta\theta}=\frac{-GM}{3(1-2GM/r)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{r\phi\phi}=\frac{-GM\sin^2 \theta}{3(1-2GM/r)}&lt;/math&gt;

It is further possible to show, even in this simple case, that the Lanczos tensor cannot in general be reduced to a linear combination of the spin coefficients of the [[Newman–Penrose formalism]], which attests to the Lanczos tensor's fundamental nature.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell" /&gt;  Similar calculations have been used to construct arbitrary [[Petrov type D]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Zafar Ahsan and Mohd Bilal, "A Solution of Weyl-Lanczos Equations for Arbitrary Petrov Type D Vacuum Spacetimes." ''Int J Theor Phys'' '''49''' (2010) 2713-2722. {{doi|10.1007/s10773-010-0464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical mechanics]], the '''Laplace–Runge–Lenz (LRL) vector''' is a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] used chiefly to describe the shape and orientation of the [[orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit]] of one astronomical body around another, such as a planet revolving around a star.  For two bodies interacting by [[gravitation|Newtonian gravity]], the LRL vector is a [[constant of motion]], meaning that it is the same no matter where it is calculated on the orbit;&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980"&gt;{{cite book | last=Goldstein | first=H. | authorlink=Herbert Goldstein | date=1980 | title=Classical Mechanics | edition=2nd | publisher=Addison Wesley | pages=102–105, 421–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalently, the LRL vector is said to be ''conserved''.   More generally, the LRL vector is conserved in all problems in which [[two-body problem|two bodies interact]] by a [[central force]] that varies as the [[inverse square law|inverse square]] of the distance between them; such problems are called [[Kepler problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arnold | first = VI | authorlink = Vladimir Arnold | date = 1989 | title = Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics | edition = 2nd | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | page = 38 | isbn = 0-387-96890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hydrogen atom]] is a Kepler problem, since it comprises two charged particles interacting by [[Coulomb's law]] of [[electrostatics]], another [[inverse square law|inverse square]] [[central force]].  The LRL vector was essential in the first [[quantum mechanic]]al derivation of the [[atomic emission spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[hydrogen atom]],&lt;ref name="pauli_1926"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pauli | first = W | authorlink = Wolfgang Pauli | date = 1926 | title = Über das Wasserstoffspektrum vom Standpunkt der neuen Quantenmechanik | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 36 | pages = 336–363 | doi = 10.1007/BF01450175|bibcode = 1926ZPhy...36..336P }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the development of the [[Schrödinger equation]].  However, this approach is rarely used today.

In [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[quantum mechanics]], conserved quantities generally correspond to a [[symmetry]] of the system.  The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to an unusual symmetry; the Kepler problem is mathematically equivalent to a particle moving freely on [[3-sphere|the surface of a four-dimensional (hyper-)sphere]]&lt;!--a 3-manifold, embedded in 4-space; the latter may be clearer to our readers--&gt;,&lt;ref name="fock_1935" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Fock | first = V | authorlink = Vladimir Fock | date = 1935 | title = Zur Theorie des Wasserstoffatoms | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 98 | pages = 145–154 | doi = 10.1007/BF01336904|bibcode = 1935ZPhy...98..145F }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the whole problem is symmetric under certain rotations of the four-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="bargmann_1936" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Bargmann | first = V | authorlink = Valentine Bargmann | date = 1936 | title = Zur Theorie des Wasserstoffatoms: Bemerkungen zur gleichnamigen Arbeit von V. Fock | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 99 | pages = 576–582 | doi = 10.1007/BF01338811|bibcode = 1936ZPhy...99..576B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This higher symmetry results from two properties of the Kepler problem: the velocity vector always moves in a perfect [[circle]] and, for a given total [[energy]], all such velocity circles intersect each other in the same two points.&lt;ref name="hamilton_1847_hodograph"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = WR | authorlink = William Rowan Hamilton | date = 1847 | title = The hodograph or a new method of expressing in symbolic language the Newtonian law of attraction | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy | volume = 3 | pages = 344–353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is named after [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre-Simon de Laplace]], [[Carl David Tolmé Runge|Carl Runge]] and [[Wilhelm Lenz]]. It is also known as the '''Laplace vector''', the '''Runge–Lenz vector''' and the '''Lenz vector'''. Ironically, none of those scientists discovered it.  The LRL vector has been re-discovered several times&lt;ref name="goldstein_1975_1976"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Goldstein | first=H. | authorlink=Herbert Goldstein | date=1975 | title=Prehistory of the Runge–Lenz vector | journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] | volume=43 | pages=737–738 | doi=10.1119/1.9745|bibcode = 1975AmJPh..43..737G }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last=Goldstein | first=H. | authorlink=Herbert Goldstein | date=1976 | title=More on the prehistory of the Runge–Lenz vector | journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] | volume=44 | pages=1123–1124 | doi=10.1119/1.10202|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44.1123G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also equivalent to the dimensionless [[eccentricity vector]] of [[celestial mechanics]].&lt;ref name="hamilton_1847_quaternions"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = WR | authorlink = William Rowan Hamilton | date = 1847 | title = Applications of Quaternions to Some Dynamical Questions | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy | volume = 3 | pages = Appendix III}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various generalizations of the LRL vector have been defined, which incorporate the effects of [[special relativity]], [[electromagnetic field]]s and even different types of [[central force]]s.

==Context==
A single particle moving under any [[conservation of energy|conservative]] [[central force]] has at least four [[constant of motion|constants of motion]], the total [[energy]] ''E'' and the three [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian components]] of the [[angular momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] '''L''' with respect to the origin.  The particle's orbit is confined to a plane defined by the particle's initial [[momentum]] '''p''' (or, equivalently, its [[velocity]] '''v''') and the vector '''r''' between the particle and the center of force (see Figure 1, below).

As defined below (see [[#Mathematical definition|Mathematical definition]]), the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector (LRL vector) '''A''' always lies in the plane of motion for any [[central force]].  However, '''A''' is constant only for an inverse-square central force.&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;  For most central forces, however, [[#Mathematical definition|this vector]] '''A''' is not constant, but changes in both length and direction; if the central force is ''approximately'' an [[inverse-square law]], the vector '''A''' is approximately constant in length, but slowly rotates its direction.  A ''generalized'' conserved LRL vector &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; [[#Generalizations to other potentials and relativity|can be defined]] for all central forces, but this generalized vector is a complicated function of position, and usually not [[expressible in closed form]].&lt;ref name="fradkin_1967"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fradkin | first = DM | date = 1967 | title = Existence of the Dynamic Symmetries O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and SU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for All Classical Central Potential Problems | journal = Progress of Theoretical Physics | volume = 37 | pages = 798–812 | doi = 10.1143/PTP.37.798|bibcode = 1967PThPh..37..798F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yoshida_1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yoshida | first = T | date = 1987 | title = Two methods of generalisation of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector | journal = European Journal of Physics | volume = 8 | pages = 258–259 | doi = 10.1088/0143-0807/8/4/005|bibcode = 1987EJPh....8..258Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plane of motion is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector '''L''', which is constant; this may be expressed mathematically by the vector [[dot product]] equation {{nowrap|1='''r''' ⋅ '''L''' = 0}}; likewise, since '''A''' lies in that plane, {{nowrap|1='''A''' ⋅ '''L''' = 0}}.

The LRL vector differs from other conserved quantities in the following property.  Whereas for typical conserved quantities, there is a corresponding [[cyclic coordinate]] in the three-dimensional [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of the system, there does ''not'' exist such a coordinate for the LRL vector. Thus, the conservation of the LRL vector must be derived directly, e.g., by the method of [[Poisson bracket]]s, as described below. Conserved quantities of this kind are called "dynamic", in contrast to the usual "geometric" conservation laws, e.g., that of the angular momentum.

==History of rediscovery==
The LRL vector '''A''' is a [[constant of motion]] of the important Kepler problem, and is useful in describing [[orbit (celestial mechanics)|astronomical orbits]], such as the motion of the [[planet]]s.   Nevertheless, it has never been well-known among physicists, possibly because it is less intuitive than [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum]].  Consequently, it has been rediscovered independently several times over the last three centuries.&lt;ref name="goldstein_1975_1976" /&gt;

[[Jakob Hermann]] was the first to show that '''A''' is conserved for a special case of the inverse-square [[central force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hermann | first = J | authorlink = Jakob Hermann | date = 1710 | title = Unknown title | journal = Giornale de Letterati D'Italia | volume = 2 | pages = 447–467}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hermann | first = J | authorlink = Jakob Hermann | date = 1710 | title = Extrait d'une lettre de M.

Juillet 1710 | journal = Histoire de l'academie royale des sciences (Paris) | volume = 1732 | pages = 519–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked out its connection to the eccentricity of the orbital [[ellipse]].  Hermann's work was generalized to its modern form by [[Johann Bernoulli]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bernoulli | first = J | authorlink = Johann Bernoulli | date = 1710 | title = Extrait de la Réponse de M. Bernoulli à M. Herman datée de Basle le 7. Octobre 1710 | journal = Histoire de l'academie royale des sciences (Paris) | volume = 1732 | pages = 521–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the century, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre-Simon de Laplace]] rediscovered the conservation of '''A''', deriving it analytically, rather than geometrically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laplace | first = PS | authorlink = Laplace | date = 1799 | title = Traité de mécanique celeste | pages = Tome I, Premiere Partie,  Livre II, pp.165ff | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the middle of the nineteenth century, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] derived the equivalent [[eccentricity vector]] defined [[#Alternative scalings, symbols and formulations|below]],&lt;ref name="hamilton_1847_quaternions" /&gt; using it to show that the momentum vector '''p''' moves on a circle for motion under an inverse-square [[central force]] (Figure 3).&lt;ref name="hamilton_1847_hodograph" /&gt;

At the beginning of the twentieth century, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] derived the same vector by [[vector analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibbs | first = JW | authorlink = Josiah Willard Gibbs |author2=Wilson EB  | date = 1901 | title = Vector Analysis | publisher = Scribners | location = New York | page = 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibbs' derivation was used as an example by [[Carl David Tolmé Runge|Carle Runge]] in a popular [[Germany|German]] textbook on vectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Runge | first = C | authorlink = Carle David Tolmé Runge | date = 1919 | title = Vektoranalysis | publisher = Hirzel | location = Leipzig | volume = I | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was referenced by [[Wilhelm Lenz]] in his paper on the (old) [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] treatment of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lenz | first = W | authorlink = Wilhelm Lenz | date = 1924 | title = Über den Bewegungsverlauf und Quantenzustände der gestörten Keplerbewegung | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 24 | pages = 197–207 | doi = 10.1007/BF01327245|bibcode = 1924ZPhy...24..197L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1926, the vector was used by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to derive the [[spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]] using modern [[matrix mechanics|quantum mechanics]], but not the [[Schrödinger equation]];&lt;ref name="pauli_1926" /&gt; after Pauli's publication, it became known mainly as the ''Runge–Lenz vector''.

==Mathematical definition==
For a single particle acted on by an [[inverse-square law|inverse-square]] [[central force]] described by the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(r)=\frac{-k}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}~,&lt;/math&gt; 
the LRL vector '''A''' is defined mathematically by the formula&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;
[[File:Laplace Runge Lenz vector.svg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 1: The LRL vector '''A''' (shown in red) at four points (labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4) on the elliptical orbit of a bound point particle moving under an inverse-square [[central force]].  The center of attraction is shown as a small black circle from which the position vectors (likewise black) emanate.  The [[angular momentum]] vector '''L''' is perpendicular to the orbit.  The coplanar vectors {{nowrap|'''p''' × '''L'''}} and (''mk''/''r'')'''r''' are shown in blue and green, respectively; these variables are defined [[#Mathematical definition|below]].  The vector '''A''' is constant in direction and magnitude.]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} - m k \mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}
where

*  {{mvar|m}}  is the [[mass]] of the point particle moving under the [[central force]],
*  '''p'''  is its [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]],
*  '''L''' = '''r''' × '''p''' is its [[angular momentum]] vector,
* {{mvar|k}}  is a parameter that describes the strength of the [[central force]],
* '''r''' is the position vector of the particle (Figure 1), and
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding [[unit vector]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|r}} is the magnitude of '''r'''.

Since the assumed force is [[Conservation law (physics)|conservative]], the total [[energy]] {{mvar|E}} is a [[constant of motion]],
:&lt;math&gt;
E = \frac{p^{2}}{2m} - \frac{k}{r} = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2} - \frac{k}{r}  ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the assumed force is a [[central force]], and thus the angular momentum vector '''L''' is also conserved and defines the plane in which the particle travels.  The LRL vector '''A''' is perpendicular to the [[angular momentum]] vector '''L''' because both {{nowrap|'''p''' × '''L'''}} and '''r''' are perpendicular to '''L'''. It follows that '''A''' lies in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of the [[orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit]].

This definition of the LRL vector '''A''' pertains to a single point particle of mass {{mvar|m}} moving under the action of a fixed force.  However, the same definition may be extended to [[two-body problem]]s such as Kepler's problem, by taking {{mvar|m}} as the [[reduced mass]] of the two bodies and '''r''' as the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] between the two bodies.

A variety of [[#Alternative scalings, symbols and formulations|alternative formulations]] for the same constant of motion may also be used.  The most common is to scale by {{math|''mk''}} to define the [[eccentricity vector]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e} = \frac{\mathbf{A}}{m k} = \frac{1}{m k}(\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L}) - \mathbf{\hat{r}}  ~ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation of the Kepler orbits==
[[File:Laplace Runge Lenz vector2.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 2: Simplified version of Figure 1, defining the angle ''θ'' between '''A''' and '''r''' at one point of the orbit.]]

The ''shape'' and ''orientation'' of the [[two-body problem|Kepler problem]] orbits can be determined from the LRL vector as follows.&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;  Taking the [[dot product]] of '''A''' with the position vector '''r''' gives the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{r} = Ar \cos\theta = 
\mathbf{r} \cdot \left( \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) - mkr
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the angle between '''r''' and '''A''' (Figure 2).  Permuting the [[triple product|scalar triple product]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r} \cdot\left(\mathbf{p}\times \mathbf{L}\right) = 
\left(\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}\right)\cdot\mathbf{L} = 
\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{L}=L^2
&lt;/math&gt;

and rearranging yields the defining formula for a [[conic section]], provided that ''A'' is a constant, which is the case for the inverse square force law,
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{mk}{L^2} \left( 1 + \frac{A}{mk} \cos\theta \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}
of [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] ''e'', 
:&lt;math&gt;
e = \frac{A}{mk} = \frac{\left|\mathbf{A}\right|}{m k}
&lt;/math&gt;
and [[latus rectum]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\left| 2\ell \right| = \frac{2L^2}{mk} ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

The major semiaxis {{mvar|a}} of the conic section may be defined using the latus rectum and the eccentricity
:&lt;math&gt;
a \left( 1 \pm e^2 \right) = \ell = \frac{L^{2}}{mk} ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where the minus sign pertains to [[ellipse]]s and the plus sign to [[hyperbola]]e.

Taking the dot product of '''A''' with itself yields an equation involving the energy {{mvar|E}},
:&lt;math&gt;
A^2= m^2 k^2 + 2 m E L^2 \,  ,
&lt;/math&gt;
which may be rewritten in terms of the eccentricity,
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{2}  - 1= \frac{2L^{2}}{mk^{2}}E ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if the energy ''E'' is negative (bound orbits), the eccentricity is less than one and the orbit is an [[ellipse]].  Conversely, if the energy is positive (unbound orbits, also called "scattered orbits"), the eccentricity is greater than one and the orbit is a [[hyperbola]].  Finally, if the energy is exactly zero, the eccentricity is one and the orbit is a [[parabola]].  In all cases, the direction of '''A''' lies along the symmetry axis of the conic section and points from the center of force toward the [[periapsis]], the point of closest approach.

==Circular momentum hodographs==
[[File:Kepler hodograph3.svg|thumb|right|280px|Figure 3: The momentum vector '''p''' (shown in blue) moves on a circle as the particle moves on an ellipse. The four labeled points correspond to those in Figure 1.  The circle is centered on the ''y''-axis at position ''A''/''L'' (shown in magenta), with radius {{math|''mk''/''L''}} (shown in green).  The angle η determines the eccentricity ''e'' of the elliptical orbit (cos&amp;nbsp;''η'' =&amp;nbsp;''e'').  By the [[inscribed angle|inscribed angle theorem]] for [[circle]]s, ''η'' is also the angle between any point on the circle and the two points of intersection with the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; axis, {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ±''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]

The conservation of the LRL vector '''A''' and angular momentum vector '''L''' is useful in showing that the momentum vector '''p''' moves on a [[circle]] under an inverse-square central force.&lt;ref name="hamilton_1847_hodograph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein_1975_1976" /&gt;

Taking the dot product of
:&lt;math&gt;
mk ~\hat{\mathbf{r}} =    \mathbf{p} \times  \mathbf{L}  - \mathbf{A}
&lt;/math&gt;
with itself yields
:&lt;math&gt;
   (mk)^2= A^2+ p^2 L^2 + 2  \mathbf{L} \cdot (\mathbf{p}  \times \mathbf{A}) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Further  choosing '''L''' along the {{mvar|z}}-axis, and the major semiaxis as the {{mvar|x}}-axis, yields the locus equation for '''p''',

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; p_x^2 + \left(p_y - \frac A L \right)^2 = \left( \frac{mk} L \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}} .

In other words, the momentum vector '''p''' is confined to a circle of radius {{math|''mk/L'' {{=}} ''L''/''ℓ''}} centered on {{math|(0, ''A''/''L'')}}.  The eccentricity {{mvar|e}} corresponds to the cosine of the angle {{mvar|η}} shown in Figure 3.

In the degenerate limit of circular orbits, and thus vanishing '''A''', the  circle centers at the origin (0,0).
For brevity, it is also useful to introduce the variable &lt;math&gt;p_0 = \sqrt{2m|E|}&lt;/math&gt;.

This circular [[hodograph]] is useful in illustrating the [[symmetry]] of the Kepler problem.

==Constants of motion and superintegrability==
The seven scalar quantities ''E'', '''A''' and '''L''' (being vectors, the latter two contribute three conserved quantities each) are related by two equations, {{nowrap|1='''A''' ⋅ '''L''' = 0}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 ''mEL''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, giving five independent [[constants of motion]].  (Since the magnitude of '''A''', hence the eccentricity ''e'' of the orbit, can be determined from the total angular momentum ''L'' and the energy ''E'', only the ''direction'' of '''A''' is conserved independently; moreover, since '''A''' must be perpendicular to '''L''', it contributes ''only one'' additional conserved quantity.)

This is consistent with the six initial conditions (the particle's initial position and velocity [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, each with three components) that specify the orbit of the particle, since the initial time is not determined by a constant of motion.  The resulting 1-dimensional orbit in 6-dimensional phase space is thus completely specified.

A mechanical system with ''d'' degrees of freedom can have at most {{nowrap|2''d'' − 1}} [[constant of motion|constants of motion]], since there are 2''d'' initial conditions and the initial time cannot be determined by a constant of motion.  A system with more than ''d'' [[constant of motion|constants of motion]] is called ''superintegrable'' and a system with {{nowrap|2''d'' − 1}} constants is called '''[[Superintegrable Hamiltonian system|maximally superintegrable]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = NW | date = 1990 | title = Superintegrability in classical mechanics | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 41 | pages = 5666–5676 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.41.5666|bibcode = 1990PhRvA..41.5666E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the solution of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] in one [[coordinate system]] can yield only ''d'' constants of motion, superintegrable systems must be separable in more than one coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sommerfeld | first = A | authorlink = Arnold Sommerfeld | date = 1923 | title = Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines | publisher = Methuen | location = London | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kepler problem is maximally superintegrable, since it has three degrees of freedom ({{nowrap|1=''d'' = 3}}) and five independent [[constant of motion]]; its Hamilton–Jacobi equation is separable in both [[spherical coordinates]] and [[parabolic coordinates]],&lt;ref name="landau_lifshitz_1976"&gt;{{cite book | last=Landau |first=LD | authorlink=Lev Landau |author2=Lifshitz EM |authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz  | date=1976 | title=Mechanics | edition=3rd | publisher=Pergamon Press | page = 154 | isbn=         
0-08-021022-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described [[#Hamilton–Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates|below]].

Maximally superintegrable systems follow closed, one-dimensional orbits in [[phase space]], since the orbit is the intersection of the phase-space [[isosurface]]s of their constants of motion. Consequently, the orbits are perpendicular to all gradients of all these
independent isosurfaces, five in this specific problem, and hence are determined by the generalized cross products of all of these gradients. As a result, '''all''' superintegrable systems are automatically describable by [[Nambu mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Curtright | first= T |author2=Zachos C | date= 2003 | title=Classical and Quantum Nambu Mechanics | journal = Physical Review | volume = D68 | page = 085001 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.68.085001|arxiv = hep-th/0212267 |bibcode = 2003PhRvD..68h5001C }}&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, and equivalently,  to [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].

Maximally superintegrable systems can be [[canonical quantization|quantized]] using   [[commutation relation]]s, as illustrated [[#Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom|below]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = NW | date = 1991 | title =

such as this classical Kepler problem into the quantum hydrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title= Branes, quantum Nambu brackets,  and the hydrogen atom | last = Zachos | first = C | author2=Curtright T | date= 2004 | journal = Czech Journal of Physics | volume= 54 | pages = 1393–1398 | doi= 10.1007/s10582-004-9807-x |arxiv = math-ph/0408012 |bibcode = 2004CzJPh..54.1393Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution under perturbed potentials==
[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|right|thumb|250px|Figure 5: Gradually precessing elliptical orbit, with an eccentricity ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.667.  Such precession arises in the Kepler problem if the attractive [[central force]] deviates slightly from an [[inverse-square law]].  The ''rate'' of precession can be calculated using the formulae in the text.]]

The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector '''A''' is conserved only for a perfect [[inverse square law|inverse-square]] [[central force]].  In most practical problems such as planetary motion, however, the interaction [[potential energy]] between two bodies is not exactly an [[inverse square law]], but may include an additional central force, a so-called ''perturbation'' described by a [[potential energy]] {{math|''h''(''r'')}}.  In such cases, the LRL vector rotates slowly in the plane of the orbit, corresponding to a slow [[apsidal precession]] of the orbit.

By assumption, the perturbing potential {{math|''h''(''r'')}} is a [[conservation of energy|conservative]] central force, which implies that the total energy {{mvar|E}} and [[angular momentum]] vector '''L''' are conserved.  Thus, the motion still lies in a plane perpendicular to '''L''' and the magnitude {{mvar|A}} is conserved, from the equation {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''mEL''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The perturbation potential {{math|''h''(''r'')}} may be any sort of function, but should be significantly weaker than the main inverse-square force between the two bodies.

The ''rate'' at which the LRL vector rotates provides information about the perturbing potential {{math|''h''(''r'')}}.  Using canonical perturbation theory and [[action-angle coordinates]], it is straightforward to show&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt; that '''A''' rotates at a rate of,
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial L} \langle h(r) \rangle &amp; = \displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial L} \left\{ \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T h(r) \, dt \right\} \\[1em]
&amp; =  \displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial L} \left\{ \frac{m}{L^{2}} \int_0^{2\pi} r^2 h(r) \, d\theta \right\}  ~,
\end{align}   &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|T}} is the orbital period, and the identity {{math|''L'' ''dt'' {{=}} ''m'' ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dθ''}} was used to convert the time integral into an angular integral (Figure 5).  The expression in angular brackets, {{math|{{langle}}''h''(''r''){{rangle}}}}, represents the perturbing potential, but ''averaged'' over one full period; that is, averaged over one full passage of the body around its orbit. Mathematically, this time average corresponds to the following quantity in curly braces.  This averaging helps to suppress fluctuations in the rate of rotation.

This approach was used to help verify [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]], which adds a small effective inverse-cubic perturbation to the normal Newtonian gravitational potential,&lt;ref name="einstein_1915"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | date = 1915 | title = Erklärung der Perihelbewegung des Merkur aus der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie | journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften | volume = 1915 | pages = 831–839}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
h(r) = \frac{kL^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} \left( \frac{1}{r^{3}} \right) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this function into the integral and using the equation
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{mk}{L^2} \left( 1 + \frac{A}{mk} \cos\theta \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
to express {{mvar|r}} in terms of {{mvar|θ}}, the [[Apsidal precession|precession rate]] of the [[periapsis]] caused by this non-Newtonian perturbation is calculated to be&lt;ref name="einstein_1915" /&gt;

===The unscaled functions===
The algebraic structure of the problem  is, as explained in later sections, SO(4)/ℤ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ~ SO(3) × SO(3).&lt;ref name="bargmann_1936" /&gt;
The three components ''L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the angular momentum vector '''L''' have the [[Poisson bracket]]s&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\{ L_i, L_j\} = \sum_{s=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijs} L_s ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|i}}=1,2,3 and {{math|''ϵ&lt;sub&gt;ijs&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the fully [[antisymmetric tensor]], i.e., the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]; the summation index {{mvar|s}} is used here to avoid confusion with the force parameter {{mvar|k}} defined [[#Mathematical definition|above]].   Then since the LRL vector '''A''' transforms like a vector, we have the following Poisson bracket relations between '''A''' and '''L''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 17.25&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{A_i,L_j\}=\sum_{s=1}^3\varepsilon_{ijs}A_s.&lt;/math&gt; 
Finally, the Poisson bracket relations between the different components of '''A''' are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 18.7; note that Hall uses a different normalization of the LRL vector&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{A_i,A_j\}=-\frac{2}{m}\sum_{s=1}^3\varepsilon_{ijs}L_sH,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian. Note that the span of the components of '''A''' and the components of '''L''' is not closed under Poisson brackets, because of the factor of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; on the right-hand side of this last relation.

Finally, since both '''L''' and '''A''' are constants of motion, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\{A_i,H\}=\{L_i,H\}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The Poisson brackets will be extended to [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[canonical commutation relation|commutation relations]] in the [[#Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom|next section]] and [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]]s in a [[#Conservation and symmetry|following section]].

===The scaled functions===
As noted [[#Alternative scalings, symbols and formulations|below]], a scaled Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector '''D''' may be defined with the same units as [[angular momentum]] by dividing '''A''' by &lt;math&gt;p_0= \sqrt{2m|H|}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since '''D''' still transforms like a vector, the [[Poisson bracket]]s of '''D''' with the angular momentum vector '''L''' can then be written in a similar form&lt;ref name="bargmann_1936" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bohm_1986"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bohm | first=A. | date=1986 | title=Quantum Mechanics: Foundations and Applications | edition= 2nd | publisher=Springer Verlag | pages=208–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\{ D_i, L_j\} = \sum_{s=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijs} D_s ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Poisson bracket]]s of '''D''' with ''itself'' depend on the [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] of ''H'', i.e., on whether the energy is [[negative number|negative]] (producing closed, elliptical orbits under an inverse-square central force) or [[positive number|positive]] (producing open, hyperbolic orbits under an inverse-square central force).  For ''negative'' energies—i.e., for bound systems—the Poisson brackets are&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 18.9&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\{ D_i, D_j\} = \sum_{s=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijs} L_s.
&lt;/math&gt;
We may now appreciate the motivation for the chosen scaling of '''D''': With this scaling, the Hamiltonian no longer appears on the right-hand side of the preceding relation. Thus, the span of the three components of '''L''' and the three components of '''D''' forms a six-dimensional Lie algebra under the Poisson bracket. This Lie algebra is isomorphic to so(4), the Lie algebra of the 4-dimensional rotation group SO(4).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 18.4.4&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, for ''positive'' energy, the Poisson brackets have the opposite sign,
:&lt;math&gt;
\{ D_i, D_j\} = -\sum_{s=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijs} L_s ~.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the Lie algebra is isomorphic to so(3,1).

The distinction between positive and negative energies arises because the desired scaling—the one that eliminates the Hamiltonian from the right-hand side of the Poisson bracket relations between the components of the scaled LRL vector—involves the ''square root'' of the Hamiltonian. To obtain real-valued functions, we must then take the absolute value of the Hamiltonian, which distinguishes between positive values (where &lt;math&gt;|H|=H&lt;/math&gt;) and negative values (where &lt;math&gt;|H|=-H&lt;/math&gt;).

===Casimir invariants and the energy levels===
The [[Casimir invariant]]s for negative energies are
:&lt;math&gt;
C_1 = \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{L} = \frac{mk^2}{2|E|}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
C_2 = \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{L} = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

and have vanishing Poisson brackets with all components of '''D''' and '''L''',
:&lt;math&gt;
\{ C_1, L_i \} = \{ C_1, D_i\} = 
\{ C_2, L_i \} = \{ C_2, D_i \} = 0 ~.
&lt;/math&gt;
''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is trivially zero, since the two vectors are always perpendicular.

However, the other invariant, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is non-trivial and depends only on ''m'', ''k'' and ''E''.  Upon canonical quantization, this invariant allows the energy levels of [[hydrogen-like atom]]s to be derived using only [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[canonical commutation relation]]s, instead of the conventional solution of the [[Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 18.4.4&lt;/ref&gt; This derivation is discussed in detail in the next section.

==Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dipole]] --&gt;

[[File:Hydrogen energy levels.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 6: Energy levels of the hydrogen atom as predicted from the commutation relations of angular momentum and Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector operators; these energy levels have been verified experimentally.]]

Poisson brackets provide a simple guide for [[canonical quantization|quantizing most classical systems]]: the [[commutation relation]] of two [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Operator (physics)|operator]]s is specified by the [[Poisson bracket]] of the corresponding [[classical mechanics|classical]] variables, multiplied by  {{math|''iħ''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirac | first = PAM | authorlink = Paul Dirac | date = 1958 | title = Principles of Quantum Mechanics | edition = 4th revised | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By carrying out this quantization and calculating the eigenvalues of the {{mvar|C}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; Casimir operator for the Kepler problem, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] was able to derive the [[energy spectrum|energy levels]] of [[hydrogen-like atom]]s (Figure 6) and, thus, their [[atomic emission spectrum]].&lt;ref name="pauli_1926" /&gt;  This elegant 1926 derivation was obtained ''before the development of the [[Schrödinger equation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schrödinger | first = E | authorlink = Erwin Schrödinger | date = 1926 | title = Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 384 | pages = 361–376 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19263840404|bibcode = 1926AnP...384..361S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subtlety of the quantum mechanical operator for the LRL vector '''A''' is that the momentum and angular momentum operators do not commute; hence, the quantum operator [[cross product]] of '''p''' and '''L''' must be defined carefully.&lt;ref name="bohm_1986" /&gt;  Typically, the operators for the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian components]] {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  are defined using a symmetrized (Hermitian) product,
:&lt;math&gt;
A_s = - m k \hat{r}_s + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \varepsilon_{sij} (p_i \ell_j + \ell_j p_i) ,
&lt;/math&gt;
Once this is done, one can show that the quantum LRL operators satisfy commutations relations exactly analogous to the Poisson bracket relations in the previous section—just replacing the Poisson bracket with &lt;math&gt;1/(i\hbar)&lt;/math&gt; times the commutator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 18.12&lt;/ref&gt;

From these operators, additional [[ladder operators]]  for '''L''' can be defined,
:&lt;math&gt;
J_0 = A_3
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
J_{\pm 1} = \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( A_1 \pm i A_2 \right) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;
These further connect ''different'' eigenstates of '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so different spin multiplets, among themselves.

A normalized first Casimir invariant operator, quantum analog of the above, can likewise be defined,
:&lt;math&gt;
C_1 = - \frac{m k^2}{2 \hbar^{2}} H^{-1} - I  ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the inverse of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] energy operator, and {{mvar|I}} is the [[identity function|identity operator]].

Applying these ladder operators to the [[eigenstate]]s |''ℓ''{{math|''mn''}}〉 of the total angular momentum, azimuthal angular momentum and energy operators, the eigenvalues of the first Casimir operator, {{mvar|C}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are seen to be quantized, {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.  Importantly, by dint of the vanishing of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, they are independent of the ℓ and {{mvar|m}} quantum numbers, making the [[degenerate energy level|energy levels degenerate]].&lt;ref name="bohm_1986" /&gt;

Hence, the energy levels are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
E_n = - \frac{m k^2}{2\hbar^{2} n^2} ~ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
which coincides with the [[Rydberg formula]] for [[hydrogen-like atom]]s (Figure 6). The additional symmetry operators '''A''' have connected the different ℓ multiplets among themselves, for a given energy (and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), dictating  {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} states at each level. In effect, they have enlarged the angular momentum group [[SO(3)]] to [[SO(4)]]/ℤ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ~ SO(3) × SO(3).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 18.14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and symmetry==
The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to a subtle [[symmetry]] of the system.  In [[classical mechanics]], symmetries are continuous operations that map one orbit onto another without changing the energy of the system; in [[quantum mechanics]], symmetries are continuous operations that "mix" [[atomic orbital|electronic orbitals]] of the same energy, i.e., [[degenerate energy level]]s.  A conserved quantity is usually associated with such symmetries.&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;  For example, every [[central force]] is symmetric under the [[rotation group SO(3)]], leading to the conservation of [[angular momentum]] '''L'''.  Classically, an overall rotation of the system does not affect the energy of an orbit; quantum mechanically, rotations mix the [[spherical harmonic]]s of the same [[quantum number]] ''l'' without changing the energy.

[[File:Kepler hodograph family.png|thumb|right|Figure 7: The family of circular momentum hodographs for a given energy ''E''.  All the circles pass through the same two points &lt;math&gt;\pm p_0 = \pm \sqrt{2m|E|}&lt;/math&gt; on the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;-axis (cf. Figure 3).  This family of hodographs corresponds to one family of [[Apollonian circles]], and the σ isosurfaces of [[bipolar coordinates]].]]

The symmetry for the inverse-square central force is higher and more subtle.  The peculiar symmetry of the Kepler problem results in the conservation of both the angular momentum vector '''L''' and the LRL vector '''A''' (as defined [[#Mathematical definition|above]]) and, [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanically]], ensures that the energy levels of [[hydrogen]] do not depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers ''l'' and ''m''.  The symmetry is more subtle, however, because the symmetry operation must take place in a [[dimension|higher-dimensional space]]; such symmetries are often called "hidden symmetries".&lt;ref name="prince_eliezer_1981" /&gt;

Classically, the higher symmetry of the Kepler problem allows for continuous alterations of the orbits that preserve energy but not angular momentum; expressed another way, orbits of the same energy but different angular momentum (eccentricity) can be transformed continuously into one another.  Quantum mechanically, this corresponds to mixing orbitals that differ in the ''l'' and ''m'' [[quantum number]]s, such as the ''s'' ({{nowrap|1=''l'' = 0}}) and ''p'' ({{nowrap|1=''l'' = 1}}) [[atomic orbital]]s.  Such mixing cannot be done with ordinary three-dimensional translations or rotations, but is equivalent to a rotation in a higher dimension.

For ''negative'' energies – i.e., for bound systems – the higher symmetry group is [[SO(4)]], which preserves the length of four-dimensional vectors

:&lt;math&gt;
|\mathbf{e}|^2 = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + e_3^2 + e_4^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

In 1935, [[Vladimir Fock]] showed that the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] bound Kepler problem is equivalent to the problem of a free particle confined to a three-dimensional [[three-sphere|unit sphere]] in four-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="fock_1935" /&gt;  Specifically, Fock showed that the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger]] [[wavefunction]] in the momentum space for the Kepler problem was the [[stereographic projection]] of the [[spherical harmonic]]s on the sphere.  Rotation of the sphere and reprojection results in a continuous mapping of the elliptical orbits without changing the energy; quantum mechanically, this corresponds to a mixing of all orbitals of the same energy quantum number ''n''.  [[Valentine Bargmann]] noted subsequently that the Poisson brackets for the angular momentum vector '''L''' and the scaled LRL vector '''D''' formed the [[Lie algebra]] for SO(4).&lt;ref name="bargmann_1936" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 18.9&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, the six quantities '''D''' and '''L''' correspond to the six conserved angular momenta in four dimensions, associated with the six possible [[SO(4)|simple rotations]] in that space (there are six ways of choosing two axes from four).  This conclusion does not imply that our [[universe]] is a three-dimensional sphere; it merely means that this particular physics problem (the [[two-body problem]] for inverse-square [[central force]]s) is ''mathematically equivalent'' to a free particle on a three-dimensional sphere.

For ''positive'' energies –&amp;nbsp;i.e., for unbound, "scattered" systems&amp;nbsp;– the higher symmetry group is [[SO(3,1)]], which preserves the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski length]] of [[4-vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^{2} = e_{1}^{2} + e_{2}^{2} + e_{3}^{2} - e_{4}^{2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Both the negative- and positive-energy cases were considered by Fock&lt;ref name="fock_1935" /&gt; and Bargmann&lt;ref name="bargmann_1936" /&gt; and have been reviewed encyclopedically by Bander and Itzykson.&lt;ref name="bander_itzykson_1966"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bander | first = M |author2=Itzykson C  | date = 1966 | title = Group Theory and the Hydrogen Atom (I) | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 38 | pages = 330–345 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.38.330 | bibcode=1966RvMP...38..330B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bander | first = M |author2=Itzykson C  | date = 1966 | title = Group Theory and the Hydrogen Atom (II) | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 38 | pages = 346–358 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.38.346 | bibcode=1966RvMP...38..346B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbits of [[central force|central-force]] systems&amp;nbsp;– and those of the Kepler problem in particular&amp;nbsp;– are also symmetric under [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].  Therefore, the [[SO(3)]], [[SO(4)]] and [[SO(3,1)]] groups cited above are not the full symmetry groups of their orbits; the full groups are [[orthogonal group|O(3)]], [[orthogonal group|O(4)]] and [[O(3,1)]], respectively.  Nevertheless, only the [[connected space|connected]] [[subgroup]]s, SO(3), SO(4) and SO(3,1), are needed to demonstrate the conservation of the [[angular momentum]] and LRL vectors; the reflection symmetry is irrelevant for conservation, which may be derived from the [[Lie algebra]] of the group.

==Rotational symmetry in four dimensions==
[[File:Kepler Fock projection.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 8: The momentum hodographs of Figure 7 correspond to [[stereographic projection]]s of [[great circle]]s on the three-dimensional η unit sphere.  All of the great circles intersect the η&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; axis, which is perpendicular to the page; the projection is from the North pole (the '''w''' unit vector) to the ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;−''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; plane, as shown here for the magenta hodograph by the dashed black lines.  The great circle at a latitude ''α'' corresponds to an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] {{nowrap|1=''e'' = sin ''α''}}.  The colors of the great circles shown here correspond to their matching hodographs in Figure 7.]]

The connection between the [[two-body problem|Kepler problem]] and four-dimensional rotational symmetry [[SO(4)]] can be readily visualized.&lt;ref name="bander_itzykson_1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rogers_1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rogers | first = HH | date = 1973 | title = Symmetry transformations of the classical Kepler problem | journal = Journal of Mathematical Physics | volume = 14 | pages = 1125–1129 | doi = 10.1063/1.1666448|bibcode = 1973JMP....14.1125R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Guillemin | first = V |author2=Sternberg S  | date = 1990 | title = Variations on a Theme by Kepler | publisher = American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications | volume = 42 | isbn = 0-8218-1042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Let the four-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinates]] be denoted (''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'') where (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') represent the Cartesian coordinates of the normal position [[vector (geometric)|vector]] '''r'''. The three-dimensional momentum vector '''p''' is associated with a four-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\eta&lt;/math&gt; on a three-dimensional unit sphere

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol\eta &amp; = \displaystyle \frac{p^2 - p_0^2}{p^2 + p_0^2} \mathbf{\hat{w}} + \frac{2 p_0}{p^2 + p_0^2} \mathbf{p} \\[1em]
  &amp; = \displaystyle \frac{mk - r p_0^2}{mk} \mathbf{\hat{w}} + \frac{rp_0}{mk} \mathbf{p},
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector along the new ''w''-axis.  The transformation mapping '''p''' to '''η''' can be uniquely inverted; for example, the ''x''-component of the momentum equals

:&lt;math&gt;
p_x = p_0 \frac{\eta_x}{1 - \eta_w}
&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''.  In other words, the three-dimensional vector '''p''' is a [[stereographic projection]] of the four-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\eta&lt;/math&gt; vector, scaled by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (Figure 8).

Without loss of generality, we may eliminate the normal rotational symmetry by choosing the [[Cartesian coordinates]] such that the ''z''-axis is aligned with the angular momentum vector '''L''' and the momentum hodographs are aligned as they are in Figure 7, with the centers of the circles on the ''y''-axis.  Since the motion is planar, and '''p''' and '''L''' are perpendicular, ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and attention may be restricted to the three-dimensional vector {{nowrap|1=&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\eta&lt;/math&gt; = (η&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;, η&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  The family of [[Apollonian circles]] of momentum hodographs (Figure 7) correspond to a family of [[great circle]]s on the three-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\eta&lt;/math&gt; sphere, all of which intersect the ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;-axis at the two foci {{nowrap|1=''η''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ±1}}, corresponding to the momentum hodograph foci at ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ±''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;-axis (Figure 8).  This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another; however, such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three-dimensional rotations, since it transforms the fourth dimension ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector.

An elegant [[action-angle variables]] solution for the Kepler problem can be obtained by eliminating the redundant four-dimensional coordinates &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\eta&lt;/math&gt; in favor of elliptic cylindrical coordinates {{nowrap|(''χ'', ''ψ'', ''φ'')}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lakshmanan | first = M |author2=Hasegawa H  | title = On the canonical equivalence of the Kepler problem in coordinate and momentum spaces | journal = Journal of Physics A | volume = 17 | pages = L889–L893 | doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/17/16/006 | date = 1984|bibcode = 1984JPhA...17L.889L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\eta_w = \operatorname{cn} \chi \operatorname{cn} \psi
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\eta_x = \operatorname{sn}\, \chi \operatorname{dn} \psi \  \cos \phi

:&lt;math&gt;
\eta_z = \operatorname{dn} \chi \operatorname{sn} \psi
&lt;/math&gt;
where sn, cn and dn are [[Jacobi's elliptic functions]].

==Generalizations to other potentials and relativity==
The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector can also be generalized to identify conserved quantities that apply to other situations.

In the presence of a uniform electric field '''E''', the generalized Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name="landau_lifshitz_1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Redmond | first = PJ | date = 1964 | title = Generalization of the Runge–Lenz Vector in the Presence of an Electric Field | journal = Physical Review | volume = 133 | pages = B1352–B1353 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.133.B1352|bibcode = 1964PhRv..133.1352R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} = \mathbf{A} + \frac{mq}{2} \left[ \left( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{E} \right) \times \mathbf{r} \right] ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''q'' is the [[electric charge|charge]] of the orbiting particle. Although &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is not conserved, it gives rise to a conserved quantity, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

Further generalizing the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector to other potentials and [[special relativity]], the most general form can be written as&lt;ref name="fradkin_1967" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} = 
\left( \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial u} \right) \left(\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L}\right)  +
\left[ \xi - u \left( \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial u} \right)\right] L^{2}  \mathbf{\hat{r}} ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''u'' = 1/''r''}} (cf. [[Bertrand's theorem]]) and {{nowrap|1=''ξ'' = cos ''θ''}}, with the angle ''θ'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta = L \int^u \frac{du}{\sqrt{m^2 c^2 (\gamma^2 - 1) - L^2 u^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''γ'' is the [[Lorentz factor]].  As before, we may obtain a conserved binormal [[vector (geometric)|vector]] '''B''' by taking the [[cross product]] with the conserved [[angular momentum]] vector

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{B} = \mathbf{L} \times \mathcal{A} .
&lt;/math&gt;

These two vectors may likewise be combined into a conserved [[dyadic tensor]] '''W''',

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{W} = \alpha \mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{A} + \beta \, \mathcal{B} \otimes \mathcal{B}
&lt;/math&gt;

In illustration, the LRL vector for a non-relativistic,  isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated.&lt;ref name="fradkin_1967" /&gt;  Since the force is [[central force|central]],
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}(r)= -k \mathbf{r} ,
&lt;/math&gt;
the [[angular momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] is conserved and the motion lies in a plane.

The conserved dyadic tensor can be written in a simple form
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{W} = \frac{1}{2m} \mathbf{p} \otimes \mathbf{p} + \frac{k}{2} \, \mathbf{r} \otimes \mathbf{r}  ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
although it should be noted that '''p''' and '''r''' are not necessarily perpendicular.

The corresponding Runge–Lenz vector is more complicated,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{mr^2 \omega_0 A - mr^2 E + L^2}} \left\{ \left( \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) + \left(mr\omega_0 A - mrE \right) \mathbf{\hat{r}} \right\}  ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}&lt;/math&gt; 
is the natural oscillation frequency and 
:&lt;math&gt;A=(E^2-\omega^2 L^2)^{1/2}/\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proofs that the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is conserved in Kepler problems==
The following are arguments showing that the LRL vector is conserved under [[central force]]s that obey an inverse-square law.

===Direct proof of conservation===
A central force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; acting on the particle is

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = f(r) \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} = f(r) \mathbf{\hat{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

for some function &lt;math&gt;f(r)&lt;/math&gt; of the radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the [[angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is conserved under central forces, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{L} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} \times \mathbf{L}  = f(r) \mathbf{\hat{r}} \times \left( \mathbf{r} \times m \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right) = f(r) \frac{m}{r} \left[ \mathbf{r} \left(\mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right) - r^2 \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right] ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and where the triple [[cross product]] has been simplified using [[Vector triple product|Lagrange's formula]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r} \times \left( \mathbf{r} \times \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right) = \mathbf{r} \left(\mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right) - r^2 \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

The identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right) = 2 \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (r^2) = 2r\frac{dr}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) = 
-m f(r) r^2 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} - \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^2} \frac{dr}{dt}\right] = -m f(r) r^2 \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r}\right) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

For the special case of an inverse-square central force &lt;math&gt;f(r)=\frac{-k}{r^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, this equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) = 
m k \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r}\right) = 
\frac{d}{dt} (mk\mathbf{\hat{r}}) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, '''A''' is conserved for inverse-square central forces&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 2.34&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{A} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) - \frac{d}{dt} \left( mk\mathbf{\hat{r}} \right) = \mathbf{0}
&lt;/math&gt;

A shorter proof is obtained by using the relation of angular momentum to angular velocity, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = m r^2 \boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, which holds for a particle traveling in a plane perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;. Specifying to inverse-square central forces, the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L}  = \left( \frac{-k}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}} \right) \times \left(m r^2 \boldsymbol{\omega}\right)
= m k \, \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{\hat{r}} = m k \,\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{\hat{r}} ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality holds because a unit vector can only change by rotation, and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital velocity of the rotating vector. Thus, '''A''' is seen to be a difference of two vectors with equal time derivatives.

As described [[#Generalizations to other potentials and relativity|below]], this LRL vector '''A''' is a special case of a general conserved vector &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that can be defined for all [[central force]]s.&lt;ref name="fradkin_1967" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yoshida_1987" /&gt;  However, since most central forces do not produce closed orbits (see [[Bertrand's theorem]]), the analogous vector &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; rarely has a simple definition and is generally a [[multivalued function]] of the angle ''θ'' between '''r''' and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Hamilton–Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates===
The constancy of the LRL vector can also be derived from the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] in [[parabolic coordinates]] {{nowrap|1=(''ξ'', ''η'')}}, which are defined by the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi = r + x
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\eta = r - x
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' represents the radius in the plane of the orbit

:&lt;math&gt;
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The inversion of these coordinates is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = \frac{1}{2} (\xi - \eta)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \sqrt{\xi\eta}
&lt;/math&gt;

Separation of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in these coordinates yields the two equivalent equations&lt;ref name="landau_lifshitz_1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dulock | first = VA |author2=McIntosh HV  | date = 1966 | title = On the Degeneracy of the Kepler Problem | journal = Pacific Journal of Mathematics | volume = 19 | pages = 39–55 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1966.19.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
2\xi p_\xi^2 - mk - mE\xi = -\Gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
2\eta p_\eta^2 - mk - mE\eta = \Gamma ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ is a [[constant of motion]].  Subtraction and re-expression in terms of the Cartesian momenta ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; shows that Γ is equivalent to the LRL vector

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma = p_y (x p_y - y p_x) - mk\frac{x}{r} = A_x ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Noether's theorem===
The connection between the rotational symmetry described above and the conservation of the LRL vector can be made quantitative by way of [[Noether's theorem]].  This theorem, which is used for finding constants of motion, states that any infinitesimal variation of the [[generalized coordinate]]s of a physical system

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta q_i = \varepsilon g_i(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)
&lt;/math&gt;

that causes the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] to vary to first order by a total time derivative

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta L = \varepsilon \frac{d}{dt} G(\mathbf{q}, t)
&lt;/math&gt;

corresponds to a conserved quantity Γ

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma = -G + \sum_i g_i \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the conserved LRL vector component ''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' corresponds to the variation in the coordinates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lévy-Leblond | first = JM | date = 1971 | title = Conservation Laws for Gauge-Invariant Lagrangians in Classical Mechanics | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 39 | pages = 502–506 | doi = 10.1119/1.1986202|bibcode = 1971AmJPh..39..502L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta x_i = \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \left[ 2 p_i x_s - x_i p_s - \delta_{is} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{p} \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' equals 1, 2 and 3, with ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' being the ''i''th components of the position and momentum vectors '''r''' and '''p''', respectively; as usual, ''δ&lt;sub&gt;is&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the [[Kronecker delta]].  The resulting first-order change in the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta L = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon mk\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{x_s}{r} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the general formula for the conserved quantity Γ yields the conserved component ''A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the LRL vector,
:&lt;math&gt;
A_s = \left[ p^2 x_s - p_s \ \left(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{p}\right) \right] - mk \left( \frac{x_s}{r} \right) = 
\left[ \mathbf{p} \times \left( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} \right) \right]_s - mk \left( \frac{x_s}{r} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Lie transformation===
[[File:Scaled ellipses.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 9: The Lie transformation from which the conservation of the LRL vector '''A''' is derived. As the scaling parameter λ varies, the energy and angular momentum changes, but the eccentricity ''e'' and the magnitude and direction of '''A''' do not.]]

The [[Noether theorem]] derivation of the conservation of the LRL vector '''A''' is elegant, but has one drawback: the coordinate variation ''δx''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; involves not only the ''position'' '''r''', but also the ''momentum'' '''p''' or, equivalently, the ''velocity'' '''v'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gonzalez-Gascon | first = F | date = 1977 | title = Notes on the symmetries of systems of differential equations | journal = Journal of Mathematical Physics | volume = 18 | pages = 1763–1767 | doi = 10.1063/1.523486|bibcode = 1977JMP....18.1763G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This drawback may be eliminated by instead deriving the conservation of '''A''' using an approach pioneered by [[Sophus Lie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lie | first = S | authorlink = Sophus Lie | date = 1891 | title = Vorlesungen über Differentialgleichungen | publisher = Teubner | location = Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ince | first = EL | date = 1926 | title = Ordinary Differential Equations | publisher = Dover (1956 reprint) | location = New York | pages = 93–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, one may define a Lie transformation&lt;ref name="prince_eliezer_1981" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Prince | first = GE |author2=Eliezer CJ  | date = 1981 | title = On the Lie symmetries of the classical Kepler problem | journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General | volume = 14 | pages = 587–596 | doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/14/3/009|bibcode = 1981JPhA...14..587P }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the coordinates '''r''' and the time ''t'' are scaled by different powers of a parameter λ (Figure 9),
:&lt;math&gt;
t \rightarrow \lambda^{3}t ,  \qquad \mathbf{r} \rightarrow \lambda^{2}\mathbf{r} , \qquad\mathbf{p} \rightarrow \frac{1}{\lambda}\mathbf{p}~.
&lt;/math&gt;

This transformation changes the total angular momentum ''L'' and energy ''E'',
:&lt;math&gt;
L \rightarrow \lambda L, \qquad  E \rightarrow \frac{1}{\lambda^{2}} E ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
but preserves their product ''EL''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Therefore, the eccentricity ''e'' and the magnitude ''A'' are preserved, as may be seen from the [[#Derivation of the Kepler orbits|equation for ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]

:&lt;math&gt;
A^2 = m^2 k^2 e^{2} = m^2 k^2 + 2 m E L^2
&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of '''A''' is preserved as well, since the semiaxes are not altered by a global scaling.  This transformation also preserves [[Kepler's third law]], namely, that the semiaxis ''a'' and the period ''T'' form a constant&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Alternative scalings, symbols and formulations==
Unlike the [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] '''p''' and '''L''', there is no universally accepted definition of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector; several different scaling factors and symbols are used in the scientific literature.  The most common definition is given [[#Mathematical definition|above]], but another common alternative is to divide by the constant ''mk'' to obtain a dimensionless conserved [[eccentricity vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e} = 
\frac{1}{mk} \left(\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} \right) - \mathbf{\hat{r}} = 
\frac{m}{k} \left(\mathbf{v} \times \left( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} \right) \right) - \mathbf{\hat{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''v''' is the velocity vector.  This scaled vector '''e''' has the same direction as '''A''' and its magnitude equals the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the orbit.  Other scaled versions are also possible, e.g., by dividing '''A''' by ''m'' alone

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{L} - k\mathbf{\hat{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

or by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{D} = \frac{\mathbf{A}}{p_{0}} = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2m|E|}}
\left\{ \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} - m k \mathbf{\hat{r}} \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same units as the [[angular momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] '''L'''.  In rare cases, the sign of the LRL vector may be reversed, i.e., scaled by −1.  Other common symbols for the LRL vector include '''a''', '''R''', '''F''', '''J''' and '''V'''.  However, the choice of scaling and symbol for the LRL vector do not affect its [[constant of motion|conservation]].

[[File:Kepler trivector.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 4: The angular momentum vector '''L''', the LRL vector '''A''' and Hamilton's vector, the binormal '''B''', are mutually perpendicular; '''A''' and '''B''' point along the major and minor axes, respectively, of an elliptical orbit of the Kepler problem.]]

An alternative conserved vector is the [[binormal]] vector '''B''' studied by [[William Rowan Hamilton]]&lt;ref name="hamilton_1847_quaternions" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{p} - \left(\frac{mk}{L^{2}r} \right) \  \left( \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{r} \right) ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

which is conserved and points along the ''minor'' semiaxis of the ellipse; the LRL vector {{nowrap|1='''A''' = '''B''' × '''L'''}} is the [[cross product]] of '''B''' and '''L''' (Figure 4).

The vector '''B''' is denoted as "binormal" since it is perpendicular to both '''A''' and '''L'''.  Similar to the LRL vector itself, the binormal vector can be defined with different scalings and symbols.

The two conserved vectors, '''A''' and '''B''' can be combined to form a conserved [[dyadic tensor]] '''W''',&lt;ref name="fradkin_1967" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{W} = \alpha \mathbf{A} \otimes \mathbf{A} + \beta \, \mathbf{B} \otimes \mathbf{B} ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' and ''β'' are arbitrary scaling constants and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[tensor product]] (which is not related to the [[cross product|vector cross product]], despite their similar symbol).  Written in explicit components, this equation reads
:&lt;math&gt;
W_{ij} = \alpha A_i A_j + \beta B_i B_j \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Being perpendicular to each another, the vectors '''A''' and '''B''' can be viewed as the [[principal axis (mechanics)|principal axes]] of the conserved [[tensor]] '''W''', i.e., its scaled [[eigenvector]]s.  '''W''' is perpendicular to '''L'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{W} =  
\alpha \left( \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{A} \right) \mathbf{A} + \beta \left( \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{B} \right) \mathbf{B} = 0 ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
since '''A''' and '''B''' are both perpendicular to '''L''' as well, {{nowrap|1='''L''' ⋅ '''A''' = '''L''' ⋅ '''B''' = 0}}.  For clarification, this equation reads, in explicit components,
:&lt;math&gt;
\left( \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{W} \right)_j =  \alpha \left( \sum_{i=1}^3 L_i A_i \right) A_j + \beta \left( \sum_{i=1}^3 L_i B_i \right) B_j = 0 ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Origin of the database==
The project grew out of founder [[Harry Coonce]]'s desire to know the name of his advisor's advisor.&lt;ref name="llmgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="che"&gt;{{citation

The project relocated at that time to [[North Dakota State University]]. Since 2003, the project has also operated under the auspices of the [[American Mathematical Society]] and in 2005 it received a grant from the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].&lt;ref name="llmgp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="focus"/&gt; Harry Coonce has been assisted by [https://www.wlu.edu/mathematics-department/faculty-and-staff/profile?ID=x7434 Mitchel T. Keller], Assistant Professor at [[Washington and Lee University]]. Dr Keller is currently the Managing Director of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/news.php MGP News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Mathematics Genealogy Mission statement states, "Throughout this project when we use the word "[[mathematics]]" or "[[mathematician]]" we mean that word in a very inclusive sense.&lt;ref name=MGP21/&gt; Thus, all relevant data from [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]] or [[operations research]] is welcome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/mission.php Mission Statement], The Mathematics Genealogy Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The genealogy information is obtained from sources such as ''Dissertation Abstracts International'' and ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'', but may be supplied by anyone via the project's website.&lt;ref name="focus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/faq.php#sources Where do you get your data?], Mathematics Genealogy FAQ, retrieved March 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The searchable database contains the name of the mathematician, university which awarded the degree, year when the degree was awarded, title of the dissertation, names of the advisor and second advisor, a flag of the country where the degree was awarded, a listing of doctoral students, and a count of academic descendants.&lt;ref name="llmgp"/&gt; Some historically significant figures who lacked a doctoral degree are listed, notably [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=17864 Joseph Lagrange], "We show a link to Euler to show a connection in our intellectual heritage. (hbc)", The Mathematics Genealogy Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy of information and other criticisms==
It has been noted that "The data collected by the mathematics genealogy project are self-reported, so there is no guarantee that the observed genealogy network is a complete description of the mentorship network. In fact, 16,147 mathematicians do not have a recorded mentor, and of these, 8,336 do not have any recorded proteges."&lt;ref name=Maimgren622626&gt;Maimgren, R. D., Ottino, J. M., &amp; Amaral, L. A.

In [[mathematics]], the method of considering a '''minimal counterexample''' combines the ideas of [[inductive proof]] and [[proof by contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Chartrand|Chartrand, Gary]], Albert D. Polimeni, and [[Ping Zhang (graph theorist)|Ping Zhang]]. Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Abstractly, in trying to prove a proposition ''P'', one assumes that it is false, and that therefore there is at least one [[counterexample]]. With respect to some idea of size, which may need to be chosen skillfully, one assumes that there is such a counterexample ''C'' that is ''minimal''. We expect that ''C'' is something quite hypothetical (since we are trying to prove ''P''), but it may be possible to argue that if ''C'' existed, it would have some definite properties. From those we then try to get a contradiction. 

If the form of the contradiction is that we can derive a further counterexample ''D'', and that ''D'' is smaller than ''C'' in the sense of the working hypothesis of minimality, then this technique is traditionally called [[infinite descent]]. There may however be more complicated ways to argue. For example, the minimal counterexample method has been much used in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The [[Feit–Thompson theorem]], that finite simple groups that are not [[cyclic group]]s have even order, was based on the hypothesis of some, and therefore some minimal, simple group ''G'' of odd order. Every proper subgroup of ''G'' can be assumed a [[solvable group]], meaning that much theory of such subgroups could be applied.

The assumption that if there is a counterexample, there is a minimal counterexample, is based on a [[well-ordering]] of some kind. The usual ordering on the [[natural number]]s is clearly possible, by the most usual formulation of [[mathematical induction]]; but the scope of the method is [[well-ordered induction]] of any kind.

[[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic#Elementary proof of uniqueness|Euclid's proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] is a simple proof using a minimal counterexample.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15337">The [[probability]] of the outcome of an experiment is never negative, although a [[quasiprobability distribution]] allows a '''negative probability''', or '''quasiprobability''' for some events. These distributions may apply to unobservable events or conditional probabilities.

==Physics and mathematics==
In 1942, [[Paul Dirac]] wrote a paper "The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1942.0023|pages=1–39|jstor=97777|title=Bakerian Lecture. The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=180|issue=980|year=1942|last1=Dirac|first1=P. A. M.|bibcode=1942RSPSA.180....1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he introduced the concept of [[negative energy|negative energies]] and negative [[probabilities]]:

: "Negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense.  They are well-defined concepts mathematically, like a negative of money."

The idea of negative probabilities later received increased attention in physics and particularly in [[quantum mechanics]].  [[Richard Feynman]] argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |date=1987 |editor1-last=Peat |editor1-first=F. David |editor2-last=Hiley |editor2-first=Basil |title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |pages=235–248 |chapter=Negative Probability |isbn=978-0415069601 |chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that no one objects to using negative numbers in calculations: although "minus three apples" is not a valid concept in real life, negative money is valid. Similarly he argued how negative probabilities as well as probabilities above [[1 (number)|unity]] possibly could be useful in probability [[calculations]].

Mark Burgin gives another example:
{{quote|"Let us consider the situation when an attentive person A with the high knowledge of English writes some text T. We may ask what the probability is for the word “texxt” or “wrod” to appear in his text T. Conventional probability theory gives 0 as the answer. However, we all know that there are usually misprints. So, due to such a misprint this word may appear but then it would be corrected. In terms of extended probability, a negative value (say, −0.1) of the probability for the word “texxt” to appear in his text T means that this word may appear due to a misprint but then it’ll be corrected and will not be present in the text T."|Mark Burgin|{{cite arXiv  |authorlink= |eprint=1008.1287 |title= Interpretations of Negative Probabilities|class= physics.data-an|year= 2010|version= |last1= Burgin|first1= Mark}}  }}

Negative probabilities have later been suggested to solve several problems and [[paradoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Y. (1997): ''Non-Archimedean Analysis: Quantum Paradoxes, Dynamical Systems and Biological Models''. Kluwer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-4800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-coins'' provide simple examples for negative probabilities. These strange coins were introduced in 2005 by [[Gábor J. Székely]].&lt;ref&gt;Székely, G.J. (2005) [http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf Half of a Coin: Negative Probabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108010759/http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf |date=2013-11-08 }}, Wilmott Magazine July, pp 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Half-coins have infinitely many sides numbered with 0,1,2,... and the positive even numbers are taken with negative probabilities. Two half-coins make a complete coin in the sense that if we flip two half-coins then the sum of the outcomes is 0 or 1 with probability 1/2 as if we simply flipped a fair coin.

In ''[[Convolution quotient]]s of nonnegative definite functions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages= 235–239|doi=10.1007/BF01352002|title=Convolution quotients of nonnegative functions|journal=Monatshefte für Mathematik|volume=95|issue=3|year=1983|last1=Ruzsa|first1=Imre Z.|last2=SzéKely|first2=Gábor J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Algebraic Probability Theory'' &lt;ref&gt;Ruzsa, I.Z. and Székely, G.J. (1988): ''Algebraic Probability Theory'', Wiley, New York {{ISBN|0-471-91803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] and [[Gábor J. Székely]] proved that if a [[random variable]] X has a signed or quasi distribution where some of the probabilities are negative then one can always find two random variables, Y and Z, with ordinary (not signed / not quasi) distributions such that X, Y are independent and X + Y = Z in distribution. Thus X can always be interpreted as the "difference" of two ordinary random variables, Z and Y. If Y is interpreted as a measurement error of X and the observed value is Z then the negative regions of the distribution of X are masked / shielded by the error Y.

Another example known as the Wigner distribution in [[phase space formulation|phase space]], introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1932 to study quantum corrections, often leads to negative probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.40.749|title=On the Quantum Correction for Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Physical Review|volume=40|issue=5|year=1932|last1=Wigner|first1=E.|bibcode=1932PhRv...40..749W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it has later been better known as the [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution]]. In 1945, [[M. S. Bartlett]] worked out the mathematical and logical consistency of such negative valuedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bartlett | first=  M. S.| year = 1945| title= Negative Probability | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 41| pages=  71–73 | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100022398|bibcode = 1945PCPS...41...71B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigner distribution function is routinely used in [[physics]] nowadays, and provides the cornerstone of [[Weyl quantization|phase-space quantization]]. Its negative features are an asset to the formalism, and often indicate quantum interference.  The negative regions of the distribution are shielded from direct observation by the quantum [[uncertainty principle]]: typically, the moments of such a non-positive-semidefinite quasiprobability distribution are highly constrained, and prevent ''direct measurability'' of the negative regions of the distribution. But these regions contribute negatively and crucially to the [[expected value]]s of observable quantities computed through such distributions, nevertheless.

=== An example: the double slit experiment ===

Consider a double slit experiment with photons. The two waves exiting each slit can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;f_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;f_2(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the distance to the detection screen, ''a'' is the separation between the two slits, ''x'' the distance to the center of the screen, ''λ'' the wavelength and ''dN/dt'' is the number of photons emitted per unit time at the source. The amplitude of measuring a photon at distance ''x'' from the center of the screen is the sum of these two amplitudes coming out of each hole, and therefore the probability that a photon is detected at position ''x'' will be given by the square of this sum:

&lt;math&gt;I(x) = \left\vert f_1(x)+f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 + \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 + \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

This should strike you as the well-known probability rule:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{either}\,\,\mathtt{slit})
 = \,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Negative joint probability 2.svg|thumb|In blue, the sum of the probabilities of going through holes 1 and 2; in red, minus the joint probability of going through "both holes". The interference pattern is obtained by adding the two curves.]]whatever the last term means. Indeed, if one closes either one of the holes forcing the photon to go through the other slit, the two corresponding intensities are

&lt;math&gt;I_1(x) = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;I_2(x) = \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

But now, if one does interpret each of these terms in this way, the joint probability takes negative values roughly every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\frac{d}{a}&lt;/math&gt; !&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} I_{12}(x) &amp; = \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right] \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\sin\left[(h/\lambda)(\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}-\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2})\right] \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, these negative probabilities are never observed as one can't isolate the cases in which the photon "goes through both slits", but can hint at the existence of anti-particles.

== Finance ==

Negative probabilities have more recently been applied to [[mathematical finance]]. In quantitative finance most probabilities are not real probabilities but pseudo probabilities, often what is known as [[risk neutral]] probabilities.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} These are not real probabilities, but theoretical "probabilities" under a series of assumptions that helps simplify calculations by allowing such pseudo probabilities to be negative in certain cases as first pointed out by Espen Gaarder Haug in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, E. G. (2004): [http://www.espenhaug.com/NegativeProbabilitiesHaug.pdf Why so Negative to Negative Probabilities], Wilmott Magazine, Re-printed in the book (2007); Derivatives Models on Models, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous mathematical definition of negative probabilities and their properties was recently derived by Mark Burgin and Gunter Meissner (2011). The authors also show how negative probabilities can be applied to financial [[option pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1773077  Burgin and Meissner: Negative Probabilities in Financial Modeling] Wilmott Magazine March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engineering ==

The concept of negative probabilities have also been proposed for reliable facility location models where facilities are subject to negatively correlated disruption risks when facility locations, customer allocation, and backup service plans are determined simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=L.V.|last2=Daskin|first2=M.S.|date=2005|title=Reliability Models for Facility Location: The Expected Failure Cost Case|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.1040.0107|journal=Transportation Science|volume=39|issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1287/trsc.1040.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=T.|last2=Ouyang|first2=Y.|last3=Shen|first3=Z-J.

This approach reduces a problem from one with correlated disruptions to one without. Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=|year=2015|title=Decomposition of general facility disruption correlations via augmentation of virtual supporting stations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515001290|journal=Transportation Research Part B|volume=80|pages=64–81|doi=10.1016/j.trb.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; later showed how negatively correlated disruptions can also be addressed by the same modeling framework, except that a supporting station now may be disrupted with a “failure propensity” which

“... inherits all mathematical characteristics and properties of a failure probability except that we allow it to be larger than 1...”

This finding paves ways for using compact mixed-integer mathematical programs to optimally design reliable location of service facilities under site-dependent and positive/negative/mixed disruption correlations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=An|first2=K.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=2017|title=Planning of Facility Location under Correlated Facility Disruptions|url=|journal=Under Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed “propensity” concept in Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; turns out to be what Feynman and others referred to as “quasi-probability.” Note that when a quasi-probability is larger than 1, then 1 minus this value gives a negative probability. The truly physically verifiable observation is the facility disruption states, and there is no direct information on the station states or their corresponding probabilities. Hence the failure probability of the stations, interpreted as “probabilities of imagined intermediary states,” could exceed unity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2689">The '''phi-hiding assumption''' or '''Φ-hiding assumption''' is an assumption about the difficulty of finding small [[factorization|factors]] of φ(''m'') where ''m'' is a number whose [[factorization]] is unknown, and φ is [[Euler's totient function]].  The security of many modern [[cryptosystem]]s comes from the perceived difficulty of certain problems.  Since [[P = NP problem|P vs. NP problem]] is still unresolved, cryptographers cannot be sure computationally intractable problems exist.  Cryptographers thus make assumptions as to which problems are ''hard''.  It is commonly believed that if ''m'' is the product of two large [[Prime number|primes]], then calculating φ(''m'') is currently computationally infeasible; this assumption is required for the security of the [[RSA Cryptosystem]].  The Φ-Hiding assumption is a stronger assumption, namely that if ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are small primes exactly one of which divides φ(''m''), there is no [[Polynomial time|polynomial-time]] algorithm which can distinguish which of the primes ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; divides φ(''m'') with probability significantly greater than one-half.

This assumption was first stated in the 1999 paper Computationally Private Information Retrieval with Polylogarithmic Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cachin |first1=Christian |last2=Micali |first2=Silvio|last3=Stadler|first3=Markus|year=1999|title=Computationally Private Information Retrieval with Polylogarithmic Communication|publisher=Springer|volume= 1592|issue= |pages=402–414|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0e5brpemrg9d5me7/|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi=10.1007/3-540-48910-X |editor1-last=Stern |editor1-first=Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1798">In [[mathematics]], a '''preordered class''' is a [[class (mathematics)|class]] equipped with a [[preorder]].

==Definition==
When dealing with a class ''C'', it is possible to define a class relation on ''C'' as a [[Subclass (set theory)|subclass]] of the power class ''C &lt;math&gt; \times &lt;/math&gt; C'' . Then, it is convenient to use the language of [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] on a set.

A '''preordered class''' is a class with a [[preorder]] on it. ''Partially ordered class'' and ''totally ordered class'' are defined in a similar way. These concepts  generalize respectively those of [[preordered set]], [[partially ordered set]] and [[totally ordered set]]. However, it is difficult to work with them as in the ''small'' case because many constructions common in a [[set theory]] are no longer possible in this framework.

Equivalently, a preordered class is a '''[[thin category]]''', that is, a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with at most one morphism from an object to another.

==Examples==
*In any [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'', when ''D'' is a class of morphisms of ''C'' containing identities and closed under composition, the relation 'there exists a ''D''-morphism from ''X'' to ''Y''' is a preorder on the class of objects of ''C''.
*The class '''Ord''' of all [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s is a totally ordered class with the classical ordering of ordinals.

'''Proclus Lycaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|k|l|ə|s|_|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|s}}; 8 February 412&amp;nbsp;– 17 April 485 AD), called '''the Successor''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Πρόκλος ὁ Διάδοχος}}, ''Próklos ho Diádokhos''), was a [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] [[Neoplatonist]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], one of the last major classical philosophers (see [[Damascius]]). He set forth one of the most elaborate and fully developed systems of [[Neoplatonism]]. He stands near the end of the classical development of [[philosophy]], and was very influential on Western [[medieval philosophy]] (Greek and Latin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Laurence| last=Rosan| year= 1981|title= Neoplatonism and Indian Thought (Editor: R Baine Harris)|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0873955461|pages=45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Proclus was born on February 8, 412 AD (his birth date is deduced from a [[horoscope]] cast by a disciple, [[Marinus of Neapolis|Marinus]]) in [[Constantinople]] to a family of high social status in [[Lycia]] (his father Patricius was a high legal official, very important in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]'s court system) and raised in [[Xanthos|Xanthus]]. He studied [[rhetoric]], [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]] in [[Alexandria]], with the intent of pursuing a judicial position like his father. Before completing his studies, he returned to Constantinople when his rector, his principal instructor (one [[Leonas]]), had business there.

Proclus became a successful practicing lawyer. However, the experience of the practice of law made Proclus realize that he truly preferred philosophy. He returned to Alexandria, and began determinedly studying the works of [[Aristotle]] under [[Olympiodorus the Elder]]. He also began studying mathematics during this period as well with a teacher named Heron (no relation to [[Hero of Alexandria]], who was also known as Heron). As a gifted student, he eventually became dissatisfied with the level of philosophical instruction available in Alexandria, and went to [[Athens]], the pre-eminent philosophical center of the day, in 431 to study at the Neoplatonic successor of the famous [[Academy]] founded 800 years earlier (in 387 BC) by [[Plato]]; there he was taught by [[Plutarch of Athens]] (not to be confused with [[Plutarch of Chaeronea]]), [[Syrianus]], and [[Asclepigenia]]; he succeeded Syrianus as head of the Academy, and would in turn be succeeded on his death by [[Marinus of Neapolis]].

He lived in Athens as a vegetarian bachelor, prosperous and generous to his friends, until the end of his life, except for a voluntary one-year exile, which was designed to lessen the pressure put on him by his political-philosophical activity, little appreciated by the [[Christian]] rulers; he spent the exile traveling and being initiated into various [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. He was also instructed in the "theurgic" Neoplatonism, as derived from the Orphic and [[Chaldean Oracles]]. His house has been discovered recently in Athens, under the pavement of [[Dionysiou Areopagitou Street]], south of Acropolis, opposite the theater of Dionysus. He had a great devotion to the goddess Athena, who he believed guided him at key moments in his life. Marinus reports that when Christians removed the statue of the goddess from the [[Parthenon]], a beautiful woman appeared to Proclus in a dream and announced that the "Athenian Lady" wished to stay at his home.&lt;ref&gt;Marinus of Samaria, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/marinus_01_life_of_proclus.htm ''"The Life of Proclus or Concerning Happiness"''], Translated by [[Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie|Kenneth S. GUTHRIE]] (1925), pp.15–55:30, retrieved 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Proclus died aged 73, and was buried near [[Mount Lycabettus]] in a tomb. It is reported that he was writing 700 lines each day.

==Works==
The majority of Proclus's works are commentaries on dialogues of [[Plato]] (''Alcibiades'', ''Cratylus'', ''Parmenides'', ''Republic'', ''Timaeus''). In these commentaries he presents his own philosophical system as a faithful interpretation of Plato, and in this he did not differ from other Neoplatonists, as he considered the Platonic texts to be divinely inspired (ὁ θεῖος Πλάτων ''ho theios Platon''—the divine Plato, inspired by the gods) and therefore that they spoke often of things under a veil, hiding the truth from the philosophically uninitiate. Proclus was however a close reader of Plato, and quite often makes very astute points about his Platonic sources. A number of his Platonic commentaries are lost.

Proclus, the scholiast to Euclid, knew  [[Eudemus of Rhodes]]' ''History of Geometry'' well, and gave a short sketch of the early history of geometry, which appeared to be founded on the older, lost book of Eudemus. The passage has been referred to as "the Eudemian summary," and determines some approximate dates, which otherwise might have remained unknown.&lt;ref&gt;James Gow, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9d8DAAAAMAAJ A Short History of Greek Mathematics]'' (1884)&lt;/ref&gt; The influential commentary on the first book of [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements of Geometry'' is one of the most valuable sources we have for the history of ancient mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|authorlink=T. L. Heath|title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements Vol. 1|year=1908|chapter=Proclus and His Sources|page=29|quote=It is well known that the commentary of Proclus on Eucl. Book I is one of the two main sources of information as to the history of Greek geometry which we possess, the other being the ''Collection'' of Pappus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Platonic account of the status of mathematical objects was influential. In this work, Proclus also listed the first mathematicians associated with Plato: a mature set of mathematicians ([[Leodamas of Thasos]], [[Archytas|Archytas of Taras]], and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]), a second set of younger mathematicians ([[Neoclides]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]), and a third yet younger set ([[Amyntas of Heraclea|Amyntas]], [[Menaechmus]] and his brother [[Dinostratus]], [[Theudius of Magnesia]], [[Hermotimus of Colophon]] and [[Philip of Opus]]). Some of these mathematicians were influential in arranging the Elements that Euclid later published.

In addition to his commentaries, Proclus wrote two major systematic works. The ''Elements of Theology'' (Στοιχείωσις θεολογική) consists of 211 propositions, each followed by a proof, beginning from the existence of the One (divine Unity) and ending with the descent of individual souls into the material world. The ''Platonic Theology'' (Περὶ τῆς κατὰ Πλάτωνα θεολογίας) is a systematisation of material from Platonic dialogues, showing from them the characteristics of the divine orders, the part of the universe which is closest to the One.

We also have three essays, extant only in Latin translation: ''Ten doubts concerning providence'' (''De decem dubitationibus circa providentiam''); ''On providence and fate'' (''De providentia et fato''); ''On the existence of evils'' (''De malorum subsistentia'').

He also wrote a number of minor works, which are listed in the bibliography below.

==System==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Proclus's system, like that of the other Neoplatonists, is a combination of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic elements. In its broad outlines, Proclus's system agrees with that of [[Plotinus]]. However, following [[Iamblichus]], Plutarch of Athens, and his master Syrianus, Proclus presents a much more elaborate universe than Plotinus, subdividing the elements of Plotinus's system into their logically distinct parts, and positing these parts as individual things. This multiplication of entities is balanced by the [[monism]] which is common to all Neoplatonists. What this means is that, on the one hand the universe is composed of hierarchically distinct things, but on the other all things are part of a single continuous emanation of power from the One. From this latter perspective, the many distinctions to be found in the universe are a result of the divided perspective of the human soul, which needs to make distinctions in its own thought in order to understand unified realities. The idealist tendency is taken further in [[John Scotus Eriugena]].

There is a double motivation found in Neoplatonic systems. The first is a need to account for the origin and character of all things in the universe. The second is a need to account for how we can know this origin and character of things. These two aims are related: they begin from the assumption that we can know reality, and then ask the question of what reality must be like, in its origin and unfolding, so that we can know it. An important element in the Neoplatonic answer to these questions is its reaction to [[Scepticism]]. In response to the sceptical position that we only know the appearances presented by our senses, and not the world as it is, Plotinus placed the object of knowledge inside the soul itself, and accounted for this interior truth through the soul's kinship with its own productive principles.

===The One===
The first principle in Neoplatonism is [[henology|the One]] (Greek: ''to Hen''). Being proceeds from the One. The One cannot itself be a being. If it were a being, it would have a particular nature, and so could not be universally productive. Because it is ''beyond being'' (''epekeina tes ousias'', a phrase from Plato's ''Republic'' 509b), it is also beyond thought, because thinking requires the determinations which belong to being: the division between subject and object, and the distinction of one thing from another. For this reason, even the name ''The One'' is not a positive name, but rather the most non-multiple name possible, a name derived from our own inadequate conception of the simplicity of the first principle. The One causes all things by conferring unity, in the form of individuality, on them, and in Neoplatonism existence, unity, and form tend to become equivalent. The One causes things to exist by donating unity, and the particular manner in which a thing is one is its form (a dog and a house are individual in different manners, for example). Because the One makes things exist by giving them the individuality which makes them what they are as distinct and separate beings, the Neoplatonists thought of it also as the source of the good of everything. So the other name for the One is the Good. Despite appearances, the first principle is not double; all things have a double relation to it, as coming from them (One) and then being oriented back towards them to receive their perfection or completion (Good).

The particular characteristic of Proclus's system is his elaboration of a level of individual ones, called ''henads,'' between the One which is before being and intelligible divinity. The henads exist "superabundantly", also beyond being, but they stand at the head of chains of causation (''seirai'') and in some manner give to these chains their particular character. He identifies them with the Greek gods, so one henad might be Apollo and be the cause of all things apollonian, while another might be Helios and be the cause of all ''sunny'' things. Each henad participates in every other henad, according to its character. What appears to be multiplicity is not multiplicity at all, because any henad may rightly be considered the center of the polycentric system.

===Intellect===
The principle which is produced below the level of the One and the Henads is the divine Intellect (''[[Nous]]''). The One cannot have a determinate nature if it is to be the source of all determinate natures, so what it produces is the totality of all determinate natures, or Being. By determination is meant existence within boundaries, a being ''this'' and not ''that''. The most important determinate natures are the ''Greatest Kinds'' from Plato's ''Sophist'' (Being, Same, Other, Rest, Motion) and Aristotle's ten categories (Quantity, Quality, etc.). In other words, the One produces what Plato called the Forms, and the Forms are understood to be the first determinations into which all things fall. The One produces the Forms through the activity of thinking. The One itself does not think, but instead produces a divine mind, Intellect, whose thoughts are themselves the Forms. Intellect is both Thinking and Being. It is a mind which has its own contents as its object. All things relate to the first principle as both One and Good. As Being, Intellect is the product of the One. But it also seeks to return to its cause, and so in Thinking it attempts to grasp the One as its Good. But because the simplicity of the One/Good does not allow Intellect to grasp it, what Intellect does is generate a succession of perspectives around its simple source. Each of these perspectives is itself a Form, and is how Intellect generates for itself its own content.

Plotinus speaks about the generation of Intellect from the One, and Intellect's attempt to return to the One in a thinking which is also a desiring. Proclus systematises this production through a threefold movement of remaining, procession, and return (''mone, proodos, epistrophe''). Intellect remains in the One, which means that it has the One as its origin. It proceeds from the One, which means that it comes to be as a separate entity. But it returns to the One, which means that it does not cut itself off from its source, but receives the good which is its identity from the One. This threefold motion is used by Proclus to structure all levels of his system below the One and above material reality, so that all things except those mentioned remain, proceed, and return.

Proclus also gives a much more elaborate account of Intellect than does Plotinus. In Plotinus we find the distinction between Being and Thinking in Intellect. Proclus, in keeping with his triadic structure of remaining, procession, and return, distinguishes three moments in Intellect: Intelligible, Intelligible-Intellectual, and Intellectual. They correspond to the object of thought, the power of the object to be grasped by the subject, and the thinking subject. These three divisions are elaborated further, so that the intelligible moment consists of three triads (Being, Eternity, and the Living Being or Paradigm from Plato's ''Timaeus''). The intelligible-intellectual moment also consists of three triads, and the intellectual moment is a hebdomad (seven elements), among which is numbered the Demiurge from Plato's ''Timaeus'' and also the monad of Time (which is before temporal things). In this elaboration of Intellect as a whole, Proclus is attempting to give a hierarchical ordering to the various [[metaphysical]] elements and principles that other philosophers have discussed, by containing them within a single triadic logic of unfolding.

Proclus's universe unfolds according to the smallest steps possible, from unity to multiplicity. With Intellect emerges the multiplicity which allows one being to be different from another being. But as a divine mind, Intellect has a complete grasp of all its moments in one act of thought. For this reason, Intellect is outside of Time.

Intellect as the second principle also gives rise to individual intellects, which hold various places within Proclus's cosmos.

In terms of his sources, Intellect is like taking the Platonic Forms and placing them in the self-thinking thought which is Aristotle's Unmoved Mover.

===Soul===
[[Soul]] (''Psyche'') is produced by Intellect, and so is the third principle in the Neoplatonic system. It is a mind, like Intellect, but it does not grasp all of its own content as one. Therefore with Soul, Time comes to be, as a measure of Soul's movement from one object of thought to another. Intellect tries to grasp the One, and ends up producing its own ideas as its content. Soul attempts to grasp Intellect in its return, and ends up producing its own secondary unfoldings of the Forms in Intellect. Soul, in turn, produces Body, the material world.

In his commentary on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' Proclus explains the role the Soul as a principle has in mediating the Forms in Intellect to the body of the material world as a whole. The Soul is constructed through certain proportions, described mathematically in the ''Timaeus'', which allow it to make Body as a divided image of its own arithmetical and geometrical ideas.

Individual souls have the same overall structure as the principle of Soul, but they are weaker. They have a tendency to be fascinated with the material world, and be overpowered by it. It is at this point that individual souls are united with a material body (i.e. when they are born). Once in the body, our passions have a tendency to overwhelm our reason. According to Proclus, philosophy is the activity which can liberate the soul from a subjection to bodily passions, remind it of its origin in Soul, Intellect, and the One, and prepare it not only to ascend to the higher levels while still in this life, but to avoid falling immediately back into a new body after death.

Because the soul's attention, while inhabiting a body, is turned so far away from its origin in the intelligible world, Proclus thinks that we need to make use of bodily reminders of our spiritual origin. In this he agrees with the doctrines of [[theurgy]] put forward by [[Iamblichus]]. Theurgy is possible because the powers of the gods (the ''henads'') extend through their series of causation even down to the material world. And by certain power-laden words, acts, and objects, the soul can be drawn back up the series, so to speak. Proclus himself was a devotee of many of the religions in Athens, considering that the power of the gods could be present in these various approaches.

For Proclus, philosophy is important because it is one of the primary ways to rescue the soul from a fascination with the body and restore it to its station. However, beyond its own station, the soul has Intellect as its goal, and ultimately has unification with the One as its goal. So higher than philosophy is the non-discursive reason of Intellect, and the pre-intellectual unity of the One. Philosophy is therefore a means of its own overcoming, in that it points the soul beyond itself.

==Influence==
Proclus can be considered as the spokesman of mature Neoplatonism. His works had a great influence on the history of western philosophy. The extent of this influence, however, is obscured by the channels through which it was exercised. An important source of Procline ideas was through the [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Dionysius, the Areopagite, by [[Pope Benedict XVI]], General Audience Address for May 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This late-5th- or early-6th-century Christian Greek author wrote under the pseudonym [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], the figure converted by St. Paul in Athens. Because of this fiction, his writings were taken to have almost apostolic authority. He is an original Christian writer, and in his works can be found a great number of Proclus's metaphysical principles.

Another important source for the influence of Proclus on the Middle Ages is [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', which has a number of Proclus principles and motifs. The central poem of Book III is a summary of Proclus's ''Commentary on the Timaeus'', and Book V contains the important principle of Proclus that things are known not according to their own nature, but according to the character of the knowing subject.

A summary of Proclus's ''Elements of Theology'' circulated under the name ''[[Liber de Causis]]'' (the ''Book of Causes''). This book is of uncertain origin, but circulated in the Arabic world as a work of Aristotle, and was translated into Latin as such. It had great authority because of its supposed Aristotelian origin, and it was only when Proclus's ''Elements'' were translated into Latin that Thomas Aquinas realised its true origin.

Proclus's works also exercised an influence during the Renaissance through figures such as Georgius Gemistus [[Pletho]] and [[Marsilio Ficino]]. Before the contemporary period, the most significant scholar of Proclus in the English-speaking world was [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]], who produced English translations of most of his works, with commentaries.

His work inspired the New England Transcendentalists, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who declared in 1843 that, in reading Proclus, "I am filled with hilarity &amp; spring, my heart dances, my sight is quickened, I behold shining relations between all beings, and am impelled to write and almost to sing."

Modern scholarship on Proclus essentially begins with E.R. Dodd's edition of the ''Elements of Theology'' in 1933. Since then he has attracted considerable attention, especially in the French-speaking world. Procline scholarship, however, still (2006) falls far short of the attention paid to [[Plotinus]].

The following epigram is engraved on the tomb which houses Proclus and his master Syrianus:

:"I am Proclus,
:Lycian whom Syrianus brought up to teach his doctrine after him.
:This tomb reunites both our bodies.
:May an identical sojourn be reserved to our both souls!"

The crater [[Proclus (crater)|Proclus]] on the Moon is named after him.

A number of other minor works or fragments of works survive. A number of major commentaries have been lost.

The ''Liber de Causis'' (Book of Causes) is not a work by Proclus, but a summary of his work the ''Elements of Theology'', likely written by an Arabic interpreter. It was mistakenly thought in the Middle Ages to be a work of Aristotle, but was recognised by Aquinas not to be so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11200">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[functional analysis]], a  '''projection-valued measure (PVM)''' is a function defined on certain subsets of a fixed set and whose values are [[self-adjoint]] [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s on a fixed [[Hilbert space]]. Projection-valued measures are formally similar to real-valued [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], except that their values are self-adjoint projections rather than real numbers. As in the case of ordinary measures, it is possible to integrate complex-valued functions with respect to a PVM; the result of such an integration is a linear operator on the given Hilbert space.

Projection-valued measures are used to express results in [[spectral theory]], such as the important spectral theorem for [[self-adjoint operator]]s. The [[Borel functional calculus]] for self-adjoint operators is constructed using integrals with respect to PVMs.  In [[quantum mechanics]], PVMs are the mathematical description of [[Quantum measurement|projective measurements]].{{clarify|reason=Is this a novel term? It's not defined in the linked article.|date=May 2015}}  They are generalized by [[POVM|positive operator valued measures]] (POVMs) in the same sense that a [[mixed state (physics)|mixed state]] or [[density matrix]] generalizes the notion of a [[pure state]].

== Formal definition ==

A projection-valued measure on a [[measurable space]] 
&lt;math&gt;(X, M)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[σ-algebra]] of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[function (mathematics)|mapping]] &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to the set of [[self-adjoint]] [[projection operator|projections]] on a [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the orthogonal projections) such that

: &lt;math&gt;
\pi(X) = \operatorname{id}_H \quad 
&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_H&lt;/math&gt; is the identity operator of ''H'') and for every ξ, η ∈ ''H'', the set-function

:&lt;math&gt; 
M \to \mathbb C : E \mapsto \langle \pi(E)\xi \mid \eta \rangle 
&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[complex measure]] on ''M'' (that is, a complex-valued [[sigma additivity|countably additive]] function).

We denote this measure by 
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{S}_\pi(\xi, \eta)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{S}_\pi(\xi, \xi)&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued measure, and a probability measure when &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; has length one.

If π is a projection-valued measure and

: &lt;math&gt;
E \cap F = \emptyset,
&lt;/math&gt;

then the images π(''E''), π(''F'') are [[orthogonal]] to each other.  From this follows that in general,

: &lt;math&gt;
 \pi(E) \pi(F) = \pi(E \cap F) =  \pi(F) \pi(E), 
&lt;/math&gt;

and they commute.

'''Example'''.  Suppose &lt;math&gt;(X, M, \mu)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure space.  Let, for every measurable subset E in M, 
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(E) : L^2(\mu) \to L^2 (\mu): 
\psi \mapsto \chi_E \psi
&lt;/math&gt;
be the operator of multiplication by the [[indicator function]] 1&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; on [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'')]]. Then π is a projection-valued measure.

== Extensions of projection-valued measures, integrals and the spectral theorem==

If π is a projection-valued measure on a measurable space (''X'', ''M''), then the map

: &lt;math&gt;
 \chi_E \mapsto \pi(E)
&lt;/math&gt;

extends to a linear map on the vector space of [[step function]]s on ''X''.  In fact, it is easy to check that this map is a [[ring homomorphism]].  This map extends in a canonical way to all bounded complex-valued [[measurable function]]s on ''X'', and we have the following.

'''Theorem'''. ''For any bounded'' ''M''-''measurable function f on X, there exists'' ''a unique bounded linear operator'' 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm T_\pi (f) : H \to H
&lt;/math&gt;
such that''
: &lt;math&gt;
 \langle \operatorname{T}_\pi(f) \xi \mid  \eta \rangle =
 \int_X f \ d \operatorname{S}_\pi (\xi,\eta) 
&lt;/math&gt;

''for all'' &lt;math&gt; \xi,\eta \in H &lt;/math&gt;.  ''Where,'' &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{S}_\pi (\xi,\eta)&lt;/math&gt; ''denotes the complex measure'' 

:&lt;math&gt;E \mapsto \langle \pi(E)\xi \mid \eta \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

''from the definition of'' &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The map

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{BM}(X,M) \to \mathcal L(H): 
f \mapsto \operatorname{T}_\pi(f)&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[Ring homomorphism|homomorphism of rings]]. 

An integral notation is often used for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{T}_\pi(f)&lt;/math&gt;, as in

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{T}_\pi(f)=\int_X f(x) d \pi(x) = \int_X f d \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is also correct for unbounded measurable functions ''f'', but then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{T}_\pi(f)&lt;/math&gt; will be an unbounded linear operator on the Hilbert space ''H''.

The [[spectral theorem]] says that every [[self-adjoint operator]] &lt;math&gt;A:H\to H&lt;/math&gt; has an associated projection-valued measure &lt;math&gt;\pi_A&lt;/math&gt; defined on the real axis, such that
:&lt;math&gt;A =\int_\mathbb{R} x d \pi_A(x).&lt;/math&gt;
This allows to define the [[Borel functional calculus]] for such operators: if &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable function, we set
:&lt;math&gt;g(A) :=\int_\mathbb{R} g(x) d \pi_A(x).&lt;/math&gt;

== Structure of projection-valued measures==

First we provide a general example of projection-valued measure based on [[direct integral]]s.   Suppose (''X'', ''M'', μ) is a measure space and let {''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''x'' ∈ ''X'' &lt;/sub&gt; be a μ-measurable family of separable Hilbert spaces. For every  ''E'' ∈ ''M'', let π(''E'') be the operator of multiplication by 1&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; on the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X^\oplus H_x \ d \mu(x). &lt;/math&gt;

Then π is a projection-valued measure on (''X'', ''M'').

Suppose π, ρ  are projection-valued measures on  (''X'', ''M'') with values in the projections of ''H'', ''K''.   π,  ρ  are '''unitarily equivalent''' [[if and only if]] there is a unitary operator ''U'':''H'' → ''K'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \pi(E) = U^* \rho(E) U \quad &lt;/math&gt;

for every ''E'' ∈ ''M''.

'''Theorem'''. If (''X'', ''M'') is a [[Borel algebra#Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems|standard Borel space]], then for every projection-valued measure π on (''X'', ''M'') taking values in the projections of a ''separable'' Hilbert space, there is a Borel measure μ and a μ-measurable family of Hilbert spaces {''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''x'' ∈ ''X'' &lt;/sub&gt;, such that π is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by 1&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; on the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X^\oplus H_x \ d \mu(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The measure class{{clarify|reason=What is a measure class? A measure up to measure-preserving equivalence? Should the measure be completed?|date=May 2015}} of μ and the measure equivalence class of the multiplicity function ''x'' → dim ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; completely characterize the projection-valued measure up to unitary equivalence.

A projection-valued measure  π is ''homogeneous of multiplicity'' ''n'' if and only if the multiplicity function has constant value ''n''.  Clearly,

'''Theorem'''.  Any projection-valued measure π taking values in the projections of a separable Hilbert space is an orthogonal direct sum of homogeneous projection-valued measures:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \bigoplus_{1 \leq n \leq \omega} (\pi | H_n) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; H_n = \int_{X_n}^\oplus H_x \ d (\mu | X_n) (x) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; X_n = \{x \in X: \operatorname{dim} H_x = n\}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Application in quantum mechanics==

In quantum mechanics, given a projection valued measure of a measurable space X to the space of continuous endomorphisms upon a Hilbert space H, 

- the unit sphere of the Hilbert space ''H'' is interpreted as the set of possible states Φ of a quantum system,

- the measurable space ''X'' is the value space for some quantum property of the system (an "observable"), 

- the projection-valued measure π  expresses the probability that the observable takes on various values.

A common choice for ''X'' is the real line, but it may also be 

'''- R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (for position or momentum in three dimensions ), 

- a discrete set (for angular momentum, energy of a bound state, etc.), 

- the 2-point set "true" and "false" for the truth-value of an arbitrary proposition about Φ.

Let ''E'' be a measurable subset of the measurable space ''X'' and Φ a normalized vector-state in ''H'', so that its Hilbert norm is unitary, ||Φ|| = 1. The probability that the observable takes its value in the subset ''E,'' given the system in state Φ, is

:&lt;math&gt;
 P_\pi(\phi)(E) = 
\langle \phi|\pi(E)(\phi)\rangle = \langle \phi|\pi(E)|\phi\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where the latter notation is preferred in physics.

We can parse this in two ways. 

First, for each fixed ''E'', the projection π(''E'') is a self-adjoint operator on ''H'' whose 1-eigenspace is the states Φ for which the value of the observable always lies in ''E'', and whose 0-eigenspace is the states Φ for which the value of the observable never lies in ''E''.  

Second, for each fixed normalized vector state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the association 

:&lt;math&gt;
P_\pi(\psi) :
E \mapsto  &lt;\psi|\pi(E)\psi&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
is a probability measure on ''X'' making the values of the observable into a random variable.

A measurement that can be performed by a projection-valued measure π is called a '''projective measurement'''. 

If ''X'' is the real number line, there exists, associated to π, a Hermitian operator ''A'' defined on ''H'' by

:&lt;math&gt;A(\phi) = \int_{\mathbf{R}} \lambda \,d\pi(\lambda)(\phi),&lt;/math&gt;

which takes the more readable form

:&lt;math&gt;A(\phi) = \sum_i \lambda_i \pi({\lambda_i})(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

if the support of π is a discrete subset of '''R'''. 

The above operator A is called the observable associated with the spectral measure.

Any operator so obtained is called an [[observable]] , in quantum mechanics.

==Generalizations==
The idea of a projection-valued measure is generalized by the [[positive operator-valued measure]] (POVM), where the need for the orthogonality implied by projection operators is replaced by the idea of a set of operators that are a non-orthogonal partition of unity{{clarify|reason=Partition of unity in the operator sense is not defined in the article "partition of unity".|date=May 2015}}. This generalization is motivated by applications to [[quantum information theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1385">The '''Prony equation''' (named after [[Gaspard de Prony]]) is a historically important equation in [[hydraulics]], used to calculate the [[head loss]] due to [[friction]] within a given run of pipe.  It is an [[empirical equation]] developed by [[France|Frenchman]] [[Gaspard de Prony]] in the 19th century:

:&lt;math&gt;h_f = \frac{L}{D} (aV + bV^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the head loss due to friction, calculated from: the ratio of the length to [[diameter]] of the pipe ''L/D'', the velocity of the flow ''V'', and two empirical factors ''a'' and ''b'' to account for friction.

This equation has been supplanted in modern hydraulics by the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]], which used it as a starting point.

[[File:Trigonometric Triangle.svg|right|thumb|Trigonometric functions specify the relationships between side lengths and interior angles of a right triangle. For example, the sine of angle θ is defined as being the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.|396x396px]]

The six trigonometric functions are defined for every [[real number]], except, for some of them, for angles that differ from 0 by a multiple of the right angle (90°). Referring to the diagram at the right, the six trigonometric functions of θ are, for angles smaller than the right angle:

:&lt;math&gt; \sin \theta = \frac {\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {a}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta = \frac {\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {b}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \theta = \frac {\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} = \frac {a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cot \theta = \frac {\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{opposite}} = \frac {b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sec \theta = \frac {\mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} = \frac {h}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \csc \theta = \frac {\mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{opposite}} = \frac {h}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

===Ratio identities===

In the case of angles smaller than a right angle, the following identities are direct consequences of above definitions through the division identity
: &lt;math&gt; \frac {a}{b}= \frac {\left(\frac {a}{h}\right)} {\left(\frac {b}{h}\right) }.&lt;/math&gt;
They remain valid for angles greater than 90° and for negative angles.

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \theta
= \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{adjacent}}
= \frac { \left( \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}} \right) } { \left( \frac{\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}\right) }
= \frac {\sin \theta} {\cos \theta} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cot \theta =\frac{\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{opposite}}
= \frac { \left( \frac{\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} \right) } { \left( \frac {\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} \right) }
= \frac {1}{\tan \theta} = \frac {\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sec \theta = \frac {1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \csc \theta = \frac {1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{opposite}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \theta = \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{adjacent}}
= \frac{\left(\frac{\mathrm{opposite} \times \mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{opposite} \times \mathrm{adjacent}} \right) } { \left( \frac {\mathrm{adjacent} \times \mathrm{hypotenuse}} {\mathrm{opposite} \times \mathrm{adjacent} } \right) }
= \frac{\left( \frac{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} \right)} { \left( \frac{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}{\mathrm{opposite}} \right)}
= \frac {\sec \theta}{\csc \theta} &lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt; \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
= \frac{\left( \frac{1}{\csc \theta} \right) }{\left( \frac{1}{\sec \theta} \right) }
= \frac{\left( \frac{\csc \theta \sec \theta}{\csc \theta} \right) }{\left( \frac{\csc \theta \sec \theta}{\sec \theta} \right) }
= \frac{\sec \theta}{\csc \theta} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cot \theta = \frac {\csc \theta}{\sec \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

===Complementary angle identities===
Two angles whose sum is π/2 radians (90 degrees) are ''complementary''.  In the diagram, the angles at vertices A and B are complementary, so we can exchange a and b, and change θ to π/2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;θ, obtaining:

:&lt;math&gt; \sin\left(  \pi/2-\theta\right) = \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cos\left(  \pi/2-\theta\right) = \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \tan\left(  \pi/2-\theta\right) = \cot \theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cot\left(  \pi/2-\theta\right) = \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sec\left(  \pi/2-\theta\right) = \csc \theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \csc\left(  \pi/2-\theta\right) = \sec \theta&lt;/math&gt;

===Pythagorean identities===
Identity 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The following two results follow from this and the ratio identities. To obtain the first, divide both sides of &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;; for the second, divide by &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tan^2(x) + 1\ = \sec^2(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 1\ + \cot^2(x) = \csc^2(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly

:&lt;math&gt; 1\ + \cot^2(x) = \csc^2(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\csc^2(x) - \cot^2(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Identity 2:

The following accounts for all three reciprocal functions.

:&lt;math&gt; \csc^2(x) + \sec^2(x) - \cot^2(x) = 2\ + \tan^2(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Proof 2:

Refer to the triangle diagram above. Note that &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt; by [[Pythagorean theorem]].
:&lt;math&gt;\csc^2(x) + \sec^2(x) = \frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{h^2}{b^2} = \frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2} + \frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2} = 2\ + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting with appropriate functions -

:&lt;math&gt; 2\ + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{a^2}{b^2} = 2\ + \tan^2(x)+ \cot^2(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \csc^2(x) + \sec^2(x) - \cot^2(x) = 2\ + \tan^2(x) &lt;/math&gt;

===Angle sum identities===

====Sine====
[[File:TrigSumFormula.svg|right|thumb|350px|Illustration of the sum formula.]]

Draw a horizontal line (the ''x''-axis); mark an origin O. Draw a line from O at an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; above the horizontal line and a second line at an angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; above that; the angle between the second line and the ''x''-axis is &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Place P on the line defined by &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta&lt;/math&gt; at a unit distance from the origin.

Let PQ be a line perpendicular to line defined by angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, drawn from point Q on this line to point P. &lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; OQP is a right angle.

Let QA be a perpendicular from point A on the ''x''-axis to Q and PB be a perpendicular from point B on the ''x''-axis to P. &lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; OAQ and OBP are right angles.

Draw R on PB so that QR is parallel to the ''x''-axis.

Now angle &lt;math&gt;RPQ = \alpha&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;OQA = \frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;,
making &lt;math&gt;RQO = \alpha, RQP = \frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and finally &lt;math&gt;RPQ = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;RPQ = \tfrac{\pi}{2} - RQP = \tfrac{\pi}{2} - (\tfrac{\pi}{2} - RQO) = RQO = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;OP = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;PQ = \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;OQ = \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AQ}{OQ} = \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;AQ = \sin \alpha \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{PR}{PQ} = \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;PR = \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha + \beta) = PB = RB+PR = AQ+PR = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;



By substituting &lt;math&gt;-\beta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and using [[List of trigonometric identities#Symmetry|Symmetry]], we also get:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos (-\beta) + \cos \alpha \sin (-\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

Another rigorous proof, and much easier, can be given by using [[Euler's formula]], known from complex analysis. 
Euler's formula is:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\varphi}=\cos \varphi +i \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that for angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; we have:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i (\alpha + \beta)} = \cos (\alpha +\beta) + i \sin(\alpha +\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

Also using  the following properties of exponential functions:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(\alpha + \beta)} = e^{i \alpha} e^{i\beta}= (\cos \alpha +i \sin \alpha) (\cos \beta + i \sin \beta)&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the product:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(\alpha + \beta)} = (\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta)+i(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

Equating real and imaginary parts:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha +\beta)=\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha +\beta)=\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

====Cosine====
Using the figure above,

:&lt;math&gt;OP = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;PQ = \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;OQ = \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{OA}{OQ} = \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;OA = \cos \alpha \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{RQ}{PQ} = \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;RQ = \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha + \beta) = OB = OA-BA = OA-RQ = \cos \alpha \cos \beta\ - \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting &lt;math&gt;-\beta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and using [[List of trigonometric identities#Symmetry|Symmetry]], we also get:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos (-\beta) - \sin \alpha \sin (-\beta),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

Also, using the complementary angle formulae,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cos (\alpha + \beta) &amp; = \sin\left(  \pi/2-(\alpha + \beta)\right) \\
&amp; = \sin\left(  (\pi/2-\alpha) - \beta\right) \\
&amp; = \sin\left(  \pi/2-\alpha\right) \cos \beta - \cos\left(  \pi/2-\alpha\right) \sin \beta \\
&amp; = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Tangent and cotangent====
From the sine and cosine formulae, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\tan (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\sin (\alpha + \beta)}{\cos (\alpha + \beta)}
= \frac{\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta}{\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt; \cos \alpha \cos \beta &lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\tan (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;, using &lt;math&gt;\tan (- \beta) = -\tan \beta &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\tan (\alpha - \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan (-\beta)}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan (-\beta)} = \frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly from the sine and cosine formulae, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\cot (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\cos (\alpha + \beta)}{\sin (\alpha + \beta)}
= \frac{\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta}{\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Then by dividing both numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt; \sin \alpha \sin \beta &lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\cot (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\cot \alpha \cot \beta - 1}{\cot \alpha + \cot \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, using &lt;math&gt; \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\cot (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta}{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}
= \frac{\frac{1}{\tan \alpha \tan \beta} - 1}{\frac{1}{\tan \alpha} + \frac{1}{\tan \beta}}
= \frac{\cot \alpha \cot \beta - 1}{\cot \alpha + \cot \beta} &lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;\cot (- \beta) = -\cot \beta &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\cot (\alpha - \beta) = \frac{\cot \alpha \cot (-\beta) - 1}{ \cot \alpha + \cot (-\beta) } = \frac{\cot \alpha \cot \beta + 1}{\cot \beta - \cot \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

===Double-angle identities===
From the angle sum identities, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sin (2 \theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\cos (2 \theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

The Pythagorean identities give the two alternative forms for the latter of these:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos (2 \theta) = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos (2 \theta) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

The angle sum identities also give

:&lt;math&gt;\tan (2 \theta) = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} = \frac{2}{\cot \theta - \tan \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cot (2 \theta) = \frac{\cot^2 \theta - 1}{2 \cot \theta} = \frac{\cot \theta - \tan \theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be proved using [[Euler's formula]]

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i \varphi}=\cos \varphi +i \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

Squaring both sides yields

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i 2\varphi}=(\cos \varphi +i \sin \varphi)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

But replacing the angle with its doubled version, which achieves the same result in the left side of the equation, yields

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i 2\varphi}=\cos 2\varphi +i \sin 2\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;(\cos \varphi +i \sin \varphi)^{2}=\cos 2\varphi +i \sin 2\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Expanding the square and simplifying on the left hand side of the equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;i(2 \sin \varphi \cos \varphi) + \cos^2 \varphi - \sin^2 \varphi\ = \cos 2\varphi +i \sin 2\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the imaginary and real parts have to be the same, we are left with the original identities

:&lt;math&gt;\cos^2 \varphi - \sin^2 \varphi\ = \cos 2\varphi&lt;/math&gt;,

and also

:&lt;math&gt;2 \sin \varphi \cos \varphi = \sin 2\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Half-angle identities===
The two identities giving the alternative forms for cos 2θ lead to the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \pm\, \sqrt\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \pm\, \sqrt\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sign of the square root needs to be chosen properly—note that if 2{{pi}} is added to θ, the quantities inside the square roots are unchanged, but the left-hand-sides of the equations change sign.  Therefore, the correct sign to use depends on the value of θ.

For the tan function, the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \pm\, \sqrt\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then multiplying the numerator and denominator inside the square root by (1 + cos θ) and using Pythagorean identities leads to:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{\sin \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also, if the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by (1 - cos θ), the result is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

This also gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \csc \theta - \cot \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar manipulations for the cot function give:

:&lt;math&gt;\cot \frac{\theta}{2} = \pm\, \sqrt\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{1 - \cos \theta} = \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\sin \theta}{1 - \cos \theta} = \csc \theta + \cot \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

===Miscellaneous -- the triple tangent identity===

If &lt;math&gt;\psi + \theta + \phi = \pi = &lt;/math&gt; half circle (for example, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are the angles of a triangle),
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\psi) + \tan(\theta) + \tan(\phi) = \tan(\psi)\tan(\theta)\tan(\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

Proof:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathlaoshi.com/tags/tangent-identity/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203121/http://mathlaoshi.com/tags/tangent-identity/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }} dead link&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\psi &amp; = \pi - \theta - \phi \\
\tan(\psi) &amp; = \tan(\pi - \theta - \phi) \\
&amp; = - \tan(\theta + \phi) \\
&amp; = \frac{- \tan\theta - \tan\phi}{1 - \tan\theta \tan\phi} \\
&amp; = \frac{\tan\theta + \tan\phi}{\tan\theta \tan\phi - 1} \\
(\tan\theta \tan\phi - 1) \tan\psi &amp; = \tan\theta + \tan\phi \\
\tan\psi \tan\theta \tan\phi - \tan\psi &amp; = \tan\theta + \tan\phi \\
\tan\psi \tan\theta \tan\phi &amp; = \tan\psi + \tan\theta + \tan\phi \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Miscellaneous -- the triple cotangent identity===

If &lt;math&gt;\psi + \theta + \phi = \tfrac{\pi}{2} = &lt;/math&gt; quarter circle,
:&lt;math&gt; \cot(\psi) + \cot(\theta) + \cot(\phi) = \cot(\psi)\cot(\theta)\cot(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof:

Replace each of &lt;math&gt;\psi &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; with their complementary angles, so cotangents turn into tangents and vice versa.

Given
:&lt;math&gt;\psi + \theta + \phi = \tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore (\tfrac{\pi}{2}-\psi) + (\tfrac{\pi}{2}-\theta) + (\tfrac{\pi}{2}-\phi) = \tfrac{3\pi}{2} - (\psi+\theta+\phi) = \tfrac{3\pi}{2} - \tfrac{\pi}{2} = \pi &lt;/math&gt;

so the result follows from the triple tangent identity.

===Sum to product identities===

* &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \pm \sin \phi = 2 \sin \left ( \frac{\theta\pm \phi}2 \right ) \cos \left ( \frac{\theta\mp \phi}2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + \cos \phi = 2 \cos \left ( \frac{\theta+\phi}2 \right ) \cos \left ( \frac{\theta-\phi}2 \right ) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta - \cos \phi = -2 \sin \left ( \frac{\theta+\phi}2 \right ) \sin \left ( \frac{\theta-\phi}2 \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

====Proof of sine identities====

First, start with the sum-angle identities:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

By adding these together,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha + \beta) + \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta + \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
= 2 \sin \alpha \cos \beta &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, by subtracting the two sum-angle identities,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha + \beta) - \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta - \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
= 2 \cos \alpha \sin \beta &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha - \beta = \phi&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore \alpha = \frac{\theta + \phi}2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\theta - \phi}2 &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta + \sin \phi = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\theta + \phi}2 \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta - \phi}2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta - \sin \phi = 2 \cos \left( \frac{\theta + \phi}2 \right) \sin \left( \frac{\theta - \phi}2 \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\theta - \phi}2 \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta + \phi}2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \pm \sin \phi = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\theta\pm \phi}2 \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta\mp \phi}2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

====Proof of cosine identities====

Similarly for cosine, start with the sum-angle identities:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta\ - \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

Again, by adding and subtracting
:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha + \beta) + \cos (\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta\ - \sin \alpha \sin \beta + \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta = 2\cos \alpha \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha + \beta) - \cos (\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta\ - \sin \alpha \sin \beta - \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
= -2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as before,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + \cos \phi = 2 \cos \left( \frac{\theta+\phi}2 \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta-\phi}2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta - \cos \phi = -2 \sin \left( \frac{\theta+\phi}2 \right) \sin \left( \frac{\theta-\phi}2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Inequalities===
{{See also|List of triangle inequalities}}

[[File:TrigInequality.svg|right|thumb|342px|Illustration of the sine and tangent inequalities.]]

The figure at the right shows a sector of a circle with radius 1.  The sector is {{math|''θ''/(2{{pi}})}} of the whole circle, so its area is {{math|''θ''/2}}. We assume here that {{math|''θ'' &lt; {{pi}}/2}}.

:&lt;math&gt;OA = OD = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;AB = \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;CD = \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;

The area of triangle {{math|''OAD''}} is {{math|''AB''/2}}, or {{math|sin(''θ'')/2}}.  The area of triangle {{math|''OCD''}} is {{math|''CD''/2}}, or {{math|tan(''θ'')/2}}.

Since triangle {{math|''OAD''}} lies completely inside the sector, which in turn lies completely inside triangle {{math|''OCD''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta &lt; \theta &lt; \tan \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

This geometric argument relies on definitions of [[arc length]] and
[[Jordan measure|area]], which act as assumptions, so it is rather a condition imposed in construction of [[trigonometric functions]] than
a provable property.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Richman |first=Fred |title=A Circular Argument |journal=The College Mathematics Journal |date=March 1993 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=160–162 |jstor=2686787 |doi=10.2307/2686787}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sine function, we can handle other values.  If {{math|''θ'' &gt; {{pi}}/2}}, then {{math|''θ'' &gt; 1}}.  But {{math|sin ''θ'' ≤ 1}} (because of the Pythagorean identity), so {{math|sin ''θ'' &lt; ''θ''}}.  So we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} &lt; 1\ \ \ \mathrm{if}\ \ \ 0 &lt; \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

For negative values of {{math|''θ''}} we have, by symmetry of the sine function

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = \frac{\sin (-\theta)}{-\theta} &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} &lt; 1\quad \text{if }\quad \theta \ne 0,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tan \theta}{\theta} &gt; 1\quad  \text{if }\quad  0 &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Identities involving calculus==

===Preliminaries===

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to 0}{\sin \theta} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to 0}{\cos \theta} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

===Sine and angle ratio identity===

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to 0}{\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the function sine is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at 0, and its [[derivative]] is 1.

Proof: From the previous inequalities, we have, for small angles

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta &lt; \theta &lt; \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;,
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} &lt; 1 &lt; \frac{\tan \theta}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;,
Consider the right-hand inequality. Since
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore 1 &lt; \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta \cos \theta} &lt;/math&gt;
Multiply through by &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta &lt; \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;
Combining with the left-hand inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta &lt; \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
Taking &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta &lt;/math&gt; to the limit as &lt;math&gt; \theta \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to 0}{\cos \theta} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to 0}{\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

===Cosine and angle ratio identity===
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to 0}\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\theta} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Proof:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\theta} &amp; = \frac{1 - \cos^2 \theta}{\theta (1 + \cos \theta)}\\
&amp; = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\theta (1 + \cos \theta)}\\
&amp; = \left( \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} \right) \times \sin \theta \times \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos \theta} \right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The limits of those three quantities are 1, 0, and 1/2, so the resultant limit is zero.

===Cosine and square of angle ratio identity===
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\theta \to 0}\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\theta^2}  = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Proof:

As in the preceding proof,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\theta^2} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} \times \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} \times \frac{1}{1 + \cos \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The limits of those three quantities are 1, 1, and 1/2, so the resultant limit is 1/2.

===Proof of compositions of trig and inverse trig functions===

All these functions follow from the Pythagorean trigonometric identity. We can prove for instance the function
:&lt;math&gt;\sin[\arctan(x)]=\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Proof:

We start from
:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta=1&lt;/math&gt;
Then we divide this equation by &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos^2\theta=\frac{1}{\tan^2\theta+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Then use the substitution &lt;math&gt;\theta=\arctan(x)&lt;/math&gt;, also use the Pythagorean trigonometric identity:
:&lt;math&gt;1-\sin^2[\arctan(x)]=\frac{1}{\tan^2[\arctan(x)]+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we use the identity &lt;math&gt;\tan[\arctan(x)]\equiv x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin[\arctan(x)]=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1653">In [[coding theory]], '''puncturing''' is the process of removing some of the parity bits after encoding with an [[error correction and detection|error-correction code]].  This has the same effect as encoding with an error-correction code with a higher rate, or less redundancy.  However, with puncturing the same decoder can be used regardless of how many bits have been punctured, thus puncturing considerably increases the flexibility of the system without significantly increasing its complexity.

In some cases, a pre-defined pattern of puncturing is used in an encoder.  Then, the inverse operation, known as depuncturing, is implemented by the decoder.

Puncturing is used in [[UMTS]] during the rate matching process. It is also used in [[Wi-Fi]], [[GPRS]] and [[EDGE]], as well as in the [[DVB-T]] and [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] Standards.

Puncturing is often used with the [[Viterbi algorithm]] in coding systems.

During [[Radio Resource Control]] (RRC) Connection set procedure, during  sending NBAP radio link setup message the uplink puncturing limit will send to NODE B, along with U/L spreading factor &amp; U/L scrambling code.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Regularization perspectives on support vector machines''' provide a way of interpreting [[support vector machine]]s (SVMs) in the context of other machine learning algorithms.  SVM algorithms categorize [[multidimensional]] data, with the goal of fitting the [[training set]] data well, but also avoiding [[overfitting]], so that the solution [[generalize]]s to new data points.  [[Regularization (mathematics)|Regularization]] algorithms also aim to fit training set data and avoid overfitting.  They do this by choosing a fitting function that has low error on the training set, but also is not too complicated, where complicated functions are functions with high [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s in some [[function space]].  Specifically, [[Tikhonov regularization]] algorithms choose a function that minimize the sum of training set error plus the function's norm.  The training set error can be calculated with different [[loss function]]s.  For example, [[regularized least squares]] is a special case of Tikhonov regularization using the [[squared error loss]] as the loss function.&lt;ref name="rosasco1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosasco|first=Lorenzo|title=Regularized Least-Squares and Support Vector Machines|url=http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/spring12/slides/class06/class06_RLSSVM.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Regularization perspectives on support vector machines interpret SVM as a special case Tikhonov regularization, specifically Tikhonov regularization with the [[hinge loss]] for a loss function.  This provides a theoretical framework with which to analyze SVM algorithms and compare them to other algorithms with the same goals: to [[generalize]] without [[overfitting]]. SVM was first proposed in 1995 by [[Corinna Cortes]] and [[Vladimir Vapnik]], and framed geometrically as a method for finding [[hyperplane]]s that can separate [[multidimensional]] data into two categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cortes|first=Corinna|author2=Vladimir Vapnik |title=Support-Vector Networks|journal=Machine Learning|year=1995|volume=20|pages=273–297|doi=10.1007/BF00994018|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k238jx04hm87j80g/?MUD=MP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This traditional geometric interpretation of SVMs provides useful intuition about how SVMs work, but is difficult to relate to other [[machine learning]] techniques for avoiding overfitting like [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]], [[early stopping]], [[sparsity]] and [[Bayesian inference]].  However, once it was discovered that SVM is also a [[special case]] of Tikhonov regularization, regularization perspectives on SVM provided the theory necessary to fit SVM within a broader class of algorithms.&lt;ref name="rosasco1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rifkin|first=Ryan|title=Everything Old is New Again: A Fresh Look at Historical Approaches in Machine Learning|year=2002|publisher=MIT (PhD thesis)|url=http://web.mit.edu/~9.520/www/Papers/thesis-rifkin.pdf}}

==Theoretical background==
In the [[statistical learning theory]] framework, an [[algorithm]] is a strategy for choosing a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt; f:\mathbf X \to \mathbf Y &lt;/math&gt; given a training set &lt;math&gt; S = \{(x_1,y_1),\ldots, (x_n,y_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; of inputs, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, and their labels, &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; (the labels are usually &lt;math&gt;\pm1&lt;/math&gt;).  [[Regularization (mathematics)|Regularization]] strategies avoid [[overfitting]] by choosing a function that fits the data, but is not too complex.  Specifically:

&lt;math&gt;f = \text{arg}\min_{f\in\mathcal{H}}\left\{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n V(y_i,f(x_i))+\lambda||f||^2_\mathcal{H}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[hypothesis space]]&lt;ref&gt;A hypothesis space is the set of functions used to model the data in a machine learning problem. Each function corresponds to a hypothesis about the structure of the data. Typically the functions in a hypothesis space form a [[Hilbert space]] of functions with norm formed from the loss function.&lt;/ref&gt; of functions, &lt;math&gt;V:\mathbf Y \times \mathbf Y \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is the loss function, &lt;math&gt;||\cdot||_\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on the hypothesis space of functions, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[regularization parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;For insight on choosing the parameter, see, e.g., {{cite journal|last=Wahba|first=Grace|author2=Yonghua Wang |title=When is the optimal regularization parameter insensitive to the choice of the loss function|journal=Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods|year=1990|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1685–1700|doi=10.1080/03610929008830285|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610929008830285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]], there exists a [[kernel function]] &lt;math&gt;K: \mathbf X \times \mathbf X \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; that can be written as an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt;  [[symmetric]] [[Positive-definite kernel|positive definite]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf K&lt;/math&gt;.  By the [[representer theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal|last=Scholkopf|first=Bernhard |author2=Ralf Herbrich |author3=Alex Smola|title=A Generalized Representer Theorem|journal=Computational Learning Theory: Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2001|volume=2111|pages=416–426|doi=10.1007/3-540-44581-1_27|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v1tvba62hd4837h9/?MUD=MP}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;f(x_i) = \sum_{f=1}^n c_j \mathbf K_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; ||f||^2_{\mathcal H} = \langle f,f\rangle_\mathcal H = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n c_ic_jK(x_i,x_j) = c^T\mathbf K c &lt;/math&gt;

==Special properties of the hinge loss==
[[File:Hinge and Misclassification Loss.png|Hinge and misclassification loss functions]]

The simplest and most intuitive loss function for categorization is the misclassification loss, or 0-1 loss, which is 0 if &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)=y_i&lt;/math&gt; and 1 if &lt;math&gt;f(x_i) \neq y_i&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the [[Heaviside step function]] on &lt;math&gt;-y_if(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.  However, this loss function is not [[convex function|convex]], which makes the regularization problem very difficult to minimize computationally.  Therefore, we look for convex substitutes for the 0-1 loss.  The hinge loss, &lt;math&gt; V(y_i,f(x_i)) = (1-yf(x))_+&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(s)_+ = max(s,0)&lt;/math&gt;, provides such a [[convex relaxation]].  In fact, the hinge loss is the tightest convex [[upper bound]] to the 0-1 misclassification loss function,&lt;ref name="Lee 2012 67–81"/&gt; and with infinite data returns the [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes]] optimal solution:&lt;ref name="Rosasco 2004 1063–1076"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Yi|title=Support Vector Machines and the Bayes Rule in Classification|journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=July 2002|volume=6|issue=3|pages=259–275|doi=10.1023/A:1015469627679|url=http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~jvert/svn/bibli/local/Lin2002Support.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_b(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix}1&amp;p(1|x)&gt;p(-1|x)\\-1&amp;p(1|x)&lt;p(-1|x)\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==

The Tikhonov regularization problem can be shown to be equivalent to traditional formulations of SVM by expressing it in terms of the hinge loss.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed derivation, see {{cite book|last=Rifkin|first=Ryan|title=Everything Old is New Again: A Fresh Look at Historical Approaches in Machine Learning|year=2002|publisher=MIT (PhD thesis)|url=http://web.mit.edu/~9.520/www/Papers/thesis-rifkin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the hinge loss,

&lt;math&gt; V(y_i,f(x_i)) = (1-yf(x))_+&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(s)_+ = max(s,0)&lt;/math&gt;, the regularization problem becomes

&lt;math&gt;f = \text{arg}\min_{f\in\mathcal{H}}\left\{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n  (1-yf(x))_+ +\lambda||f||^2_\mathcal{H}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;1/(2\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; yields

&lt;math&gt;f = \text{arg}\min_{f\in\mathcal{H}}\left\{C\sum_{i=1}^n  (1-yf(x))_+ +\frac{1}{2}||f||^2_\mathcal{H}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;C = 1/(2\lambda n)&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to the standard SVM minimization problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60671">{{distinguish|text="education statistics", the use of statistics in [[education research]]}}

'''Statistics education''' is the practice of teaching and learning of [[statistics]], along with the associated scholarly research.

[[Statistics]] is both a [[formal science]] and a practical theory of [[scientific inquiry]], and both aspects  are considered in statistics education. Education in statistics has similar concerns as does education in other [[mathematical sciences]], like [[logic]], [[mathematics education|mathematics]], and [[computer science education|computer science]]. At the same time, statistics is concerned with evidence-based reasoning, particularly with the analysis of data. Therefore, education in statistics has strong similarities to education in empirical disciplines like [[Educational psychology#Applications in teaching|psychology]] and [[chemistry education|chemistry]], in which education is closely tied to "hands-on" experimentation.

Mathematicians and [[statistician]]s often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities). Statistics courses have been sometimes taught by non-statisticians, against the recommendations of some professional organizations of statisticians and of mathematicians.

Statistics education research is an emerging field that grew out of different disciplines and is currently establishing itself as a unique field that is devoted to the improvement of teaching and learning statistics at all educational levels.

==Goals of statistics education==

Statistics educators have cognitive and noncognitive goals for students.  For example, former [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA) President Katherine Wallman defined statistical literacy as including the cognitive abilities of understanding and critically evaluating statistical results as well as appreciating the contributions statistical thinking can make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wallman, K.S. |title=Enhancing statistical literacy: Enriching our society |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=88 |issue=421 |pages=1–8 |year=1993 |jstor=2290686 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1993.10594283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = IASE&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bond, M.E. |author2=Perkins, S.M. |author3=Ramirez, C. |title=Students’ Perceptions of Statistics: An Exploration of Attitudes, Conceptualizations, and Content Knowledge of Statistics |journal=Statistics Education Research Journal |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=6–25 |year=2012 |url=http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/serj/SERJ11(2)_Bond.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive goals===

In the text rising from the 2008 joint conference of the [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] and the International Association of Statistics Educators, editors Carmen Batanero, [[Gail Burrill]], and Chris Reading (Universidad de Granada, Spain, Michigan State University, USA, and University of New England, Australia, respectively) note worldwide trends in curricula which reflect data-oriented goals.  In particular, educators currently seek to have students: "design investigations; formulate research questions; collect data using observations, surveys, and experiments; describe and compare data sets; and propose and justify conclusions and predictions based on data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Carmen |editor1-last=Batanero |editor2-first=Gail F. |editor2-last=Burrill |editor3-first=Chris |editor3-last=Reading |title=Teaching Statistics in School Mathematics—Challenges for Teaching and Teacher Education: A Joint ICMI/IASE Study: The 18th ICMI Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRYvsu9rNqwC |year=2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-1131-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors note the importance of developing statistical thinking and reasoning in addition to statistical knowledge.

Despite the fact that cognitive goals for statistics education increasingly focus on statistical literacy, statistical reasoning, and statistical thinking rather than on skills, computations and procedures alone, there is no agreement about what these terms mean or how to assess these outcomes.  A first attempt to define and distinguish between these three terms appears in the ARTIST website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Assessment Resource Tools for Improving Statistical Thinking - Home Page | accessdate = 2013-02-28 | url = https://apps3.cehd.umn.edu/artist/glossary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was created by Garfield, delMas and Chance and has since been included in several publications.&lt;ref name=Garfield1&gt;Garfield, J., &amp; Ben-Zvi, D. (2008). Developing students’ statistical reasoning: Connecting research and teaching practice. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, J., &amp; Ben-Zvi, D. (2008). Preparing school teachers to develop students' statistical reasoning. In C. Batanero, G. Burrill, C. Reading, &amp; A. Rossman. ''Teaching Statistics in School Mathematics-Challenges for Teaching and Teacher Education: A Joint ICMI/IASE Study: The 18th ICMI Study.'' 299-310. Dordrecht: Springer.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Brief definitions of these terms are as follows:
# Statistical literacy is being able to read and use basic statistical language and graphical representations to understand statistical information in the media and in daily life.
# Statistical reasoning is being able to reason about and connect different statistical concepts and ideas, such as knowing how and why outliers affect statistical measures of center and variability.
# Statistical thinking is the type of thinking used by statisticians when they encounter a statistical problem. This involves thinking about the nature and quality of the data and, where the data came from, choosing appropriate analyses and models, and interpreting the results in the context of the problem and given the constraints of the data.

Further cognitive goals of statistics education vary across students' educational level and the contexts in which they expect to encounter statistics.

Statisticians have proposed what they consider the most important statistical concepts for educated citizens.  For example, Utts (2003) published seven areas of what every educated citizen should know, including understanding that "variability is normal" and how "coincidences… are not uncommon because there are so many possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Utts, J. |title=What educated citizens should know about statistics and probability |journal=[[The American Statistician]] |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=74–79 |year=2003 |doi=10.1198/0003130031630 |url=http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/0003130031630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gal (2002) suggests adults in industrialized societies are expected to exercise statistical literacy, "the ability to interpret and critically evaluate statistical information… in diverse contexts, and the ability to… communicate understandings and concerns regarding the… conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gal, I. |title=Adults' statistical literacy: Meanings, components, responsibilities |journal=[[International Statistical Review]] |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2002 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-5823.2002.tb00336.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-5823.2002.tb00336.x/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-cognitive goals===

Non-cognitive outcomes include affective constructs such as attitudes, beliefs, emotions, dispositions, and motivation.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin Samuel |last=Bloom |title=Taxonomy of educational objectives: the classification of educational goals. Handbook I, Cognitive domain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hos6AAAAIAAJ |year=1956 |publisher=David McKay |oclc=220283628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to prominent researchers Gal &amp; Ginsburg,&lt;ref name=galgins&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gal, I. |author2=Ginsburg, L. |title=The role of beliefs and attitudes in learning statistics: towards an assessment framework |journal=Journal of Statistics Education |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=November 1994 |url=http://www.amstat.org/PUBLICATIONS/JSE/v2n2/gal.html |doi=10.1080/10691898.1994.11910471}}&lt;/ref&gt; statistics educators should make it a priority to be aware of students’ ideas, reactions, and feelings towards statistics and how these affect their learning.

====Beliefs====

Beliefs are defined as one’s individually held ideas about statistics, about oneself as a learner of statistics, and about the social context of learning statistics.&lt;ref name=galetal&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Monitoring attitudes and beliefs in statistics education |editor1-first=Iddo |editor1-last=Gal |editor2-first=Joan B. |editor2-last=Garfield |editor3-first=Y. |editor3-last=Gal |title=The Assessment Challenge in Statistics Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxdJgnFzNRsC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=1997 |publisher=IOS Press |isbn=978-90-5199-333-2 |pages=37–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beliefs are distinct from attitudes  in the sense that attitudes are relatively stable and intense feelings that develop over time in the context of experiences learning statistics.  Students’ web of beliefs provides a context for their approach towards their classroom experiences in statistics.  Many students enter a statistics course with apprehension towards learning the subject, which works against the learning environment that the instructor is trying to accomplish. Therefore, it is important for instructors to have access to assessment instruments that can give an initial diagnosis of student beliefs and monitor beliefs during a course.&lt;ref name=galgins/&gt; Frequently, assessment instruments have monitored beliefs and attitudes together. For examples of such instruments, see the attitudes  section below.

====Dispositions====

Disposition has to do with the ways students question the data and approach a statistical problem.  Dispositions is one of the four dimensions in Wild and Pfannkuch’s&lt;ref name=wildpfan&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wild, C.J. |author2=Pfannkuch, M. |title=Statistical thinking in empirical enquiry |journal=International Statistical Review |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=223–265 |year=1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-5823.1999.tb00442.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-5823.1999.tb00442.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; framework for statistical thinking, and contains the following elements:

*Curiosity and Awareness: These traits are a part of the process of generating questions and generating ideas to explore and analyze data.
*Engagement:  Students will be most observant and aware in the areas they find most interesting.
*Imagination:  This trait is important for viewing a problem from different perspectives and coming up with possible explanations.
*Scepticism:  Critical thinking is important for receiving new ideas and information and evaluating the appropriateness of study design and analysis.
*Being logical: The ability to detect when one idea follows from another is important for arriving at valid conclusions.
*A propensity to seek deeper meaning:  This means not taking everything at face value and being open to consider new ideas and dig deeper for information.

Scheaffer states that a goal of statistics education is to have students see statistics broadly.  He developed a list of views of statistics that can lead to this broad view, and describes them as follows:&lt;ref name=scheaffer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scheaffer, R. |title=Statistics education: perusing the past, embracing the present, and charting the future |journal=Newsletter for the Section on Statistical Education |volume=7 |issue=1 |year=2001 |url=https://www.amstat.org/sections/educ/newsletter/v7n1/Perusing.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Statistics as number sense: Do I understand what the numbers mean? (seeing data as numbers in context, reading charts, graphs and tables, understanding numerical and graphical summaries of data, etc.) 
*Statistics as a way of understanding the world: Can I use existing data to help make decisions? (using census data, birth and death rates, disease rates, CPI, ratings, rankings, etc., to describe, decide and defend)
*Statistics as organized problem solving: Can I design and carry out a study to answer specific questions? (pose problem, collect data according to a plan, analyze data, and draw conclusions from data)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Attitudes====

Since students often experience math anxiety and negative opinions about statistics courses, various researchers have addressed attitudes and anxiety towards statistics.  Some instruments have been developed to measure college students’ attitudes towards statistics, and have been shown to have appropriate psychometric properties. Examples of such instruments include:

*Survey of Attitudes Towards Statistics (SATS), developed by Schau, Stevens, Dauphinee, and Del Vecchio&lt;ref name=schau&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schau, C. |author2=Stevens, J. |author3=Dauphinee, T. |author4=Del Vecchio, A. |title=The development and validation of the Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics |journal=Educational &amp; Psychological Measurement |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=868–876 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/0013164495055005022 |url=http://epm.sagepub.com/content/55/5/868.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Attitude Toward Statistics Scale, developed by Wise&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wise, S.L. |title=The development and validation of a scale measuring attitudes toward statistics |journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=401–5 |year=1985 |doi=10.1177/001316448504500226 |url=http://epm.sagepub.com/content/45/2/401.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Statistics Attitude Survey (SAS), developed by Roberts and Bilderback&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roberts, D. |author2=Bilderback, W. |title=Reliability and Validity of a Statistics Attitude Survey |journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=235–8 |date=April 1980 |doi=10.1177/001316448004000138 |url=http://epm.sagepub.com/content/40/1/235.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful use of instruments such as these can help statistics instructors to learn about students’ perception of statistics, including their anxiety towards learning statistics, the perceived difficulty of learning statistics, and their perceived usefulness of the subject.&lt;ref name = zief&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zieffler, A. |author2=Garfield, J. |author3=Alt, S. |author4=Dupuis, D., |author5=Holleque, K. |author6=Chang, B. |title=What does research suggest about the teaching and learning of introductory statistics at the college level? A review of the literature |journal=Journal of Statistics Education |volume=16 |issue=2 |year=2008 |url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/V16n2/zieffler.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/10691898.2008.11889566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown modest success at improving student attitudes in individual courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harlow, L.L. |author2=Burkholder, G.J. |author3=Morrow, J.A. |title=Evaluating attitudes, skill and performance in a learning-enhanced quantitative methods course: A structural modelling approach |journal=Structural Equation Modeling |volume=9 |pages=413–430 |year=2002 |doi=10.1207/S15328007SEM0903_6 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15328007SEM0903_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carlson, K.A. |author2=Winquist, J.R. |title=Evaluating an active learning approach to teaching introductory statistics: A classroom workbook approach |journal=Journal of Statistics Education |volume=19 |issue=1 |year=2011 |url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/carlson.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/10691898.2011.11889596}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no generalizable studies showing improvement in student attitudes have been seen.

Nevertheless, one of the goals of statistics education is to make the study of statistics a positive experience for students and to bring in interesting and engaging examples and data that will motivate students.  According to a fairly recent literature review,&lt;ref name=zief/&gt; improved student attitudes towards statistics can lead to better motivation and engagement, which also improves cognitive learning outcomes.

==Primary–secondary education level==

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], a new curriculum for statistics has been developed by Chris Wild and colleagues at Auckland University. Rejecting the contrived, and now unnecessary due to computer power, approach of reasoning under the [[Null hypothesis|null]] and the restrictions of normal theory, they use comparative box plots and [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] to introduce concepts of sampling variability and inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wild, C.J. |author2=Pfannkuch, M. |author3=Regan, M. |author4=Horton, N.J. |title=Towards more accessible conceptions of statistical inference |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]] |volume=174 |issue=2 |pages=247–295 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00678.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00678.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developing curriculum also contains aspects of [[statistical literacy]].

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], at least some statistics has been taught in schools since the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Conway1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conway, F. |title=Statistics in schools |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]] |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=60–64 |year=1986 |jstor=2981885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, P. |title=50 years of statistics teaching in English schools: some milestones (with discussion) |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series D]] |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=439–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1046/j.1467-9884.2003.372_1.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, [[A-level]] qualifications (typically taken by 17-18 year olds) are being developed in "Statistics" and "Further Statistics". The coverage of the former includes: Probability; Data Collection; Descriptive Statistics; Discrete Probability Distributions; Binomial Distribution; Poisson Distributions; Continuous Probability Distributions; The Normal Distribution; Estimation; Hypothesis Testing; Chi-Squared; Correlation and Regression. The coverage of "Further Statistics" includes: Continuous Probability Distributions; Estimation; Hypothesis Testing; One Sample Tests; Hypothesis Testing; Two Sample Tests; Goodness of Fit Tests; Experimental Design; Analysis of Variance (Anova); Statistical Process Control; Acceptance Sampling. The Centre for Innovation in Mathematics Teaching (CIMT)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cimt.plymouth.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; has online course notes for these sets of topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimt.plymouth.ac.uk/projects/mepres/alevel/alevel.htm CIMT A-level course notes]&lt;/ref&gt; Revision notes for an existing qualification&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathsrevision.net/alevel/statistics/ mathsrevision.net A-level notes]&lt;/ref&gt; indicate a similar coverage. At an earlier age (typically 15–16 years) [[GCSE]] qualifications in mathematics contain "Statistics and Probability" topics on: Probability; Averages; Standard Deviation; Sampling; Cumumulative Frequency Graphs (including median and quantiles); Representing Data; Histograms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathsrevision.net/gcse/index.php matherevision.net GCSE maths notes]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Office for National Statistics]] has a webpage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats4schools.gov.uk/ ONS stats4schools teacher/student resources]&lt;/ref&gt; leading to material suitable for both teachers and students at school level. In 2004 the Smith inquiry made the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is much concern and debate about the positioning of Statistics and Data Handling within the current mathematics GCSE, where it occupies some 25 per cent of the timetable allocation. On the one hand, there is widespread agreement that the Key Stage 4 curriculum is over-crowded and that the introduction of Statistics and Data Handling may have been at the expense of time needed for practising and acquiring fluency in core mathematical manipulations. Many in higher education mathematics and engineering departments take this view. On the other hand, there is overwhelming recognition, shared by the Inquiry, of the vital importance of Statistics and Data Handling skills both for a number of other academic disciplines and in the workplace. '''The Inquiry recommends that there be a radical re-look at this issue and that much of the teaching and learning of Statistics and Data Handling would be better removed from the mathematics timetable and integrated with the teaching and learning of other disciplines (e.g. biology or geography). The time restored to the mathematics timetable should be used for acquiring greater mastery of core mathematical concepts and operations'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= http://www.mathsinquiry.org.uk | title=Making Mathematics Count: The Report of Professor Adrian Smith's Inquiry into Post-14 Mathematics Education | year=2004 | first=Adrian|last=Smith| authorlink = Adrian Smith (academic) |location=London, England | publisher=The Stationery Office|issue=2/04 937764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], schooling has increased the use of probability and statistics, especially since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, there was a "wide growth of statistical training in grades K-12, led by the implementation of an Advanced
Placement (AP) course in statistics." Page 403 in {{cite journal | doi=10.1214/088342304000000404 | title=A Report on the Future of Statistics |

Topics in probability and statistical reasoning are taught in high school algebra (or mathematical science) courses; statistical reasoning has been examined in the [[SAT#Mathematics|SAT]] test [[SAT#1994 changes|since 1994]]. The [[College Board]] has developed an [[Advanced Placement]] [[Advanced Placement Statistics|course in statistics]], which has provided a college-level course in statistics to hundreds of thousands of high school students,  with the first examination happening in May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Page 403 in {{cite journal | doi=10.1214/088342304000000404 | title=A Report on the Future of Statistics | first1=Bruce G. |last1=Lindsay|first2=Jon|last2=Kettenring|first3=David O. |last3=Siegmund| journal=Statistical Science|volume=19| issue= 3 |date= August 2004| pages=387–407 | jstor=4144386 |mr=2185624}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the ASA endorsed the [[Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education]] (GAISE), a two-dimensional framework for the conceptual understanding of statistics in Pre-K-12 students. The framework contains learning objectives for students at each conceptual level and provides pedagogical examples that are consistent with the conceptual levels.

===Estonia===
[[Estonia]] is piloting a new statistics curriculum developed by the [[Computer-Based Math]] foundation based around its principles of using computers as the primary tool of education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2013/02/11/estonian-schools-to-teach-computer-based-math/ Estonian Schools to Teach Computer-Based Math] Wall Street Journal, 11 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/computer-based-math-in-estonia/ Math Rebels Invade Estonia With Computerized Education] Wired, 12 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.err.ee/education/34fea787-9203-4811-9f5a-eb62ad8567e5 Estonia Chosen as Testing Ground for Math Education Experiment] Estonian Public Broadcasting News&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.postimees.ee/1135472/estonian-british-experts-team-up-to-develop-computer-based-math-education Estonian, British experts team up to develop computer-based math education] Postimees, 13 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==University level==

===General===

Statistics is often taught in departments of mathematics or in departments of mathematical sciences. At the undergraduate level, statistics is often taught as a service course.

====United Kingdom====
By tradition in the U.K., most professional statisticians are trained at the Master level.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} A difficulty of recruiting strong undergraduates has been noted: "Very few undergraduates positively choose to study statistics degrees; most choose some statistics options within a mathematics programme, often to avoid the advanced pure and applied mathematics courses. My view is that statistics as a theoretical discipline is better taught late rather than early, whereas statistics as part of scientific methodology should be taught as part of science."&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the teaching of statistics at university level was originally done within science departments that needed the topic to accompany the teaching of their own subjects, and departments of mathematics had limited coverage before the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Conway1/&gt; For the twenty years subsequent to this, while departments of mathematics had started to teach statistics, there was little realisation that essentially the same basic statistical methodology was being applied across a variety of sciences.&lt;ref name=Conway1/&gt; Statistical departments have had difficulty when they have been separated from mathematics departments.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

Psychologist [[Andy Field (academic)|Andy Field]] ([[British Psychological Society]] Teaching and Book Award) created a new concept of statistical teaching and textbooks that goes beyond the printed page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/SAGE-Strikes-Gold-with-Andy-Fields-New-Statistics-TextbookEbook-88546.asp  SAGE Strikes Gold with Andy Field’s New Statistics Textbook/Ebook] – Nancy K. Herther  2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Enrollments in statistics have increased in [[community college]]s, in four year colleges and universities in the United States. At community colleges in the United States, mathematics has experienced increased enrollment since 1990. At community colleges, the ratio of the students enrolled in statistics to those enrolled in calculus rose from 56% in 1990 to 82% in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Page 616 in {{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2589117 | title=Statistics and Mathematics: Tension and Cooperation | last2=Cobb | first2=George W. | last1=Moore | first1=David S. | authorlink1=David S. Moore | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=107 | issue=7 &amp;ndash;September |date= August 2000| pages=615&amp;ndash;630 | jstor=2589117|mr=1543690}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ASA-endorsed GAISE reports focused on statistics education at the [[Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education#The GAISE College Report|introductory college level]]. The report includes a brief history of the introductory statistics course and recommendations for how it should be taught.

In many colleges, a basic course in "statistics for non-statisticians" has required only algebra (and not calculus); for future statisticians, in contrast, the undergraduate exposure to statistics is highly mathematical.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"Undergraduate major programs should include study of probability and statistical theory, along with the prerequisite mathematics, especially calculus and linear algebra. Programs for nonmajors may require less study of mathematics. Programs preparing for graduate work may require additional mathematics." {{cite web | url=http://www.amstat.org/education/curriculumguidelines.cfm | title=Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science | author = [[American Statistical Association]] | accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As undergraduates, future statisticians should have completed courses in multivariate calculus, linear algebra, computer programming, and a year of calculus-based probability and statistics. Students wanting to obtain a doctorate in statistics from "any of the better graduate programs in statistics" should also take "[[real analysis]]".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Page 622 in {{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2589117 | title=Statistics and Mathematics: Tension and Cooperation | last2=Cobb | first2=George W. | last1=Moore | first1=David S. | authorlink1=David S. Moore | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=107 | issue=7 |date= August 2000| pages=615–630 | jstor=2589117  | mr = 1543690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory courses in physics, chemistry and psychology also provide useful experiences with planning and conducting experiments and with analyzing data. The ASA recommends that undergraduate students consider obtaining a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics as preparation for entering a master program in statistics.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The ASA makes the following recommendations for undergraduates wishing to become statisticians: "Major in applied mathematics, or a closely related field. If you do major in a nonstatistical field, minor in mathematics or statistics. Develop a background in mathematics, science, and computers and gain knowledge in a specific field of interest. A master's degree or PhD is very helpful and often recommended or required for higher-level positions." {{cite web | url=http://www.amstat.org/careers/howdoibecomeastatistician.cfm | title=How Do I Become a Statistician? | author = [[American Statistical Association]] | accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, professional degrees in statistics have been at the Master level, although some students may qualify to work with a bachelor's degree and job-related experience or further self-study.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"A master's degree or PhD is very helpful and often recommended or required for higher-level positions." {{cite web | url=http://www.amstat.org/careers/howdoibecomeastatistician.cfm | title=How Do I Become a Statistician? | author = [[American Statistical Association]] | accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional competence requires a background in mathematics---including at least multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and a year of calculus-based probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="amstat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amstat.org/education/curriculumguidelines.cfm | title=Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science | author = [[American Statistical Association]] | accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, a master program in statistics  requires courses in probability, mathematical statistics, and [[applied statistics]] (e.g., design of experiments, survey sampling, etc.).

For a doctoral degree in statistics, it has been traditional that students complete a course in [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] [[probability theory|probability]] as well as courses in [[statistical inference|mathematical statistics]]. Such courses require a good course in [[real analysis]], covering the [[mathematical proof|proof]]s of the theory of calculus and topics like the [[uniform convergence]] of functions.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=Terry Speed|first=Terry|last=Speed| title=A Dialogue (Terence's Stuff)|journal=IMS Bulletin|date= November 2009|volume=38 | issue=9 | pages = 14 | url=http://bulletin.imstat.org/pdf/38/9 | issn=1544-1881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, some departments have discussed allowing doctoral students to waive the course in measure-theoretic probability by demonstrating advanced skills in [[computer programming]] or [[scientific computing]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Stanford University statistician [[Persi Diaconis]] wrote that "I see a strong trend against measure theory in modern statistics departments: I had to fight to keep the measure theory requirement in Stanford's statistics graduate program.

==Who should teach statistics?==
The question of what qualities are needed to teach statistics has been much discussed, and sometimes this discussion is concentrated on the qualifications necessary for those undertaking such teaching. The question arises separately for teaching at both school and university levels, partly because of the need for numerically more such teachers at school level and partly because of need for such teachers to cover a broad range of other topics within their overall duties. Given that "statistics" is often taught to non-scientists, opinions can range all the way from "statistics should be taught by statisticians", through "teaching of statistics is too mathematical" to the extreme that "statistics should not be taught by statisticians".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tanur|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching at university level===
{{Globalize|section|USA|date=December 2009}}
In the United States especially, statisticians have long complained that many mathematics departments have assigned mathematicians (without statistical competence) to teach [[statistics]] courses, effectively giving "[[double-blind|double blind]]" courses. The [[professional ethics|principle]] that college-instructors should have qualifications and engagement with their [[academic discipline]] has long been violated in United States colleges and universities, according to generations of statisticians. For example, the journal [[Statistical Science]] reprinted "classic" articles on the teaching of statistics by non-statisticians by [[Harold Hotelling]];&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731833| title=The Teaching of Statistics | author=[[Harold Hotelling]]|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=11|issue=4|date=Dec 1940|pages=457&amp;ndash;470| jstor=2235726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|title=Golden Oldies: Classic Articles from the World of Statistics and Probability: 'The Teaching of Statistics'| author=[[Harold Hotelling]]| journal=[[Statistical Science]]| volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=63&amp;ndash;71 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177013001|doi=10.1214/ss/1177013001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|title=Golden Oldies: Classic Articles from the World of Statistics and Probability: 'The Place of Statistics in the University'| author=[[Harold Hotelling]]| journal=[[Statistical Science]]| volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=72&amp;ndash;83|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177013002|doi=10.1214/ss/1177013002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotelling's articles
are followed by the comments of [[Kenneth J. Arrow]], [[W. Edwards Deming]], [[Ingram Olkin]],  [[David S. Moore]], James V. Sidek, Shanti S. Gupta, [[Robert V. Hogg]], Ralph A. Bradley, and by Harold Hotelling, Jr. (an economist and son of Harold Hotelling).

Data on the teaching of statistics in the United States has been collected on behalf of the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences]] ([[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences|CBMS]]). Examining data from 2000, Schaeffer and Stasny&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The State of Undergraduate Education in Statistics: A Report from the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences|CBMS]]|author1=Scheaffer, Richard L. Scheaffer  |author2=Stasny, Elizabeth A |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=The [[American Statistician]]| volume=58| issue=4 |date= November 2004|pages=265&amp;ndash;271| doi=10.1198/000313004X5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By far the majority of instructors within statistics departments
have at least a master’s degree in statistics or biostatistics (about
89% for doctoral departments and about 79% for master’s departments).
In doctoral mathematics departments, however, only
about 58% of statistics course instructors had at least a master’s
degree in statistics or biostatistics as their highest degree earned.
In master’s-level mathematics departments, the corresponding
percentage was near 44%, and in bachelor’s-level departments
only 19% of statistics course instructors had at least a master’s
degree in statistics or biostatistics as their highest degree
earned. As we expected, a large majority of instructors in statistics
departments (83% for doctoral departments and 62% for
master’s departments) held doctoral degrees in either statistics
or biostatistics. The comparable percentages for instructors of
statistics in mathematics departments were about 52% and 38%.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[professional ethics|principle]] that statistics-instructors should have statistical competence has been affirmed by the [http://www.maa.org/guidelines/ guidelines] of the [[Mathematical Association of America]], which has been [http://www.maa.org/guidelines/ endorsed] by the ASA. The [[American Association of University Professors|unprofessional]] teaching of [[statistics]] by mathematicians (without qualifications in statistics) has been addressed in many articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.2307/2686686| title=Should Mathematicians Teach Statistics? |author=Moore, David S| authorlink=David S.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching methods==

{{See also|Mathematics education|Pedagogy|Didactics}}

The literature on methods of teaching statistics is closely related to the literature on the teaching of mathematics for two reasons. First, statistics is often taught as part of the mathematics curriculum, by instructors trained in mathematics and working in a mathematics department. Second, [[statistical theory]] has often been taught as a [[mathematical theory]] rather than as the practical [[inductive logic|logic]] of [[science]] --- as the science that "puts chance to work" in Rao's phrase--- and this has entailed an emphasis on formal and manipulative training, such as solving combinatorial problems involving red and green jelly beans. Statisticians have complained that mathematicians are prone to over-emphasize mathematical manipulations and probability theory and under-emphasize questions of [[design of experiments|experimentation]], [[sampling (statistics)|survey methodology]], [[exploratory data analysis]], and [[statistical inference]].&lt;ref&gt;Hotelling. Cobb and Moore.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2010|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Template:Cite web]] or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see [[WP:CITE]]) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

In recent decades, there has been an increased emphasis on [[exploratory data analysis|data analysis]] and [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]] in statistics education. In the United Kingdom, the [[Adrian Smith (academic)|Smith]] inquiry ''[[Making Mathematics Count]]'' suggests teaching [[statistical literacy|basic statistical concepts]] as part of the science curriculum, rather than as part of [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Smith (academic)|Adrian Smith]] (primary source). [[T.M.F. Smith]] et alia. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the ASA's guidelines for undergraduate statistics specify that introductory statistics should emphasize the [[scientific method]]s of [[data collection]], particularly [[randomized experiment]]s and [[random sample]]s:&lt;ref name="amstat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GHSW&gt;{{Cite book|title=Best Practices in Introductory Statistics (Draft 2000.06.09) | editor=First Courses in Statistical Science Working Group | author=Joan Garfield and Bob Hogg and Candace Schau and Dex Whittinghill | publisher=[[American Statistical Association]] | series=Undergraduate Statistics Education Initiative Position Paper |date=9 June 2000| url=http://www.amstat.org/education/pdfs/usei_1st.pdf | issue=2000.06.09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  further, the first course should review these topics when the theory of "[[statistical inference]]" is studied.&lt;ref name=GHSW/&gt; Similar recommendations occur hold for the [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) course in [[Advanced Placement Statistics|Statistics]].&lt;!-- Cobb and Moore; Moore and McCabe --&gt; The ASA and AP guidelines are followed by contemporary textbooks in the USA, such as those by [[David A.

==Professional community==

===Associations===
The [[International Statistical Institute]] (ISI) now has one section devoted to education, the International Association for Statistical Education(IASE), which runs the International Conference on Teaching Statistics every four years as well as IASE satellite conferences around ISI and ICMI meetings. The UK established the Royal Statistical Society Centre for Statistics Education and the ASA now also has a Section on Statistical Education, focused mostly on statistics teaching at the elementary and secondary levels.

===Conferences===
In addition to the international gatherings of statistics educators at ICOTS every four years, the US hosts a US Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS) every two years and has recently started an Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics (eCOTS) to alternate with USCOTS. Sessions on statistics education area also offered at many conferences in mathematics educations such as the [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]], the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]], the Conference of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, and the Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia. The annual [[Joint Statistical Meetings]] (offered by the ASA and [[Statistics Canada]]) offer many sessions and roundtables on statistics education. [[The International Research Forums on Statistical Reasoning, Thinking, and Literacy]] offer scientific gatherings every two years and related publications in journals, CD-ROMs and books on research in statistics education.

=={{Anchor|New directions}}Trends in Statistics Education==

Teachers of statistics have been encouraged to explore new directions in curriculum content, pedagogy and assessment. In an influential  talk at USCOTS, researcher George Cobb presented an innovative approach to teaching statistics that put [[simulation]], [[Resampling (statistics)#Permutation tests|randomization]], and [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] techniques at the core of the college-level introductory course, in place of traditional content such as [[probability]] theory and the [[Student's t-test|''t''-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Another recent direction is addressing the [[big data]] sets that are increasingly affecting or being contributed to in our daily lives. Statistician Rob Gould, creator of ''Data Cycle, The Musical'' dinner and theatre spectacular,  outlines many of these types of data and encourages teachers to find ways to use the data and address issues around big data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Janson has published four books and over 300 [[academic paper]]s ({{asof|2017|lc=on}}). He has an Erdős number of 1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Svante Janson has already had a long career in mathematics, because he started research at a very young age.
[[File:Carleson cropped.jpg| thumb |upright|[[Lennart Carleson]] was the [[doctoral advisor|doctoral supervisor]] of Svante Janson, who received his Ph.D. on his 22nd birthday.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;  Carleson had himself received his Ph.D. when he was 22 years old.&lt;ref name="Carleson"&gt;

===From prodigy to docent===
A [[child prodigy]] in mathematics, Janson took high-school and even university classes while in primary school. He was [[university admission|admitted]] in 1968 to [[Gothenburg University]] at age 12. After his 1968 [[matriculation#United States|matriculation]] at Uppsala University at age 13,&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; Janson obtained the following degrees in mathematics: a "candidate of philosophy" (roughly an "[[honours degree|honours]]" [[B.S. degree|B.S.]] with a thesis) at age 14 (in 1970) and a [[Ph.D.|doctor of philosophy]] at age 21–22 (in 1977). Janson's Ph.D. was awarded on his 22nd birthday.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://www.math.uu.se/~svante/cv.html Curriculum Vitæ for Svante Janson], read 18 december 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Janson's [[doctoral dissertation]] was [[doctoral advisor|supervised]] by [[Lennart Carleson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Janson | first=Svante | title=On BMO and related spaces | year=1977 | publisher=Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University|location=Uppsala}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had himself received his doctoral degree when he was 22 years old.&lt;ref name="Carleson"&gt;
his thesis studied [[harmonic analysis]], particularly [[Hardy space]]s of [[bounded mean oscillation]] (BMO), and {{cite journal

   | format = PDF
   | accessdate = 2008-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having earned his doctorate, Janson was a [[postdoc]] with the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] from 1978 to 1980. Thereafter he worked at Uppsala University. Janson's ongoing research earned him another PhD from Uppsala University in 1984 – this second doctoral degree being in [[mathematical statistics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Janson | first=Svante | title=Random coverings and related problems | year=1984 | location=Uppsala}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  [[doctoral advisor|supervisor]] was [[Carl-Gustav Esseen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=19988 The Mathematics Genealogy Project: Svante Janson], read 1 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Janson was hired by [[Stockholm University]] as [[Docent#Northern Europe|docent]] (roughly [[associate professor]] in the USA).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

===Professorships===
In 1985 Janson returned to Uppsala University, where he was named [[Professor#Main positions 2|the chaired professor]] in [[mathematical statistics]]. In 1987 Janson became [[Professor#Main positions 2|the chaired professor]] of mathematics at Uppsala university.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; Traditionally in Sweden, the ''chaired professor'' has had the role of a "''[[Professor#Main positions 2|professor ordinarius]]''" in a [[German university]] (roughly combining the roles of research professor and director of graduate studies at a [[research university]] in the USA).

Svante Janson's [[full name]] is "Carl Svante Janson".&lt;ref&gt;Page 647 in {{cite book | last1=Graham | first1=Ronald&amp;nbsp;L. | authorlink1=Ronald L.

==Awards==
Besides being a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (KVA), Svante Janson is a member of the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]]. His thesis received the 1978 Sparre Award from the KVA. He received the 1994 Swedish medal for the best young mathematical scientist, the [[Göran Gustafsson Prize]]. Janson's former [[doctoral advisor|doctoral student]], Ola Hössjer, received the Göran Gustafsson prize in 2009, becoming the first [[statistician]] so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gustafssonsstiftelse.se/kva/tidigare.html | title=Göran Gustafsson prize awarded to Svante Janson in 1994 (and to Janson's student Ola Hössjer in 2009) | date=2010-06-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804074015/http://www.gustafssonsstiftelse.se/kva/tidigare.html | archivedate=2012-08-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Janson received the [[Lars Gårding|Eva &amp; Lars Gårding]] prize from the [[Royal Physiographic Society in Lund]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">'''Synergetics coordinates''' is Clifford Nelson's attempt to describe, from another mathematical point of view, [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s '60 degree coordinate system' for understanding nature.  [[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]] is the word Fuller used to label his approach to [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;
Clifford Nelson, [http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/600/ Buckminster Fuller Notebooks]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric definition==
A [[Theory of forms|system]] of synergetics [[coordinates]] uses only one type of [[simplex]] ([[triangle]], [[tetrahedron]], [[pentachoron]], ..., n-simplex) as [[space]] units, and in fact uses a [[regular simplex]], rather like [[Cartesian coordinates]] use [[hypercubes]] ([[Square (geometry)|square]], [[cube]], [[tesseract]], ..., n-cube.)

[[Image:Synergetics coordinate plane.jpg|right|thumb|Synergetics coordinates in two dimensions]]

The n Synergetics coordinates axes are perpendicular to the n defining geometric objects that define a regular simplex; 2 end points for line segments, 3 lines for triangles, 4 planes for tetrahedrons etc.. The angles between the directions of the coordinate axes are Arc Cosine (-1/(n-1)). The coordinates can be positive or negative or zero and so can their sum. The sum of the n coordinates is the edge length of the regular simplex defined by moving the n  geometric objects in increments of the height of the n-1 dimensional regular simplex that has an edge length of one. If the sum of the n coordinates is negative the triangle (n = 3) or tetrahedron (n = 4) is upside down and inside out.

==Algebraic examples==
Regular [[triangular coordinates]] are in a [[Lattice graph|grid]] of [[equilateral]] triangles and are of the form &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are equal to or greater than 0.

Regular tetrahedral coordinates are in a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]] 'grid' of equilateral tetrahedra and are of the form &lt;math&gt;(w,x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are equal to or greater than 0.

In [[geometry]], the '''tangent line''' (or simply '''tangent''') to a plane [[curve]] at a given [[Point (geometry)|point]] is the [[straight line]] that "just touches" the curve at that point. [[Leibniz]] defined it as the line through a pair of [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] points on the curve.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G., "[[Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis]]", ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'', Oct. 1684.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''f'' (''x'')}} at a point {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''c''}} on the curve if the line passes through the point {{nowrap|(''c'', ''f'' (''c''))}} on the curve and has slope {{nowrap|''f'' {{'}}(''c'')}} where ''f'' {{'}} is the [[derivative]] of ''f''. A similar definition applies to [[space curve]]s and curves in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

As it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the '''point of tangency''', the tangent line is "going in the same direction" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.

Similarly, the '''tangent plane''' to a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] at a given point is the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] that "just touches" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in [[differential geometry]] and has been extensively generalized; see [[Tangent space]].

The word "tangent" comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:tangere#Latin|tangere]]'', 'to touch'.

==History==

[[Euclid]] makes several references to the tangent ({{lang|grc|ἐφαπτομένη}} ''ephaptoménē'') to a circle in book III of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''  (c. 300 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Euclid|title=Euclid's Elements|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookIII/bookIII.html|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] work ''Conics'' (c. 225 BC) he defines a tangent as being ''a line such that no other straight line could
fall between it and the curve''.&lt;ref name="Shenk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shenk|first1=Al|title=e-CALCULUS Section  2.8|url=http://math.ucsd.edu/~ashenk/Section2_8.pdf|pages=2.8|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archimedes]] (c.  287 – c.  212 BC) found the tangent to an [[Archimedean spiral]] by considering the path of a point moving along the curve.&lt;ref name="Shenk"/&gt;

In the 1630s [[Fermat]] developed the technique of [[adequality]] to calculate tangents and other problems in analysis and used this to calculate tangents to the parabola. The technique of adeqality is similar to taking the difference between &lt;math&gt;f(x+h)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and dividing by a power of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. Independently [[Descartes]] used his [[method of normals]] based on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|year=2008|title=A History of Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0321387004|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These methods led to the development of [[differential calculus]] in the [[17th century]]. Many people contributed. [[Gilles de Roberval|Roberval]] discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfson|first=Paul R.|year=2001|title=The Crooked Made Straight: Roberval and Newton on Tangents| journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=108 | number=3 | pages=206–216 | doi=10.2307/2695381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[René-François de Sluse]] and [[Johannes Hudde]] found algebraic algorithms for finding tangents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|year=2008|title=A History of Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0321387004|pages=512–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further developments included those of [[John Wallis]] and [[Isaac Barrow]], leading to the theory of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].
 
An 1828 definition of a tangent was "a right line which touches a curve, but which when produced, does not cut it".&lt;ref&gt;Noah Webster, ''American Dictionary of the English Language'' (New York: S. Converse, 1828), vol. 2, p. 733, [https://archive.org/stream/americandictiona02websrich#page/n733/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; This old definition prevents [[inflection point]]s from having any tangent. It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] who defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] points on the curve.

==Tangent line to a curve==
[[Image:CIRCLE LINES.svg|thumb|220px|A tangent, a [[chord (geometry)|chord]], and a [[secant line|secant]] to a circle]]
The intuitive notion that a tangent line "touches" a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines ([[secant line]]s) passing through two points, ''A'' and ''B'', those that lie on the function curve. The tangent at ''A'' is the limit when point ''B'' approximates or tends to ''A''. The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness, known as "differentiability." For example, if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point (a vertex) then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which "point ''B''" approaches the vertex.

At most points, the tangent touches the curve without crossing it (though it may, when continued, cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent). A point where the tangent (at this point) crosses the curve is called an ''[[inflection point]]''. [[Circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[hyperbola]]s and [[ellipse]]s do not have any inflection point, but more complicated curves do have, like the graph of a [[cubic function]], which has exactly one inflection point, or a sinusoid, which has two inflection points per each [[Periodic function|period]] of the [[sine]].

Conversely, it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it, and yet this straight line is not a tangent line. This is the case, for example, for a line passing through the vertex of a [[triangle]] and not intersecting it otherwise—where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above. In [[convex geometry]], such lines are called [[supporting hyperplane|supporting lines]].

[[Image:Graph of sliding derivative line.gif|left|thumb|400px|At each point, the moving line is always tangent to the [[curve]]. Its slope is the [[derivative]]; green marks positive derivative, red marks negative derivative and black marks zero derivative. The point (x,y) = (0,1) where the tangent intersects the curve, is not a [[Maxima and minima|max]], or a min, but is a [[point of inflection]].]]

===Analytical approach===
The geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly. The question of finding the tangent line to a graph, or the '''tangent line problem,''' was one of the central questions leading to the development of [[calculus]] in the 17th century. In the second book of his ''[[La Geometrie|Geometry]]'', [[René Descartes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Courier [http://store.doverpublications.com/0486600688.html Dover] |isbn=0-486-60068-8 |pages=95 |last=Descartes |first=René |title=The geometry of René Descartes |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:fr:Page:Descartes La Géométrie.djvu/52|said]] of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve, "And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. E. Langer |date=October 1937 |title=Rene Descartes |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=495–512 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |doi=10.2307/2301226 |jstor=2301226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intuitive description====
Suppose that a curve is given as the graph of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''y'' = ''f''(''x''). To find the tangent line at the point ''p'' = (''a'', ''f''(''a'')), consider another nearby point ''q'' = (''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h'')) on the curve. The [[slope]] of the [[secant line]] passing through ''p'' and ''q'' is equal to the [[difference quotient]]

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

As the point ''q'' approaches ''p'', which corresponds to making ''h'' smaller and smaller, the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value ''k'', which is the slope of the tangent line at the point ''p''. If ''k'' is known, the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point-slope form:

: &lt;math&gt; y-f(a) = k(x-a).\,&lt;/math&gt;

====More rigorous description====
To make the preceding reasoning rigorous, one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value ''k''. The precise mathematical formulation was given by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] in the 19th century and is based on the notion of [[limit of a function|limit]]. Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at ''p'' and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near ''p''. Then there is a unique value of ''k'' such that, as ''h'' approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to ''k'', and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of ''h'', if ''h'' is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function ''f''. This limit is the [[Derivative#Definition via difference quotients|derivative]] of the function ''f'' at ''x'' = ''a'', denoted ''f''&amp;nbsp;′(''a''). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Calculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas, such as the [[power function]], [[trigonometric functions]], [[exponential function]], [[logarithm]], and their  various combinations. Thus, equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions, as well as many others, can be found by the methods of calculus.

====How the method can fail====
Calculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist. For these points the function ''f'' is ''non-differentiable''. There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail: either the geometric tangent exists, but it is a vertical line, which cannot be given in the point-slope form since it does not have a slope, or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent.

The graph ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; illustrates the first possibility:  here the difference quotient at ''a'' = 0 is equal to ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;/''h'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−2/3&lt;/sup&gt;, which becomes very large as ''h'' approaches 0. This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical.

The graph ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; illustrates another possibility: this graph has a ''[[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]]'' at the origin. This means that, when ''h'' approaches 0, the difference quotient at ''a'' = 0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of ''x''. Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which ''y''=0, but none is near to the negative part of this line. Basically, there is no tangent at the origin in this case, but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent, and even, in [[algebraic geometry]], as a ''double tangent''.

The graph ''y'' = |''x''| of the [[absolute value]] function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin. As a point ''q'' approaches the origin from the right, the secant line always has slope 1. As a point ''q'' approaches the origin from the left, the secant line always has slope −1. Therefore, there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin. Having two different (but finite) slopes is called a ''corner''.

Finally, since differentiability implies continuity, the [[Contraposition|contrapositive]] states ''discontinuity'' implies non-differentiability. Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line. This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity, leading to an infinite jump discontinuity

===Equations===
When the curve is given by ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') then the slope of the tangent is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx},&lt;/math&gt;
so by the [[Linear equation#Point–slope form|point–slope formula]] the equation of the tangent line at (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is
:&lt;math&gt;y-Y=\frac{dy}{dx}(X) \cdot (x-X)&lt;/math&gt;
where (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line, and where the derivative is evaluated at &lt;math&gt;x=X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=E191&gt;Edwards Art. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curve is given by ''y'' = ''f''(''x''), the tangent line's equation can also be found&lt;ref&gt;Strickland-Constable, Charles, "A simple method for finding tangents to polynomial graphs", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'', November 2005, 466–467.&lt;/ref&gt; by using [[polynomial division]] to divide &lt;math&gt;f \, (x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(x-X)^2&lt;/math&gt;; if the remainder is denoted by &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the equation of the tangent line is given by

:&lt;math&gt;y=g(x).&lt;/math&gt;

When the equation of the curve is given in the form  ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = 0 then the value of the slope can be found by [[Implicit and explicit functions#Implicit differentiation|implicit differentiation]], giving
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of the tangent line at a point (''X'',''Y'') such that ''f''(''X'',''Y'') = 0 is then&lt;ref name=E191/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(X,Y) \cdot (x-X)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(X,Y) \cdot (y-Y)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
This equation remains true if &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(X,Y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(X,Y) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (in this case the slope of the tangent is infinite). If &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(X,Y) =  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(X,Y)  =0, &lt;/math&gt; the tangent line is not defined and the point (''X'',''Y'') is said [[singular point of a curve|singular]].

{{clear}}
For [[algebraic curve]]s, computations may be simplified somewhat by converting to [[homogeneous coordinate]]s. Specifically, let the homogeneous equation of the curve be ''g''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') = 0 where ''g'' is a homogeneous function of degree ''n''. Then, if (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'',&amp;nbsp;''Z'') lies on the curve, [[Homogeneous function#Positive homogeneity|Euler's theorem]] implies
&lt;math display=block&gt;\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \cdot X +\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \cdot Y+\frac{\partial g}{\partial z} \cdot Z=ng(X, Y, Z)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the homogeneous equation of the tangent line is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(X,Y,Z) \cdot x+\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(X,Y,Z) \cdot y+\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}(X,Y,Z) \cdot z=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of the tangent line in Cartesian coordinates can be found by setting ''z''=1 in this equation.&lt;ref name=E192&gt;Edwards Art. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

To apply this to algebraic curves, write ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') as
:&lt;math&gt;f=u_n+u_{n-1}+\dots+u_1+u_0\,&lt;/math&gt;
where each ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of all terms of degree ''r''. The homogeneous equation of the curve is then
:&lt;math&gt;g=u_n+u_{n-1}z+\dots+u_1 z^{n-1}+u_0 z^n=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the equation above and setting ''z''=1 produces
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(X,Y) \cdot x + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(X,Y) \cdot y + \frac{\partial g}{\partial z}(X,Y,1) =0&lt;/math&gt;
as the equation of the tangent line.&lt;ref name=E193&gt;Edwards Art. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The equation in this form is often simpler to use in practice since no further simplification is needed after it is applied.&lt;ref name=E192 /&gt;

If the curve is given [[Parametric equation|parametrically]] by
:&lt;math&gt;x=x(t),\quad y=y(t)&lt;/math&gt;
then the slope of the tangent is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}&lt;/math&gt;
giving the equation for the tangent line at &lt;math&gt;\, t=T, \, X=x(T), \, Y=y(T)&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref name=E196&gt;Edwards Art. 196&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(T) \cdot (y-Y)=\frac{dy}{dt}(T) \cdot (x-X).&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(T)= \frac{dy}{dt}(T) =0, &lt;/math&gt; the tangent line is not defined. However, it may occur that the tangent line exists and may be computed from an implicit equation of the curve.

===Normal line to a curve===
The line perpendicular to the tangent line to a curve at the point of tangency is called the ''normal line'' to the curve at that point. The slopes of perpendicular lines have product −1, so if the equation of the curve is ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') then slope of the normal line is
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}}&lt;/math&gt;
and it follows that the equation of the normal line at (X, Y) is
:&lt;math&gt;(x-X)+\frac{dy}{dx}(y-Y)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, if the equation of the curve has the form ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = 0 then the equation of the normal line is given by&lt;ref name=E194&gt;Edwards Art. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x-X)-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(y-Y)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the curve is given parametrically by
:&lt;math&gt;x=x(t),\quad y=y(t)&lt;/math&gt;
then the equation of the normal line is&lt;ref name=E196 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(x-X)+\frac{dy}{dt}(y-Y)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Angle between curves===
{{see also|Angle#Angle between curves}}
The angle between two curves at a point where they intersect is defined as the angle between their tangent lines at that point. More specifically, two curves are said to be tangent at a point if they have the same tangent at a point, and orthogonal if their tangent lines are orthogonal.&lt;ref name=E195&gt;Edwards Art. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple tangents at a point===
[[Image:LimaçonTrisectrix.svg|right|thumb|300px|The limaçon trisectrix: a curve with two tangents at the origin.]]
The formulas above fail when the point is a [[Singular point of a curve|singular point]]. In this case there may be two or more branches of the curve that pass through the point, each branch having its own tangent line. When the point is the origin, the equations of these lines can be found for algebraic curves by factoring the equation formed by eliminating all but the lowest degree terms from the original equation. Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables, this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point.

For example, the equation of the [[limaçon trisectrix]] shown to the right is
:&lt;math&gt;(x^2+y^2-2ax)^2=a^2(x^2+y^2).\,&lt;/math&gt;
Expanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives
:&lt;math&gt;a^2(3x^2-y^2)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
which, when factored, becomes
:&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\sqrt{3}x.&lt;/math&gt;
So these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin.&lt;ref name=E197&gt;Edwards Art. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curve is not self-crossing, the tangent at a reference point may still not be uniquely defined because the curve is not differentiable at that point although it is differentiable elsewhere. In this case the [[left and right derivative]]s are defined as the limits of the derivative as the point at which it is evaluated approaches the reference point from respectively the left (lower values) or the right (higher values). For example, the curve ''y'' = |''x'' | is not differentiable at ''x'' = 0: its left and right derivatives have respective slopes –1 and 1; the tangents at that point with those slopes are called the left and right tangents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, George B. Jr., and Finney, Ross L. (1979), ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley Publ. Co.: p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the slopes of the left and right tangent lines are equal, so the tangent lines coincide. This is true, for example, for the curve ''y'' = ''x'' &lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;, for which both the left and right derivatives at ''x'' = 0 are infinite; both the left and right tangent lines have equation ''x'' = 0.

==Tangent circles==

[[File:Tangent circles.svg|thumb|200px|Two pairs of tangent circles. Above internally and below externally tangent]]Two circles of non-equal radius, both in the same plane, are said to be tangent to each other if they meet at only one point. Equivalently, two [[circles]], with [[radii]] of ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and centers at (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2 are said to be tangent to each other if

==Surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds==
{{Main|Tangent space}}

The ''tangent plane'' to a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] at a given point ''p'' is defined in an analogous way to the tangent line in the case of curves. It is the best approximation of the surface by a plane at ''p'', and can be obtained as the limiting position of the planes passing through 3 distinct points on the surface close to ''p'' as these points converge to ''p''. More generally, there is a ''k''-dimensional [[tangent space]] at each point of a ''k''-dimensional [[manifold]] in the ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

In [[graph theory]], the '''tree-depth''' of a [[connected graph|connected]] [[undirected graph]] ''G'' is a numerical [[graph invariant|invariant]] of ''G'', the minimum height of a [[Trémaux tree]] for a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|supergraph]] of ''G''. This invariant and its close relatives have gone under many different names in the literature, including vertex ranking number, ordered chromatic number, and minimum elimination tree height; it is also closely related to the [[cycle rank]] of [[directed graph]]s and the [[star height]] of [[regular language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|Deogun|Jansen|Kloks|1998}}; {{harvtxt|Rossman|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intuitively, where the [[treewidth]] graph width parameter measures how far a graph is from being a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]], this parameter measures how far a graph is from being a [[Star (graph theory)|star]].

==Definitions==
The tree-depth of a graph ''G'' may be defined as the minimum height of a [[forest (graph theory)|forest]] ''F'' with the property that every edge of ''G'' connects a pair of nodes that have an ancestor-descendant relationship to each other in ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Definition 6.1, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''G'' is connected, this forest must be a single tree; it need not be a subgraph of ''G'', but if it is, it is a [[Trémaux tree]] for ''G''.

The set of ancestor-descendant pairs in ''F'' forms a [[trivially perfect graph]], and the height of ''F'' is the size of the largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in this graph. Thus, the tree-depth may alternatively be defined as the size of the largest clique in a trivially perfect supergraph of ''G'', mirroring the definition of [[treewidth]] as one less than the size of the largest clique in a [[chordal graph|chordal]] supergraph of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Strangely this seems to be the earliest reference I can find. Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez "On Low Tree-Depth Decompositions" 2014 mention this fact but are unusable as a source because they credit it to Wikipedia. It is also mentioned in two papers from 2013, Bannister et al "Parametrized complexity of 1-planarity" and Fomin et al "Computing tree-depth faster than 2^n". DE 2015-10-06. --&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Eppstein |authorlink=David Eppstein |url=https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/11/15/graph-parameters-and.html |title=Graph parameters and cliques in supergraphs |date=November 15, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition is the following:

&lt;math&gt;td(G)=\begin{cases}1, &amp; \text{if }|G|=1;\\
1+\min_{v\in V} td(G-v), &amp; \text{if }G\text{ is connected and }|G|&gt;1;\\
\max_{i} td(G_i), &amp;\text{otherwise};
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the set of vertices of ''G'' and the &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; are the connected components of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Lemma 6.1, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition mirrors the definition of [[cycle rank]] of directed graphs, which uses strong connectivity and strongly connected components in place of undirected connectivity and connected components.

Tree-depth may also be defined using a form of [[graph coloring]]. A '''centered coloring''' of a graph is a coloring of its vertices with the property that every connected [[induced subgraph]] has a color that appears exactly once. Then, the tree-depth is the minimum number of colors in a centered coloring of the given graph. If ''F'' is a forest of height ''d'' with the property that every edge of ''G'' connects an ancestor and a descendant in the tree, then a centered coloring of ''G'' using ''d'' colors may be obtained by coloring each vertex by its distance from the root of its tree in ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Section 6.5, "Centered Colorings", pp. 125–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, one can define this in terms of a [[pebble game]], or more precisely as a [[Pursuit-evasion|cops and robber]] game.  Consider the following game, played on an undirected graph.  There are two players, a robber and a cop.  The robber has one pebble he can move along the edges of the given graph.  The cop has an unlimited number of pebbles, but she wants to minimize the amount of pebbles she uses.  The cop cannot move a pebble after it has been placed on the graph.  The game proceeds as follows.  The robber places his pebble.  The cop then announces where she wants to place a new cop pebble.  The robber can then move his pebble along edges, but not through occupied vertices.  The game is over when the cop player places a pebble on top of the robber pebble.  The tree-depth of the given graph is the minimum number of pebbles needed by the cop to guarantee a win.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}, Theorem 5, {{harvtxt|Hunter|2011}}, Main Theorem.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a [[Star (graph theory)|star graph]], two pebbles suffice: the strategy is to place a pebble at the center vertex, forcing the robber to one arm, and then to place the remaining pebble on the robber.  For a [[path graph|path]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, the cop uses a [[binary search]] strategy, which guarantees that at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2(n+1)\rceil&lt;/math&gt; pebbles are needed.

==Examples==
[[File:Tree-depth.svg|thumb|upright=1.66|The tree-depths of the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; are both four, while the tree-depth of the [[path graph]] ''P''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is three.]]
The tree-depth of a [[complete graph]] equals its number of vertices. For, in this case, the only possible forest ''F'' for which every pair of vertices are in an ancestor-descendant relationship is a single path. Similarly, the tree-depth of a [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''x'',''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is min(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. For, the nodes that are placed at the leaves of the forest ''F'' must have at least min(''x'',''y'') ancestors in ''F''. A forest achieving this min(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 bound may be constructed by forming a path for the smaller side of the bipartition, with each vertex on the larger side of the bipartition forming a leaf in ''F'' connected to the bottom vertex of this path.

The tree-depth of a path with ''n'' vertices is exactly &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2(n+1)\rceil&lt;/math&gt;. A forest ''F'' representing this path with this depth may be formed by placing the midpoint of the path as the root of ''F'' and recursing within the two smaller paths on either side of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Formula 6.2, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth of trees and relation to treewidth==
Any ''n''-vertex [[tree (graph theory)|forest]] has tree-depth O(log&amp;nbsp;''n'').  For, in a forest, one can always find a constant number of vertices the removal of which leaves a forest that can be partitioned into two smaller subforests with at most 2''n''/3 vertices each.  By recursively partitioning each of these two subforests, we can easily derive a logarithmic upper bound on the tree-depth.  The same technique, applied to a [[tree decomposition]] of a graph, shows that, if the [[treewidth]] of an ''n''-vertex graph ''G'' is ''t'', then the tree-depth of ''G'' is O(''t''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|Gilbert|Hafsteinsson|Kloks|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Corollary 6.1, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since [[outerplanar graph]]s, [[series-parallel graph]]s, and [[Halin graph]]s all have bounded treewidth, they all also have at most logarithmic tree-depth.

In the other direction, the treewidth of a graph is at most equal to its tree-depth. More precisely, the treewidth is at most the [[pathwidth]], which is at most one less than the tree-depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|Gilbert|Hafsteinsson|Kloks|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graph minors==
A [[minor (graph theory)|minor]] of a graph ''G'' is another graph formed from a subgraph of ''G'' by contracting some of its edges. Tree-depth is monotonic under minors: every minor of a graph ''G'' has tree-depth at most equal to the tree-depth of ''G'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Lemma 6.2, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], for every fixed ''d'' the set of graphs with tree-depth at most ''d'' has a finite set of [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]].

If ''C'' is a class of graphs closed under taking graph minors, then the graphs in ''C'' have tree-depth &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''C'' does not include all the [[path graph]]s.&lt;ref name="no12-prop64"&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Proposition 6.4, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Induced subgraphs==
As well as behaving well under graph minors, tree-depth has close connections to the theory of [[induced subgraph]]s of a graph. Within the class of graphs that have tree-depth at most ''d'' (for any fixed integer ''d''), the relation of being an induced subgraph forms a [[well-quasi-ordering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Lemma 6.13, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea of the proof that this relation is a well-quasi-ordering is to use induction on ''d''; the forests of height ''d'' may be interpreted as sequences of forests of height ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (formed by deleting the roots of the trees in the height-''d'' forest) and [[Higman's lemma]] can be used together with the induction hypothesis to show that these sequences are well-quasi-ordered.

Well-quasi-ordering implies that any property of graphs that is monotonic with respect to induced subgraphs has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, and therefore may be tested in polynomial time on graphs of bounded tree-depth. The graphs with tree-depth at most ''d'' themselves also have a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, p. 138. Figure 6.6 on p. 139 shows the 14 forbidden subgraphs for graphs of tree-depth at most three, credited to the 2007 Ph.D. thesis of [[Zdeněk Dvořák]].&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''C'' is a class of graphs with bounded [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]], the graphs in ''C'' have bounded tree-depth if and only if there is a path graph that cannot occur as an induced subgraph of a graph in ''C''.&lt;ref name="no12-prop64"/&gt;

==Complexity==
Computing tree-depth is computationally hard: the corresponding decision problem is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="p88"&gt;{{harvtxt|Pothen|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem remains NP-complete for [[bipartite graph]]s {{harv|Bodlaender|Deogun|Jansen|Kloks|1998}}, as well as for [[chordal graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dereniowski|Nadolski|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the positive side, tree-depth can be computed in [[polynomial time]] on interval graphs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Aspvall|Heggernes|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on permutation, trapezoid, circular-arc, circular permutation graphs, and cocomparability graphs of bounded dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Deogun|Kloks|Kratsch|Müller|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For undirected trees, tree-depth can be computed in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Iyer|Ratliff|Vijayan|1988}}; {{harvtxt|Schäffer|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|Gilbert|Hafsteinsson|Kloks|1995}} give an [[approximation algorithm]] for tree-depth with an approximation ratio of &lt;math&gt;O((\log n)^2)&lt;/math&gt;, based on the fact that tree-depth is always within a logarithmic factor of the treewidth of a graph.

Because tree-depth is monotonic under graph minors, it is [[Parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]]: there is an algorithm for computing tree-depth running in time is &lt;math&gt;f(d) n^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''d'' is the depth of the given graph and ''n'' is its number of vertices. Thus, for every fixed value of ''d'', the problem of testing whether the tree-depth is at most ''d'' can be solved in [[polynomial time]]. More specifically, the dependence on ''n'' in this algorithm can be made linear, by the following method: compute a depth first search tree, and test whether this tree's depth is greater than 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. If so, the tree-depth of the graph is greater than ''d'' and the problem is solved. If not, the shallow depth first search tree can be used to construct a [[tree decomposition]] with bounded width, and standard [[dynamic programming]] techniques for graphs of bounded treewidth can be used to compute the depth in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, p. 138. A more complicated linear time algorithm based on the planarity of the excluded minors for tree-depth was given earlier by {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|Deogun|Jansen|Kloks|1998}}. For improved parameterized algorithms see {{harvtxt|Reidl|Rossmanith|Sánchez Villaamil|Sikdar|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to compute the tree-depth exactly, for graphs whose tree-depth may be large, in time ''O''(''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) for a constant ''c'' slightly smaller than&amp;nbsp;2.{{sfnp|Fomin|Giannopoulou|Pilipczuk|2013}}

Hopcroft]] and Jean-Jacques Pansiot in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopcroft|first1=John E.|last2=Pansiot|first2=Jean-Jacques|title=On the reachability problem for 5-dimensional vector addition systems|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|date=1979|volume=8|issue=2|pages=135–159|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both VAS and VASS are equivalent in many ways to [[Petri net]]s introduced earlier by [[Carl Adam Petri]]. [[File:Vector addition with states.svg|thumb|Example of a vector addition with states. In this VASS, e.g., q(1,2) can be reached from p(0,0), but q(0,0) cannot be reached from p(0,0).]]

== Informal definition ==

A ''vector addition system'' consists of a finite set of [[integer]] [[row vector|vectors]]. An initial vector is seen as the initial values of multiple counters, and the vectors of the VAS are seen as updates. These counters may never drop below zero. More precisely, given an initial vector with non negative values, the vectors of the VAS can be added componentwise, given that every intermediate vector has non negative values. A ''vector addition system with states'' is a VAS equipped with control states. More precisely, it  is a finite [[directed graph]] with [[Directed graph#Basic terminology|arcs]] labelled by [[integer]] vectors. VASS have the same restriction that the counter values should never drop below zero.

== Formal definitions and basic terminology ==

* A ''VAS'' is a finite set &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A ''VASS'' is a finite [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq Q \times \mathbb{Z}^d \times Q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Transitions ===

* Let &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; be a VAS. Given a vector &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the vector &lt;math&gt;u + v&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; be a VASS. Given a ''configuration'' &lt;math&gt;(p, u) \in Q \times \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the configuration &lt;math&gt;(q, u + v)&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;(p, v, q) \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

B. Vincent (1912),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The function of the viborissae in the behavior of the white rat |last1=Vincent |last2=Burnham |first1=Stella |publisher=Behavior Monographs|volume=1 |date=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used something very similar to it for constructing [[learning curve]]s at the beginning of the 1900s. It basically consists of averaging ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 subjects' estimated or elicited [[quantile function]]s in order to define group quantiles from which ''F'' can be constructed.

To cast it in its greatest generality, let ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represent arbitrary (empirical or theoretical) [[Cumulative distribution function|distribution function]]s and define their corresponding quantile functions by

: &lt;math&gt; F_i^{-1}(\alpha) = \inf\{t\in \mathbb{R} : F_i(t)\ge\alpha) \},\quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;

The Vincent average of the ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s is then computed as

: &lt;math&gt; F^{-1}(\alpha) = \sum \mathbb{E} w_i F_i^{-1}(\alpha),\quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1,\quad i = 1,\ldots,n &lt;/math&gt;

where the non-negative numbers ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; have a sum of&amp;nbsp;1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1619">The '''σ-algebra of τ-past''', (also named '''stopped σ-algebra''', '''stopped σ-field''', or '''σ-field of τ-past''') is a [[σ-algebra]] associated with a [[stopping time]] in the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a branch of [[probability theory]].&lt;ref name="rajeeva47"/&gt;&lt;ref name="klenke193"/&gt;
== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; be a [[stopping time]] on the [[filtered probability space]] &lt;math&gt; (\Omega, \mathcal A, (\mathcal F_t)_{t \in T},  P ) &lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[σ-algebra]]
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal F_\tau:= \{ A \in \mathcal A \mid  \{ \tau \leq t \} \cap A \in \mathcal F_t \text{ for all } t \in T \} &lt;/math&gt;

is called the σ-algebra of τ-past.&lt;ref name="rajeeva47"/&gt;&lt;ref name="klenke193"/&gt;

== Properties ==
=== Monotonicity ===
Is &lt;math&gt; \sigma, \tau &lt;/math&gt; are two stopping times and
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma \leq \tau &lt;/math&gt;
almost surely, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal F_\tau \subset \mathcal F_\sigma. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Measurability ===
A stopping time &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is always &lt;math&gt; \mathcal F_\tau&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable function|measurable]]
