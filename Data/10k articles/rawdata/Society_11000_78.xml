      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26420">'''Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States''' has existed since the late 19th century, during the [[Yellow Peril]]. [[Anti-Japanese sentiment]] peaked during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and again in the 1970s-1980s with the rise of Japan as [[Japanese economic miracle|a major economic power]].

==Origins==
{{Main article|Yellow Peril}}
In the [[United States]], anti-Japanese sentiment had its beginnings well before World War II. Racial prejudice against Asian immigrants began building soon after Chinese workers started arriving in the country in the mid-19th century, and set the tone for the resistance Japanese would face in the decades to come. Although Chinese were heavily recruited in the mining and railroad industries initially, whites in Western states and territories came to view the immigrants as a source of economic competition and a threat to racial "purity" as their population increased. A network of anti-Chinese groups (many of which would reemerge in the anti-Japanese movement) worked to pass laws that limited Asian immigrants' access to legal and economic equality with whites. Most important of these discriminatory laws was the exclusion of Asians from citizenship rights. The [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] revised the previous law, under which only white immigrants could become U.S. citizens, to extend eligibility to people of African descent. By designating Asians as permanent aliens, the law prohibited them from voting and serving on juries, which, combined with laws that prevented people of color from [[People v. Hall|testifying against whites]] in court, made it virtually impossible for Asian Americans to participate in the country's legal and political systems. Also significant were [[alien land laws]], which relied on coded language barring "aliens ineligible for citizenship" from owning land or real estate, and in some cases from even entering into a temporary lease, to discourage Asian immigrants from establishing homes and businesses in over a dozen states.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Cherstin M. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Alien%20land%20laws/ "Alien land laws,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers.

After the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 stopped immigration from China, American labor recruiters began targeting Japanese workers, triggering a [[Japanese Americans#Immigration|rapid increase in the country's Japanese population]], which in turn triggered the movement to decrease their number and restrict their economic and political power.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, Emily. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Anti-Japanese%20exclusion%20movement/ "Anti-Japanese exclusion movement,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cite the formation of the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California, where, along with the Japanese American population, the exclusion movement was centered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===California===
With its anti-Japanese organizations, state authorities and legislation, California may have been to the Japanese what the South was to blacks.

====Anti-Japanese organizations====
*California Farm Bureau
*California Joint Immigration Committee
*California State Grange
*Committee of One Thousand
*Japanese Exclusion League of California
*Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West

====The Alien Land Law====
The [[California Alien Land Law of 1913]] was specifically created to prevent land ownership among Japanese citizens residing in the state of California.

In ''State of California v. Jukichi Harada'' (1918), Judge Hugh H. Craig&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLS url|id=77000325}}&lt;/ref&gt; sided with the defendant and ruled that American children - who happened to be born to Japanese parents - had the right to own land.

In 1942, with the Japanese incarcerated in ten American concentration camps, California Attorney General [[Earl Warren]] saw his chance and approved the state takeover of twenty parcels of land held in the name of American children of Japanese parents, ''in absentia''. In 1943, Governor Warren signed a bill that expanded the Alien Land Law by denying the Japanese the opportunity to farm [[Japanese-American life before World War II|as they had before World War II]]. In 1945, he followed up by signing two bills that facilitated the seizure of land owned by American descendants of the Japanese.

In ''State of California v. Oyama'' (1948),&lt;ref&gt;S''tate of California v. Oyama'', 332 U.S. 633 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that California's Alien Land Law was anti-Japanese in concept, and deemed unfit to stand in America's law books. Justices Murphy and Rutledge wrote:

{{quote|This measure, though limited to agricultural lands, represented the first official act of discrimination aimed at the Japanese. . . The immediate purpose, of course, was to restrict Japanese farm competition.}}
{{quote|The more basic purpose of the statute was to irritate the Japanese, to make economic life in California as uncomfortable and unprofitable for them as legally possible.}}
{{quote|Vigorous enforcement of the Alien Land Law has been but one of the cruel discriminatory actions which have marked this nation's treatment since 1941 of those residents who chanced to be of Japanese origin.}}
{{quote|Can a state disregard in this manner the historic ideal that those within the borders of this nation are not to be denied rights and privileges because they are of a particular race? I say that it cannot.}}

It took four years for California's Supreme Court to concede that the law was unconstitutional, in ''State of California v. Fujii'' (1952). Finally, in 1956, California voters repealed the law.

==Early 20th century==
[[File:San Francisco Chinatown Welcome.jpg|thumb|300px|Young China Club warning to American visitors against buying Japanese goods in San Francisco's Chinatown circa 1940]]

Anti-Japanese racism and [[Yellow Peril]] in California had become increasingly xenophobic after the Japanese victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. On October 11, 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education had passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially segregated separate schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California; many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.

The Japanese [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of China in 1931]] and the annexation of [[Manchuria]] was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]], led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China; these calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, out of concern for the Chinese populace and for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the European American population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies. European traders sought access to Chinese markets and resources. Chinese Americans were again distressed when an estimated 150,000 [[Taishanese people|Taishanese]] locals died after starving to death in [[Taishan County]] by the Japanese blockade, as Taishan County was the homeland of most Chinese Americans at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ZAfjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=150,000+killed+taishan&amp;dq=150,000+killed+taishan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeyLeS8uvaAhVHMI8KHWMLALcQ6AEIJDAA]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Such a major starvation should be mentioned in Wikipedia or an online freely available resource.|date=October 2018}}

When the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. [[African Americans#Reconstruction Era and Jim Crow|African American sentiments at the time]] could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the [[Pacific Movement of the Eastern World]] (PMEW) which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].

==World War II==

The most profound cause of anti-Japanese sentiment outside of Asia had its beginning in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese attack propelled the United States into World War II. The Americans were unified by the attack to fight against the [[Empire of Japan]] and [[Axis powers|its allies]], the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

The surprise attack at Pearl Harbor prior to a [[declaration of war]] was presented to the American populace as an act of treachery and cowardice. Following the attack many non-governmental "Jap hunting licenses" were circulated around the country. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published an article on how to distinguish a Japanese person from a Chinese person by the shape of the nose and the stature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese conduct during the war did little to quell anti-Japanese sentiment. Fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other [[POW|prisoners of war]]. Military-related outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries, the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[kamikaze]] attacks on Allied ships, and atrocities committed on [[Wake Island]] and elsewhere.

U.S. historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in U.S. POW compounds to two key factors: a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American "conviction that the Japanese were 'animals' or 'subhuman' and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs."&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p55&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reasoning is supported by [[Niall Ferguson]], who says that "Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians [sic] — as [[Untermensch]]en."&lt;ref&gt;Niall Fergusson, "Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat", ''War in History'', 2004, 11 (2): p.182&lt;/ref&gt; Weingartner believes this explains the fact that a mere 604 Japanese captives were alive in Allied POW camps by October 1944.&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p54 /&gt;
[[Ulrich A. Straus|Ulrich Straus]], a U.S. [[Japanology|Japanologist]], believes that front line troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were "not easily persuaded" to take or protect prisoners. They believed that Allied personnel who surrendered got "no mercy" from the Japanese.&lt;ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1dQwuiEU3UC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=%22japanese+pows%22+american+hands&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Jy7xIG7C1S&amp;sig=J2I027gBjV9cqjD7t3h1-FiQW3o#PPA116,M1 Ulrich Straus, ''The Anguish Of Surrender: Japanese POWs of World War II'' (excerpts)] (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-295-98336-3}}, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender, in order to make surprise attacks.&lt;ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/&gt; Therefore, according to Straus, "[s]enior officers opposed the taking of prisoners[,] on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks..."&lt;ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/&gt;

An estimated 112,000 to 120,000 Japanese migrants and [[Japanese American]]s from the West Coast were [[Japanese American internment|interned]] regardless of their attitude to the US or Japan. They were held for the duration of the war in the inner US. The large Japanese population of Hawaii was not massively relocated in spite of their proximity to vital military areas.

A December 1944 [[opinion poll]] found that 13% of the U.S. public were in favor of the [[Genocide|extermination]] of all Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagby|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yns2vRoMEDAC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=America%27s+International+Relations+Since+World+War+I+%22to+save+american+lives%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U1deHRH2SdMicPGsaSiSw6HUBVkPw 135]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Feraru | first1 = A.

===Jap hunts===
[[File:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|thumb|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. The man was later detained nonetheless. This [[Dorothea Lange]] photograph was taken in March 1942, just prior to the [[Japanese American internment]].]]
[[Imperial Japan]]'s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, plunged the United States into war and planted the notion of Japanese treachery in the minds of Americans. The hysteria that enveloped the West Coast during the early months of the war, combined with long standing anti-Asian prejudices, set the stage for what was to come.&lt;ref&gt;A More Perfect Union. 1990–2001. 15 Oct. 2007. &lt;http://americanhistory.si.edu/perfectunion/non-flash/removal_crisis.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Executive Order 9066]] authorized the military to exclude any person from any area of the country where national security was considered threatened. It gave the military broad authority over the civilian population without the imposition of [[martial law]]. Although the order did not mention any specific group or recommend detention, its language implied that any citizen might be removed. In practice, the order was applied almost exclusively to [[Japanese American]]s and Japanese nationals, with only few Italian and German Americans suffering similar fates. Ultimately, approximately 110,000 [[Japanese people|Japanese nationals]] and Japanese Americans were interned in housing facilities called "[[Japanese American internment|War Relocation Camps]]".&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/manz/ |title=Manzanar National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=nps.gov|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howmany&gt;Various primary and secondary sources list counts between 110,000 and 120,000 persons.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Pearl Harbor attacks, much anti-Japanese paraphernalia and propaganda surfaced in the United States. An example of this was the so-called "Jap hunting license", a faux-official document, button or medallion that purported to authorize "open season" on "hunting" the Japanese, despite the fact that over a quarter of a million Americans at that time were of Japanese origin. Some reminded holders that there was "no limit" on the number of "[[Jap]]s" they could "hunt or trap". These "licenses" often characterized Japanese people as sub-human. Many of the "Jap Hunting Licenses", for example, depicted the Japanese in animalistic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Jeremy. Open Season. 06 Mar. 2004. 15 Oct. 2007. &lt;{{cite web|url=http://clioweb.org/openseason/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928210613/http://clioweb.org/openseason/index.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmund Russell writes that, whereas in Europe Americans perceived themselves to be struggling against "great individual monsters", such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Joseph Goebbels]], Americans often saw themselves fighting against a "nameless mass of vermin", in regards to Japan.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=War and Nature: Fighting Humans and Insects with Chemicals from World War I to Silent Spring|author=Russell, E.|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521799379|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDW4YNkmvZYC|page=98|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell attributes this to the outrage of Americans in regards to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Bataan Death March, American politicians decrying the killing of American POWs in the hands of Imperial Japanese forces, and the perceived "inhuman tenacity" demonstrated in the refusal of Imperial forces to surrender. Kamikaze suicide bombings, according to John Morton Blum, were instrumental in confirming this stereotype of the "insane martial spirit" of Imperial Japan, and the bigoted picture it would engender of the Japanese people as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;John Morton Blum. ''V was for victory: politics and American culture during World War II'' page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand where the word "Jap" comes from a comparison to the "[[Nazism|Nazis]]" as it left space for the recognition of the "good German", but scant comparable place for "good Japanese". Magazines like ''Time'' hammered this home even further by frequently referring to "the Jap" rather than "Japs", thereby denying the enemy even the merest semblance of pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Dower, W. John. War without Mercy. New York: Pantheon Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops also employed rhetoric of "hunting", in regards to their doing battle with Imperial Japanese forces. According to T. R. Moreman, the demonization of the Japanese served "to improve morale, foster belief that the war in the Far East was worthwhile and build the moral component of fighting power". Training instruction issued by the headquarters of 5th Indian Division suggested, "The JAP is a fanatic and therefore a menace until he is dead!... It will be our fanatical aim to KILL JAPS. Hunt him and kill him like any other wild beast!"&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Moreman. ''The jungle, the Japanese and the British Commonwealth armies at war, 1941-45''. 2005, page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision to drop the atomic bombs===
{{See also|Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
Weingartner argues that there is a common cause between the mutilation of Japanese war dead and the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p55-56&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy, saying, "[T]he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands."&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p67&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day after the Nagasaki bomb, Truman stated: "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".&lt;ref name=Weingartner1992p54&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weingardner further attributes the Truman quote to Ronald Schaffer, {{Harvnb|Schaffer|1985|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since World War II==
In the 1970s and 1980s, the waning fortunes of heavy industry in the United States prompted layoffs and hiring slowdowns just as counterpart businesses in Japan were making major inroads into U.S. markets. Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the then-[[Malaise era|lethargic]] [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]] ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from [[Honda]], [[Toyota]] and [[Nissan]], a consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars, and in the 1982 [[murder of Vincent Chin]], a [[Chinese American]] beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.

Other highly symbolic deals—including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as [[Columbia Records]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and the [[Rockefeller Center]] building to Japanese firms—further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.

Popular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Futuristic period pieces such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author [[Michael Crichton]] took a break from science fiction to write [[Rising Sun (novel)|''Rising Sun'']], a [[murder mystery]] (later made into a [[Rising Sun (film)|feature film]]) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, in [[Tom Clancy]]'s book ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.

As argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia mixed with Japanophilia during Japan's peak moments of economic dominance during the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism,{{clarify|date=January 2015}} the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious "Japan bashing" took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, mimicking in some ways the image of the [[Soviet Union]] after it launched the first [[Sputnik]] satellite in 1957: both events turned the spotlight on American education. American bureaucrats purposely pushed this analogy. In 1982, [[Ernest Boyer]], a former U.S. Commissioner of Education, publicly declared that, "What we need is another Sputnik" to re-boot American education, and that "maybe what we should do is get the Japanese to put a Toyota into orbit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsten|first=Marie|title=Superhuman Japan|url=https://www.amazon.com/Superhuman-Japan-Knowledge-Relations-Contemporary/dp/0415414261/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388393830&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=superhuman+japan|publisher=[[Routledge]]|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was both a threat and a model for human resource development in education and the workforce, merging with the image of Asian-Americans as the "model minority".

Both the animosity and super-humanizing which peaked in the 1980s, when the term "Japan bashing" became popular, had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan's waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, known today as [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]], coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.

The '''Bauzi''' or '''Baudi''' tribe consists of a group of 2,000 people&lt;ref name="pg"/&gt; living in the north-central part of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] (formerly [[Irian Jaya]]).  The Bauzi area consists of much of the west side of lower [[Mamberamo River]] area in northern Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|title=Excerpta Indonesica, Issues 25-34|year=1982|publisher=Centre for Documentation of Modern Indonesia, Royal Institute of Linguistics and Anthropology|isbn=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bauzi people lived on hunting and gathering in the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C.

For the most part, tribal warfare is no longer a large part of Bauzi culture and all Bauzi people speak the same language.  In recent years, linguists have been studying the language and translating various literature, including the [[Bible]], into the [[Bauzi language]].

It is a legal passport of Bhutan that many Bhutanese Refugees surreptitiously took when they were forcefully deported from Bhutan, although passports and many legal documents of some Bhutanese refugees were taken by the Bhutanese government after the Bhutanese military forced the refugees to sign documents that stated 'willing departure'.]] 
'''Bhutanese refugees''' are [[Lhotshampa]]s ("southerners"), a group of [[Nepali language]]-speaking Bhutanese people, including the [[Kirati people|Kirat]], [[Tamang people|Tamang]], [[Magar people|Magar]], [[Bahun|Brahman]], [[Chhetri]] and [[Gurung people]]s. These [[refugee]]s registered in [[refugee camp]]s in eastern [[Nepal]] during the 1990s as Bhutanese citizens deported from Bhutan during the [[Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan|ethnic cleansing]] carried out by King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuk]] of [[Bhutan]]. As Nepal and Bhutan have yet to implement any agreement on repatriation, many Bhutanese refugees have since resettled to [[North America]], [[Oceania]] and [[Europe]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]. Many Lhotshampa also migrated to areas of [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]] in India independently of the UNHCR.

==Historical background==
{{further|Immigration in Bhutan}}
The earliest surviving records of Bhutan's history show that Tibetan influence already existed from the 6th century. King [[Songtsen Gampo]], who ruled [[Tibet]] from the years 627 to 649, was responsible for the construction of Bhutan's oldest surviving [[Buddhist temple]]s, the [[Kyichu Lhakhang]] in [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and the [[Jambay Lhakhang]] in [[Bumthang district|Bumthang]].&lt;ref name=USLCCS&gt;{{Country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Bhutan – Ethnic Groups |author=Worden, Robert L. |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement in Bhutan by people of Tibetan origin happened by this time.&lt;ref name=USLCCS/&gt;&lt;ref name=USLCCS1&gt;{{Country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Bhutan – Arrival of Buddhism |author=Worden, Robert L. |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reports of people of [[Nepal]]ese origin in Bhutan was around 1620, when [[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal]] commissioned a few [[Newar]] craftsmen from the Kathmandu valley in Nepal to make a silver stupa to contain the ashes of his father [[Tempa Nima]].&lt;ref name=Aris&gt;{{cite book|last=Aris |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Aris |title=Bhutan: The Early History of a Himalayan Kingdom |year=1979 |pages=344 |publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips |isbn=978-0-85668-199-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, people of Nepalese origin started to settle in uninhabited areas of southern Bhutan.&lt;ref name=Forgotten1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoice.org/bhutan/index1.php?id=3#2 |publisher=Bhutanese Refugees: The Story of a Forgotten People |title=Background and History: Settlement of the Southern Bhutanese |accessdate=2010-10-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010050607/http://www.photovoice.org/bhutan/index1.php?id=3#2 |archivedate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The south soon became the country's main supplier of food. Bhutanese of Nepalese origin, Lhotshampas, were flourishing along with the economy of Bhutan. By 1930, according to British colonial officials, much of the south was under cultivation by a population of Nepali origin that amounted to some 60,000 people.&lt;ref name=Forgotten1/&gt;

Settlement in Bhutan of a large number of people from Nepal happened in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;{{rp|162–165}} This settlement was encouraged by the [[Bhutan House]] in [[Kalimpong]] for the purpose of collecting taxes for the government. In the 1930s, the Bhutan House settled 5,000 families of Nepali workers in [[Tsirang]] alone. In the 1940s, the British Political Officer Sir [[Basil Gould]] was quoted as saying that when he warned Sir Raja [[Sonam Topgay Dorji]] of Bhutan House of the potential danger of allowing so many ethnic Nepalese to settle in southern Bhutan, he replied that "since they were not registered subjects they could be evicted whenever the need arose."&lt;ref name=Datta-Ray&gt;{{cite book|first=Sundana K. |last=Datta-Ray |authorlink=Sunanda K. Datta-Ray |title=Smash and Grab: The Annexation of Sikkim |page=51 |publisher=Vikas publishing |year=1984 |isbn=0-7069-2509-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lhotshampa were forbidden from settling north of the subtropical foothills.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;{{rp|30}}&lt;ref name=Fleeing/&gt;{{rp|160–162}}

Expatriate Nepalese, who resettled in [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]] after leaving Bhutan, formed the [[Bhutan State Congress]] in 1952 to represent the interests of other expatriates in [[India]] as well as the communities they had left behind. An effort to expand their operations into Bhutan with a ''satyagraha'' (non-violent resistance) movement in 1954 failed in the face of the mobilization of Bhutan's militia and a lack of enthusiasm among those Nepalese in Bhutan, who did not want to risk their already tenuous status. The Bhutanese government further diffused the Bhutan State Congress movement by granting concessions to the minority and allowing Nepalese representation in the [[National Assembly of Bhutan|National Assembly]]. The Bhutan State Congress continued to operate in exile until its decline and gradual disappearance in the early 1960s. The leaders in exile were pardoned in 1969 and permitted to return.&lt;ref name=PolDev&gt;{{cite web|last=Savada|first=Andrea Matles|title=Bhutan: A Country Study|url=http://countrystudies.us/bhutan/47.htm|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2011-07-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623165118/http://countrystudies.us/bhutan/47.htm| archivedate= 23 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhutan's Citizenship Act of 1958===
{{further|Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958}}
Toward the end of the reign of the second King [[Jigme Wangchuck]] in the 1950s, the numbers of new immigrants had swelled causing tension between the King and the [[Dorji family]] in the [[Bhutan House]].&lt;ref name=Sinha&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan Kingdom Bhutan: Tradition, Transition, and Transformation |first=Awadhesh Coomar |last=Sinha |publisher=Indus Publishing |year=2001 |isbn=81-7387-119-1 |pages=79–80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDxx_ibIwZ0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty was given through the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958|Citizenship Act of 1958]] for all those who could prove their presence in Bhutan for at least 10 years prior to 1958.&lt;ref name=58Act&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oag.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nationality-law-of-Bhutan-1958English-version.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nationality Law of Bhutan, 1958 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |year=1958 |accessdate=2010-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823132147/http://oag.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nationality-law-of-Bhutan-1958English-version.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the government also banned further immigration in 1958.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;

From 1961 onward however, with Indian support, the government began planned developmental activities consisting of significant infrastructure development works. Uncomfortable with India's desire to bring in workers in large numbers from India, the government initially tried to prove its own capacity by insisting that the planned [[Thimphu]]-[[Phuntsholing]] [[Lateral Road|highway]] be done with its own workforce. The government also attempted to rein in immigration.&lt;ref name=EPAO/&gt; While the project was a success, completing the 182-kilometer highway in just two years, the import of workers from India was inevitable. With most Bhutanese self-employed as farmers, Bhutan lacked a ready supply of workers willing to take up the major infrastructure projects. This led eventually to the large-scale immigration of skilled and unskilled construction workers from India.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;{{rp|162–165, 220}}&lt;ref name=EPAO&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania |volume=1 |series=Facts on File Library of World History |first=Barbara A. |last=West |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=0-8160-7109-8 |page=464 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perspective/&gt; These people were mostly of Nepali origin and settled in the south, as required, among legal and illegal residents alike.&lt;ref name=Fleeing&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fleeing People of South Asia: Selections from Refugee Watch |publisher=Anthem Press India |editor=Sibaji Pratim Basu |year=2009 |isbn=81-905835-7-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-d_0Upl6tXUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160–162}} With the pressures of the developmental activities, this trend remained unchecked or inadequately checked for many years.

===Bhutan's Citizenship Act of 1985===
{{further|Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985}}
By the 1980s, the government had become acutely conscious not just of widespread illegal immigration of people of Nepali origin into Bhutan, but also of the total lack of integration even of long-term immigrants into the political and cultural mainstream of the country. Most Lhotshampa remained culturally Nepalese. For its part, the government had largely ignored illegal settlement,&lt;ref name=Far/&gt; but had encouraged intermarriage with cash payments as a means of assimilation. However, this was met with negligible success as far as actual assimilation. There was also a perception of a [[Greater Nepal]] movement emerging from the Nepali-dominated areas in [[Nepal]], [[Darjeeling]], [[Kalimpong]] and [[West Bengal]] which the Bhutanese feared as Nepali chauvinism.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;{{rp|183–186, 239}}&lt;ref name=Fleeing/&gt;{{rp|161}}&lt;ref name=Spacializing/&gt;{{rp|63}}

Perceiving this growing dichotomy as a threat to national unity, the government promulgated directives in the 1980s that sought to preserve Bhutan's cultural identity as well as to formally embrace the citizens of other ethnic groups in a "One Nation, One People" policy. The government implied that the "culture" to be preserved would be that of the various northern Bhutanese groups. To reinforce this movement, the government forced the use of the ''[[Driglam Namzha]]'', the Bhutanese national dress and etiquette code. This policy required citizens to wear the attire of the northern Bhutanese in public places under penalty of fines, and reinforced the status of Dzongkha as the national language. Nepali was discontinued as a subject in the schools, thus bringing it at par with the status of the other languages of Bhutan, none of which are taught.&lt;ref name=Spacializing&gt;{{cite book|title=Spatializing Law: An Anthropological Geography of Law in Society |first1=Franz |last1=von Benda-Beckmann |first2=Keebet |last2=von Benda-Beckmann |first3=Anne M.

The government, for its part, perceived that free Nepali-language education had encouraged illegal immigration into southern Bhutan.&lt;ref name=VanDriem93/&gt;

The [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985|Citizenship Act of 1985]] clarified and attempted to enforce the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958|Citizenship Act of 1958]] in order to control the flood of illegal immigration. In 1980, the government conducted its first real census exercise. The basis for census citizenship classifications was the 1958 "cut off" year, the year that the Nepali population had first received Bhutanese citizenship. Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be illegal immigrants.

===Bhutan's first census (1988)===
The issue was brought to the fore when the government of Bhutan discovered in its first census the magnitude of the [[Lhotsampa]] population.&lt;ref name=BBCtl/&gt; Lhotsampa of Nepali descent who had been living in southern [[Bhutan]] since the late nineteenth&lt;ref name=USLCCS/&gt;&lt;ref name=USDOS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35839.htm |title=Background Note: Bhutan |date=2010-02-02 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-10-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101006040748/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35839.htm| archivedate= 6 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2006-10-19-voa1.cfm |title=Offer To Resettle Bhutan Refugees |date=2006-10-18 |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |accessdate=2010-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031614/http://voanews.com/uspolicy/2006-10-19-voa1.cfm |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and early twentieth centuries were induced to leave Bhutan after the country carried out its first census in 1988. The government, however, failed to properly train the census officials and this led to some tension among the public. Placement in the census categories which ranged from "Genuine Bhutanese" to "Non-nationals: Migrants and Illegal Settlers" was often arbitrary, and could be arbitrarily changed.&lt;ref name=Forgotten2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoice.org/bhutan/index.php?id=18 |publisher=Bhutanese Refugees: The Story of a Forgotten People |title=People: Lhotshampas remaining in Bhutan: a vulnerable group of people |accessdate=2010-10-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815035327/http://www.photovoice.org/bhutan/index.php?id=18 |archivedate=15 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases members of the same family have been, and still are, placed in different categories; some admittedly genuine Bhutanese have been forced to flee with family members the government found to be illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name=Forgotten2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|37–39}} Other Lhotshampa who considered their own citizenship secure were prevented by government officials from obtaining proper documentation, losing their property.&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|37–39}}

The government also attempted to enforce the Bhutanese [[driglam namzha]] dress and language code at the same time, in order to have the [[Lhotshampa]] population assimilate into [[Ngalop]] society.&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|38–39}} The government explained its cultural identity programs as a defense against the first political problems since the Wangchuck Dynasty was established in 1907 and the greatest threat to the nation's survival since the seventeenth century. Its major concern was to avoid a repeat of events that had occurred in 1975 when the monarchy in [[Sikkim]] was ousted by a Nepalese majority in a [[referendum|plebiscite]] and Sikkim was absorbed into India. In an effort to resolve the interethnic strife, the Druk Gyalpo made frequent visits to the troubled southern districts, and he ordered the release of hundreds of arrested "antinationals." He also expressed the fear that the large influx of Nepalese might lead to their demand for a separate state in the next ten to twenty years, in much the same way as happened in the once-independent monarchy of Sikkim in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

However, these measures combined to alienate even bona fide citizens of Nepali descent. Some ethnic Nepalese began protesting perceived discrimination, demanding exemption from the government decrees aimed at enhancing Bhutanese national identity. The reaction to the royal decrees in Nepalese majority communities surfaced as ethnic strife directed against non-Lhotshampa. Reactions also took form as protest movements in [[Nepal]] and [[India]] among Nepalese who had left Bhutan. The [[Druk Gyalpo]] was accused of "cultural suppression," and his government was charged by antigovernment leaders with human rights violations, including the torture of prisoners; arbitrary arrest and detention; denial of due process; and restrictions of freedoms of speech and press, peaceful organization and assembly, and workers' rights. Antigovernment protest marches involved more than 20,000 participants, including some from a movement that had succeeded in coercing India into accepting local autonomy for ethnic Nepalese in [[West Bengal]], who crossed the border from [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]] into six [[districts of Bhutan|districts]] across Bhutan.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt; As the census exercise came to an end, the southern border of Bhutan became a hotbed of militancy for several years.

Supporting the anti-government activities were expatriate Nepalese political groups and supporters in Nepal and India. Between 2,000 and 12,000 Nepalese were reported to have fled Bhutan in the late 1980s, and according to a 1991 report, even high-level Bhutanese government officials of Nepalese origin had resigned their positions and moved to Nepal. Some 5 million Nepalese were living in settlements in India along the Bhutan border in 1990. Nepalese were not necessarily welcome in India, where ethnic strife conspired to push them back through the largely unguarded Bhutanese frontier. The [[Bhutan Peoples' Party]] operated among the large Nepalese community in northern India. A second group, the Bhutan People's Forum for Human Rights (a counterpart of the [[Nepal People's Forum for Human Rights]]), was established in 1998 in Nepal by [[Tek Nath Rizal]], a Lhotshampa and former trusted official of the Royal Advisory Council who acted as a chief liaison between the government and the Lhotshampa in the south, as well as a former member of the [[National Assembly of Bhutan]]. The [[Bhutan Students Union]] and the Bhutan Aid Group-Nepal also were involved in political activism.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

In November 1989, [[Tek Nath Rizal]] was allegedly abducted in eastern Nepal by Bhutanese police and returned to Thimphu, where he was imprisoned on charges of conspiracy and treason. He was also accused of instigating the racial riots in southern Bhutan. Rizal was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1993.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;&lt;ref name=AI99&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA140041999?open&amp;of=ENG-BTN |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |title=Amnesty International welcomes release of prisoner of conscience |date=1999-12-21 |accessdate=2010-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903222654/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA140041999?open&amp;of=ENG-BTN |archivedate=2009-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interethnic conflict (1990s)===
Interethnic conflict generally escalated during the 1990s. In February 1990, antigovernment activists detonated a remote-control bomb on a bridge near [[Phuntsholing]] and set fire to a seven-vehicle convoy.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

In September 1990, clashes occurred with the Royal Bhutan Army, which was ordered not to fire on protesters. The men and women marchers were organized by S.K. Neupane and other members of the illegal [[Bhutan Peoples' Party]], which reportedly urged the marchers to demand democracy and human rights for all Bhutanese citizens. Some villagers willingly joined the protests; others did so under duress. The government branded the party, reportedly established by anti-monarchists and backed by the [[Nepali Congress Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)]], as a terrorist organization. The party allegedly led its members – said to be armed with rifles, muzzle-loading guns, knives, and homemade grenades – in raids on villages in southern Bhutan, disrobing people wearing traditional Bhutanese garb; extorting money; and robbing, kidnapping, and killing people. Reportedly, there were hundreds of casualties, although the government admitted to only two deaths among security forces. Other sources indicated that more than 300 persons were killed, 500 wounded, and 2,000 arrested in clashes with security forces. Along with the above-mentioned violence, vehicle hijackings, kidnappings, extortions, ambushes, and bombings took place, schools were closed (some were destroyed), and post offices, police, health, forest, customs, and agricultural posts were destroyed. For their part, security forces were charged by the [[Bhutan Peoples' Party]], in protests made to [[Amnesty International]] and the [[UNHCR|International Human Rights Commission]], with murder and rape and carrying out a "reign of terror". In support of the expatriate Nepalese, the general secretary of the Nepali Congress Party, the ruling party in Nepal, called on the [[Druk Gyalpo]] to establish a multiparty democracy. Some of the organizers of the marches were arrested and detained.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCtl/&gt; The Bhutanese government admitted only to the arrest of 42 people involved in "anti-national" activities in late 1989, plus 3 additional individuals who had been extradited from Nepal. All but 6 were reportedly later released; those remaining in jail were charged with treason. By September 1990, more than 300 additional prisoners held in the south were released following the Druk Gyalpo's tour of southern [[districts of Bhutan|districts]].&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

In the face of government resistance to demands that would institutionalize separate identities within the nation, protesters in the south insisted that the [[Bhutan Peoples' Party]] flag be flown in front of administrative headquarters and that party members be allowed to carry the ''[[kukri]]'', a traditional Nepalese curved knife, at all times. They also called for the right not to wear the Bhutanese national dress, and insisted that schools and government offices stay closed until their demands were met. The unmet demands were accompanied by additional violence and deaths in October 1990. At the same time, India pledged "all possible assistance that the royal government might seek in dealing with this problem" and assured that it would protect the frontier against groups seeking illegal entry to Bhutan.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

By early 1991, the press in Nepal was referring to insurgents in southern Bhutan as "freedom fighters". The [[Bhutan Peoples' Party]] claimed that more than 4,000 advocates of democracy had been arrested by the Royal Bhutan Army. Charges were made that some of those arrested had been murdered outside Bhutanese police stations and that some 4,200 persons had been deported.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

To deter and regulate Nepalese migration into Bhutan from India, the Druk Gyalpo ordered more regular censuses, improved border checks, and better government administration in the southern districts. The more immediate action of forming citizens' militias took place in October 1990 as a backlash to the demonstrations. Internal travel regulations were made more strict with the issue of new multipurpose identification cards by the Ministry of Home Affairs in January 1990. By the end of 1990, the government admitted the serious effects of the anti-government violence. It was announced that foreign- exchange earnings had dropped and that the GDP had decreased significantly because of terrorist activities.&lt;ref name=PolDev/&gt;

In 1992 interethnic conflict again flared, prompting a peak in Lhotshampa departures, totaling over 100,000 by 1996.&lt;ref name=UNHCR1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MARP,,BTN,,469f386a1e,0.html |title=Chronology for Lhotshampas in Bhutan |year=2004 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |accessdate=2010-20-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016143502/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CMARP%2C%2CBTN%2C%2C469f386a1e%2C0.html |archivedate=2012-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Lhotshampa claim to have been forcibly evicted by the military, who forced them to sign "Voluntary Migration Form" documents stating they had left willingly.&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name=HRW1&gt;{{cite web|last=Frelick |first=Bill |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/01/31/bhutans-ethnic-cleansing |publisher=[[New Statesman]], [[Human Rights Watch]] |title=Bhutan's Ethnic Cleansing |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishra 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mishra|first=Vidhyapati|title=Bhutan Is No Shangri-La|website=The New York Times|date=June 28, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/opinion/bhutan-is-no-shangri-la.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugee camps in Nepal==
{{see|Refugees in Nepal}}

During the 1990s several thousand Lhotshampa settled in the refugee camps that were set up by the UNHCR in Nepal. The UNHCR recognized most of the arrivals between 1990 and 1993 on a ''prima facie'' basis.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e487646 |title=2010 UNHCR country operations profile – Nepal |year=2010 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, the camp populations had exploded to 100,000&lt;ref name=UNHCR1/&gt; and peaked at more than 107,000 persons.&lt;ref name=unhcr08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=47a30dc82&amp;query=bhutan |title= Refugees from Bhutan poised for new start |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2011-04-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005625/http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=47a30dc82&amp;query=bhutan| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living conditions===

Camp conditions were initially rife with malnutrition and disease including [[measles]], [[scurvy]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], [[cholera]], and [[beriberi]], although camp conditions improved markedly between 1995 and 2005. Education was among the best services provided within the camps, generally better than in the surrounding countryside of Nepal. Camps, however, remained significantly overpopulated through 2006. Malnourishment, due to age-based food rationing, violence against women and children, as well as marginalization and radicalization remained serious issues.&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|31–32}}
Bhutanese refugees in Nepal live under conditions of restricted or controlled movement, restricted ability to work, and limited access to the local justice system.&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|31–32}} The Danish humanitarian organization, [[Global Medical Aid]] has aided Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php action=news_details&amp;news_id=19938] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227175406/http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php |date=2014-02-27 }}."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 the population of the camps shrunk as can be seen in the table above. Due to this reduction the [[Goldhap refugee camp|Goldhap]] and [[Timai refugee camp|Timai]] camps have been merged with the [[Beldangi refugee camps|Beldangi II camp]].&lt;ref name=SAAG2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/\notes7\note618.html |title=BHUTAN: Local Council Elections and Update on Refugees: Update No. 89 |first=S |last=Chandrasekharan |publisher=South Asia Analysis Group (SAAG) online |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104071852/http://southasiaanalysis.org/notes7/note618.html |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAAG1/&gt; The offices are preparing to close or merge other camps and predicted to complete the refugee resettlement operation within 10 years. By 2016, only the Beldangi and Sanischare camps remained, with a combined total of 11,762 residents. However, there are around 10,000 refugees left in the camps, who are either not eligible or do not want to be resettled. Remaining are mainly elderly people who have lost their support network – through resettlement – and are affected by increasing rates of depression, substance misuse and suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf |title=A 'successful' refugee resettlement programme: the case of Nepal |first=Bipin |last=Ghimire |issue=54 |journal=Forced Migration Review |year=2017 |p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===

The government of Bhutan claims that among them are local Nepalese people who were attracted to the camps by their resources.&lt;ref name=Far&gt;{{cite book|title=Far East and Australasia 2003 – Regional surveys of the world |author=Eur |edition=34 |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-85743-133-2 |pages=181–183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAAG2/&gt;&lt;ref name=SAAG1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/\notes7\note623.html |title=Bhutan And Nepal Should Stop being Insincere to the Cause of Refugees: Update No. 90 |first=S |last=Chandrasekharan |publisher=South Asia Analysis Group (SAAG) online |date=2011-04-24 |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728043353/http://southasiaanalysis.org/notes7/note623.html |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the refugees deserve the label of "Bhutanese refugees" is questioned based on the fact that no proper screening was done by the UNHCR when they opened the camps. Alexander Casella, a one-time Director in UNHCR, writes "Normally, the UNHCR, before intervening, would have undertaken a survey of the caseload to determine exactly their nationality and reasons for departure. Had this been undertaken, the inescapable conclusion would have been that the overwhelming majority were actually Nepalese and hence, by the fact that they were in their own country, did not qualifying for refugee status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casella|first=Alexander|title=Nepal Finally Waves off Refugees|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KL15Ad03.html|publisher=Asia Times Online}}, December 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary return===

In 2000, after years of discussion, [[Bhutan]] and [[Nepal]] reached an agreement about the [[voluntary return]] of certain Bhutanese refugees living in Nepalese [[refugee camp|camps]]. However, points of contention included that some camp inhabitants have never been citizens, or some not even residents, of Bhutan before attaining refugee status. Furthermore, the Bhutanese government regarded many political groups among the Nepalese [[Lhotshampa]] community, such as the [[Bhutan Peoples' Party]] (BPP) and [[Bhutan National Democratic Party]] (BNDP), as terrorist or anti-national groups.&lt;ref name=SDSU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/asia_pacific/bhutan.html |title=Asia – Bhutan |first=Robert |last=Winslow |publisher=[[San Diego State University]], ROHAN Academic Computing |work=A Comparative Criminology Tour of the World |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2011-05-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605135851/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/asia_pacific/bhutan.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Europa&gt;{{cite book|title=Europa World Year, Book 1 |author=Taylor &amp; Francis Group |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2004 |isbn=1-85743-254-1 |page=60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating repatriation, the land and other property formerly held by Lhotshampa refugees have been repopulated and taken over by [[Ngalop]] settlers – including government and military members – under government encouragement.&lt;ref name=Spacializing/&gt;{{rp|70–73}}&lt;ref name=Displaced/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

In March 2001, the first verification of Bhutanese refugees eligible for repatriation commenced in [[Nepal]]ese [[refugee camp]]s. Actual repatriation was then estimated to occur within one year.  However, progress stalled for over a decade.&lt;ref name=Europa/&gt; In 2003, a Bhutanese verification team was attacked and injured in [[Jhapa]], resulting in further delay.&lt;ref name=Kuensel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19978 |title=Solution to the People in Nepal Camps |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, over 200 refugees in the [[Khudunabari refugee camp]] alone had been certified.  However, no Bhutanese refugees had been repatriated. In April 2011, Bhutan and Nepal again opened talks on repatriation, however the [[UNHCR]] remains committed to third country resettlement in light of Bhutan's refusal to guarantee full citizenship and other human rights for returnees.&lt;ref name=UNHCR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=SAAG1/&gt; As of July 2011, the governments of Bhutan and Nepal had held at least 15 rounds of bilateral talks with no practical solution reached; although Bhutanese state media echoed Bhutan's insistence on continued talks with Nepal, it has signaled its preference for third country resettlement.&lt;ref name=Kuensel/&gt; Nepal, for its part, has not accepted the refugees into its own population.&lt;ref name=Fleeing/&gt;{{rp|148}}&lt;ref name=Displaced&gt;{{cite book|title=Protracted Displacement in Asia: No Place to Call Home |first=Howard |last=Adelman |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |year=2008 |isbn=0-7546-7238-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyzfkz1gcVsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–30, 40}}

The [[United States Department of State]] identified leaders within refugee camps intent on repatriation as hampering some resettlement efforts with disinformation and intimidation, despite generally poor prospects for repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm |title=Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated'  |publisher=[[BBC News]] online |first=Subir |last=Bhaumik |location=Calcutta |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third country resettlement===

For many years the government of Nepal did not allow resettlement for Bhutanese refugees. This only changed in the second half of the 2000s after lengthy negotiations. Bhutanese refugees were an attractive group for receiving countries as they posed much less of a security risk as for example Iraqi, Somali or Afghan refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.unhcr.org/510bd3979.pdf |title=New Issues in Refugee Research |first1=M. |last1=Piper |first2=P. |last2=Power |first3=G. |last3=Thom |publisher=UNHCR |issn=1020-7473 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNHCR and different partners that formed the "Core Group on Bhutanese Refugees in Nepal" announced in 2007 to [[Third country resettlement|resettle]] the majority of the 108,000 registered Bhutanese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf |title=UNHCR Resettlement Handbook |year=2011 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. offered to take 60,000 and began receiving them in 2008.&lt;ref name=CNNrstl&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/25/bhutan.refugees/index.html |work=CNN |title=First of 60,000 refugees from Bhutan arrive in U.S |date=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark offered to resettle 10,000 each&lt;ref name=CNNrstl/&gt; and New Zealand offered to resettle 600 refugees over a period of five years starting in 2008.

According to Raj Khadka resettlement has provided the opportunity of starting a new life to these refugees, but the challenges that they are facing in the labour market are a big hurdle in establishing themselves in the new countries that are quite different from their own.&lt;ref&gt;The Road from Bhutan  (2013 Fall). http://tcwcp.successbc.ca/www/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fall-2013-Our-Home-Our-Stories-The-Road-from-Bhutan.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadians in China''' consist mainly of expatriates and students from [[Canada]] to the [[People's Republic of China]]. {{As of|2011}} there are about 300,000 Canadians living in China.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.themarknews.com/articles/6387-wanted-canadian-china-alumni It's time to get serious about mobilizing our vast cultural capital.] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130204004300/http://www.themarknews.com/articles/6387-wanted-canadian-china-alumni# |date=2013-02-04 }}", ''The Mark'', 13 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Canadians in Hong Kong}}
In February 2011, research from the Asia Pacific Foundation, conducted with [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], suggests there are at least 295,000 Canadians in Hong Kong. Near 85% of Canadians in Hong Kong are Canadian-born, a figure higher than Canada itself (80.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=singtao.ca |url=http://news.singtao.ca/vancouver/2009-10-06/headline1254824002d2074534.html |title=星岛日报溫哥華-香港：海外最大加人社區 |publisher=News.singtao.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents the third largest community of Canadians, after Canada itself and the United States. A large portion of Canadians in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese.

==Mainland China==

===Beijing===
About 10% of [[Beijing]]'s foreign population of 200,000 are from Canada (20,000).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asiapacific.ca/sites/default/files/filefield/Portrait_Report_Beijing.pdf Portrait of Canadians Abroad: Beijing]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada'', September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian diaspora in Beijing is a young and well-educated community and is economically active. A significant number of them include [[Chinese Canadian]] returnees who emigrated to Canada in the early 1990s and later returned to China.

===Shanghai===
According to local official statistics, the numbers of Canadian citizens residing in [[Shanghai]] have increased significantly over the past ten years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asiapacific.ca/sites/default/files/canadiansabroad/Portrait_Report/portrait_shanghai_2011.pdf Portrait of Canadians Abroad: Shanghai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309081613/http://www.asiapacific.ca/sites/default/files/canadiansabroad/Portrait_Report/portrait_shanghai_2011.pdf# |date=2012-03-09 }}", ''Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada'', February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the city reported 1,361 Canadian citizens living there, representing 2.3% of all foreign residents in the city. By the end of 2009, there are about 6,121 Canadian citizens living in Shanghai.

Shanghai's Canadian community consist mainly of English teachers, media workers, engineers, senior executives, small business owners and house wives as well as international students.

==Education==
Canadian schools in Mainland China:
* [[Canadian International School of Beijing]]
* [[International School of Beijing]] (formed out of a merger of the Canadian Embassy School and other embassy schools)
* [[The International School of Sanya]] (formerly Canadian International School of Sanya)

[[Canadian International School of Hong Kong]] is a Canadian school in Hong Kong.

==Notable people==
*[[Norman Bethune]] - Canadian physician and medical innovator.
*[[Davidson Black]] - Canadian paleoanthropologist
*[[Dashan]] - Freelance performer
*[[Miodrag Kojadinović]] - Canadian-Serbian poet
*[[Dorise Nielsen]] - Canadian politician and teacher.

The first recorded arrivals of Chinese people to Spain date from the late 16th century. [[Bernardino de Escalante]] in his ''Discurso de la navegación...'' (one of the first European books on China, published in 1577) says that among his sources of information were "Chinese themselves, who came to Spain" ("los mesmos naturales Chinas que an venido à España").&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|first=Bernardino de|last=Escalante|location=Sevilla|title=Discurso de la navegación que los portugueses hazen a los reinos y provincias del oriente, y de la noticia que se tiene del reino de China|url=http://www.upf.edu/asia/projectes/che/s16/escal.pdf|year=1577}}, folio 100. (Modern transcription, with slight modification to the original orthography. Full text as a PDF file.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan González de Mendoza]] in his ''[[The history of the great and mighty kingdom of China and the situation thereof|History of the great and mighty kingdom of China]]'', wrote that in 1585 "three merchants of China" arrived in Mexico "and neuer staied till they came into Spaine and into other kingdomes further off." &lt;ref&gt;[[Juan González de Mendoza]], ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofgreatmi14151gonz#page/95/mode/2up] The history of the great and mighty kingdom of China and the situation thereof''.

Modern annotations (as in the 1944 Spanish edition) note that this fact is absent in the first Spanish edition (Rome, 1585) but appears in the next Spanish edition (Madrid, 1586), meaning that Mendoza added a current fact to the new edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal case was brought before the [[Council of the Indies]] involving two Chinese men in [[Seville]], one a freeman, Esteban Cabrera, and the other a slave, Diego Indio, against Juan de Morales, Diego's owner.

The first large wave of Chinese immigrants came to Spain in the 1920s and 1930s, working as itinerant peddlers. After [[World War II]], they branched out into the restaurant industry, and later into textiles and trade.&lt;ref name="Beltran2"&gt;{{citation|last=Beltrán Antolín|first=Joaquín|title=Diáspora y comunidades asiáticas en españa (Asiatic diaspora and communities in Spain)|journal=Revista electrónica de geografía y ciencias sociales|publisher=University of Barcelona|volume=7|issue=134|date=1 February 2003|accessdate=8 December 2006|url=http://www.ub.es/geocrit/sn/sn-134.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of Chinese residents in Spain started arriving in the country around the 1980s. According to Xu Songhua, president of the Association of Chinese in Spain (''Asociación de Chinos en España''), established in 1985, there are 13,000 Chinese-owned businesses in Spain, including 4,000 restaurants, 3,200 "dollar shops", 1,500 fruit shops, 600 wholesale warehouses, 80 Chinese groceries, 200 textile factories, and 120 photo processing shops.&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt; Nowadays, Madrid, Barcelona, and the Canary Islands are home to the largest Chinese communities of Spain. Unlike earlier waves of Chinese immigrants in other countries, over 80% of the Chinese in Spain come from [[Zhejiang]]'s [[Qingtian County]], with smaller numbers from [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]]. Others have come from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and Chinese communities of [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt;

A [[:ca:Temple Taoista de Barcelona|Taoist temple]] was opened in 2014 by the Chinese community of [[Barcelona]], led by [[Taoist priest]] Liu Zemin, a 21st-generation descendant of poet, soldier and prophet Liu Bo Wen (1311-1375). The temple, located in the district of [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]] and inaugurated with the presence of the People's Republic of China consul Qu Chengwu, enshrines 28 [[Chinese gods and immortals|deities]] of the province of China where most of the Chinese in Barcelona come from.&lt;ref&gt;[http://governacio.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/013_taoista "S'ha inaugurat un temple taoista a Barcelona"].

The '''Climate Vulnerability Monitor (CVM)''' is an independent global assessment of the [[effects of global warming|effect of climate change]] on the world’s populations brought together by panels of key international authorities. The Monitor was launched in December 2010 in [[London]] and [[Cancun]] to coincide with the UN [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Cancun Summit]] on climate change (COP-16).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/4/?ref=1,5,5875]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206095940/http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/4/?ref=1%2C5%2C5875|date=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |author=BCS s.c. |url=http://www.maldiveshighcommission.org/?s=10&amp;id=1571&amp;new=ok&amp;grupa=1 |title=High Commission of the Republic of MALDIVES &amp;#124; President Nasheed Launches Climate Vulnerable Monitor 2010 |publisher=Maldiveshighcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304220915/http://www.maldiveshighcommission.org/?s=10&amp;id=1571&amp;new=ok&amp;grupa=1 |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by [[DARA (international organization)|DARA]] and the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]],  the report is meant to serve as a new tool to assess global vulnerability to various effects of climate change within different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11912566 |title=BBC News - Poorer nations 'need carbon cuts', urges The Maldives |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report distills leading science and research for a clearer explanation of how and where [[population]]s are being affected by climate change today (2010) and in the near future (2030), while pointing to key actions that reduce these impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/blogs/new-report-5-million-climate-deaths-predicted-by-2020 |title=New report: 5 million climate deaths predicted by 2020 &amp;#124; MNN - Mother Nature Network |publisher=MNN |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DARA (international organization)|DARA]] and the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] launched the 2nd edition of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor on 26 September 2012 at the [[Asia Society]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daraint.org/2012/07/30/3824/launch-of-the-2nd-edition-of-the-climate-vulnerability-monitor-sept-26-new-york/ |title=Launch of the 2nd Edition of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor |publisher=Daraint.org |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

The Climate Vulnerability Monitor attempts to demonstrate how each country is vulnerable to climate change (due to health reasons, [[extreme weather]] patterns, economic factors, [[land consumption|land loss]] from expanding deserts or [[rising sea levels]]). It lists over 50 measures that the authors claim are readily available to limit virtually all harm caused by climate change.

==Approach==
The Climate Vulnerability Monitor reportedly takes a new approach to assessing the climate vulnerability of the world and its regions, countries and communities. The Monitor looks at pre-existing characteristics of society that are affected by climate change and maps the level of vulnerability and expected impact as implied by the effect that real or projected changes in the climate. The analysis is built around 4 "impact areas", and 5 "levels of vulnerability", focusing on the years 2010 and 2030.

According to the report, the estimated figures of impacts are yielded from the Monitor’s specific [[methodology]] and represent additional impacts due to climate change. They give a "snapshot" of what is expected to already be taking place and what might occur in the near future. According to the authors, the Monitor represents just one possible way of measuring climate vulnerability that they expect can be improved upon.

'''4 Climate Impact Areas Addressed'''
*Health Impact - additional [[Mortality rate|mortality]] from climate-sensitive diseases
*Weather Disasters - additional mortality and damage in [[storm]]s, [[flood]]s and [[wildfire]]s
*Habitat Loss - additional loss of human habitat to rising sea levels, [[desertification]]
*Economic Stress - extra losses in the primary/[[agricultural sector]]s of the economy and key [[natural resource]]s

'''5 Climate Vulnerability Factors'''
*Acute (most vulnerable category)
*Severe
*High
*Moderate
*Low (least vulnerable category)

==Findings ==

The report claims that climate change fuelled by human activities is already interfering with the climate, leading to effects that are dangerous for people and the planet. According to the report, the rate of change and effects of heat, wind, rain, deserts, [[sea level]], and other impacts result in 350,000 deaths per year. The report states that the effects of climate change could contribute to the deaths of 5 million people by 2020 and cause as many as 1 million deaths per year by 2030 if [[global warming]] isn't slowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=12307753&amp;page=2 |title=Science News &amp;#124; Technology News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat, wind, and [[water shortage]]s put pressure on the habitat of approximately 2.5 million people. Storms, floods, and wildfires are estimated to leave an additional $5 billion in damage each year, while rising seas cost 1% of GDP to the lowest-income countries – 4% in the [[Pacific]] – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the [[world economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=17016 |title=Climate vulnerability monitor 2010: the state of the climate crisis - Documents &amp; Publications - Professional Resources |publisher=PreventionWeb.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report further states that most impacts are highly concentrated on children and the poor with the majority of the death toll is concentrated on children living in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] or [[South Asia]], and that gradual, not sudden, impacts from climate change causes more than 90% of all damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jen Quraishi |url=http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2010/12/children-hit-hard-climate-change |title=How Children Suffer From Climate Change |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuang |first=Cliff |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1710037/infographics-of-the-day-amid-climate-change-some-countries-luck-out |title=Infographics of the Day: Amid Climate Change, Some Countries Luck Out |publisher=Fast Company |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80% of people at risk from climate-caused desertification reside in high-growth [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] such as [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access2healthinfo.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/deaths-from-climate-change-will-triple-in-next-two-decades-if-inaction-continues/ |title=Deaths from climate change will triple in next two decades if inaction continues « Access to Health Information |publisher=Access2healthinfo.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also states that half of the economic impacts of climate change are felt in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]]. However, [[Developing country|developing countries]] suffer much greater relative stresses to their economies, mainly due to larger, less robust agricultural sectors. Just 15 countries are considered acutely vulnerable to climate change today, collectively suffering nearly half of all climate impacts. Recognized [[Fragile state|fragile states]] or [[Failed state|failed states]] like [[Afghanistan]], [[Haiti]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Somalia]] are among the worst affected. An average of just 24 countries are assessed as having the most severe factor of vulnerability for each main impact area of health, extreme weather, [[habitat loss]], and economic stress. In every case, some two thirds of the total global impact falls on just 10 countries.

The report states that 20 more years of inaction could lead to nearly 1 million climate-related deaths each year by 2030. The number of acutely vulnerable countries could more than triple over that period. Economic costs could increase to $100 billion of stress on the world’s [[coastline]]s, $150 billion worth of primary-sector and natural resource losses, and $10 billion in storm, flood, and wildfire damages—a third of a trillion dollar annual [[economic crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daraint.org/climate-vulnerability-monitor/climate-vulnerability-monitor-2010/findings/ |title=Findings - DARA |publisher=Daraint.org |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[DARA (international organization)|DARA]] and the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] created the Climate Vulnerability Monitor to advance understanding of the growing negative effects of climate change on society and to identify a variety of key options to meet this new challenge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The Climate Vulnerable Forum is a global partnership of leaders of countries most vulnerable to climate change actively seeking a firm and urgent resolution to the growing climate crisis. It was founded by President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] of the [[Maldives]] and first met in November 2009. The Declaration of the Climate Vulnerable Forum adopted then expressed alarm at the rate of changes and danger witnessed around the planet due to the effects of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] global warming and called for urgent international cooperation to tackle the challenge. The countries include [[Bangladesh]], [[Barbados]], [[Bhutan]], [[Kiribati]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nepal]], [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Vietnam]] and Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=staff |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/nov2009/2009-11-10-01.html |title=Climate Vulnerable Nations Go Carbon Neutral, Plead for Help |publisher=Ens-newswire.com |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daraint.org/climate-vulnerability-monitor/climate-vulnerability-monitor-2010/climate-vulnerable-forum/ |title=Climate Vulnerable Forum - DARA |publisher=Daraint.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARA is an international organization based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and founded in 2003 by Silvia Hidalgo. According to its website, the organization aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of aid for vulnerable populations suffering from conflict, disasters, and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daraint.org/aboutus]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is endemic at every level of the [[Liberia]]n government. Corruption is not specifically a punishable crime under Liberian law.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Liberia"/&gt; When [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf|President Sirleaf]] took office in 2006, she announced that corruption was “the major public enemy.”&lt;ref name="hrw20130822" /&gt;

In 2014, the US ambassador to Liberia stated that corruption there was harming people through "unnecessary costs to products and services that are already difficult for many Liberians to afford".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201402211033.html|title=Liberia: Corruption Is Liberia's Problem, US Ambassador to Liberia Alarms|author=Al-Varney Rogers|publisher=all Africa|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corruption dynamics ==
In the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]]'s 2013 Human Rights Report on Liberia, it was highlighted that Liberia's laws do not provide criminal penalties for official corruption. There were criminal penalties for economic sabotage, mismanagement of funds, and other corruption-related acts. According to a 2013 report published by the US State Department, low pay levels for the Liberian [[civil service]], minimal job training, and few court convictions have exacerbated official corruption and have helped to foster a culture of impunity.&lt;ref name="state220129"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=220129|title=2013 Human Rights Report - Liberia, US Department of State.|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent of corruption ==
=== Government officials ===

[[File:Liberia 2004, Anti-corruption poster.JPG|thumb|300px|An anti-corruption sign in Liberia, 2004.]]
In 2012, the Liberian central government dismissed or suspended a number of officials for corruption. Auditor General Robert L. Kilby and General Services Agency Director General Pealrine Davis-Parkinson were dismissed for conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

Deputy Justice Minister Freddie Taylor, Deputy [[Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (Liberia)|Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization]] (BIN) Commissioner Robert Buddy, former solicitor general Micah Wright, and BIN Border Patrol Chief Wilson Garpeh were dismissed for alleged involvement in [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

Deputy Public Works Minister Victor B. Smith was suspended for allegedly violating the law but was reinstated a week later following an investigation. President Sirleaf dismissed the chairman and other board members of the Liberia Airports Authority amid corruption allegations. An assistant labor minister was also dismissed for issuing work permits to foreigners after allegedly taking bribes.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

=== Liberian legal system ===
The 2013 US State Department report said that: "Judges were susceptible to bribes to award damages in civil cases. Judges sometimes requested bribes to try cases, release detainees from prison, or find defendants not guilty in criminal cases. Defense attorneys and prosecutors sometimes suggested defendants pay bribes to secure favorable rulings from or to appease judges, prosecutors, jurors, and police officers."&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[Liberian National Police|Liberia National Police]] (LNP) "investigated reports of police misconduct or corruption, and authorities suspended or dismissed several LNP officers."&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

In 2013, [[Human Rights Watch]] released a report specifically about police corruption in Liberia. They interviewed more than 120 people who had said they had been victimized in their dealings with the police. They said that "police officers typically ask crime victims to pay to register their cases, for transport to the crime scene, and for pens and other items used in the investigation. Criminal suspects routinely pay bribes for release from police detention."&lt;ref name="hrw20130822"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/22/liberia-police-corruption-harms-rights-progress|title =Liberia: Police Corruption Harms Rights, Progress|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=22 August 2013|accessdate = 13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Street vendors said they were often the victim of police raids, especially in Monrovia. Vendors said that police routinely steal goods, arrest vendors, and then require them to pay for their release from detention. Motorcycle and taxi drivers throughout the country described harassment and extortion along roads. Those who refuse to meet officers’ demands face violence and arrest. Elite armed units, such as the Police Support Unit, were frequently cited for violent abuses.&lt;ref name="hrw20130822" /&gt;

Human Rights Watch also interviewed 35 police officers of varying ranks for their study. The police described being given inadequate supplies, living on low salaries, and pressure to pay their superiors to obtain desirable posts and promotions.&lt;ref name="hrw20130822" /&gt;

=== Education system ===
In Liberia's education system, patronage and bribery by administrators, professors, and students are widely reported. Abuse of resources, teacher absenteeism, and sex for grades are common. A culture of silence prevents reporting of problems and hence any constructive reform.&lt;ref name="cfr20120820"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/development-channel/2012/08/20/emerging-voices-glencorse-on-higher-education-in-liberia/|title=Emerging Voices: Glencorse on Higher Education in Liberia|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=20 August 2012|accessdate = 13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo20131203"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/03/breaking-the-silence-sms-helps-liberian-schools-to-improve-education/|title=Breaking the Silence: SMS Helps Liberian Schools to Improve Education|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|author=Ken Banks|date=3 December 2013|accessdate = 13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a confidential anonymous SMS suggestions box for students and educators began to operate in elements of Liberia's education system, in order to report systemic abuses.&lt;ref name="natgeo20131203" /&gt;

In 2014, the head of Liberia's National Commission on Higher Education was under investigation by Liberia's Anti Corruption Commission for a second time, over allegations of the [[embezzlement]] of funds supposedly spent upon official travel which never occurred. The National Commission on Higher Education coordinates, monitors, evaluates and accredits all higher institutions of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201403270863.html|title=Liberia: Higher Education Boss Still in Anti-Corruption Agency Dragnet|publisher=All Africa Global Media|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical system ===
Amidst Liberia's [[Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia|Ebola epidemic in 2014]], some body-collection teams dispatched to collect the Ebola dead accepted bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members, stating that their dead relative died from something other than Ebola. The body of the Ebola victim could also be left with relatives. Ebola carries a stigma in Liberia, and some families do not want to admit that their relative died of Ebola. Another factor is that families wish to give their relative a traditional burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ebola-stricken-african-families-pay-bribes-for-fake-death-records-1413153854|title=Some Ebola-Stricken African Families Pay Bribes for Fake Death Records|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Heidi Vogt|date= 12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-corruption efforts ==
The Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) and the Ministry of Justice are responsible for exposing and combating official corruption.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

=== Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission ===
There exists an underfunded and understaffed Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission, created in 2008, that is supposedly empowered to prosecute crimes that effectively amount to corruption. Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted in 2011 that though there had been a multiplicity of high-level corruption scandals during the previous year, they had resulted in “few investigations and  only two convictions.”&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Liberia"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Liberia|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154354.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the LACC received 25 cases, investigated 23 cases, and recommended four for prosecution, resulting in no convictions.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

The Anti-Corruption Commission, HRW complained, is “hampered by insufficient funds [and] personnel” and does not actually have the “authority to independently prosecute cases.” The failure of Sirleaf to deal with this issue has led to “the perception that the president lacks the will to address the problem,” they said.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Liberia"/&gt;

In her final state of the nation address in 2017, President Sirleaf stated the corruption in Liberia was too great for her administration to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/24/liberia-leader-acknowledges-failure-in-anti-corruption-fight.html|title=Liberia leader acknowledges failure in anti-corruption fight|date=2017-01-24|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial disclosure ===
2013 US State Department report noted that President Sirleaf issued Executive Order 38 in January 2012 requesting officials of the executive branch to make financial disclosures and declare their assets to the LACC. Many officials only did so after the president threatened dismissal if they did not comply. All officials of the executive branch declared their assets by year’s end.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

The LACC initiated an asset verification process to review these declarations and in October summarized the results of the process, highlighting some discrepancies and instances of unexplained wealth accumulation. The LACC was not required to release the contents of the declarations, but it released aggregate information about officials’ cooperation and the overall results of the asset verification process.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

=== Transparency of government ===
The 2010 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides that the government should release government information not involving national security or military issues upon request. Some transparency advocates, including the head of the LACC have suggested that the FOIA law needs to be improved to ensure that citizens can access information to verify that government funds were properly spent and accounted for.&lt;ref name="state220129" /&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Dauphin of France.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the Dauphin of France.]]
[[File:Arms of the Dauphin of France.svg|thumb|right|Arms of the Dauphin of France, depicting the [[fleur-de-lis]] and the [[dolphin]].]]
'''Dauphin of France''' ({{lang-fr|Dauphin de France}} {{IPA-fr|dofɛ̃ də fʁɑ̃s|}}), originally '''Dauphin of Viennois''' (''Dauphin de Viennois''), was the title given to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[List of heirs to the French throne|throne of France]] from 1350 to 1791 and 1824 to 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/dauphin-French-political-history|title=dauphin {{!}} French political history|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dauphin'' is French for [[dolphin]]. At first the heirs were granted the [[County of Viennois]] (Dauphiné) to rule, but eventually only the title was granted.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[Guigues IV of Albon|Guigues IV]], Count of [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], had a [[dolphin]] on his [[coat of arms]] and was nicknamed ''le Dauphin''. The title of [[Dauphin de Viennois]] descended in his family until 1349, when [[Humbert II of Viennois|Humbert II]] sold his [[Manorialism|seigneury]], called the [[Dauphiné]], to King [[Philip VI of France|Philippe VI]] on condition that the heir of France assume the title of ''le Dauphin''. The wife of the Dauphin was known as ''la Dauphine''.

The first French prince called ''le Dauphin'' was Charles the Wise, later to become [[Charles V of France]]. The title was roughly equivalent to the English (thence British) ''[[Prince of Wales]]'', the Scottish ''[[Duke of Rothesay]]'', the Portuguese ''[[Prince of Brazil]]'', the Brazilian ''[[Prince of Grão-Pará]]'' and the Spanish ''[[Prince of Asturias]]''. The official style of a Dauphin of France, prior to 1461, was ''par la grâce de Dieu, dauphin de Viennois, comte de Valentinois et de Diois'' ("By the Grace of God, Dauphin of Viennois, Count of Valentinois and of Diois"). A Dauphin of France united the coat of arms of the Dauphiné, which featured Dolphins, with the French [[fleurs-de-lis]], and might, where appropriate, further unite that with other arms (e.g. [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], son of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], was ruling [[Duke of Brittany]], so united the arms of that province with the typical arms of a Dauphin; [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], while Dauphin, was also King of Scots by marriage to [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]], and added the arms of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to those of the Dauphin).

Originally the Dauphin was personally responsible for the rule of the [[Dauphiné]], which was legally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and which the Emperors, in giving the rule of the province to the French heirs, had stipulated must never be united with France. Because of this, the Dauphiné suffered from anarchy in the 14th and 15th centuries, since the Dauphins were frequently minors or concerned with other matters.

During his period as Dauphin, Louis, son of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], defied his father by remaining in the province longer than the King permitted and by engaging in personal politics more beneficial to the Dauphiné than to France. For example, he married [[Charlotte of Savoy]] against his father's wishes. Savoy was a traditional ally of the Dauphiné, and Louis wished to reaffirm that alliance to stamp out rebels and robbers in the province. Louis was driven out of the Dauphiné by Charles VII's soldiers in 1456, leaving the region to fall back into disorder. After his succession as [[Louis XI of France]] in 1461, Louis united the Dauphiné with France, bringing it under royal control.

The title was automatically conferred upon the next heir apparent to the throne in the direct line upon birth, accession of the parent to the throne or death of the previous Dauphin, unlike the British title ''Prince of Wales'', which has always been in the gift of the monarch.

The sons of the King of France hold the style and rank of ''[[fils de France]]'' (son of France), while male-line grandsons hold the style and rank of ''petits-enfants de France'' (Grandson of France). The sons and grandsons of the Dauphin ranked higher than their cousins, being treated as the king's children and grandchildren respectively. The sons of the Dauphin, though grandsons of the king, are ranked as Sons of France, and the grandsons of the Dauphin ranked as Grandsons of France; other great-grandsons of the king ranked merely as [[Prince du sang|Princes of the Blood]].

The title was abolished by the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]], which made France a constitutional monarchy. Under the constitution the heir-apparent to the throne ([[Louis XVII of France|Dauphin Louis-Charles]] at that time) was restyled ''Prince Royal'' (a ''Prince of the Blood'' retitled ''prince français''), taking effect from the inception of the Legislative Assembly on 1 October 1791. The title was restored ''in potentia'' under the [[Bourbon Restoration]] of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], but there would not be another Dauphin until after his death. With the accession of his brother [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], Charles' son and heir [[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême]] automatically became Dauphin.

With the removal of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] the title fell into disuse, the heirs of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] being titled ''Prince Royal''. After the death of [[Henri, comte de Chambord]], [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid]], the heir of the [[legitimists|legitimist]] claimant, [[Juan, Count of Montizón]], made use of the title in [[Pretender|pretense]], as have the Spanish legitimist claimants since.

==In literature==
[[File:Lineographic Dauphin Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|right|A [[lineographic]] representation of the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the Dauphin. Designed by [[Jean de Beaugrand]] in 1604.]]
In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', Huck encounters two odd characters who turn out to be professional [[Confidence trick|con men]]. One of them claims that he should be treated with deference, since he is "really" an impoverished English [[duke]], and the other, not to be outdone, reveals that he is "really" the Dauphin ("[[Louis XVII of France|Looey the Seventeen]], son of [[Louis XVI of France|Looey the Sixteen]] and [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marry Antonet]]").

Is a character in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.

In [[Emma Orczy|Baronness Emma Orczy's]] ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]'', the [[Scarlet Pimpernel]] rescues the Dauphin from prison and helps spirit him from France.

[[Alphonse Daudet]] wrote a short story called "The Death of the Dauphin", about a young Dauphin who wants to stop Death from approaching him.

It is also mentioned in [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s ''[[Blood Meridian]]''.

[[The Dauphin (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|"The Dauphin"]] is a 1988 episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. As the titular character is female, the episode title gets the gender incorrect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">The definition of marriage varies widely by culture, region and jurisdiction.

==Terminology==
The stimulus for differentiating married and non-married individuals is sometimes based upon how the companions refer to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter, and Hansfried Kellner. "Marriage and the construction of reality: An exercise in the microsociology of knowledge." Diogenes 12.46 (1964): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the English language, terms used may be ''husband'' or ''wife'' or a gender-neutral term such as ''spouse''.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hongyu, and Paul R. Amato. "Predictors of divorce adjustment: Stressors, resources, and definitions." Journal of Marriage and Family 62.3 (2000): 655-668.&lt;/ref&gt; In third person, demographics of married people may be referred to by terms sch as ''wedders'',&lt;ref&gt;Culbertson, Tucker. "Arguments against Marriage Equality: Commemorating &amp; (and) Reconstructing Loving v. Virginia." Wash. UL Rev. 85 (2007): 575.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by more obscure and nonstandard terms such as ''wedlockers''&lt;ref&gt;Rachman, Arnold Wm. "Ferenczi's “Confusion of Tongues” theory and the analysis of the incest trauma." Psychoanalytic Social Work 7.1 (2000): 27-53.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''gamists''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caroline Hymanson|first1=Mary|title=Connections and contexts: a basic vocabulary|date=1981|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contention==
When there are social contentions regarding the definition of marriage a concerted effort to delineate the definition may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Duran. "Defining marriage and legitimacy." Current Anthropology 38.2 (1997): 237-253.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in response to movements in favor of same-sex marriage,  Robert H. Knight wrote:

:''Giving non-marital relationships the same status as marriage does not expand the definition of marriage; it destroys it. For example, if you declare that, because it has similar properties, grape juice must be labeled identically to wine, you have destroyed the definitions of both “grape juice” and “wine.” The term “marriage” refers specifically to the joining of two people of the opposite sex. When that is lost, the term “marriage” becomes meaningless.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fact-index.com/r/re/redefinition_of_marriage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
There may also be a distinction between a formal and an informal marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Garza, Sonya C. "Common Law Marriage: A Proposal for the Revival of a Dying Doctrine." New Eng. L. Rev. 40 (2005): 541.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter may incur various socioeconomic factors such as custody rights, pension rights, spousal support and distribution of property while the former may not.&lt;ref&gt;Schoonmaker IV, Samuel V., and Wendy Dunne DiChristina. "Repercussions of the Windsor Decision Beyond DOMA: Family, Tax, Estate, and Employment Issues." Fam. LQ 47 (2013): 409.&lt;/ref&gt; A prevailing theme within definitions of marriage tends to be that it is at one's discretion, and that unlike wedleases, it is meant to be enduring and lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Thomas W., and Nicola S. Peart. "The dualism of marriage laws in Africa." Acta Juridica (1983): 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the historical territory of [[Latvia]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnic background]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Background==

[[Latvia]] was settled by the Baltic tribes some three millennia ago. The territories along the eastern Baltic first came under foreign domination at the beginning of the 13th century, with the formal establishment of Riga in 1201 under the German [[Teutonic Knights]].

Latvia, in whole or in parts, remained under foreign rule for the next eight centuries, finding itself at the cross-roads of all the regional superpowers of their day, including [[Denmark]] (the Danes held on lands around the [[Gulf of Riga]]), [[Sweden]], and [[Russia]], with southern (Courland) Latvia being at one time a vassal to Poland-Lithuania as well as Latgale falling directly under Poland-Lithuania rule. Through all this time, Latvia remained largely under Baltic German hegemony, with Baltic Germans comprising the largest land-owners, a situation which did not change until Latvia's independence.

Historically, Latvia has had significant [[German people|German]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] minorities. The majority (roughly two thirds) of Latvians, under Swedish influences, adopted Lutheranism, while the minority (the remaining third) of Latvians under Poland-Lithuania, Latgale in particular, retained their Catholicism. Aglona, in Latgale, has been the site of annual Catholic pilgrimage for centuries, even through to today.

Recently introduced immigration law in Latvia provides framework for immigration through investment in various financial areas or real estate. In 2012, solely 2,435&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration-residency.eu/faq/latvia-real-estate-statistics-residence-permit-requests-history/|title=Statistics - residence permit requests|website=Immigration-residency.eu|date=2013|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications for residence permit by investment in real estate were received by Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs. Main immigrant countries are [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Lithuania]] (Lithuania is in the [[European Union]], thus no investment is needed). Moreover, Latvia receives residence permit applications from people of nationalities such as [[Afghans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Libyans]] and people from various other distant countries.

Latvia's indigenous population has been ravaged numerous times throughout history. The earliest such event occurred during the conquest of Latvia by Peter the Great in the [[Great Northern War]] with Sweden.

In 1897, the first official census in this area indicated that Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, Germans for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%. The remainder were Lithuanians, Estonians, Gypsies, and various other nationalities.

The demographics shifted greatly in the 20th century due to the world wars, the expulsion of the [[Baltic Germans]], the [[Holocaust]], and [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|occupation]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. Today, only the Russian minority, which has tripled in numbers since 1935, remains important. The share of ethnic Latvians grew from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 80% (1,508,800), after human loss in World War II and human deportation and other repressive measures, fell strongly to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989.

In 2005, there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989, though their share of the population was larger - 1,357,099 (58.8% of the inhabitants). People who arrived in Latvia during the Soviet era, and their descendants born before 21 August 1991, have to pass a naturalisation process to receive Latvian citizenship. Their children born after the restoration of independence in 1991 are registered as citizens, if one of the parents requests it.

Ethnic Latvians have been one of the world's slowest-growing ethnic groups for a century. The number of Latvians today is actually less than it was in the 1920s.

Over 130,000 persons have been naturalized as Latvian citizens since 1995, but 290,660 persons, as of March 2011, live in Latvia with non-citizen's passports. Large numbers of Russians, as well as some Ukrainians and Belarusians remained in Latvia after the fall of the Soviet Union.

According to the provisional results of the Population and Housing Census 2011, the total population of Latvia on 1 March 2011 was 2,067,887. Since the previous census in 2000 the country's population decreased by 309 thousand or 13%. The proportion of ethnic Latvians increased to 62.1% of the population.&lt;ref name="csb.gov.lv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistikas-temas/population-census-2011-key-indicators-33613.html|title=Population Census 2011 - Key Indicators - Latvijas statistika|website=Csb.gov.lv|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livonians]] are the other indigenous ethnic group, with about 100 of them remaining. [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]] are a distinctive subgroup of Latvians inhabiting or coming from [[Latgale|Eastern Latvia]].

According to rankings provided by the United States Census Bureau—International Data Base (IDB)—Country Rankings, Latvia is estimated to have a population of 1,249,812 in the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/rank.php|title=International Data Base Country Rankings|website=Census.gov|accessdate=September 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329060848/https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/rank.php|archive-date=March 29, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
Illegal immigration in Latvia has traditionally been from neighboring countries such as Russia but now migrants also come from other areas such as Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Illegal immigrants from Africa and Latin America increase in Latvia  |work=[[The Baltic Times]]|date=|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/21117/|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian government have sought to work with Russia to stem the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Estonia urges cooperation with Russia in fighting illegal immigration |work=[[Baltic Review]] |date= |url=http://baltic-review.com/2010/03/estonia-urges-cooperation-with-russia-in-fighting-illegal-immigration/ |accessdate=2012-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414155948/http://baltic-review.com/2010/03/estonia-urges-cooperation-with-russia-in-fighting-illegal-immigration/ |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian government has been criticized for its treatment of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 2009 Human Rights Report: Latvia |work=[[US State Department]]|date=|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136040.htm|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= New measures for restricting employment of illegal immigrants |work=Saeima Press Service|date=|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/news/saeima-news/18645-new-measures-for-restricting-employment-of-illegal-immigrants|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-statement|date=May 2017}}

For an [[immigrant]] not to become an illegal resident, a [[License|permit]] is required for a foreign national or a [[stateless person]] wishing to reside in the [[Republic of Latvia]] for more than 90 days within a 6-month period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Statistics show immigration in Latvia is growing   |work=Baltic Legal|date=|url= http://blog.baltic-legal.com/page-immigration-in-latvia-is-growing-recently-migration-statistics-2012-aug.htm|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus if the person does not acquire himself a residence permit, he will be considered an illegal immigrant.

==Ethnic groups==
[[File:Латвия.ру.png|thumb|500px|Distribution of Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians in 2011]]
[[File:Ethnic groups in Latvia.png|thumb|right|500px|Ethnic Latvians and Russians]]
[[File:Smaller minorities in Latvia.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Smaller ethnic minorities]]

Latvians have always been the largest ethnic group in Latvia during the past century, but minority peoples have always been numerous. Before WW II the proportion of non-Latvians was approximately 25%, the Russians being the largest minority (app. 10%), followed by Jews (approx. 5%), Germans and Poles (2–3%). After World War 2 only small numbers of Jews and Germans remained and following a massive immigration of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians, Latvians almost became a minority. In 1989, the proportion of Latvians had decreased to only 52% (from 75.5% in 1935). Despite the decreasing number of Latvians due to low fertility rates, the proportion of Latvians has considerably increased during the past two decades and reached 62.1% in 2011 (slightly higher than the 62.0% in 1959). This is due to large scale emigration of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. The number of these peoples almost halved between 1989 and 2011.

*[[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Roman Catholic]]&amp;nbsp;– 500,000&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx |title=Tieslietu ministrijā iesniegtie reliģisko organizāciju pārskati par darbību 2011. gadā |language=Latvian |accessdate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126013327/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx |archivedate=26 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]&amp;nbsp;– 370,000&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija" /&gt;

In the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2010, 38% of Latvian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", while 48% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 11% stated that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".

Lutheranism was more prominent before the Soviet occupation, when it was a majority religion of ~60% due to strong historical links with the [[Nordic countries]] and influence of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], and [[Germany]] in general. Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a slightly greater extent than Roman Catholicism in all three [[Baltic states]]. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of 18 March 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in Latvia, but the faith has since experienced a revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/latvia/SOCIETY.html |title=Latvia&amp;nbsp;– SOCIETY |publisher=Mongabay.com |date=18 March 1987 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, modern [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations are spreading worldwide, including Latvia. The country's Orthodox Christians belong to the [[Latvian Orthodox Church]], a semi-autonomous body within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In 2011, there were 416 [[Jews]] and 319 [[Islam in Latvia|Muslims]] living in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt;

There are more than 600 Latvian [[neopaganism|neopagan]]s, ''[[Dievturība|Dievturi]]'' (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on [[Latvian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibelesbiedriba.lv/religiju-enciklopedija/statistika.html|title=Statistics of approved parishes in Latvia|date=1 January 2004|accessdate=7 March 2007|work=Reliģiju Enciklopēdija|publisher=The Latvian Bible Society|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt;

'''Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico''' dates back to the beginning of [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Immigrants have moved from the territory of the [[Dominican Republic]] to its eastern neighbor, [[Puerto Rico]], and vice versa for centuries.&lt;ref name=Duany&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duany |first=Jorge |year=2005 |title=Dominican migration to Puerto Rico: A transnational perspective |journal=Centro Journal, spring |volume=XVII |issue=001 |pages=242–269 |publisher=City University of New York.

In recent years, the rate of Dominican immigration has declined due to the unemployment and [[Puerto Rico government-debt crisis|economic crisis]] in Puerto Rico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puerto Ricans flock to US mainland as island crisis worsens|url=https://news.yahoo.com/puerto-ricans-flock-us-mainland-island-crisis-worsens-221252402.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there's been increasing immigration in the opposite direction, from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puerto Rican Migrants Drawn To Dominican Republic To Escape Economic Crisis|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/173682/20160127/puerto-rican-migrants-drawn-dominican-republic-escape-economic-crisis.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puerto Ricans flee to Dominican Republic to escape U.S. territory's economic crisis|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/money/2016/01/26/puerto-ricans-flee-to-dominican-republic-to-escape-us-territory-economic-crisis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico debt crisis headed for U.S.-style bankruptcy resolution|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/23/us-puertorico-debt-analysis-idUSKBN0FS0A420140723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;bigstory.ap.org/article/25dfa7db079241eab2f8ab58122aef7a/dominican-economy-lures-puerto-ricans-crisis&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haitian people|Haitian nationals]] now make the majority of persons trying to reach the commonwealth nation from the island of [[Hispaniola]], usually with the aid of Dominican smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/haitian-immigrants-puerto-rico-_n_3225298.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Puerto Rico Used As A Gateway To The U.S | date=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://coastguardnews.com/coast-guard-repatriates-86-haitian-migrants-detains-3-dominican-smugglers-near-desecheo-island-puerto-rico/2013/10/08/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Haitians+apparently+drown+near+Puerto+Rico+island+after+being/9149228/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228191928/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Haitians+apparently+drown+near+Puerto+Rico+island+after+being/9149228/story.html |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1795 to 1961==
Many residents of [[History of the Dominican Republic|clColonial Santo Domingo]], now the Dominican Republic, left for Puerto Rico because of the cession of Santo Domingo to France in 1795, the [[Haiti|Haitian]] invasions from 1801 to 1803, and the occupation from 1822 to 1844. Immigration continued over the next 86 years although at a comparatively low rate.

The dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]] from 1930 and 1961 greatly constrained foreign travel by Dominicans. In 1960, there were 1,812 Dominicans in Puerto Rico, some of whom were "returning" descendants of Puerto Ricans who had themselves migrated to the Dominican Republic.

==Recently==
Dominican migration increased sharply after 1961 as a result of political events, of which the first was the assassination of Trujillo that year. Many politicians and other members of the conservative former regime, as well as government employees, left the country, many of them for Puerto Rico. The next major political event to drive emigration was the [[coup d'état]] against the elected, leftist president [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in 1963. Then followed the Dominican Civil War in 1965 after a revolt to restore Bosch. The United States [[Operation Power Pack|invaded the Dominican Republic]] a few days into the conflict, and one of its policies was to prevent renewed civil war by issuing visas to opponents or potential opponents of the newly-elected US-backed conservative regime of [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (who was incidentally, like Bosch, of Puerto Rican ancestry). Many of the visaholders traveled to Puerto Rico.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Politics continued to play a role in emigration in succeeding decades, as [[Government of the Dominican Republic|presidential election years]] produced emigration peaks whenever Balaguer, a member of the former Trujillo regime, won the presidency, as happened in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986, and 1990. As a result, most of the Dominican emigration was middle-class and skilled, including many managers and professionals.&lt;ref name=Duany/&gt;

Although there are substantial [[upper class]] and [[middle class]] segments in the Dominican Republic, the country also has a high poverty rate. Since the 1970s, the poor [[economy of the Dominican Republic]] has rampantly driven emigration. Overall, between 1966 and 2002 119,000 Dominicans were legally admitted to Puerto Rico, while many thousands arrived illegally. Most emigrants, however, are far from destitute, as they tend to be jobholders in the Dominican Republic, many in skilled occupations such as mechanic, mason, seamstress, and nurse. Such migrants have been attracted by the [[economy of Puerto Rico]]'s higher wages, which have generally tended to rise in relation to Dominican wages since the early 1980s, when an era of frequent devaluation of the Dominican peso began. Economic crises that beset the Dominican Republic in the 1980s further increased emigration. Despite strong economic growth, the 1990s marked the peak in Dominican emigration&gt;because of the high income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Castro |first=Max J. |author2=Thomas D. Boswell |date=January 2002 |title=The Dominican Diaspora Revisited: Dominicans And Dominican-Americans In A New Century |journal=North-South Agenda Papers |issue=Fifty–three |publisher=University of Miami North-South Center |url=http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/cam03/cam03.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-03-17 |isbn=1-57454-113-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another severe economic crisis hit in 2003 to 2004, again causing a surge in emigration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Illegal immigration==
[[File:Dominican boat.jpg|frame|Abandoned yola in the coast of [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]]]
The [[Illegal immigration|illegal or undocumented]] component of the Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico has increased over recent decades, becoming large enough to attract great attention, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The first recorded illegal trip took place in 1972, and perhaps 28% of all Dominicans in Puerto Rico were undocumented in 1996, during the peak decade of Dominican immigration to the Commonwealth; many of the documented residents had regularized their originally undocumented status.&lt;!--There were believed to be between 100,000 and 150,000 illegal Dominican immigrants living in Puerto Rico as of 2007.&lt;ref name=ap&gt; {{cite news |first=|last=|title= Pedro Saul Perez |url=http://www.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=APStory&amp;Id=13499|work= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=Legacy.com |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; dead link--&gt; Illegal immigration has been one of the most recurrent themes in Puerto Rican [[news media]] during the first decade of the 21st century.

Illegal trips usually take place in ''yolas'' (small wooden boats), usually overcrowded, as trip planners and boat captains seek to realize the greatest profit from the ventures. A trip on a ''yola'' takes 26–28 hours and takes place over the [[Puerto Rico Trench]] (an underwater [[Volcanic crater|crater]] area) or through the [[Mona Passage]]. Accounts by survivors include people being either eaten alive by sharks or forced to jump into the sea when there is a danger of sinking. Others tell of seeing their loved ones left behind to drown after a heavy wave has overturned one of these ''yolas'', and many others tell of corpses left on board. Travelers sometimes die of [[starvation]] or [[dehydration]] since the ''yolas'' can get lost out at sea for days, and many have no type of navigation equipment on board to steer them in the right direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/world/dominicans-saved-from-sea-tell-of-attacks-and-deaths-of-thirst.html| title=Dominicans Saved From Sea Tell of Attacks and Deaths of Thirst | publisher=The New York Times| date=2004-08-12| accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted tragedies on such trips include a 1989 sinking near [[Mona Island]] where as many as 500 perished, and other, comparatively small tragedies where groups of 30 or more passengers have died. Perhaps the most famous of these tragic trips was the Nagua Tragedy, named so because the yola heading to Puerto Rico that time sunk while trying to make its way out of a beach in [[Nagua]]. More than one hundred died, including the boat's captain and the trip planner.

In November 2008, a group of 33 illegal Dominican migrants who were en route to Puerto Rico were forced to resort to cannibalism after they were lost at sea for over 15 days before being rescued by a [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] patrol boat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27531105/ Dominican migrant: We ate flesh to survive - A small group turned to cannibalism after being stranded in mid-ocean], MSNBC.com, November 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be pointed out that not all illegal trips to Puerto Rico from the Dominican Republic end in tragedy. These trips are massively scheduled by traffickers, who sometimes travel up to three times each week from Puerto Rico to illegally bring Dominicans. But, because of the large amount of lives that have been lost in many of these trips, both the governments of [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] and the Dominican Republic have launched [[mass media]] campaigns to try to reduce them. In the Dominican Republic, videos of dead bodies on the water are shown on television to try to deter people from travelling to Puerto Rico on ''yolas''. The traffickers face long periods in jail if caught, whereas the travelers are deported to the Dominican Republic, where they do not face criminal charges. 

In 2009 an order was given by Governor [[Luis Fortuño]] to shut off essential services, such as water and electricity, to Villas del Sol, a [[shantytown]] within the municipality of [[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]]. The shantytown consisted mainly of homes built illegally on flood-prone government-owned land. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] bought these homes from the Puerto Rican Government in order to keep them from being used further. In January 2010 the island government began demolishing some of the homes whose residents are both U.S. citizens and undocumented aliens, mainly of Dominican origin.

==Current circumstances==
Dominicans in Puerto Rico are largely disadvantaged [[Politics of Puerto Rico|politically]], in great part because so many are not citizens. They are also disadvantaged economically, and possess on average much lower [[Education in Puerto Rico|levels of education]] than the mainstream of Puerto Ricans on the island. That is in contrast to their situation in the 1970s, when a demographic study considered Dominican immigrants to be "privileged" and an "elite," as a large percentage of Dominican immigrants were professionals and managers. Their present characteristics have made them easy victims for ethnic discrimination, which include accusations of excessive use of government programs. They are often targets of prejudice and [[racism]] as well. In response, dozens of organizations have sprouted to increase the group's political participation, although these efforts' full effectiveness is hampered by inadequate coordination.

The group is not ignored by Dominican politicians, however. The main [[List of political parties in the Dominican Republic|Dominican parties]] campaign in Puerto Rico during presidential elections and raise important amounts of funds from the Dominican residents. Dominicans in Puerto Rico send millions of dollars per month to their relatives in the Dominican Republic, and are thus also important as a source of foreign currency for the D.R.

The 2010 census estimated a population of 68,036 Dominicans in Puerto Rico,&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web |url =http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S0201PR&amp;prodType=table|title= SELECTED POPULATION PROFILE IN PUERTO RICO 2009-2011 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates |accessdate=2011-11-09 |work=Data Set: 2010 U.S. Census |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; equal to 1.8% of the Commonwealth's population. Data from the 2000 census shows that 55% of this group lived in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan municipality]], 11% in [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], and 7% in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]].  San Juan is about 9% Dominican, with a moderate concentration in the [[Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico|Rio Piedras]] district, in the southern part of the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid%3DDEC_10_SF1_QTP10%26prodType%3Dtable |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218203429/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_QTP10&amp;prodType=table |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Dominican immigrants in Puerto Rico, are black or mulatto/mixed, with very few Dominicans in Puerto Rico self-identifying as white.&lt;ref name="2010 Census"&gt;{{cite news|title=2010 Census |publisher=Medgar Evers College |url=http://2010.census.gov/partners/materials/factsheets-pr.php |accessdate=2010-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611082314/http://2010.census.gov/partners/materials/factsheets-pr.php |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Dominicans that settle in Puerto Rico, have lived in the Dominican Republic for generations prior to immigrating to Puerto Rico. Women form a fairly large majority of the Dominicans in Puerto Rico. Intermarriage rates with Puerto Ricans are also high. Although the Dominican community has largely assimilated into the mainstream Puerto Rican population, due to very similar culture, they still retain traditions that uniquely Dominican. About 67% of Dominicans in Puerto Rico are legal citizens.&lt;ref name="2010 Census"/&gt;

Economically, Dominicans contribute most as unskilled and low-paid service workers, as operators, laborers and craftspeople, and they are well represented as small business owners. Their ratio of managers and professionals — 24% in 1970, higher than for mainstream Puerto Ricans at that time — is now much lower. However, Dominicans are employed in all occupations and industrial sectors of Puerto Rico's economy. Many members of the group have attained prominence and fame as entertainers, including musicians, singers, actors, and presenters.

The '''Fiestas Patrias''' (literally '''Native Land Holidays''')&lt;ref&gt;Collins Spanish to English Dictionary, [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/spanish-english/patrio patrio].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Chile]] consist of two days, with a third one added on some years:
* 18 September, in commemoration of the proclamation of the First Governing Body of 1810, and marking the beginning of the [[Chilean Independence|Chilean independence process]].
* 19 September, known as the "Day of the Glories of the [[Chilean army|Army]]".
* Since 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feriadoschilenos.cl/index.html#DiaDeLaLibacionNacional | title=Días Feriados en Chile | accessdate=25 Aug 2018 | language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17 September (if it should be a Monday) or 20 September (if it should be a Friday) will be included as well.

Within Chile the Fiestas Patrias are often referred to as the Dieciocho, or "18th" because the celebration occurs on September 18. Unofficially, the celebration can last for around a week, depending on when it falls. For example, if the 18th is a Wednesday, public holidays are from Wednesday the 18th to Friday the 20th and celebrations begin the afternoon of Tuesday the 17th and continue until Sunday the 22nd. It is held close to the spring equinox of the Southern Hemisphere so it doubles as a spring festival. Chile's Declaration of Independence happened on February 12. Most schools and jobs declare a week-long [[Annual leave|vacation]] for the holiday. This day is very important to the Chilean people because they are celebrating their freedom from Spanish rule.

==Activities==
The celebration of Fiestas Patrias is an expression of Chilean culture. Traditional activities associated with the Dieciocho include [[Chilean rodeo]], dancing the [[cueca]], going to [[fondas]], and barbecue.&lt;ref name=Stgotimes2&gt;

Officially, activities on September eighteen are centered on a religious celebration "[[Te Deum Ecuménico de Fiestas Patrias]]".&lt;ref name=Stgotimes1 /&gt; This ceremony, which is organized by the [[Catholic Church]] and led by the [[Archbishop of Santiago (Chile)|Archbishop of Santiago]], has taken place since 1811 when it was started by [[José Miguel Carrera]].&lt;ref name=Stgotimes1 /&gt; In 1971, President [[Salvador Allende]] asked that the celebration become more ecumenical, encompassing the diverse religious beliefs throughout the country. The ceremony itself begins at 11:00am in the [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza de Armas]].&lt;ref name=Stgotimes1&gt;{{cite web

Military parades and civil school parades are held on this day in major cities and towns nationwide. Many Chileans travel during the Fiestas Patrias to visit family, friends and relatives in other parts of the country and join the celebrations there. In Santiago, many people travel to resorts on the Pacific coast, especially [[Viña del Mar]] and the [[Litoral Central]] region. It is estimated that 2 million Chileans—nearly one-eighth of the country's population—travel during this holiday.

September 19, the anniversary of the installation of the First Government Council and the very first military parade in Chilean history, marks the grand finale: the [[Great Military Parade of Chile]] commemorating the glories of the Chilean Army, on Santiago's [[O'Higgins Park]] and overseen by the [[President of Chile]] in his/her performance of his/her constitutional mandate as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=Stgotimes2 /&gt; Attracting millions of people, and simulcast live on radio, television and on the Internet, the parade, led by the [[Chilean Armed Forces]] ([[Chilean Army]], [[Chilean Navy]] and [[Chilean Air Force]]) and the [[Carabineros de Chile]], takes place in the afternoon, and (when September 19th is a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday) marks the end of the holiday.

==Traditional food==
[[Image:Asado dieciochero.jpg|thumb|Barbecue or ''Asado Chileno''|190px]]
Consumption of traditional Chilean foods is one of the principal displays of the Fiestas Patrias.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; Chileans prepare these foods in their homes, or they go to [[fondas]].&lt;ref name=about /&gt; Fondas are venues, often tents, prepared and decorated for the Fiestas Patrias where traditional Chilean dishes and beverages are served. The largest fondas are found in [[Parque O'Higgins]]. Each year the Chilean President kicks off the Fiestas Patrias celebrations at one of these locales. For many years, the selected fonda was [[La Grandiosa Bertita]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;

The predominant food associated with the Fiestas Patrias are [[Empanada#Chile|Chilean empanadas]], which are a sort of bread pastry. The filling of these empanadas consist of ''pino'', a mixture of chopped beef and onion, as well as half of a hard-boiled egg, raisins, and an olive. Many Chileans also throw a barbecue for the Fiestas Patrias. During this time sales of meat products exceed $50 million.

During the Fiestas Patrias the preferred drink is [[chicha]], a lightly alcoholic beverage typically made from grapes, although apple chicha is popular in southern Chile. Red wine enjoys popularity during the holiday, while [[pisco]], the so-called "national liquor", becomes secondary.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

[[Alfajor]]es are a typical dessert. They consist of two lightly breaded cookies joined with [[manjar]], a sweet filling made from caramelized condensed milk.

==Use of the flag==
In Chile, it is mandatory to hang the Chilean flag from every building in the country on 18 and 19 September (and 21 May as well).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=18035&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2013-01-29 | title=Decreto 1534 de 1967 del Ministerio del Interior | accessdate=25 Aug 2018 | language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag should be in perfect condition, hung from a white pole or from the front of every building, horizontally or vertically. If hung vertically, the star should always be in the upper left corner, visible from the front of the building. Violation of this rule is punishable with fines in local currency of up to 40,000 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] (about US$80),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=322276|publisher=Emol.com|language=es|title=Carabineros recordó obligación de poner la bandera el 18 y 19 de septiembre|date=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not strictly enforced.

'''Ganeriwala family''' are a business family from [[Rajasthan, India]]. They are an aristocratic [[Marwari people|Marwari]] family, connected with the social and cultural history of India, holding the prefix of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Sethji's''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. The family rose in dominance and fame in the 1800s after founding one of India's largest banking dynasties, often referred to as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''The Great Ganeriwala Firm&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. The firm provided loans, credit services, insurance and currency exchange services at 22 branch offices spawned across the princely states of India. Members of the family have been credited for the construction of various Hindu temples across India during the British Raj of India, and opulent ''haveli's'' &lt;nowiki/&gt;in Rajasthan.

&lt;nowiki/&gt;Shobharam Birla, the grandfather of Raja [[Baldeo Das Birla]], was a munim (accountant) at the Great Ganeriwala firm, before the [[Birla family|Birlas]] emerged as the leading industrialists of India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pDlj7rwlDK0C&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;dq=ganeriwal+birla&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c8DK8h5c6E&amp;sig=45pNthUtFxUqYntMToBpJJt1R5Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j6VTVYvQGcX8oAS9poGYAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ganeriwal%20&amp;f=false Brushes With History, Krishna Kumar Birla, Penguin UK, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/a-man-of-our-times/article1-268912.aspx A man of our times Hindustan Times, May 21, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Great Ganeriwala Firm,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Industrial Entrepreneurship of Shekhawati Marwaris, D.K.

The '''Military Administration in France''' ({{lang-de|Militärverwaltung in Frankreich}}; {{lang-fr|Occupation de la France par l'Allemagne}}) was an [[military Administration (Nazi Germany)|interim occupation authority]] established by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] to administer the occupied zone in areas of northern and western [[France]]. This so-called ''{{lang|fr|zone occupée}}'' was renamed ''{{lang|fr|zone nord}}'' ("north zone") in November 1942, when the previously unoccupied zone in the south known as ''{{lang|fr|[[zone libre]]}}'' ("free zone") was also occupied and renamed ''{{lang|fr|zone sud}}'' ("south zone").

Its role in France was partly governed by the conditions set by the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Second Armistice at {{lang|fr|Compiègne|nocat=y}}]] after the {{lang|de|[[blitzkrieg]]}} success of the {{lang|de|[[Wehrmacht]]}} leading to the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]]; at the time both French and Germans thought the occupation would be temporary and last only until Britain came to terms, which was believed to be imminent. For instance, France agreed that its [[french prisoners of war in World War II|soldiers would remain prisoners of war]] until the cessation of all hostilities.

Replacing the [[French Third Republic]] that had dissolved during France's defeat was the "French State" (''{{lang|fr|État français}}''), with its sovereignty and authority limited to the free zone. As [[Paris]] was located in the occupied zone, its government was seated in the spa town of [[Vichy]] in {{lang|fr|[[Auvergne]]}}, and therefore it was more commonly known as [[Vichy France]].

While the Vichy government was nominally in charge of all of France, the military administration in the occupied zone was a ''{{lang|la|[[de facto]]}}'' [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] dictatorship. Its rule was extended to the free zone when it was invaded by Germany and Italy during ''{{lang|fr|[[Case Anton]]}}'' on 11 November 1942 in response to [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in [[French North Africa]] on 8 November 1942. The Vichy government remained in existence, even though its authority was now severely curtailed.

The military administration in France ended with the [[Liberation of France]] after the [[Normandy landings|Normandy]] and [[Operation Dragoon|Provence landings]]. It formally existed from May 1940 to December 1944, though most of its territory had been liberated by the Allies by the end of summer 1944.

[[Alsace-Lorraine]], which had been annexed after the [[Franco-Prussian war]] in 1871 by the [[German Empire]] and returned to France after the First World War, was [[Alsace-Lorraine#World War II|re-annexed]] by the [[Third Reich]] (thus [[malgré-nous|subjecting their male population to German military conscription]].)

The occupied zone ({{lang-fr|zone occupée}}, {{IPA-fr|zon ɔkype}}, {{lang-de|Besetztes Gebiet}}) consisted of the rest of northern and western France, including the two forbidden zones.

The southern part of France, except for the western half of [[Aquitaine]] along the Atlantic coast, became the ''[[zone libre]]'' ("free zone"), where the [[Vichy regime]] remained sovereign as an independent state, though under heavy German influence due to the restrictions of the Armistice (including a heavy tribute) and economical dependency on Germany. It constituted a land area of 246,618 square kilometres, approximately 45 percent of France, and included approximately 33 percent of the total French labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://www.defense.gouv.fr/sga/content/download/46040/457868/file/n7_-_la_ligne_de_demarcation_mc07.pdf  |title= "La ligne de démarcation", Collection " Mémoire et Citoyenneté ", No.7  }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[demarcation line (France)|demarcation line]] between the free zone and the occupied zone was a de facto border, necessitating special authorisation and a [[Laissez-Passer|laissez-passer]] from the German authorities to cross.&lt;ref name="jackson247"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jackson|first1=Julian|title=France: the dark years, 1940-1944|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2003|page=247|isbn=0-19-925457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian occupation zone was also occupied by Germany and added to the ''zone sud'' after [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy's surrender in September 1943]], except for Corsica, [[Italian-occupied Corsica#Liberation of Corsica|which was liberated]] by the landings of [[Free French forces]] and local Italian troops that had switched sides to the Allies.

== Administrative structure ==
After Germany and France agreed on an [[armistice]] following the defeats of May and June, Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and [[Charles Huntziger|General Charles Huntzinger]], representatives of the [[Third Reich]] and of the French government of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] respectively, signed it on 22 June 1940 at the Rethondes clearing in [[Compiègne Forest]]. As it was done at the same place and in the same railroad carriage where the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice ending the First World War]] when Germany surrendered, it is known as the [[Second Compiègne|Second Compiègne armistice]].

France was roughly divided into an occupied northern zone and an unoccupied southern zone, according to the armistice convention "in order to protect the interests of the German Reich".&lt;ref name=conc&gt;[http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/1940armistice.htm La convention d'armistice], sur le site de l'Université de Perpignan, ''mjp.univ-perp.fr'', accessed 29 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[French colonial empire#Second French colonial empire|French colonial empire]] remained under the authority of Marshall Pétain's Vichy regime. French sovereignty was to be exercised over the whole of French territory, including the occupied zone, Alsace and Moselle, but the third article of the armistice stipulated that French authorities in the occupied zone would have to obey the military administration and that Germany would exercise rights of an occupying power within it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the occupied region of France, the German Reich exercises all of the rights of an [[Military occupation|occupying power]]. The French government undertakes to facilitate in every way possible the implementation of these rights, and to provide the assistance of the French administrative services to that end. The French government will immediately direct all officials and administrators of the occupied territory to comply with the regulations of, and to collaborate fully with, the German military authorities.&lt;ref name=conc/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The military administration was responsible for [[civil affairs]] in occupied France. It was divided into ''Kommandanturen'' (singular ''[[Kommandantur]]''), in decreasing hierarchical order ''Oberfeldkommandanturen'', ''Feldkommandanturen'', ''Kreiskommandanturen'', and ''Ortskommandanturen''.  [[Naval regions and districts of the Kriegsmarine#France and the Low Countries|German naval affairs in France]] were coordinated through a central office known as the ''Höheres Kommando der Marinedienststellen in Groß-Paris'' (Supreme Command for Naval Services in the Greater Paris Area) who in turn answered to a senior commander for all of France known as the ''Admiral Frankreich''.  After [[Case Anton]], the "Admiral Frankreich" naval command was broken apart into smaller offices which answered directly to the operational command of [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Navy Group Commands|Navy Group West]].

== Collaboration ==
{{see also|Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#France|Collaborationism#France}}

In order to suppress partisans and resistance fighters, the military administration cooperated closely with the [[Gestapo]], the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'', the intelligence service of the [[SS]], and the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'', its security police. It also had at its disposal the support of the French authorities and police forces, who had to cooperate per the conditions set in the armistice, to [[Holocaust in France|round up Jews]], anti-fascists and other dissidents, and vanish them into ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'', "Night and Fog". It also had the help of collaborationists auxiliaries like the ''[[Milice]]'', the ''[[Franc-Garde]]s'' and the [[Service d'ordre légionnaire|Legionary Order Service]]. The two main collaborationist political parties were the [[French Popular Party]] (PPF) and the [[National Popular Rally]] (RNP), each with 20,000 to 30,000 members.

The ''Milice'' participated with Lyon Gestapo head [[Klaus Barbie]] in seizing members of the resistance and minorities including Jews for shipment to detention centres, such as the [[Drancy deportation camp]], en route to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and other German concentration camps, including [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Buchenwald]].

Some Frenchmen also volunteered directly in German forces to fight for Germany and/or against [[Bolsheviks]], such as the [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]]. Volunteers from this and other outfits later constituted the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS ''Charlemagne'' (1st French)]].

[[Stanley Hoffmann]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="S_H"&gt;{{cite book |first=Stanley |last=Hoffmann |chapter=La droite à Vichy |title=Essais sur la France: déclin ou renouveau? |publisher=Le Seuil |location=Paris |year=1974 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after him, other historians such as [[Robert Paxton]] and [[Jean-Pierre Azéma]] have used the term ''collaborationnistes'' to refer to fascists and Nazi sympathisers who, for ideological reasons, wished a reinforced collaboration with Hitler's Germany, in contrast to "collaborators", people who merely cooperated out of self-interest. Examples of these are PPF leader [[Jacques Doriot]], writer [[Robert Brasillach]] or [[Marcel Déat]]. A principal motivation and ideological foundation among ''collaborationnistes'' was [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref name="S_H"/&gt;

== Occupation forces ==
The Wehrmacht maintained a varying number of divisions in [[France]]. 100,000 Germans were in the whole of the German-zone in France in December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.conncoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=histhp&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dpopulation%2Bof%2Boccupied%2Bfrance%2B1942%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26oq%3Dpopulation%2Bof%2Boccupied%2Bfrance%2B1942%26gs_l%3Dheirloom-serp.3...3787.5186.0.5673.9.9.0.0.0.0.135.908.1j7.8.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-serp..2.7.817.cGRBuVZx-Vc#search=%22population%20occupied%20france%201942%22|title=The Civilian Experience in German Occupied France, 1940-1944 |publisher=Connecticut College}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the bulk of the Wehrmacht was fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]], German units were rotated to France to rest and refit. The number of troops increased when the threat of Allied invasion began looming large, with the [[Dieppe raid]] marking its real beginning. The actions of [[British Commandos]] against German troops brought Hitler to condemn them as [[irregular warfare]]. In his [[Commando Order]] he denied them lawful combatant status, and ordered them to be handed over to the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SS security service]] when captured and liable to be [[Summary execution|summarily executed]]. As the war went on, garrisoning the [[Atlantic Wall]] and suppressing the resistance became heavier and heavier duties.

Some notable units and formations stationed in France during the occupation:

*1940: ''[[Luftflotte 2]]'', ''[[Luftflotte 3]]'' operated from airfields in northern France during the [[Battle of Britain]]. ''Luftflotte 3'' stayed there to defend against the [[Allied bombing of Germany|allied strategic bombings]] until it had to retreat in 1944.
*1941: Battlecruisers {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}. The battleship [[battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] was sunk while trying to reach French Atlantic harbors after its commissioning.
*1942: [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS Panzer Division ''Das Reich'']], [[4th SS Police Regiment]]
*1943: At the height of the [[battle of the Atlantic]], between 60 and over a 100 German [[U-boat]]s were [[Submarine pen#France|stationed in submarine pens]] in French Atlantic ports such as [[La Rochelle]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Brest, France|Brest]], and [[Lorient]].
*1944: [[8th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|157th Mountain (Reserve) Division]], ''[[Panzer Lehr]]'', [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|XIXth Army]], [[716th Static Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|716th Static Infantry Division]], [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division ''Hitlerjugend'']].

== Anti-partisan actions ==
{{further|French Resistance}}
[[File:Member of the FFI.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A volunteer of the French Resistance interior force (FFI) at [[Châteaudun]] in 1944]]
The "[[Appeal of 18 June]]" by de Gaulle's [[Free France]] government in exile in London had little immediate effect, and few joined its [[French Forces of the Interior]] beyond those that had already gone into exile to join the Free French. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, the [[French communist party]], hitherto under orders from the [[Comintern]] to remain passive against the German occupiers, began to mount actions against them. De Gaulle sent [[Jean Moulin]] back to France as his formal link to the irregulars throughout the occupied country to coordinate [[List of networks and movements of the French Resistance|the eight major ''Résistance'' groups]] into one organisation. Moulin got their agreement to form the "National Council of the Resistance" (''[[Conseil National de la Résistance]]'').

Moulin was eventually captured, and died under brutal torture by the [[Gestapo]], possibly by [[Klaus Barbie]] himself. The resistance intensified after it became clear the tide of war had shifted after the Reich's defeat at [[Stalingrad]] in early 1943 and, by 1944, large remote areas were out of the German military's control and free zones for the ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquisards]]'', so-called after the [[maquis shrubland]] that provided ideal terrain for [[guerrilla warfare]].

The most important anti-partisan action was the [[Battle of Vercors]]. The most infamous one [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre]]. Other notable atrocities committed were the [[Tulle massacre]], the [[Le Paradis massacre]], the [[Maillé massacre]], and the [[Ascq massacre]]. Large maquis where significant military operations were conducted included the [[maquis du Vercors]], the [[maquis du Limousin]], the [[maquis des Glières]], the [[maquis du Mont Mouchet]], and the [[maquis de Saint-Marcel]]. Major round-up operations included the [[battle of Marseille]] and the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]].

Although the majority of the French population did not take part in active resistance, many resisted passively through acts such as listening to the banned BBC's ''[[Radio Londres]]'', or giving collateral or material aid to Resistance members. Others assisted in the escape of downed US or British airmen who eventually found their way back to Britain, often through Spain.

By the eve of the liberation, [[List of networks and movements of the French Resistance|numerous factions of nationalists, anarchists, communists, socialists and others]], counting between 100,000 and up to 400,000 combatants, were actively fighting the occupation forces. Supported by the [[Special Operations Executive]] and the [[Office of Strategic Services]] that air-dropped weapons and supplies, as well as infiltrating agents like [[Nancy Wake]] who provided tactical advice and specialist skills like [[radio]] operation and [[demolition]], they systematically sabotaged railway lines, destroyed bridges, cut German [[supply line]]s, and provided general intelligence to the allied forces. German anti-partisan operations claimed around 13,000-16,000 French victims, including 4,000 to 5,000 innocent civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lieb]]: ''Konventioneller Krieg oder NS-Weltanschauungskrieg?

At the end of the war, some [[World War II casualties#Human losses by country|580,000]] French had died (40,000 of these by the western Allied forces during the bombardments of the first 48 hours of operation ''Overlord''). Military deaths were 92,000 in 1939-40. Some 58,000 were killed in action from 1940 to 1945 fighting in the Free French forces. Some 40,000 ''[[malgré-nous]]'' ("against our will"), citizens of re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine drafted into the Wehrmacht, became casualties. Civilian casualties amounted to around 150,000 (60,000 by aerial bombing, 60,000 in the resistance, and 30,000 murdered by German occupation forces). Prisoners of war and deportee totals were around 1.9 million. Of this, around 240,000 died in captivity. An estimated 40,000 were prisoners of war, 100,000 racial deportees, 60,000 political prisoners and 40,000 died as slave labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Dear and Foot 2005, p. 321.{{cite book|last1=Dear|last2=Foot|title=The Oxford Companion to World War II|date=2005|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The census for 1 April 1941 show 25,071,255 inhabitants in the occupied zone (with 14.2m in the unoccupied zone).

===Daily life===

The life of the French during the German occupation was marked, from the beginning, by endemic shortages. They are explained by several factors:

#One of the conditions of the armistice was to pay the costs of the 300,000-strong occupying German army, which amounted to 20 million [[German Reichsmark|''Reichsmark'']] per day. The artificial exchange rate of the German currency against the [[French franc]] was consequently established as 1 RM to 20 FF.&lt;ref name="Book Review of ''Morts d'inanition: Famine et exclusions en France sous l'Occupation''"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi? act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/111.5/br_161.html |title=Book Review of ''Morts d'inanition: Famine et exclusions en France sous l'Occupation'' |author=The American Historical Association |accessdate=2007-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907195109/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed German requisitions and purchases to be made into a form of organised [[plunder]] and resulted in endemic food shortages and [[malnutrition]], particularly amongst children, the elderly, and the more vulnerable sections of French society such as the working urban class of the cities.&lt;ref name="Effects of War on French children"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/reprint/5/3/266.pdf| title=Effects of War on French children| author=Marie Helen Mercier and J. Louise Despert| accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The disorganisation of transport, except for the railway system which relied on French domestic coal supplies.
#The cutting off of international trade and the Allied [[blockade]], restricting imports into the country.
#The extreme shortage of petrol and diesel fuel. France had no indigenous oil production and all imports had stopped.
#Labour shortages, particularly in the countryside, due to the large number of [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French prisoners of war held in Germany]], and the [[Service du travail obligatoire]].
[[File:Tickets de rationnement.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Rationing tickets for the French population (July 1944)]]
[[Ersatz]], or makeshift substitutes, took the place of many products that were in short supply; [[wood gas generator]]s on trucks and automobiles burned charcoal or wood pellets as a substitute to gasoline, and wooden soles for shoes were used instead of leather. Soap was rare and made in some households from fats and [[caustic soda]]. Coffee was replaced by toasted [[barley]] mixed with [[chicory]], and sugar with [[saccharin]].

The Germans seized about 80 percent of the [[French food]] production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the [[French people]].&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Collingham , ''The Taste of War: World War Two and the Battle for Food'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; French farm production fell in half because of lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so the Germans seized half the meat, 20 percent of the produce, and 80 percent of the [[Champagne]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Mouré, "Food Rationing and the Black Market in France (1940-1944)," ''French History'', June 2010, Vol. 24 Issue 2,  pp. 272-273&lt;/ref&gt; Supply problems quickly affected French stores which lacked most items.

Faced with these difficulties in everyday life, the government answered by [[rationing]], and creating food charts and tickets which were to be exchanged for bread, meat, butter and cooking oil. The rationing system was stringent but badly mismanaged, leading to malnourishment, [[black market]]s, and hostility to state management of the food supply. The official ration provided starvation level diets of 1,300 or fewer [[calories]] a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.&lt;ref&gt;Mouré, "Food Rationing and the Black Market in France (1940-1944)" pp 262-282,&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunger prevailed, especially affecting youth in urban areas. The queues lengthened in front of shops. In the absence of meat and other foods including potatoes, people ate unusual vegetables, such as [[Rutabaga|Swedish turnip]] and [[Jerusalem artichoke]]. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of [[milk]] products permitted better survival.

Some people benefited from the [[black market]], where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers diverted especially meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and [[barter]] against [[Smoking in France|cigarettes]] were also frequent practices during this period. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried out at the risk of confiscation and fines.

During the day, numerous regulations, censorship and propaganda made the occupation increasingly unbearable. At night, inhabitants had to abide a [[curfew]] and it was forbidden to go out during the night without an ''[[Kennkarte|Ausweis]]''. They had to close their shutters or windows and turn off any light, to prevent Allied aircraft using city lights for navigation. The experience of the Occupation was a deeply psychologically disorienting one for the French as what was once familiar and safe suddenly become strange and threatening.&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, Ian ''Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944'', New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 pages 157-159.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Parisians could not get over the shock experienced when they first saw the huge swastika flags draped over the Hôtel de Ville and flying on top of the Eiffel Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, Ian ''Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944'', New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Ian Ousby]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even today, when people who are not French or did not live through the Occupation look at photos of German soldiers marching down the Champs Élysées or of Gothic-lettered German signposts outside the great landmarks of Paris, they can still feel a slight shock of disbelief. The scenes look not just unreal, but almost deliberately surreal, as if the unexpected conjunction of German and French, French and German, was the result of a Dada prank and not the sober record of history. This shock is merely a distant echo of what the French underwent in 1940: seeing a familiar landscape transformed by the addition of the unfamiliar, living among everyday sights suddenly made bizarre, no longer feeling at home in places they had known all their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, Ian ''Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944'', New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 page 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ousby wrote that by the end of summer of 1940: "And so the alien presence, increasingly hated and feared in private, could seem so permanent that, in the public places where daily life went on, it was taken for granted".&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, Ian ''Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944'', New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 page 170.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time France was also marked by disappearances as buildings were renamed, books banned, art was stolen to be taken to Germany and as time went on, people started to vanish.&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, Ian ''Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944'', New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 pages 171, 18 &amp; 187-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

With nearly {{FORMATNUM:75000}} inhabitants killed and {{FORMATNUM:550000}} tons of bombs dropped, France was, after Germany, the second most severely bomb-devastated country on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front of World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Centre d'études d'histoire de la défense, ''Les bombardements alliés sur la France durant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, Stratégies, bilans matériels et humains'', Conference of 6 June 2007, [http://www.cehd.sga.defense.gouv.fr/spip.php?article224 Defense.gouv.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202005021/http://www.cehd.sga.defense.gouv.fr/spip.php?article224 |date=2008-12-02 }} retrieved 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Allied bombings were particularly intense before and during [[Operation Overlord]] in 1944.

The Allies' [[Transport Plan|Transportation Plan]] aiming at the systematic destruction of French railway [[marshalling yard]]s and railway bridges, in 1944, also took a heavy toll on civilian lives. For example, the 26 May 1944 bombing hit railway targets in and around five cities in south-eastern France, causing over 2,500 civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;See French language Wikipedia article [[:fr:bombardement du 26 mai 1944]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing the ''ligne de démarcation'' between the north zone and the south zone also required an ''Ausweis'', which was difficult to acquire.&lt;ref name="jackson247"/&gt; People could write only to their family members, and this was only permissible using a pre-filled card where the sender checked off the appropriate words (e.g. 'in good health', 'wounded', 'dead', 'prisoner').&lt;ref name="jackson247"/&gt; The occupied zone was on German time, which was one hour ahead of the unoccupied zone.&lt;ref name="jackson247"/&gt; Other policies implemented in the occupied zone but not in the free zone were a [[curfew]] from 10 p.m to 5 a.m, a ban on American films, the suppression of displaying the [[French flag]] and singing the ''[[Marseillaise]]'', and the banning of Vichy paramilitary organizations and the Veterans' Legion.&lt;ref name="jackson247"/&gt;

Schoolchildren were made to sing ''"[[Maréchal, nous voilà !]]"'' ("Marshall, here we are!"). The portrait of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] adorned the walls of classrooms, thus creating a [[personality cult]]. Propaganda was present in education to train the young people with the [[Révolution nationale|ideas of the new Vichy regime]]. However, there was no resumption in ideology as in other occupied countries, for example [[occupied Poland|in Poland]], where the teaching elite was liquidated. Teachers were not imprisoned and the programs were not modified overall. In the private Catholic sector, many school directors hid [[Jewish people|Jewish]] children (thus saving their life) and provided education for them&lt;!-- It more than *provided education for them*, it saved their life ! /FW --&gt; until the Liberation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Nightlife in Paris ===
{{see also|Paris in World War II}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-129-0480-25, Paris, deutsche Soldaten vor dem Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|German soldiers talking with French women by the [[Moulin Rouge]] in June 1940, shortly after the German occupation of Paris]]
One month after the occupation, the bi-monthly soldiers' magazine ''{{ill|Der Deutsche Wegleiter für Paris|fr}}'' (''The German Guide to Paris'') was first published by the Paris ''Kommandantur'', and became a success.&lt;ref name ="L'Express"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Emmanuel | last1=Hetch | title=Le Guide du soldat allemand à Paris, ou comment occuper Fritz | work=[[L'Express]] | date= October 2013 | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/le-guide-du-soldat-allemand-comment-occuper-fritz_1293448.html?xtmc=Der_Deutsche_Wegleiter_f%FCr_Paris&amp;xtcr=1#4ygQU2BpCE8RQ27K.99 | accessdate=23 October 2013 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further guides, such as the ''Guide aryien'', counted e.g. the [[Moulin Rouge]] among the must-see locations in Paris.&lt;ref name= we&gt;''[https://www.routledge.com/Emotion-in-Motion-Tourism-Affect-and-Transformation/Robinson-Picard/p/book/9781409421337 Emotion in Motion: Tourism, Affect and Transformation]'', Dr David Picard, Professor Mike Robinson, Ashgate Publishing, 2012, {{ISBN|978-14094-2133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous clubs such as the [[Folies-Belleville]] or [[Bobino]] were also among the sought-after venues. A wide array of German units were rotated to France to rest and refit; the Germans used the motto ''"Jeder einmal in Paris"'' ("everyone once in Paris") and provided 'recreational visits' to the city for their troops.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris under the occupation'', [[Gilles Perrault]]; [[Jean-Pierre Azéma]] London : Deutsch, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-233-98511-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various famous artists, such as  [[Yves Montand]], or later [[Les Compagnons de la chanson]], started their careers during the occupation. [[Edith Piaf]] lived above [[L'Étoile de Kléber]], a famous bordello on the Rue Lauriston, which was near to the [[Carlingue]] headquarters and often frequented by German troops. The [[curfew]] in Paris was not upheld as strictly as in other cities.

The [[Django Reinhardt]] song "[[Nuages]]", performed by Reinhardt and the [[Quintet of the Hot Club of France]] in the [[Salle Pleyel]], gained notoriety among both French and German fans. Reinhardt was even invited to play for the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dregni: ''Django – The Life and Music of a Gipsy Legend''. p.344, Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-01951-6752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use and abuse of Paris in the visitations of German forces during the Second World War led to a backlash; the intensive prostitution during the occupation made way for the ''Loi de [[Marthe Richard]]'' in 1946, which closed the bordellos and reduced raunchy stage shows to mere dancing events.

===Oppression===

During the German occupation, a forced labour policy, called ''[[Service du Travail Obligatoire]]'' ("Obligatory work service, STO"), consisted of the requisition and transfer of hundreds of thousands of French workers to Germany against their will, for the German war effort.  In addition to work camps for factories, agriculture, and railroads, [[forced labour]] was used for [[V-1 flying bomb (facilities)|V-1 launch sites]] and other military facilities targeted by the Allies in [[Operation Crossbow]]. Beginning in 1942, many refused to be drafted to factories and farms in Germany by the STO, going underground to avoid imprisonment and subsequent deportation to Germany. For the most part, those "work dodgers" (''réfractaires'') became [[Maquis (World War II)|''maquisards'']].

There were German reprisals against civilians in occupied countries; in France, the Nazis built an execution chamber in the cellars of the former Ministry of Aviation building in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many Jews were victims of [[the Holocaust in France]]. Approximately 49 [[Concentration camps in France|concentration camps]] were in use in France during the occupation, the largest of them at [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy]]. In the occupied zone, as of 1942, Jews were required to wear the [[yellow badge]] and were only allowed to ride in the last carriage of the [[Paris Métro]]. 13,152 Jews residing in the Paris region were victims of a mass arrest by pro-Nazi French authorities on 16 and 17 July 1942, known as the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]], and were transported to [[Auschwitz]] where they were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/The-Vel-d-Hiv-round-up Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence: ''Case Study: The Vélodrome d'Hiver Round-up: July 16 and 17, 1942'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, according to a detailed count drawn under [[Serge Klarsfeld]], slightly below 77,500 of the Jews residing in France died during the war, overwhelmingly after being deported to [[Extermination camp|death camps]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Shoah#Les victimes françaises|Summary from data compiled by the Association des Fils et Filles des déportés juifs de France, 1985.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azéma, Jean-Pierre and Bédarida, François (dir.), ''La France des années noires'', 2 vol., Paris, Seuil, 1993 [rééd. Seuil, 2000 (Points Histoire)]&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a Jewish population in France in 1940 of 350,000, this means that somewhat less than a quarter died. While horrific, the mortality rate was lower than in other occupied countries (e.g. 75 percent in the Netherlands) and, because the majority of the Jews were recent immigrants to France (mostly exiles from Germany), more Jews lived in France at the end of the occupation than did approximately 10 years earlier when Hitler formally came to power.&lt;ref&gt;François Delpech, ''Historiens et Géographes'', no 273, mai–juin 1979, {{ISSN|0046-757X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[Liberation of France]] was the result of the Allied operations [[operation Overlord|''Overlord'']] and [[operation Dragoon|''Dragoon'']] in the summer of 1944. Most of France was liberated by September 1944. Some of the heavily fortified [[Submarine pen#France|French Atlantic coast submarine bases]] remained [[Atlantic pockets|stay-behind "fortresses"]] until the German capitulation in May 1945. The [[free France|Free French exile government]] declared the re-establishment of a [[GPRF|provisional French Republic]], ensuring continuity with the defunct Third Republic. It set about raising new troops to participate in the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|advance to the Rhine]] and the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]], using the [[French Forces of the Interior]] as [[En cadre|military cadre]]s and manpower pools of experienced fighters to allow a very large and rapid expansion of the French Liberation Army (''Armée française de la Libération''). Thanks to [[Lend-Lease]], it was well equipped and well supplied despite the economic disruption brought by the occupation, and it grew from 500,000 men in the summer of 1944 to more than 1.3 million by [[V-E day]], making it the fourth largest Allied army in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Talbot|first1=C.

The [[French 2nd Armored Division]], tip of the spear of the [[Free French]] forces that had participated in the [[Normandy Campaign]] and had [[liberation of Paris|liberated Paris]] on 25 August 1944, went on to [[French 2nd Armoured Division#Alsace .26 Lorraine|liberate Strasbourg]] on 23 November 1944, thus fulfilling the [[Battle of Kufra (1941)#Oath of Kufra|Oath of Kufra]] made by General [[Philippe Leclerc|Leclerc]] almost four years earlier. The unit under his command, barely above [[Company (military unit)|company]]-size when it had captured the Italian fort, had grown into a full-strength armoured [[division (military)|division]].

The spearhead of the Free [[French First Army]], that had [[Operation Dragoon|landed in Provence]] on 15 August 1944, was the [[1 Army Corps (France)#World War 2|I Corps]]. Its leading unit, the [[French 1st Armored Division]], was the first Western Allied unit to reach the [[Rhône]] (25 August 1944), the [[Rhine]] (19 November 1944) and the [[Danube]] (21 April 1945). On 22 April 1945, it captured the [[Sigmaringen enclave]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], where the last Vichy regime exiles, including Marshal Pétain, were hosted by the Germans in one of the ancestral castles of the [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty.

Collaborators were put on trial in legal purges (''[[épuration légale]]''), and a number were executed for [[high treason]], among them [[Pierre Laval]], Vichy's prime minister in 1942-44. Marshal Pétain, "Chief of the French State" and [[battle of Verdun|Verdun]] hero, was also condemned to death (14 August 1945), but his sentence was commuted to life three days later.&lt;ref&gt;by de Gaulle, then leader of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thousands of collaborators were [[summary execution|summarily executed]] by local Resistance forces in so-called "savage purges" (''épuration sauvage'').

'''Haushabi''' or '''Hawshabi''' ({{Lang-ar|الحوشبي}} ''al-Ḥawshabī'' or {{Lang-ar|الحواشب}} ''al-Ḥawāshab''), or the '''Haushabi Sultanate''' ({{Lang-ar|سلطنة الحواشب}} ''Salṭanat al-Ḥawāshab''), was a state in the British [[Aden Protectorate]]. Its capital was [[Musaymir]]. The area is now part of the Republic of [[Yemen]].

==History==
Haushabi was established in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch. ''A History of Modern Yemen.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader signed an agreement with the British already in 1839, but it was not until 1895 that a formal [[protectorate|protection]] agreement with [[British Empire|Great Britain]] was signed. Subsequently, it became part of the British [[Aden Protectorate]]. The state later  joined the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]], and its successor, the [[Federation of South Arabia]].

The last sultan, Faisal bin Surur Al Haushabi, was deposed and his state was abolished in 1967 upon the founding of the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]].

===Rulers===
The rulers of Haushabi bore the title ''Sultan al-Saltana al-Hawshabiyya''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yemen_protectorate.html States of the Aden Protectorates]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Vegetarian Union''' ('''IVU''') is an international non-profit [[Non-governmental organization|organization]] whose purpose is to promote vegetarianism. IVU was founded in 1908 in [[Dresden]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/624623/vegetarianism/258891/The-17th-through-19th-centuries#ref=ref828014 Vegetarianism The 17th through 19th centuries] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivu.org/congress/wvc08/germany-de.html IVU Welt-Vegetarier-Kongress 1908] IVU (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered as an [[umbrella organization]] for under this organisation are included organisations from many countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vilaweb.cat/www/noticia?p_idcmp=1594564 Dia mundial dels veganisme] 01/11/2005 [[Vilaweb]] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organises often World and Regional Vegetarian Congresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad13a7dc-312c-11d9-a595-00000e2511c8.html Monday 8 UK] 8 November 2004 [[Financial Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These alternate in two-year cycles.

==Description==
The ruling body from IVU is the International Council, and the members who form it are unpaid volunteers elected by the Member Societies at each World Vegetarian Congress.

The IVU also encourages regional and national organizations to run vegetarian festivals, such as the 43rd WorldVegFest in [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], on 25 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvegfest.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=367:ivu-world-vegfest-in-australia&amp;catid=21&amp;Itemid=293|title=IVU World Vegfest in Australia|date=19 May 2015|publisher=IVU World VegFest|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''kidnapping of Aldo Moro''' ({{lang-it|Rapimento di Aldo Moro}}), also referred in Italy as '''Moro Case''' ({{lang-it|Caso Moro}}), was a seminal event in Italian political history.

On the morning of 16 March 1978, the day on which the new cabinet led by [[Giulio Andreotti]] was supposed to have undergone a [[confidence and supply|confidence]] vote in the [[Italian Parliament]], the car of [[Aldo Moro]], former prime minister and then president of [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian Democracy]] (Italian: ''Democrazia Cristiana'', or DC, Italy's relative majority party at the time), was assaulted by a group of [[Red Brigades]] (Italian: ''Brigate Rosse'', or BR) [[terrorists]] in Via Fani in [[Rome]]. Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro's bodyguards, (two [[Carabinieri]] in Moro's car and three [[Italian police|policemen]] in the following car) and kidnapped him.

On 9 May 1978 Moro's body was found in the [[Trunk (automobile)|trunk]] of a [[Renault 4]] in Via Caetani after 55 days of imprisonment, during which Moro was submitted to a political trial by the so-called "people's court" set up by the Brigate Rosse and the Italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners. Despite the common interpretation, the car location in Via Caetani was not halfway between the locations of the national offices of DC and of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) in Rome.&lt;ref name="Fasanella 2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Giovanni |last=Fasanella |author2=Giuseppe Roca|title=The Mysterious Intermediary. Igor Markevitch and the Moro affair|publisher=Einaudi|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping==

===The assault===
[[File:Aldo Moro headshot.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Official portrait of [[Aldo Moro]], during 1960s.]]
The terrorists had prepared the ambush by parking two cars in Via Mario Fani which, once moved, would prevent Moro's cars from escaping. According to the official reconstruction at the subsequent trials, eleven people&lt;ref&gt;Other sources, such as [http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1978r.htm Cronologia italiana] web history, report the presence of ten persons, including a look-out; [http://www.ilcassetto.it/notizia.php?tid=154 other reconstructions] mention up to twenty people taking part in the ambush.&lt;/ref&gt; participated in the assault. However, several doubts have been cast on the terrorists' declarations on which the official accounts were based, and about the exact identity of the ambush team's members.&lt;ref name="Moro 28 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 28 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Moro himself in Via Fani during the ambush has also been questioned after revelations in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaoggi.info/node/3960 |title=Article at americaoggi.it 16 March 2008 |publisher=Americaoggi.info |date=2008-03-16 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Theory of the alternative kidnapping|Theory of the alternative kidnapping]]).

At 8:45 the Red Brigades members took their positions at the end of Via Fani, a downhill street in the northern quarter of Rome. An unknown number, from at least two to the whole team, were wearing [[Alitalia]] airline crew uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 32 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since not all team members knew each other, the uniforms were needed to avoid friendly fire. In the upper part of the road, and on the right-hand side, [[Mario Moretti]] was inside a [[Fiat 128]] with a fake diplomatic license plate. [[Alvaro Lojacono]] and [[Alessio Casimirri]] were in another Fiat 128 some meters ahead of him. On the opposite side there was a third Fiat 128, with [[Barbara Balzerani]] inside, facing the supposed direction from which Moro would arrive. {{Interlanguage link multi|Bruno Seghetti|it}} occupied a fourth car, a [[Fiat 132]], near the crossroads where the street ended.

Moro left his house a few minutes before 9:00. He was sitting in a blue [[Fiat 130]] driven by Domenico Ricci. Another [[Carabinieri|carabiniere]], marshal Oreste Leonardi, sat beside him. Leonardi was the head of the bodyguard team. The Fiat 130 was followed by a white [[Alfetta]] with the remaining bodyguards: Francesco Zizzi, Giulio Rivera and Raffaele Iozzino.&lt;ref name="cronologia.leonardo.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1978r.htm |title=Page at Cronologia italiana history website |publisher=Cronologia.leonardo.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambush began when the two cars entered Via Fani and the terrorists were alerted by a lookout, {{Interlanguage link multi|Rita Algranati|it}}. Moretti's Fiat 128 cut the road in front of Moro's car, which bumped into the rear of Moretti's car and remained blocked between it and the bodyguards' Alfetta. Leonardi tried an escape manoeuver, but was thwarted by a [[Mini|Mini Minor]] parked at the crossroad. Moro's cars were finally trapped from behind by Lojacono's 128. At this point four armed terrorists jumped out from the bushes at the sides of the street, firing [[machine pistol]]s. The judiciary investigations identified them as [[Valerio Morucci]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Raffaele Fiore|it}}, [[Prospero Gallinari]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franco Bonisoli|it}}. The action has shown an analogy to a similar one by the German far-left formation [[Rote Armee Fraktion|RAF]]. One unidentified witness declared that a German voice was heard during the ambush, which led to a presumption of the presence of RAF militiamen in the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=La Repubblica|date=16 March 2008|title=I Giorni di Moro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

91 bullets were fired of which 45 hit the bodyguards, who were all killed. 49 shots came from a single weapon, a [[FNAB-43]] submachine gun, and 22 from another of the same model. The remaining 20 shots came from other weapons which included a [[Beretta M12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 31 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricci and Leonardi, who were sitting in the front seat of the first car, were killed first. Moro was immediately kidnapped and forced into the Fiat 132 which was next to his car. At the same time the terrorists killed the other three policemen, dispatching each of them with a single shot in the neck. The only policeman who was able to shoot back was Iozzino, but he was immediately hit in the head by Bonisoli. The blue Fiat 132 was found at 9:40 AM in Via Licinio Calvo with some blood stains inside. The other cars used for the ambush were also found in the following days in the same road (according to the declarations of Red Brigade members, the cars had been left in the road that same day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 45 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March the escort in Via Fani was not carrying weapons, which were instead kept in the trunks of the cars;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Enzo|last=Biagi|authorlink=Enzo Biagi|title=La nuova storia d'Italia a fumetti|publisher=Mondadori|year=2004 |page=656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonora Chiavarelli (Aldo Moro's wife) said, during the trial, that the weapons were in the trunks because "these people didn't know how to use weapons because they had never had any shooting practice, they were not used to handling them, so the guns were in the trunk. Leonardi always talked about it. "These people shouldn't have weapons they don't know how to use. They should know how to use them. They should carry them properly. Keep them within reach. The radio should be operational, but it doesn't work." For months it had been going on like this. Marshal Leonardi and lance corporal Ricci did not expect an ambush, because their weapons were placed in the bag and one of the two holsters was even in a plastic liner."&lt;ref name=Montanelli&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Indro Montanelli|first=Indro |last=Montanelli |author2=Mario Cervi|title=L'Italia degli anni di piombo|publisher=Rizzoli Editore|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last sentence was denied by the widow of Marshal Leonardi, stating that her husband "recently went around armed because he had noticed that a car was following him."&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt;

[[File:Via fani1.jpg|thumb|left|After the assault]]
The action was claimed by the BR in a phone call to [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]. At 10:00 [[Pietro Ingrao]], president of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]], stopped the session and announced that Moro had been kidnapped. On the same day Andreotti's government obtained a large majority of votes, including those of his traditional enemies, notably PCI.&lt;ref name="cronologia.leonardo.it"/&gt; Before the kidnapping the Communists were supposed to enter the government in a direct role but the emergency changed the situation, resulting in another right-centre cabinet under the firm control of DC. [[Enrico Berlinguer]] spoke of "an attempt to stop a positive political process", but [[Lucio Magri]], representative of the extreme left [[Proletarian Unity Party (Italy)|PUP]], was concerned about the hypocrisy of passing laws limiting personal freedom as a reaction to the massacre, saying that "it would play into the hands of the strategy of subversion". He asked for "self-criticism" from the authorities and for a genuine willingness to tackle problems "that are at the basis of the economic and moral crisis".&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt;
[[File:Vittime_di_via_Fani.jpg|thumb|The victims: above Oreste Leonardi, from left to right Raffaele Iozzino, Francesco Zizzi, Giulio Rivera, Domenico Ricci]]
Mario Ferrandi, a militant of [[Prima Linea]], nicknamed "Coniglio" (''Rabbit''), later said that when the news of the kidnapping and the killing of the bodyguards spread during a workers' demonstration there was a moment of amazement, followed by a moment of euphoria and anxiety because there was a feeling that something would happen so big that things would not be quite the same. He recalled that students present at the event spent the money of ''Cassa del circolo giovanile'' to buy champagne and toast with workers of the canteen.&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt;

===Motivations===
[[File:Giulio Andreotti, ca 1987.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Giulio Andreotti]]]]
A large amount of literature exists about the reasons for the kidnapping. The Red Brigades chose Moro due to his role as mediator between DC and PCI, the two main parties in Italy at the time, which had both participated in the Fourth Andreotti Cabinet. It was the first time since 1947 that Italian Communists had a government position, even if indirect. The success of the action would thus halt the Communists' rise to Italian state institutions, reassuring the BR as a key point in a future revolutionary war against capitalism. According to others{{Who|date=February 2011}} BR aimed to strike at the whole DC who were the main exponent of a regime that, as described in BR's first communiqué after the kidnapping "... had been suppressing the Italian people for years".&lt;ref name=Zavoli&gt;{{cite book|first=Sergio|last=Zavoli|title=La notte della Repubblica|publisher=Nuova Eri|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to later terrorist declarations, in the months before the kidnapping the Red Brigades had also envisaged the kidnapping the other leader of DC, Giulio Andreotti. This was abandoned once they deemed that Andreotti's police protection was too strong.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;

The immediate consequence of the kidnapping was the exclusion of PCI from any government cabinet in the following years. Although increasingly weakened, DC remained the main government party until 1994 (although in 1981, for the first time since the formation of the Italian Republic [[Giovanni Spadolini]], a non-Christian Democrat, became premier in a DC-based alliance).&lt;ref&gt;Other three non-Christian Democrats will become premier in a DC-based alliance: [[Bettino Craxi]] (in 1983), [[Giuliano Amato]] (in 1992) and [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (in 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
The exact location of Moro's imprisonment is disputed. The official reconstruction in the trials identified it as an apartment in Via Camillo Montalcini 8 in Rome, which had been owned by a BR terrorist for a few years. Moro would be killed there, in an underground parking garage. Months after the kidnapping the apartment was put under investigation by [[UCIGOS]], the Italian police's central directorate for political crimes, and was thus abandoned by the Red Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moro fu ucciso in via Montalcini|journal=la Repubblica|date =20 September 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mistero di stato in via Montalcini|journal=la Repubblica|date =18 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La vera storia di via Montalcini|journal=la Repubblica|date =1 June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, 22nd session, interrogation of Valerio Morucci, 18 giugno 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo Moro's brother Carlo Alfredo, a judge, writes in his book ''Storia di un delitto annunciato''&lt;ref name="Moro 28 ff"/&gt; that the politician was not detained in Via Montalcini, but in a seaside location. His theory is based on the fact that sand and vegetable remains were found in the car together with Moro's body. Further, Moro's body had a generally good muscular tone and according to Moro's brother this, along with several contradictions in the terrorists' declarations, contravenes the traditional view of the politician closed in a very tight cell with little space to move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|chapter= Chapter III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aldo Moro's letters===
[[File:Cossiga Francesco.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Francesco Cossiga]]]]
During his detention, Moro wrote 86 letters to the main members of Christian Democracy, his family and to [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticasociale.net/index.php?&amp;lng=ita&amp;sid=839b3226faffb565d3a67238c97e2df4&amp;function=rivista&amp;pid=page&amp;year=2008&amp;id=0003938&amp;top_nav=titoli_2008&amp;sintesi=1 Le lettere da patibolo di Aldo Moro], from ''Critica Social'' Vol. 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some arrived at their addressees; others that had not been sent were later found in another base of the BR in via Monte Nevoso, [[Milan]]. In the letters Moro puts forward the possibility of negotiation for his liberation if help from his party's colleagues and of the highest figures of the Republic could be obtained.

Some of Moro's letters allegedly contain hidden allusions and hints. In one letter he asks: "Is maybe there, behind keeping it hard against me, an American or German instruction?"&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Moro's letter to [[Paolo Emilio Taviani]], sent on 9/10 April and enclosed in the BR's Communication Number 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Leonardo Sciascia]] suggested that in his letters Moro was including clues about his position, as when he wrote "I am here in full health"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Eleonora Moro of 27 March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Leonardo Sciascia|first=Leonardo |last=Sciascia|title= L'affaire Moro|publisher=Adelphi|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate that he was in Rome. In the letter of 8 April Moro launched a vibrant attack at [[Benigno Zaccagnini]], national secretary of Christian Democracy, at [[Francesco Cossiga]], then Minister of the Interior, as well as on the whole of his party: "Of course, I cannot prevent myself from underlining the wickedness of all the Christian Democrats who did not agree with my position [...] And Zaccagnini? How can he stay tranquil in his position? And Cossiga could not devise any possible defence? My blood will fall over them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Il mio sangue ricadrà su di loro. Gli scritti di Aldo Moro prigioniero delle Br|publisher=Kaos edizioni|first=Sergio|last=Flamigni|isbn=88-7953-058-5|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubts have been cast over the complete publication of Moro's letters. The Carabinieri general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] (then coordinator of the fight against terrorism in Italy, later killed by the Mafia) found copies of some previously unknown letters in an apartment used by the terrorists in via Monte Nevoso. For undisclosed reasons the finding was not publicly revealed for years. During the kidnapping the prevalent view was that Moro did not enjoy complete freedom to write. Despite Moro's wife declaring that she recognized his writing style in them, the letters would be considered, if not directly dictated by the terrorists, at least to be inspired or controlled by them. Some experts in an analysis committee formed by Cossiga initially declared that Moro had been subject to [[brainwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Panorama|title=I giorni del complotto|first=Robert|last=Katz|date=13 August 1994|url =http://www.theboot.it/pieczenikIT.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cossiga would later admit that he had partially written the speech held by Giulio Andreotti in which it was said that Moro's letter were to be considered "not morally authentic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo Moro was never tortured by the Red Brigades during the 55 days; in the 1990s Italian journalist [[Indro Montanelli]] commented severely on the letters written during the kidnapping, saying that "Everyone in this world has the right to be afraid. But a Statesman (and [[Aldo Moro|Moro]] was the State) can't try to induce the State to a negotiation with terrorists that over all, in the kidnapping of Via Fani, had left on the asphalt five dead between Carabinieri and policemen."&lt;ref&gt;Montanelli, Indro (22 March 1997). "Aldo Moro, al di la' della melassa ipocrita...". ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montanelli was also scathingly critical of Moro's widow, Eleonora Chiavarelli, who, in the years after her husband was killed, blamed the Christian Democrats and the Italian political class in general for his fate. In 1982 he wrote:
{{quote|There was something almost gloating in the tone in which this black widow of politics spoke about politicians, and in her peremptory gesture of pointing her finger at everyone. At everyone, that is, except the people who killed her husband. She made no accusations against them. According to the accounts I read, she pronounced no sentences, she didn't even look at them. If it were up to her, the trial of the terrorists would have been a trial of the Christian Democratic Party, of which her husband had been president; of the government of which her husband was both architect and guarantor; and of the [members of the] security services whose graves he had dug.&lt;ref&gt;"''C'era infatti qualcosa di trionfalistico nel tono con cui questa vedova nera della politica parlava dei politici e nel perentorio gesto con cui puntava il dito contro tutti. Tutti, eccettuati coloro che le hanno ammazzato il marito. Contro di essi, dalle cronache che ho letto, non ha sporto accuse, non ha pronunciato condanne, non li ha nemmeno guardati. Fosse dipeso da lei, il processo ai terroristi sarebbe diventato il processo alla Dc, di cui suo marito era presidente, al governo di cui suo marito era l'artefice e garante, e ai servizi di sicurezza di cui suo marito era stato l'affossatore''", Montanelli, Indro (23 July 1982). "La vedova nera". ''[[il Giornale|il Giornale Nuovo]]'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Communications and negotiations===
During the 55 days of Moro's detention the Red Brigades issued nine "Communications" in which they explained the reasons of the kidnapping. In the Communication No.3:
{{quote|The interrogation, whose contents we already described, continues with the prisoner's full collaboration. His answers increasingly clarify the counter-revolutionary  lines that the imperialist bases are carrying out; they clearly line out the contours and the body of the "new" regime that, in the restoration of the Imperialist State of the Multinationals is being established in our country and which has the Christian Democracy as its pivot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1978u.htm |title=List of the communications at Cronologia Italiana history website |publisher=Cronologia.leonardo.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

And:
{{quote|Moro is also acquainted that he is not the only one, that he is, indeed, the higher exponent of the regime; he thus summons the other hierarchs to share with him the responsibilities, and addresses them an appeal which sounds like an explicit call of "co-culpability".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

The Red Brigades proposed to exchange Moro for imprisoned terrorists (Communication No.8). They later accepted to exchange him for a single terrorist.&lt;ref name="I giorni di Moro"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=La Repubblica|title=I giorni di Moro|date=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 1978 Pope Paul VI made a public speech and asked BR to return Moro to his family, specifying that such act should also be "without conditions".&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt; Moro, who had previously written a letter to the Pope, reacted angrily to the latter point, feeling he had been abandoned by the Vatican.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt; The specified "without conditions" is controversial—according to some sources it was added to Paul VI's letter against his will, and the pope instead wanted to negotiate with the kidnappers. Government members like Cossiga denied this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiain.net/arret/num85/artic2.asp "L'assassino di Moro", page at storiain.net] Cossiga was notably involved in numerous scandal of Italian history, in many of which (such as the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]], he had an active role in sidetracking the investigations. See [http://www.memoriacondivisa.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1136:strage-di-bologna&amp;catid=60:strage-di-bologna&amp;Itemid=66 page at memoriacondivisa.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian politicians were divided into two factions: one favourable to negotiations which, amongst others, included the secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], [[Bettino Craxi]] and the others totally negating that possibility, most of the Christian Democracy and Italian Communist Party, including the latter's national secretary [[Enrico Berlinguer]]&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt; and Republican leader [[Ugo La Malfa]] who proposed the death penalty for the terrorists.&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt; The second faction noted that any negotiation would seem a legitimisation of the violence of the terrorists. Further, that solution would not be accepted by the Italian police forces who had seen numerous of their members fall during the war against terrorism in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;"Cari lettori, sui sequestri siete troppo confusi". ''Corriere della Sera'', 16 September 1998, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers, including Moro's brother, underlined how the BR's communication lacked any reference to the possible role of the Communist Party in the Italian government. This was in spite of the day chosen for the kidnapping being that in which PCI, for the first time since the early republican years, was going to obtain an active government role in Italy. A letter by Moro to Zaccagnini, in which he was referring to this argument, had to be rewritten by the politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo|last= Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages=123 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second point put forward was the premise that Moro's revelations, from most of the communication during his "political process", would be made public. Unlike other people kidnapped by the BR and subjected to same procedure&lt;ref&gt;Such as judge [[Giovanni D'Urso]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in spite of the unprecedented repetition of the point, in the case of Moro this never happened. Much of the material collected by the terrorists, including Moro's letter and personal notes written during his imprisonment, became public only after the discovery of the base in via Monte Nevoso. The terrorists later declared they had destroyed all the material including that containing references to the [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] undercover organization discovered in 1990.&lt;ref name=Tamburrano&gt;Montanelli, Indro (16 December 1995). "Andreotti e Pecorelli: come un romanzo". ''Corriere della Sera'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Indro Montanelli]] sided in favor of firmness and against the negotiations from the first day&lt;ref&gt;Montanelli, Indro. {{cite journal|title=Faccia a faccia|journal=[[il Giornale|il Giornale Nuovo]]|date=17 March 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerbi, Sandro; Raffaele Liucci (2014). ''Indro Montanelli: Una biografia (1909-2001)''.  Milan, Lombardy, Italy: Hoepli.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000, responding to a reader on ''Corriere della Sera'', wrote: {{quote|My opinion remains that expressed on my ''[[il Giornale|Giornale]]'' the day after the crime. «If the State, bowing to blackmail, negotiates with the violence that has already left on the pavement five corpses of Moro's bodyguards, thereby recognizing crime as a legitimate interlocutor, has no reason, as a State, to exist.» This was the position that we took from day one and fortunately it found in Parliament two determinants political forces (the Italian Communist Party of Berlinguer and the Italian Republican Party of [[Ugo La Malfa|La Malfa]]) and one reluctant between tears and sobs (the Christian Democracy of Zaccagnini). This was the «plot» that led to the hesitant «no» of the State, to the subsequent death of Moro, but shortly after to the Red Brigades' surrender. Of the tittle-tattle and suspicions that have been embroidered around, and who occasionally crop up still, was never brought a shred of evidence, and are only the result of the complainer momism of a people cowardly, unable even to conceive that a State can react with hardness, against those who offend the law.&lt;ref&gt;Montanelli, Indro. {{cite journal|title=[http://www.corriere.it/solferino/montanelli/00-09-22/03.spm Reazione dello Stato]|journal=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=22 September 2000}} Original text: ''Il mio parere è rimasto quello che espressi sul mio Giornale l'indomani del fattaccio. «Se lo Stato, piegandosi al ricatto, tratta con la violenza che ha già lasciato sul selciato i cinque cadaveri della scorta, in tal modo riconoscendo il crimine come suo legittimo interlocutore, non ha più ragione, come Stato, di esistere». Questa fu la posizione che prendemmo sin dal primo giorno e che per fortuna trovò in Parlamento due patroni risoluti (il Pci di Berlinguer e il Pri di La Malfa) e uno riluttante fra lacrime e singhiozzi (la Dc del moroteo Zaccagnini). Fu questa la «trama» che condusse al tentennante «no» dello Stato, alla conseguente morte di Moro, ma poco dopo anche alla resa delle Brigate rosse. Delle chiacchiere e sospetti che vi sono stati ricamati intorno, e che ogni tanto tuttora affiorano, non è stato mai portato uno straccio di prova, e sono soltanto il frutto del mammismo piagnone di questo popolo imbelle, incapace perfino di concepire che uno Stato possa reagire, a chi ne offende la legge, da Stato.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Discovery of the body===
[[File:AldoMoro ViaCaetani.jpg|thumb|240px|The location where Moro's body was found, in via Caetani, [[Sant'Angelo, Rome|Rione S. Angelo]]. A plaque now commemorates the Christian Democratic statesman.]]
Communication No.9 stated that:
{{quote|For what concerns our proposal of an exchange of political prisoners in order to suspend the condemnation and to release Aldo Moro, we can only record the clear refusal from DC. We thus conclude the battle begun  on 16 March, executing the sentence to which Aldo Moro has been condemned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; }}

The depositions made to the Italian judges during the trials showed that not all the Red Brigades leaders were for condemning Moro to death. Mario Moretti called Moro's wife by phone, asking her to push the DC leaders for negotiations.&lt;ref name="I giorni di Moro"/&gt; [[Adriana Faranda]], a member of BR, mentioned a night meeting held in Milan a few days before the murder of Moro where she and other terrorists, including Valerio Morucci and Franco Bonisoli, dissented although the final decision was taken after voting.

On 9 May 1978, after a summary "people's trial", Moro was murdered by Mario Moretti. It was also determined that the participation of {{Interlanguage link multi|Germano Maccari|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;Haver, Flavio (June 20, 1996). "Erano le 6.30, così uccidemmo Moro". ''Corriere della Sera'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The body was found that same day in the [[Trunk (automobile)|trunk]] of a red Renault 4 in via Michelangelo Caetani in the historic centre of Rome. The location was mentioned by journalist [[Carmine Pecorelli]] as the residence of opera conductor [[Igor Markevitch]] who, according to some theories, was the alleged instigator of the whole kidnapping.

According to the terrorist's declarations, made some ten years after the event, Moro was woken up at 06:00 AM with the excuse that he had to be moved to another secret base. In contradiction to this Bonisoli said that Moro was told that he had been "pardoned" and was going to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorists put him into a wicker basket and brought him to the parking garage of their base in via Montalcini. They put him into the trunk of a red Renault and, after covering him with a red sheet, Moretti shot Moro with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[Walther PPK]] and after the weapon jammed, a 7.65&amp;nbsp;mm [[Škorpion vz. 61]]. The bullets perforated Moro's lungs and killed him.

The car with his body was taken to via Caetani where it was parked about one hour after the murder. The common interpretation was that the location was midway between the national seats of DC and of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) in Rome to symbolize the end of the [[Historic Compromise]], the alliance between DC and PCI which Moro had sought. In fact the car was found more towards the [[Tiber River]], near the [[Ghetto]].&lt;ref name="Fasanella 2003"/&gt; At 12:30 a phone call was made to Francesco Tritto, assistant of Aldo Moro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Brigate+Rosse+(Ultima+Telefonata+Aldo+Moro)&amp;search=Search&amp;gl=IT&amp;hl=it |title=Video with the last phone call of the kidnapping of Aldo Moro |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to let him announce the location of the body. This fulfilled an ''exliciti'' will communicated by Aldo Moro to his kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 13:30 a phone call, attributed to Valerio Morucci, notified the [[Prefecture of Police]] that the politician's body was in a car in via Caetani. [[Autopsy|Autoptic examinations]] made after the discovery assigned the death to around 09:00 and 10:00 of the same day, in contradiction to the terrorist's declarations. Witnesses declared that the car was in the street as early as 08:00 AM, while some witnesses declared that they did not see it before 12:30 AM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 75 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moro was wearing the same grey clothes he had during the kidnapping. The cravat had several blood stains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|page= 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; traces of sand were found in the pockets and socks, and traces of vegetables were also found. Eventually the terrorists declared that they had intentionally added those traces in order to sidetrack the investigators.&lt;ref name=Bianconi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Caso Moro, le risposte a tutte le domande dei lettori|first= Giovanni|last=Bianconi|author-link=Giovanni Bianconi (journalist)|journal=Corriere della Sera website|date=10 March 2008|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_marzo_10/moro_bianconi_risponde_lettori_a2e52312-eed4-11dc-bfb4-0003ba99c667.shtml|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the trunk there were also some of Moro's personal effects, a bracelet and his watch, and some spent cartridges. Moro also had a thigh wound, likely suffered during the initial assault in via Fani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hanno ucciso Aldo Moro|first=Miriam|last= Mafai|authorlink=Miriam Mafai|journal=La Repubblica|date=10 May 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent hypotheses, investigations and trials==

Despite the long investigations and trials, the exact details of the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro are not known.

===Crisis committees===
[[Francesco Cossiga]], minister of the interior at the time, formed two "crisis committees" on the very day of the kidnapping of Moro. These were:
* a technical-operational-political committee, chaired by Cossiga himself and, in his absence, by undersecretary Nicola Lettieri. Other members included the supreme commanders of the Italian Police Forces, of the Carabinieri, the [[Guardia di Finanza]], the recently named directors of [[SISMI]] and [[SISDE]]  (respectively, Italy's military and civil intelligence services), the national secretary of [[CESIS]] (a secret informations agency), the director of UCIGOS and the police prefect of Rome.
*an information committee, including members of CESIS, SISDE, SISMI and [[SIOS]], another military intelligence office.

A third unofficial committee was created which never met officially, called the ''comitato di esperti'' ("committee of experts"). Its existence was not disclosed until 1981, by Cossiga himself, in his interrogation by the Italian Parliament's Commission about the Moro affair. He omitted to reveal the decisions and the activities of the committee however. This committee included: [[Steve Pieczenik]], a psychologist of the anti-terrorism section of the US State Department, a criminologist [[Franco Ferracuti]], [[Stefano Silvestri]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Vincenzo Cappelletti|it}} (director of the [[Istituto per l'Enciclopedia Italiana]]) and [[Giulia Conte Micheli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicola|last= Biondo|author2=Massimo Veneziani|title= Il falsario di Stato. Uno spaccato noir della Roma degli anni di piombo|location= Rome|publisher= Cooper|year= 2008|isbn= 978-88-7394-107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these changes, in the months that the kidnapping of Aldo Moro developed and executed, no Secret Service was designed to combat internal subversion. The committees were acting according to old standards: the planning of measures to be taken in case of emergency dating back to the 1950s, and it hadn't been updated even after the alarming growth of terrorism. This was due to the fact that the country had spread an atmosphere of resignation (if not indulgence) to the left-wing terrorism,&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt; because in the trials defendants get extenuating circumstances,&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt; [[Prima Linea]] was considered a simple subversive association (instead of an armed gang)&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt; and a part of the judiciary harbored hostility towards the State and was sympathetic to the revolutionary myths;&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt; so that the political scientist {{Interlanguage link multi|Giorgio Galli (political scientist)|it|Giorgio Galli|lt=Giorgio Galli}} said that terrorism had become "a historical phenomenon understandable (though not justifiable) in a period of social change thwarted by a corrupt political class".&lt;ref name="Montanelli"/&gt;

===Involvement of P2, Gladio and of the Italian intelligence services===&lt;!--NOTE: linked before and below--&gt;
Several authorities have suggested that [[Propaganda Due|Propaganda 2]] (P2) was involved in the kidnapping of Aldo Moro.&lt;ref name="Flamigni 2003"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Sergio Flamigni|first=Sergio|last=Flamigni|title=La tela del ragno|publisher=Edizioni Caos |year=2003|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda 2 was a secret masonic lodge involved in numerous financial and political scandals in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s and which featured as its members entrepreneurs, journalists, numerous high exponents of right-wing parties, the Italian police and military forces.&lt;ref&gt;An incomplete list include future prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], Carabinieri general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] (who made an admission request whose result is unknown), [[Vito Miceli]], chief of SIOS, mafia banker [[Michele Sindona]], and the pretender  to the throne of Italy [[Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia]]. The name of [[Giulio Andreotti]] has been repeatedly associated with numerous members of P2, notable with Sindona and its founder [[Licio Gelli]], with whom he was well acquainted.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory supposes that the [[Red Brigades]] had been infiltrated by the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) or by the [[Operation Gladio|Organizzazione Gladio]], a paramilitary clandestine network headed by [[NATO]] whose main alleged task was to oppose Soviet influence in western Europe.

[[File:Licio Gelli in paramenti.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Licio Gelli]], [[Venerable Master]] of [[Propaganda 2]] masonic lodge.]]
During the days of Moro's imprisonment journalist [[Carmine Pecorelli]] ([[#Role of Carmine Pecorelli|see also below]]) wrote, in his magazine ''[[Osservatorio politico]]'', an article entitled "''Vergogna, buffoni!''" ("Shame on you, clowns!"): in it he wrote that [[Giulio Andreotti]] had met general Dalla Chiesa who told the politician that he knew the location where Moro was kept, but did not obtain the authorization to proceed to free him due to (in Pecorelli's words) a certain "Christ's lodge in paradise". The likely allusion to P2 became clear only after the discovery of a list of the lodge members on 17 March 1981. Members of the lodge occupied important institutional positions and included: Giuseppe Santovito, director of SISMI; prefect Walter Pelosi, director of [[CESIS]]; general Giulio Grassini of SISDE; admiral Antonino Geraci, commander of SIOS; [[Federico Umberto D'Amato]], director of the Office of Reserved Affairs of the Ministry of the Interiors; generals Raffaele Giudice and Donato Lo Prete, respectively commander and chief-of-staff of the [[Guardia di Finanza]]; and Carabinieri general Giuseppe Siracusano, responsible for road blocks in the capital during the investigations of the Moro affair.&lt;ref name="Flamigni 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strano.net/stragi/stragi/crono/crono78.htm |title=Chronology of informations about the Italian statal massacres from 1978 |language=Italian |publisher=Strano.net |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{Interlanguage link multi|Vincenzo Cappelletti|it}} (a professor who took part in the crisis committees) Franco Ferracuti, later discovered to be a member of P2 and who declared that Moro was suffering of the [[Stockholm syndrome]] towards his kidnappers, was close to the lodge during the kidnapping days, having been introduced by general Grassini.&lt;ref&gt;Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, 63the session, interrogation of Vincenzo Cappelletti, 23 febbraio 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Licio Gelli declared that the presence of numerous members of P2 in the committees was casual, since numerous personalities were members at the time, and this was simply a statistic reflected by the composition of the committees. According to Gelli, some members of the committees did not know that some of their colleagues were also part of P2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Licio |last=Gelli|title=La P2 non c'entra con la morte di Moro|journal=Il Tempo|date=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 1978, the day of Moro's kidnapping, the most important members of P2 met in the [[The Westin Excelsior, Rome|Hotel Excelsior]] in Rome—a few hundred meters from the United States Embassy. While exiting the hotel Gelli declared "the most difficult part is done". It was supposed that his words referred to the abduction of Moro.&lt;ref name="storiain.net"&gt;[http://www.storiain.net/arret/num115/artic5.asp "Le BR e l'omicidio Moro", by Giuseppe dell'Acqua].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another debated case was regarding the presence of Camillo Guglielmi, a colonel of [[SISMI]]'s 7th Division which controlled [[Operation Gladio]], in via Stresa near the location of the ambush, and in those exact minutes when the BR kidnapped Moro. His presence was kept secret and was only disclosed in 1990 during the investigation of the Italian Parliament commission on State Massacres. Guglielmi admitted that he was in via Stresa, but only because he had been invited to lunch by a colleague. According to several sources the colleague confirmed that Guglielmi came to his house, but had not been invited. Furthermore, Italians normally have lunch at around 12:30 and Guglielmi's presence at around 09:00 AM would be not justified.&lt;ref name="Flamigni 2003"/&gt; Other sources list Guglielmi as a true member of Gladio, but the officer always firmly denied this accusation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 15 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; His direct superior, general [[Pietro Musumeci]], was a member of P2 and condemned for sidetracking the investigations on the [[Bologna massacre|1980 Bologna Station bombing]].&lt;ref name="storiain.net"/&gt;

The discovery of the BR refuge in via Gradoli ([[#The false Communication No. 7 and the discovery of the base of via Gradoli|see also below]]) saw the participation of members of both P2 and the police forces of Italy. Lucia Mokbel, an informer of SISDE, had communicated that she had heard [[Morse code|MORSE]] messages coming from the flat next to her. It turned out that those noises interpreted as MORSE code were in fact coming from the electric typewriter used by the Terrorists (BR) to type their demand letters. She informed police commissar Elio Coppa, enlisted in the Propaganda Due, but when police agents went to the flat and knocked on the door, strangely they did not attempt to enter it and left the place instead.&lt;ref name="storiain.net"/&gt; SISDE had been also informed that a lock up garage in via Gradoli had an antenna, allegedly used by the terrorist to communicate with the area of Lake Duchessa. However Giulio Grassini, head of SISDE and member of P2, did not take any investigative measures.&lt;ref name="storiain.net"/&gt;

Investigations made by [[DIGOS]] discovered that several machines used by the terrorists to print their communications from one year before the kidnapping of Moro, which was financed by Moretti, had been previously owned by the Italian state. These included a printer owned by the ''Raggruppamento Unità Speciali dell'Esercito'' and, despite its relatively young age and its high value, had been sold out as a scrap. A photocopier was previously owned by the Ministry of Transportation, acquired in 1969 and later sold to Enrico Triaca, a member of BR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 28 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivio900.it/it/documenti/doc.aspx?id=84 Operations of the Triaca tipography] Page at Italy '900 Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher= Fazi Editore|year=2005|isbn=978-88-8112-633-0|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apartment in via Gradoli ([[#The false Communication No. 7 and the discovery of the base of via Gradoli|see below]]&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 177"&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher= Fazi Editore|year=2005|isbn=978-88-8112-633-0|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had been rented by Mario Moretti under the pseudonym of Mario Borghi since 1978. The same building housed several apartments owned by SISDE men and one inhabited by a police confidant. During the days of the kidnapping the palace was inspected by Carabinieri under colonel Varisco, with the exclusion of Moretti's apartment—the official justification was that the Carabinieri were not authorized to enter the apartments if no one was inside. The owner of the apartment, Luciana Bozzi, was later discovered to be a friend of Giuliana Conforto, whose father was named in the [[Mitrokhin list]] of the [[KGB]]. Morucci and Faranda were eventually arrested in her flat. Pecorelli wrote a postcard to Moretti in 1977 from [[Ascoli Piceno]] (Moretti was born in the province of Ascoli), addressing it to one "Borghi at via Gradoli", with the message "Greetings, brrrr".&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 177"/&gt;

In June 2008 the Venezuelan terrorist [[Carlos the Jackal|Ilich Ramírez Sánchez]], best known as "Carlos the Jackal", spoke in an interview released to the Italian press agency ANSA declaring that several men of the SISMI, led by colonel Stefano Giovannone (considered near to Moro) negotiated at the airport in [[Beirut]] for the liberation of the politician during the night of 8 to 9 May 1978: the agreement would endorse the liberation of several imprisoned members of the BR to the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] in the territory of an Arabic country. According to Carlos the agreement, which found the opposition of the SISMI leading figures, failed because news about it leaked to other western secret services who, in turn, informed SISMI. Moro was killed the following day. Carlos stated that the officers involved in the attempt were all expelled from the services, being forced to resign or to go into compulsory retirement on a pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=di Paolo Cucchiarelli |url=http://www.americaoggi.info/2008/06/29/5999-intervista-carlos-cos-salt-lultimo-tentativo-di-salvare-moro |title=Così saltò l'ultimo tentativo di salvare Moro |date=29 June 2008 |publisher=Americaoggi.info |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/06/sezioni/cronaca/carlos-moro-sismi/carlos-moro-sismi/carlos-moro-sismi.html?ref=search|title=Parigi, parla il terrorista Carlos 'Il Sismi tentò di salvare Moro'|journal=la Repubblica|date=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement of foreign powers===
[[File:Henry Kissinger.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Henry Kissinger]]]]
In 2005 Giovanni Galloni, former national vice-secretary of Christian Democracy, said that during a discussion with Moro about the difficulty to find the Red Brigades' bases Moro told him that he knew of the presence of US and Israeli intelligence agents infiltrated within the BR. However the information obtained was not given to the Italian investigators. He also declared that the reason of the assassination of journalist Carmine Pecorelli was the same information, perhaps coming from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=55360 |title=Page at rainews.it |publisher=Rainews24.rai.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in front of the Italian parliament commission on terrorism Galloni also stated that, during his trip to the United States in 1976, he had been told that a government like that envisaged by Moro, which would include the Communist presence, would be opposed at "any cost" by the American Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Galloni, Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, 39th session, 22 July 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1983 trial against the BR Moro's widow, Eleonora Chiavarelli, declared that her husband was unpopular in the United States due to the [[Historic Compromise|historic compromise]] matter, and that he had been repeatedly warned by American politicians to stop disrupting the political situation which had been established in the [[Yalta conference]] (in reference to the possible executive role of the Italian Communist Party). According to her [[Henry Kissinger]] was one of the American personalities who menaced Moro in 1974 and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher=Fazi Editore|year= 2005| pages= 181–184|isbn=88-8112-633-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that the words to Moro which he repeated to her were:

{{quote| ... you have to put an end to your political plan of mustering all the forces in your country to collaborate directly. Here, or you stop doing this thing, or you will be badly punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movisol.org/moro.htm |title=Caso Moro: Verità e giustizia per riscattare il paese, '&amp;#39;Solidarietà'&amp;#39;, VI, 3, July 1998 |publisher=Movisol.org |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kissinger denied these accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', 15 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Franceschini]], one of the founders of BR, mentioned the possibility that the Red Brigades had been infiltrated by Israeli agents as early as 1974. He reported a confidence told to him by co-founder [[Renato Curcio]], according to whom Mario Moretti would be an infiltrated agent. Curcio has always denied this reconstruction. Moretti took the reins of the Red Brigades after Franceschini and Curcio were arrested in the mid-1970s, introducing a far stronger militarization of the organization's activities.

Moretti, in the Italian RAI TV programme ''[[La notte della Repubblica]]'' denied these accusations, saying that he had never seen an Israeli in his life and that it was wrong to think that the change of RB's strategy depended from the arrest of some militants. He also added:
{{quote|The hypothesis that the Red Brigades have been manipulated by anyone is a thesis dear to the conspiracy, which would divide the RB into good and bad.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;}}

===The false Communication No. 7 and the discovery of the base of via Gradoli===&lt;!--NOTE: Cited above--&gt;
Another controversial event occurred on April 18, 1978 when a false BR's "Communication No. 7" announced the death of Moro and that he had been buried near Lake Duchessa, in the [[province of Rieti]] (north of Rome). In response the Italian police looked in vain for Moro under the iced surface of the lake.

The authors of the false communication included Antonio Chichiarelli, a notorious forger from Rome who was connected to the [[Banda della Magliana]] gang of the city. Chichiarelli would later issue further false communications from the Red Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=164, note 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in uncertain circumstances in September 1984 when his connection with the false communiqué had been yet entirely clarified.&lt;ref name="Moro 105 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo |last=Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti|pages= 105 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chichiarelli spoke of the communication to several people, including Luciano Dal Bello, a confidant of the Carabinieri and of SISDE.&lt;ref name="Moro 105 ff"/&gt; Del Bello reported the facts but no investigation on Chichiarelli followed.

In the same day that the police force found an apartment used as a base by the Red Brigades in Rome, on via Gradoli 96. The discovery was allegedly due to a water leak for which a neighbour had called the firemen. The leak was caused by a tap left open in the apartment's shower in an unusual fashion, i.e. with water directed against the wall. The base was normally used by Mario Moretti but the Italian media reported the discovery immediately and he avoided returning there. As previously mentioned, the palace had been inspected by Carabinieri under colonel Varisco, with the exclusion of Moretti's apartment: the official justification was that the Carabinieri were not authorized to enter the apartments if no one was inside. The owner of the apartment, Luciana Bozzi, was later discovered to be a friend of Giuliana Conforto, whose father was named in the [[Mitrokhin list]] of the [[KGB]], and in whose apartments Morucci and Faranda were later arrested.

The commissar who had led Rome's police forces in the inspection of the building on via Gradoli, Elio Coppa, was eventually promoted to vice-director of SISDE—he later turned out to be a member of P2.&lt;ref&gt;[Italian Parliament's commission on the P2 lodge  (law 23 September 1981, n. 527) – minority report]&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbor whose call had led to the inspection, Lucia Mokbel, was officially a university student of Egyptian descent and was later identified as a confidant of SISDE&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 178–179"&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher= Fazi Editore|year=2005|isbn=978-88-8112-633-0|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaosedizioni.com/nov_covo_sintesinotizie.htm "Da via Gradoli al SISDE", page at Kaos edizioni website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121112703/http://www.kaosedizioni.com/nov_covo_sintesinotizie.htm |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the report of the inspection, which was presented at the trial on the Moro affair, was written on a type of paper distributed to the Italian police only in 1981, three years after the events.&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 178–179"/&gt;

Before, and after 1978, numerous apartments in the street had been used by Italian secret agents, including a Carabinieri NCO enrolled by SISMI who resided in the building facing that of Moretti and who was from the same birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaosedizioni.com/nov_covo_sintesinotizie.htm "Il covo di stato", page at Kaos edizioni website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121112703/http://www.kaosedizioni.com/nov_covo_sintesinotizie.htm |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the street there were also firms used by SISMI for its affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/segretigradoli.html |title=Sergio Flamigni, "I segreti di via Gradoli e la morte di Moro" |publisher=Rifondazione-cinecitta.org |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moretti's apartment itself had been under observation by UCIGOS for several years previously as it had been frequented also by members of the far-left organizations [[Potere Operaio]] and [[Autonomia Operaia]].&lt;ref&gt;Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, 31st session, interview of [[Adriana Faranda]], 11 February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, 48th session, interview of Giovanni Moro, 9 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was revealed that the Christian Democracy parliament member [[Benito Cazora]], during the contact he had with the [['ndrangheta]] (the [[Calabria]]n mafia) in the attempt to find Moro's prison, had been warned that the area of via Gradoli was a "hot zone".&lt;ref&gt;Cazora received in the formation while stopping in his car at a crossroad between [[via Cassia]] and via Gradoli.&lt;/ref&gt; Cazora had reported this warning to the DC and to the police.&lt;ref name="vuotoaperdere.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vuotoaperdere.org/interviste/areagiugno1997.pdf |title=Interview with Benito Cazora, magazine '&amp;#39;Area'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vuotoaperdere.org/interviste/Intervista.asp?IntID=6 |title=Interview with Mario Cazora, son of Benito Cazora, 25 December 2007 |publisher=Vuotoaperdere.org |date=2007-12-25 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mino Pecorelli, already mentioned for his likely knowledge of the presence of Moretti in via Gradoli, was one of the few journalists to immediately deny the authenticity of "Communication No.7", whereas most authorities had considered it true.

Some 30 years after the events Steve Pieczenik, an expert on terrorism of the US State Department, declared in an interview that the decision to issue the false communication was taken during a meeting of the crisis committee, present at which were Francesco Cossiga, members of the Italian intelligence agencies and Franco Ferracuti (as previously mentioned, a member of P2). The alleged goal was to prepare the Italian and European audience for the likely death of Moro in the kidnapping. He however stated that it would be ignored if the communication had been actually issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avvenimentionline.it/content/view/1325/1/ |title=Interview with Sergio Flamigni at '&amp;#39;Avvenimenti'&amp;#39; website, by Paola Pentimella Testa |publisher=Avvenimentionline.it |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228053202/http://www.avvenimentionline.it/content/view/1325/1/ |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[#Role of Steve Pieczenik|below]]

It was also supposed that Moro had told his kidnappers of the existence of [[Operation Gladio]], many years before its public revelation in 1990. From this point of view the false "Communication No.7" was a code message from sectors of the Italian secret agencies that Moro should not return alive from his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bicola|last=Biondo|title=Il falsario di stato|author2=Massimo Veneziani|publisher=Cooper|year=2008|isbn=88-7394-107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1978 the Red Brigades issued the true Communication No.7: they attached a photo of Aldo Moro holding a copy of ''[[La Repubblica]]'', dated 19 April, showing that the politician was still alive.

===The séance===
[[File:Romano Prodi 1978.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Romano Prodi]] in 1978.]]
Also connected to via Gradoli is an event which involved [[Romano Prodi]], [[Mario Baldassarri]] and [[Alberto Clò]]. During an alleged [[séance]] in which they participated on 2 April 1978, after asking the soul of [[Giorgio La Pira]] about the location of Moro, a [[Ouija|Ouija table]] they were using registered the words [[Viterbo]], [[Bolsena]] and [[Gradoli]], three towns north of Rome. The information was trusted and a police group made an armed blitz in the town of Gradoli, 80&amp;nbsp;km from [[Rome]], on the following day, 6 April&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1978c.htm |title=Moro e i segreti, by Paolo Avanti, page at Cronologia italiana history website |publisher=Cronologia.leonardo.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Moro was not found.&lt;ref&gt;The supernatural element was generally not overlooked during the investigations. For example, [http://www.salpan.org/ARTICOLI/Seduta%20spiritica%20di%20Prodi.htm The Italian government had engaged] a [[diviner]], hoping that he would find Moro's location. As document in Sergio Flamigni's ''La tela del ragno'' (pages 102–103), the police made another fruitless blitz in Viterbo after an abbess declared that, during a vision, she had seen him there.&lt;/ref&gt; Prodi spoke to the Italian parliament's commission about the case in 1981. In the notes of the Italian parliament commission on terrorism the séance is described as a fake, used to hide the true source of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/pellegrino/pelle/pelle.html |title=Pellegrino: un'intelligence a caccia delle carte di Moro, on '&amp;#39;La Repubblica online website'&amp;#39;, 28 July 1999 |publisher=Repubblica.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Giulio Andreotti declared that the information came from the Bologna section of [[Autonomia Operaia]], a far-left organization with some ties with the BR, and that Cossiga also knew the true source. Judge [[Ferdinando Imposimato]] considered Andreotti's theory as "possible", but accused him of having kept information that could have been valuable in a trial about Moro's murder.&lt;ref&gt;Dino Martiniano. "Macchè seduta spiritica per Moro". ''Corriere della Sera''. April 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moro's widow later declared that she had repeatedly informed the police that a via Gradoli existed in Rome, but the investigators did not consider it — some replied to her that the street did not appear in Rome's maps.&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 178–179"/&gt; This is confirmed by other Moro relatives, but strongly denied by Francesco Cossiga.&lt;ref&gt;Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, 48th session, interview of Giovanni Moro, 9 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the séance matter was reopened by the Italian parliament's commission on terrorism. While Prodi (then prime minister) declared that he had no time for an interview, both Baldassarri (senator and vice-minister in two [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]] cabinets) and Clò (minister of Industry in [[Lamberto Dini]]'s cabinet and owner of the house where the séance was performed) responded to the call: they confirmed the circumstances of the séance, and that the word "Gradoli" had appeared in several sessions, even if the participants had changed.

===Involvement of the Mafia===
In the years following Moro's murder there have been numerous references to the presence of Calabrian 'ndrangheta at via Fani. In an intercepted phone call between Sereno Freato, then Moro's personal secretary, and [[Benito Cazora]], a DC parliament member who had been given the task to keep contacts with the Calabrian gangs, Freato asks for news about the prison of Moro. The 'ndrangheta was in possession of several photos of the events in via Fani, some of which allegedly portrayed a "man known by them". According to what was reported by Cazora in 1991 some members of the 'ndrangheta, who had been expelled from Calabria, had offered their assistance to the Christian Democracy to discover the location of Moro, in exchange for the possibility to return to their homeland. However this collaboration never materialized.&lt;ref name="vuotoaperdere.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

According to the Sicilian Mafia ''pentito'' [[Tommaso Buscetta]], several Italian state organizations tried to obtain information about Moro's location from the Mafia, but later [[Giuseppe Calò]] asked boss [[Stefano Bontade]] to stop the search, since the highest members of DC no longer desired the liberation of their fellow politician.&lt;ref name="Bianconi"/&gt; The decision to abandon the search was taken between 9 and 10 April after Moro had revealed to his captors a series of very compromising information about the American CIA and Giulio Andreotti.&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2003 43"&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher=Fazi Editore |year=2003|isbn=88-8112-633-8| page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources report that the Sicilian Mafia changed its mind due to Moro's will to associate the Communist Party with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel |last=Amara|title=Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher=Cooper|page= 71, note 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a deposition made at trial [[Raffaele Cutolo]], then leader of the Neapolitan [[camorra]], declared that the [[Banda della Magliana]] asked him if he was interested in the liberation of Moro. Cutolo contacted the Italian secret service who replied to him to stay away from the matter, because had vetoed the intermediation for the salvation of the then president of the DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3r4NGVadE |title=Cutolo's interview at YouTube |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2008-04-20 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerio Morucci]] has completely discredited this confused story: he showed that the Camorra's militants were apparently "normal people in suits", completely alien environment of the underworld and therefore difficult to identify from the ''Banda della Magliana''. Morucci concluded: "We weren't a gang ... we didn't meet under the street lights ... we didn't do we trade strange ... I don't see how the Banda della Magliana or anyone could identify the Red Brigades".&lt;ref name=Satta&gt;Satta, Vladimiro (2003). ''Odissea nel caso Moro''. Edup.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 1993 a 'Ndrangheta pentito, {{Interlanguage link multi|Saverio Morabito|it|3=Rapporti tra 'Ndrangheta e altre organizzazioni criminali}}, declared that Antonio Nirta, another Calabrian gangster who had been infiltrated in the Red Brigades, took part in the assault in via Fani.&lt;ref name="lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it"&gt;[http://www.lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it/puntata.aspx?id=40 ''La storia siamo noi'', show of [[RAI]] Italian state network, episode "Il caso Moro"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206083035/http://www.lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it/puntata.aspx?id=40 |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio Flamigni, a former communist senator and member of the Italian Parliament commission on the Moro affair, wrote that when he learnt about Morabito's words he remembered about the testimony of Benito Cazora, who had declared that he had been approached by a Calabrian asking him about photos shot in via Fani.&lt;ref name="lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it"/&gt;

According to the 'Ndrangheta [[pentito]] [[Francesco Fonti]], his boss [[Sebastiano Romeo]] was involved in attempts to locate the place where Moro was held. Romeo had been asked by unnamed national and Calabrian Christian Democrats such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Riccardo Misasi|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Vito Napoli|it}} to help out.&lt;ref name=esp220909&gt;{{it icon}} [http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/io-boss-cercai-di-salvare-moro/2110299 'Io boss, cercai di salvare Moro'], ''L’espresso'', September 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of [[SISMI]] and the [[Banda della Magliana]], Fonti was able to locate the house where Moro was kept. When he reported back, Romeo said that he had done a good job but that important politicians in Rome had changed their minds.&lt;ref name=esp220909/&gt;

Morabito's revelations were not considered supported by adequate evidence.&lt;ref name="Satta"/&gt;

===Role of Carmine Pecorelli===&lt;!--NOTE: linked above.--&gt;
[[File:CarminePecorelli.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Carmine Pecorelli]]]]
Journalist [[Carmine Pecorelli|Carmine "Mino" Pecorelli]], who apparently had several informers in the Italian secret services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo|last= Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti| page= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke repeatedly about the kidnapping of Moro in his magazine ''Osservatorio Politico'' (or simply ''OP''). Before the events of via Fani, Pecorelli had already written about the possibility that Moro would be blocked in his attempt to admit the Italian Communist Party into the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo|last= Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti| page= 20 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1978, one day before Moro was abducted, ''Osservatorio Politico'' published an article which, citing the anniversary of the killing of [[Julius Caesar]] in relation with the upcoming formation of Andreotti's cabinet, mentioned a possible new [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] (one of the assassins of Caesar, and a member of his family).&lt;ref name="Moro 22 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo Carlo|last= Moro|title=Storia di un delitto annunciato|publisher=Editori Riuniti| pages= 22 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles written during the politician's imprisonment show that he already knew of the existence of a ''memorial'' (the documents written by Moro in his detention) and of some of the unpublished letters. Pecorelli stated that there were two groups within the Red Brigades, one favourable to the negotiations, and one who wanted to kill Moro in any case. He hinted that the group that had captured Moro in via Fani was not the same that was detaining him, and which had planned the whole move. He wrote:

{{quote| The authors of the massacre of via Fani and of the kidnapping of Aldo Moro are professionals trained in top-level war schools. The killers sent to assault the president's car, instead, could be only unskilled workers recruited on the road.&lt;ref name="Moro 22 ff"/&gt; }}

When the terrorist base in via Gradoli was discovered Pecorelli stressed how in the apartment, different from what could be expected, all the proofs of the BR's presence were clearly displayed. Regarding the kidnapping he wrote that Moro's opening to the Communist Party was not welcome, both by the United States as it would change the political balance of southern Europe, nor by the Soviet Union since this would prove that Communists could reach power democratically, and without being a direct offshoot of any [[Communism|Communist party]].&lt;ref name="Moro 22 ff"/&gt;

On 20 March 1979 Pecorelli was murdered in front of his house. In 1992 the Mafia ''[[pentito]]'' Tommaso Buscetta revealed that the journalist had been eliminated as "a favor to Andreotti", who was preoccupied about some information about Moro's kidnapping in the possession of Pecorelli. The latter had allegedly received from general Dalla Chiesa (they were both affiliated or near to P2) a copy of a letter by Moro which contained dangerous accusations against Andreotti; the journalist had hinted about them in some previous articles. The unabridged letters were published only in 1991 when, together with others, it was discovered during renovation works in via Nevoso (only a resume of them, the so-called ''Memoriale Moro'', had been previously issued). The fact that Moro's letters were circulating before 1991 is proven by a speech held by [[Bettino Craxi]], leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), in which he mentioned a letter which had not been officially published at the time. The fact was considered a subtle menace against Andreotti in the war for the supreme political power waged between PSI and DC at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Italian parliament, IX legislature, Chamber of Deputies, Assembly, interventions of deputies Adolfo Battaglia (p. 15202) and [[Virginio Rognoni]] (p. 15245).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Giuseppe Tamburrano|it}} expressed doubts about what was said by the Mafia ''[[pentito|pentiti]]'' because, comparing the two memorials (the "amputee" of 1978 and the "complete" of 1990), noted that Moro's allegations addressed to Andreotti were the same, so Andreotti had no interest to order the murder of Pecorelli, who could not threaten him to publish things already known and publicly available.&lt;ref name="Tamburrano"/&gt;

Andreotti underwent a trial for his role in the assassination of Pecorelli. He was acquitted in the first grade trial (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, Giuliano; Martirano Dino; Cavallaro, Felice (25 September 1999). "Tutti assolti per l'omicidio Pecorelli". ''Corriere della Sera'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; condemned in the second (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Haver, Flavio (18 November 2002). "Delitto Pecorelli, condannati Andreotti e Badalamenti". ''Corriere della Sera'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally acquitted by the Italian Supreme Court (2003).&lt;ref&gt;"Andreotti, assoluzione definitiva". ''Corriere della Sera''. 31 October 2003, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pecorelli, in an article written the very day of his assassination, hinted to the role of opera composer [[Igor Markevitch]] (see [[#Role of Igor Markevitch|below]]) in the kidnapping.

===Role of Steve Pieczenik===
[[Steve Pieczenik]] was an American negotiatior and expert in terrorism who was sent by the US State Department, at the request of Cossiga, and remained in Italy for three weeks during Moro's detention. He later collaborated with [[Tom Clancy]] as a novel and cinematic writer. His presence in Italy as a member of one of the previously mentioned "crisis committees" was revealed only in the early 1990s. Pieczenik had written to a relation in which he spoke about the possible effects of Moro's abduction, the possibility that the Red Brigades had been infiltrated by Italian agents, and also gave advice about how to find the terrorists. Eventually however, Pieczenik declared that this relation was false, since the ideas included were similar to those of the P2-affiliated criminologist Francesco Ferracuti, another member of the secret committee. Pieczenik also stated that he did not release any written document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel |last=Amara|title=Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher=Cooper|page= 159, note 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to what was revealed by Cossiga and by Pieczenik himself, his initial idea was to show the will to negotiate, with the goal of gaining time and in the hope that the terrorists would make some error from which they could be detected.&lt;ref&gt;Italian Parliament Investigation Commission on Terrorism, 27th session, interview of  Francesco Cossiga, 27 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; During later interviews, Pieczenik declared that there were numerous leaks about the discussions made at the committee:

{{quote|I found myself in a room with numerous generals and politicians, all people who knew [Moro] well, and... Well, I felt that no one of them liked Moro or appreciated him as a person, including Cossiga. It was clear that I was not speaking with his allies. [...] After a while I recognized that what happened in the meeting room was leaking outside. I knew it because there were people who – including the BR themselves – were releasing declarations which could stem only from within our group. [...] I thus decided to  reduce the number of participants, but the leakage continued to grow, so that at the end there were only two. I and Cossiga. But the leakage did not stop.&lt;ref name="theboot.it"/&gt;}}

Pieczenik also declared that, once returned to the United States, he met an alleged Argentinian secret agent who knew everything that had happened at the Italian crisis committee. Pieczenik explained the leak to Argentina with the presence in the committee of numerous members of the P2 lodge, which had strong ties with the South American country (its founder Licio Gelli had lived for a period there).&lt;ref name="theboot.it"&gt;[http://www.theboot.it/pieczenikIT.htm "I giorni del complotto", by [[Robert Katz]], ''Panorama'', 13 August 1994].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later interview to French journalist Emmanuel Amara, Pieczenik declared:

{{quote| I soon understood the true intentions of the actors in the game: the [Italian] right wanted the death of Moro, the Red Brigades wanted him alive, while the Communist Party, due to its hardline political position, was not going to negotiate. Francesco Cossiga, from his side, wanted him alive and well, but numerous forces in the country had radically different programs. [...] We had to pay attention to the left and the right both:  we should avoid that the Communists entered the government and, at the same time, suppress any harmful capability of the reactionary and anti-democratic right forces. At the same time it was  desirable that Moro's family did not start a parallel negotiation, averting the risk that he could be released too soon. But I recognized that, pushing my strategy to its extreme consequences, I should perhaps sacrify the hostage for the stability of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At his arrival in Italy Pieczenik had been informed by Cossiga and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] intelligence services that there had been a coup attempt in Italy in previous months, led by right-winged personalities of the intelligence services and of P2.&lt;ref&gt;Pieczenik did not specify which coup he was referring to. Known coup attempts in Italy include the [[Piano Solo]] (1964), the [[Golpe Borghese]] (1970), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rosa dei Venti|it|3=Rosa dei venti (storia)}} (early 1970s) and [[Edgardo Sogno]]'s "White Golpe" of 1974. In an interview to ''[[L'espresso]]'' of 1981, former general Maletti mentioned two further coup attempts in August and September 1974, but they preceded Moro's capture by several years. See {{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|pages=98, 104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieczenik was astonished by the presence of so many fascists in the Italian intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Brigades had also infiltrated the Italian institutions and obtained information from the children of politicians who were members of left and far-left organizations. With the help of the Vatican intelligence, which he considered superior to the Italian one, he investigated such infiltrations, but no measures were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieczenik also declared that he participated in the decision to issue the false "Communication No.7", stating that he pushed the BR to kill Moro in order to de-legitimise them, once it was clear that the Italian politicians were not interested in his liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pieczenik, the United States did not have a clear image of the situation in Italy, especially for the left and right-wing terrorist groups; he also said that he received no help from CIA or the US embassy in Italy.&lt;ref name="theboot.it"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieczenik explained his premature return to the US with the desire to avoid the accusations of American pressure behind the now likely death of Moro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Emmanuel|last= Amara|title= Abbiamo ucciso Aldo Moro. La vera storia del rapimento Moro|publisher= Cooper|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously he had instead declared that he had left in order to deprive the decisions taken by the Italian institutions, which he considered inefficient and corrupted, of any US legitimisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theboot.it/pieczenikIT.htm "I giorni del complotto", by [[Robert Katz]], ''Panorama'', 13 August 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Igor Markevitch===
Russian composer and conductor [[Igor Markevitch]] has also been purported to have helped the kidnappers, housing them in his villa at [[Florence]] and perhaps preparing the questions made to Moro. His residence in Rome faced via Michelangelo Caetani (Markevitch had married the daughter of the nobleman after whom the street was named), where Moro's body was found after he was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/grande-vecchio.html "Il grande vecchio"] The first terrorist to speak of a mysterious "host" was Valerio Morucci&lt;/ref&gt;

A report issued by SISMI in 1980 mentions one "Igor, of the dukes Caetani family", who had a prominent role in the Red Brigades organization. Two agents of SISMI were investigating near Paleazzo Caetani in the early May 1978 when Moro had not yet been murdered. They were stopped by an unspecified "superior intervention" (allegedly coming from the agency's director, Giuseppe Santovito, a member of P2). Markevitch has been also identified as the "mysterious intermediary" mentioned by the Red Brigades in their Communication No.4.&lt;ref name="Fasanella 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rifondazione-cinecitta.org/grande-vecchio.html |title=Il grande vecchio |publisher=Rifondazione-cinecitta.org |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article written the very day in which he was killed, Mino Pecorelli, speaking of the "prison of the people" where Moro was kept, mentioned a palace having a frieze with lions and located in the centre of Rome; and described a duchess who could see the body of Moro from her balcony. The Caetani palace in which Markevitch and his wife lived had a bas-relief of two lions biting two horses.&lt;ref&gt;Calabrò, Maria Antonietta (30 May 1999). "Caso Moro, un musicista ospitò i capi Br", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged presence of a marksman===
In the course of Moro's capture the terrorists fired 93 bullets. These killed all the five members of the escort but left Moro with only a light wound in his thigh. Despite this apparent precision, members of the BR such as [[Valerio Morucci]] declared that they had only a rough shooting training, obtained by firing their weapons in grottoes at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sergio|last=Zavoli|title=La notte della repubblica|publisher=Nuova ERI/Edizioni RAI|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the bodyguards (two sitting in the front seats of Moro's car, and three in the following one), separated from the politician, likely made it easier for the ambush squad to direct their fire against them and avoid hitting Moro.

However several writers and observers suggested that the ambushers of via Fani included a marksman.&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2003 43"/&gt; Sources such as the magazine ''[[l'espresso]]'' further suppose that he could have been a member of the Italian intelligence service and identify him as Giustino De Vuono, a marksman once part of the [[French Foreign Legion]]: according to their reconstruction, the 49 bullets found in the bodies of the bodyguards would come from his weapon. A witness reporting on 19 April 1978 at Rome's Prefecture declared that he had recognized De Vuono driving a green [[Austin Mini]] or [[Autobianchi A112]] on the location of the massacre. De Vuono, who was affiliated to the [['Ndrangheta]] (Calabrian mafia), on that day was not in his usual residence in southern [[Paraguay]] (at the time under the dictatorship of [[Alfredo Stroessner]]). Several members of the Red Brigades declared that their weapons were acquired from the Calabrian gangland, amongst others; further, it has been proved that members of DC got in touch with Calabrian gangsters to obtain a help in the liberation of Moro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Il fantasma di Via Fani |journal=L'Espresso|issue= 20 |date=21 May 2009|pages= 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the alleged marksman has been also associated to the German terrorist group RAF. Another witness of the events in via Fani declared that some thirty minutes before the ambush a foreigner with German accent had addressed him, ordering to go away from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gli anni di Moro|journal=la Repubblica|date=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since some of the ammunition used for the massacre had been treated with a special preserving paint (which was also found in some secret depots related to the [[Gladio]] undercover organization), it has been suggested that these would come from some Italian military or paramilitary corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher= Fazi Editore|year=2005|isbn=978-88-8112-633-0|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of the alternative kidnapping===&lt;!--LINKED ABOVE--&gt;
Journalist Rita di Giovacchino suggests that Moro was not in via Fani during the massacre, but had been taken prisoner by another organization and that the Red Brigades acted only as "front men". This would explain their reticence and the incongruity of their declarations about the whole kidnapping (from the ambush, to the presence of sand on Moro's body). According to her, this would also explain the [[sibylline]] remark pronounced by Sereno Freato, first secretary of Aldo Moro, when Carmine Pecorelli (see [[#Role of Carmine Pecorelli|above]]) was also found dead: "Investigate on the instigators of [[Carmine Pecorelli|Pecorelli]]'s murder, and would find the instigators of Moro's murder". She thus lists as part of the same plot the deaths of Pecorelli, [[Chichiarelli]] (who would have been punished for his blackmailing attempts) and of Carabinieri colonel {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Varisco|it}}. Allegedly killed by the Red Brigades in 1979, although in circumstances never clear, [[Antonio Varisco]] had been at the helm of the investigation on the BR base in via Gradoli; he was also a friend of general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa (also murdered for never completely understood reasons), as well as of Pecorelli. The use made by BR of printing machines once owned by the Italian intelligence, according to di Giovacchino, shows that the latter were likely the organization behind all these bloody acts.&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 141 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher= Fazi Editore|year=2005|isbn=978-88-8112-633-0|pages=141 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Moretti declared that he was studying Moro's daily moves since 1976. Every morning the politician went with his grandson to a church near his house, after which he had a short walk with only one member of the escort. This looked like a more favourable moment to kidnap him, since most of the bodyguards were not present, but was not chosen by the terrorists. On the morning of his abduction Moro did not bring his grandson with him.

After the ambush in via Fani the terrorists took only the most interesting for them of the five bags that Moro carried with him. Those containing the politician's medicines and his reserved documents. Further, the necessity of inflicting a coup de grâce to any of the bodyguards is in contrast with a hurried attack typical of such acts, and is motivated only by the necessity to eliminate any possible witness that would reveal that Moro was not there. In a letter to his wife Moro wrote during captivity he asked her to take care of his bags. Since Moro was surely aware that if his bags had been found in the massacre location, they had been taken by the investigators. Also the absence from his letter of any word about the victims of via Fani has been taken as an element in favour of the theory that Moro was captured while in his Gladio escort (see [[#Involvement of P2, Gladio and of the Italian intelligence services|Involvement of P2, Gladio and of the Italian intelligence services]]) and not in via Fani and so did not know anything about their assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altrainformazione.it/wp/2008/10/25/il-caso-moro-secondo-gabriella-pasquali-carlizzi/ |title=Moro aveva due scorte |publisher=Altrainformazione.it |date=2008-10-25 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubts about the kidnapping===

Numerous unanswered questions surround Moro's kidnapping in via Fani:&lt;ref name="lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it"/&gt;

*Moro's widow noted that in Moro's letters, delivered by the terrorists, there is no mention of the killing of his bodyguards: given the character of Aldo Moro, she considered it improbable that he did not write a single word about these victims.&lt;ref name="Di Giovacchino 2005 141 ff"/&gt;
*On 1 October 1993, during the fourth trial on the Moro affair, ballistic experts released a report which disputed the version of Valerio Morucci. According to their new report, a second member of the ambush squad fired towards the Fiat 130.&lt;ref&gt;Acts of Moro ''quarter'' ("fourth") trial, ballistic report by professor Antonio Ugolini. According to the report, "in via Fani, on the morning of 16 March [1978], at least seven weapons fired. The shots came from both the sides of the street and not only from the left, as stated by the terrorist Valerio Morucci in a memorial..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number of the participants in the ambush (the terrorists initially spoke of nine, later of eleven people) is considered small by other terrorists, such as Red Brigades co-founder Alberto Franceschini. He declared: "For the capture of {{Interlanguage link multi|Mario Sossi|it}}, in 1974, we were twelve. I think that managing a kidnapping such as that of via Fani with 11 is quite risky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rita |last=Di Giovacchino|title=Il libro nero della Prima Repubblica|publisher= Fazi Editore|year=2005|isbn=978-88-8112-633-0|pages=120 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alessandro Marini, an engineer who passed by via Fani the day of the assault, declared that two people on a [[Honda]] motorbike shot at him with a firearm. The motorbike preceded Mario Moretti's car. However, members of the Red Brigades always denied the presence of the Honda and did not explain the origin of the shooting against Marini.&lt;ref name="lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it"/&gt;
*An unexplained element is how the terrorists could have planned an ambush in via Fani, since Moro's escort changed their routes daily. However, the terrorists for the occasion had taken measures, such as cutting the tyres of the van of a florist who worked in via Fani (in order to remove a dangerous witness during the ambush), which can be explained only by their having precise knowledge of Moro's route that morning.
*[[Telecom Italia|SIP]], then Italy's national telephone company, was exceedingly inefficient on numerous occasions linked to Moro's detention. In particular, after the assault in via Fani, all the phone communications in the area were inoperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/inlavorazione/visualizza_new.html_48488334.html |title=ANSA news, 19 aprile 2008 |publisher=Ansa.it |date=2008-04-19 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002140519/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/inlavorazione/visualizza_new.html_48488334.html |archivedate=2012-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples included when, on 14 April, journalists of Rome's newspaper ''[[Il Messaggero]]'' were waiting for a phone call from the terrorists. The six phone lines in the newspaper's office had been connected to police central but, when the call arrived, [[DIGOS]] reported that all of them had been cut, with the result that the caller could not be identified. On 15 March 1978, the day before the capture of Moro, SIP had been alerted. However, after Moro had been kidnapped, an inspection of the telephone lines in the area of via Fani showed that they were all out of order. This prevented any possible witness contact with the police before the ambush. The commander of DIGOS during the kidnapping days described SIP as "totally un-cooperative", and stated that "in no occasion did they find the origin of the kidnappers' calls", concluding by noting that Michele Principe, then general director of [[STET - Società Finanziaria Telefonica|STET]], the company that owned SIP, was a member of the P2 lodge.&lt;ref&gt;L. Cipriani, "L'Affare Moro"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antonella.beccaria.org/2010/08/10/seguendo-il-memoriale-moro-un-blackout-dei-telefoni-poiche-siamo-appassionati-di-elementi-secondari/ |title=Reports of the Italian commission on terrorism, Document XXIII, n. 64, vol. I |publisher=Antonella.beccaria.org |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other suspicions and controversies===
*Chichiarelli, the author of the false "Communication No.7", was related to the ''[[Banda della Magliana]]''. Aside from its purely criminal activities this large gang in Rome was related to Sicilian Mafia and has been involved in numerous political and terrorist scandals since the 1970s. Judiciary acts have proved that members of the gang had a role in the assassination of Pecorelli and in the case of [[Roberto Calvi]] (both of which saw the incrimination of [[Giulio Andreotti]]), in the financial affairs of the [[Vatican City]] (including the kidnapping of [[Emanuela Orlandi]]), and in the sidetracking of the investigations on massacres such as [[massacre of Bologna Station|that of Bologna Station]]. Judge [[Ferdinando Imposimato]] proved that the "Banda della Magliana" had strong ties with [[SISMI]] (Italy's military intelligence agency),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Il governo impossibile|title=La nebulosa del caso Moro|editor=Maria Fida Moro|publisher=Selene Edizioni|year=2004|pages=37 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the latter inspired the farce of the communication and of the ''Lago della Duchessa''. Finally, the apartment of via Montalcini, in which Moro was allegedly detained by the Red Brigades, was located in the [[Magliana]] quarter of southern Rome and a member of the gang owned the building facing that apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/03/16/le-br-fantasma-paradosso-del-caso-moro.html|title=Le Br fantasma paradosso del Caso Moro|journal=la Repubblica|date=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Members of Moro's escort, who were not in service on the day of the kidnap, declared in September 1978 that Moro was a habitual person, and that every day he got out from his house exactly at 09:00 AM. However, Moro's widow denied this circumstance during her interview in front of the investigative judges on 23 September 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Oggi|issue=19 |date=12 May 2010|pages=55–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Francesco Cossiga declared that Moro's confessor, Don [[Antonio Mennini]] (later [[papal nuncio]] to Great Britain), was allowed to enter in the politician's cell just before his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzquotidiano.it/cronaca-italia/antonello-mennini-moro-nunzio-apostolico-685741/ |title=Cossiga's declaration of 22 February 2008 to SKY Tg24 |location=41.902916,12.453389 |publisher=Blitzquotidiano.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Don Mennini has denied this reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Bianconi, Giovanni (10 March 2015). "Dai contatti dei brigatisti ai baffi di Morucci La versione (e gli enigmi) del prete di Moro". ''Corriere della Sera'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political consequences==
[[File:Enrico Berlinguer.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Enrico Berlinguer]], leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]].]]
The kidnapping and murder of Moro drastically changed the politics of Italy.

The [[Historic Compromise]] between DC and PCI, one of Moro's main goals, was not liked by Italy's main international partners. On 23 March 1976 Aldo Moro, during his tenure as prime minister, took part in the [[G7]] conference in [[Puerto Rico]]. When he asked his colleagues' opinions about the matter they replied to him that, if it materialized, the presence of the Communists in the executive would cause the loss of international support (including financial ones) for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loccidentale.it/articolo/grandi+coalizioni.+gli+anni+della+solidariet%C3%A0+nazionale |title=Grandi coalizioni. Gli anni della solidarietà nazionale, by Maurizio Stefanini, '&amp;#39;L'Occidente'&amp;#39;, 6 April 2008 |publisher=Loccidentale.it |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the previous general elections, DC had scored a 38%, followed by PCI with 34%. Moro was considered a natural candidate for the next [[President of the Italian Republic]], with the ensuing realization of the government alliance between the two parties. His assassination marked the definitive end of the Historic Compromise.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord, January 1979, Foreword to the fourth Italian edition of ''La società dello spettacolo'' (Vallecchi, Florence, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 1978, the very day of the kidnapping of Moro, Andreotti's cabinet obtained the vote of confidence: it was voted for by all the Italian parties, with the exception of the [[Italian Social Movement|Social Movement]], the [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] (the first a far right party, the second a centre-right one), the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] and of [[Proletarian Democracy]] (the latter being left/far left formations). The executive was formed exclusively by members from DC and could govern only with the indirect support of PCI (the so-called "non-no confidence").

Between 1978 and 1979, Italy was involved with a series of events, after the assassination of Moro; on 15 June [[Giovanni Leone]] resigned from the [[President of Italy|presidency of the Republic]], ending six months before his term as a result of harsh polemics and attacks on his person. A few weeks later [[Sandro Pertini]] was elected with plebiscite vote. In January 1979, Andreotti's cabinet resigned: Pertini entrusted the task to [[Ugo La Malfa]], but the attempt failed and there were new elections.
At [[Italian general election, 1979|successive elections]] the DC remained stable while the PCI suffered a sharp setback: 
this result marked the end of the government of national solidarity and the possibility of entry of the Communists in the executive.

The party, under the stronger influence of [[Ciriaco De Mita]] (from 1982 to 1989), Giulio Andreotti and [[Arnaldo Forlani]] (from 1989), remained a government party until 1994; in the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 elections]] went down for the first time below 30% of the votes due to the [[Lega Nord]]'s growth in [[Northern Italy]], and following the requests of [[Mani pulite]] scandal (and the ties between the Mafia and Andreotti himself) that also involved the allied parties (in addition to former PCI, renamed [[Democratic Party of the Left|PDS]], involved at the local level), continued to lose support. In 1994 the party was disbanded and the DC's last secretary, [[Mino Martinazzoli]], decided to change the name of the party to the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]].

According to the acts of the Italian Parliament commission on terrorism:
{{quote|Moro's murder, evaluated as a historical fact, appeared as the moment of greatest offensive power of the armed party [the terrorists] and, speculatively, as the moment in which the State proved itself unable to give a barely adequate reply to the subversive aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storiain.net/arret/num115/artic5.asp |title=Le BR e l'omicidio Moro, by Giuseppe dell'Acqua |publisher=Storiain.net |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Kuki language.png|thumb|260px|Approximate extension of the area traditionally inhabited by the Kuki people.]]
The '''Kukis'''&lt;ref&gt;{{MYname|MY=ချင်းလူမျိုး|MLCTS=hkyang lu. myui:}}, {{IPA-my|tɕɪ́ɴ lù mjó|pron}}&lt;/ref&gt; constitute one of several hill tribes within [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and Burma. As [[Chin people|Chin]] in the [[Chin State]] of [[Myanmar]] and as [[Mizo people|Mizo]] in the State of [[Mizoram]] in India are a number of related [[Tibeto-Burman]] tribal peoples spread throughout the northeastern states of India, northwestern Burma, and the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of Bangladesh. In [[Northeast India]], they are present in all states except [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. This dispersal across international borders is a culmination of punitive actions made by the British during [[British Raj|their occupation of India]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Haokip, 'The Kuki Tribes of Meghalaya: A Study of their Socio-Political Problems', in S.R. Padhi (Ed.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/4392866/The_Kuki_Tribes_of_Meghalaya_A_Study_of_their_Socio-Political_Problems Current Tribal Situation: Strategies for Planning, Welfare and Sustainable Development]''. Delhi: Mangalam Publications, 2013, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fifty tribes of Kuki peoples in India are recognised as [[scheduled tribe]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120417072648/http://tribal.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/File939.pdf Alphabetical List of India's Scheduled Tribes]&lt;/ref&gt; based on the dialect spoken by that particular Kuki community as well as their region of origin.



The name "Chin" is disputed. During the [[British Raj|British occupation of India]], the British used the compound term 'Chin-Kuki-Mizo' to group the Kukish language speaking people, and the Government of India "inherited" this.&lt;ref&gt;Violence and identity in North-east India: Naga-Kuki conflict - Page 201 S. R. Tohring - 2010 "... for these tribes including • the Kuki/ speaking tribe such as: 'Chin', 'Mizo', 'Chin-Kuki-Mizo', 'CHIKIM', 'Zomi', 'Zou', 'Zo'. ...

==History==

===Early history===

The early history of the Kukis is obscure. The origin of the word "Kuki" is uncertain, but like the word "Naga", it is an [[exonym]]: it was not originally as a self-designation by the tribes that are now called Kukis. According to the [[British Raj|colonial British]] writer Adam Scott Reid, the earliest reference to the word Kuki can be dated to 1777 CE, when it first appeared in British records. However, PS Haokip of [[Kuki National Army|Kuki National Organisation]] claims that a 33 CE record refers to two Kuki chiefs named Kuki Ahongba and Kuki Achouba.&lt;ref name="SRTohring_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=S. R. Tohring |title=Violence and Identity in North-east India: Naga-Kuki Conflict |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlaIRKRspYQC&amp;pg=PA8 |year=2010 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-8324-344-5 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Sanskrit]] legendary literature mentions the [[Kirata]] people, which have been identified with tribes such as the Kuki.&lt;ref name="Mrinal2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mrinal |last=Miri | date=2003 | title=Linguistic Situation in North-East India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfSz3UOAxM4C&amp;pg=PA77  | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | page=77 | isbn=978-81-8069-026-6 | accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to CA Soppit, the "Old Kukis" migrated to Manipur in the early 11th century, while the "New Kukis" migrated to [[Manipur]] during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="SPSinha_2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. P.

===Contact with outside world and resistance===
Long ignored by the outside world, an important landmark in the history of the Kuki people was the arrival of missionaries and the spread of Christianity among them. Missionary activity had considerable social, cultural and political ramifications while the acceptance of Christianity marked a departure from the tradition religion of the Kuki peoples as well as both the Kuki peoples' ancestral customs and traditions. The spread of English education introduced the Kuki people to the "modern era". William Pettigrew, the first foreign missionary, came to Manipur on 6 February 1894 and was sponsored by the [[American Baptist Church|American Baptist Mission Union]]. He, together with Dr. Crozier, worked together in the North and the Northeast of Manipur. In the south, Watkins Robert of the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales|Welsh Presbytery]] mission organised the Indo-Burma [[Thadou]]-Kuki Pioneer Mission in 1913. To have a broader scope, the mission’s name was changed to North East India General Mission (NEIGM).&lt;ref&gt;T. Haokip, '[https://www.academia.edu/29134905/Kuki_Churches_Unification_Movements Kuki Churches Unification Movements]', ''Journal of North East India Studies'', Vol. 2(1), 2012, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first resistance to British hegemony by the Kuki people was the Kuki Rebellion of 1917-19 after which their territory was subjugated by the British and divided between the administrations of [[British India]] and [[British Burma]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Burma and Assam Frontier, ‘Kuki rising, 1917-1919’, L/PS/10/724, Oriental and India Office Collections (OIOC), British Library, London&lt;/ref&gt; Up until their defeat in 1919, the Kukis had been an independent people ruled by their chieftains.

During [[World War II]], seeing an opportunity to regain independence, the Kuki fought with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] but the success of the Allied forces over the Axis group dashed their hopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guite |first=Jangkhomang |date=2010 |title=Representing Local Participation in INA–Japanese Imphal Campaign: The Case of the Kukis in Manipur, 1943–45 |journal=[[Indian Historical Review]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=291–309 |doi=10.1177/037698361003700206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultures and traditions==
The land of the Kukis has a number of [[convention (norm)|customs]] and [[traditions]].

===Sawm===
Sawm, a community centre for boys – was the centre of learning in which the ''Sawm-upa'' (an elder) did the teaching, while ''Sawm-nu'' took care of chores, such as combing of the boy’s hair, washing of the garments and making the beds. The best students were recommended to the King’s or the Chief’s service, and eventually would achieve the office of ''Semang'' and ''Pachong'' (ministers) in their courts, or ''gal –lamkai'' (leaders, warriors) in the army.&lt;ref name="Paokhohao Haokp 2013"&gt;Paokhohao Haokp, "Reinculcating Traditional Values of the Kukis with Special Reference to Lom and Som", in T. Haokip (ed.). ''The Kukis of Northeast India: Politics and Culture''. New Delhi: Bookwell, 2013, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawm===
Lawm (a traditional type of youth club) was an institution in which boys and girls engaged in social activities for the benefit of the individual and the community. It was also another learning institution. Every Lawm has a ''Lawm-upa'' (a senior member), a ''To’llai-pao'' (an overseer or superintendent) and a ''Lawm-tangvo'' (assistant superintendent). Besides being a source of traditional learning, the institution of the Lawm also facilitated the transmission of both technical as well as practical knowledge to its members, especially with regard to particular methods of [[farming]], [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and sporting activities such as ''Kung–Kal'' (high jump, especially over a choice ''mithun''), ''Ka’ng Ka’p'', ''Ka’ngchoi Ka’p'' (top game), ''Suhtumkhawh'' (javelin throw using the heavy wooden implement for pounding-de-husking-paddy) and ''So’ngse'' (shot put).&lt;ref name="Paokhohao Haokp 2013"/&gt;

The Lawm was also a centre where young Kuki people learned discipline and social etiquette. After harvest season, the ''Lawm meet'' is celebrated with a ''Lawm-se’l'' and, as a commemoration, a pillar is erected. The event is accompanied by dance and drinking rice-beer, which sometimes continues for days and nights.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Laws and government==

===Governance===
With regard to governance, Semang (cabinet) is the annual assembly of a Kuki village community held at the Chief’s residence represents the Inpi (Assembly). In such an assembly, the Chief and his Semang and Pachong (cabinet members and auxiliary of Inpi) and all the household heads of the village congregate to discuss and resolve matters relating to the village and the community.&lt;ref&gt;T. Lunkim, "Traditional System of Kuki Administration", in T. Haokip (ed.). ''The Kukis of Northeast India: Politics and Culture''. New Delhi: Bookwell, 2013, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religions===
The majority of Chins are [[Christians]], with most belonging to [[Protestant]] denominations, especially [[Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethnomed.org/culture/chin Chin Cultural Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the Chin were [[animist]]s. Due to the work of [[Arthur E. Carson]] a Baptist missionary, many converted to [[Christianity]]. Many Chins have also served as evangelists and pastors, ministering in places like the United States, Australia, Guam and India.

The '''[[Bnei Menashe]]''' ({{lang-he|בני מנשה}}, "Sons of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]]") are a small group within the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] of [[India]]'s [[Seven Sister States|North-Eastern border states]] of [[Manipur]] and [[Mizoram]]; since the late 20th century, they claim descent from one of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes of Israel]] and have adopted the practice of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Shalva. "Double Conversion among the 'Children of Menasseh'" in Georg Pfeffer and Deepak K. Behera (eds) ''Contemporary Society Tribal Studies'', New Delhi: Concept, pp. 84–102. 1996 Weil, Shalva. "Lost Israelites from North-East India: Re-Traditionalisation and Conversion among the Shinlung from the Indo-Burmese Borderlands", ''The Anthropologist, ''2004''. ''6(3): 219–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bnei Menashe are made up of [[Mizo people|Mizo]], Kuki and [[Chin people]]s, who all speak [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], and whose ancestors migrated into [[northeast India]] from [[Burma]] mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.languageinindia.com/july2005/morphologynortheast1.html | title = Issues in Morphological Analysis of North-East Indian Languages | date =2005-07-07 |accessdate= 2007-03-04 |work= Language in India | first1 =Vijayanand | last1 = Kommaluri | first2 = R | last2 = Subramanian | first3 = Anand | last3 = Sagar K}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are called Chin in [[Burma]]. In the late 20th century, an Israeli rabbi investigating their claims named them Bnei Menashe, based on their account of descent from [[Menasseh]]. Most of the peoples in these two northeast states, who number more than 3.7 million, do not identify with these claims. Some have supported other movements to separate from India.

Prior to conversion in the 19th century to [[Christianity]] by Welsh [[Baptists|Baptist]] missionaries, the Chin, Kuki, and Mizo peoples were [[animism|animists]]; among their practices were ritual [[headhunting]].&lt;ref name=asya&gt;{{cite web | title = Controversies surrounding Bnei Menashe | author= Asya Pereltsvaig |date=9 June 2010 |publisher = Languages of the World | url = http://languagesoftheworld.info/geolinguistics/controversies-surrounding-bnei-menashe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century, some of these peoples have begun following [[Messianic Judaism]]. The Bnei Menashe are a small group who started studying and practicing Judaism since the 1970s in a desire to return to what they believe is the religion of ancestors. The total population of Manipur and Mizoram is more than 3.7 million. The Bnei Menashe number below 9,000; several hundred have emigrated to Israel.

{{nihongo|'''''Kyōgaku no [[Gaijin]] Hanzai Ura File - Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007'''''|驚愕の外人犯罪裏ファイル―外人犯罪白書2007|extra=lit. ''Shocking Secret Foreigner Crime File - Foreigner Crime [[White Paper]] 2007''}}, is a  {{nihongo|[[:ja:ムック (出版)|mook]]|ムック|mukku|extra=a Japanese word for a cross between a magazine and a book}} that was published in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on January 31, 2007 by Eichi Publishing Inc.&lt;sup&gt;[[:ja:英知出版|ja]]&lt;/sup&gt; It was distributed in convenience stores and online at [[Rakuten]] Books and [[Amazon.com]]. Its cover price was 690 [[yen]].

==Content==
The mook contains images and descriptions of what it says are crimes committed in Japan by non-Japanese, including graphs breaking down crimes by nationality. The mook's cover, in red and black, shows [[caricature]]d images of foreigners grinning maniacally with glowing red eyes under its banner headline. No advertising content was included in the mook.

The mook included a caption describing a black man as a "[[nigga]]", an article entitled "Chase the Iranian!", and calls [[Tokyo]] a "city torn apart by evil foreigners". One cartoon re-enacts a murder on a pig farm in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], east of Tokyo, allegedly by a Chinese man who overstayed his visa.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The product was withdrawn from [[FamilyMart]] shelves after several complaints from customers. [[Debito Arudou]], a commentator on racial issues in Japan, posted a bilingual letter on his blog for readers to take to FamilyMart stores, protesting against "discriminatory statements and images about non-Japanese residents of Japan."&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;
[[Richard-Lloyd Parry]], Asia editor of ''[[The Times]]'' also criticised the book.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

|title= Tiny reasons for a furious storm
|accessdate= 2007-02-18
|publisher= ''[[The Times]]''
|date= 6 February 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The blog Japan Probe requested its readers to "check that FamilyMart is complying with its pledge to remove the publication".&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt; Citing the publication's "inappropriate racial expressions" FamilyMart decided to stop distributing the book on February 5.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;

The editor of the book, Shigeki Saka, defended his decision to publish in an editorial in ''[[Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)|Metropolis]]''. Saka stated that, "there are no lies, distortions or racist sentiments expressed in Gaijin Hanzai Ura Fairu. All the statistics about rising crime rates are accurate, and all the photographs show incidents that actually occurred." His stated purpose was to create an informed dialogue on the "taboo" topic of foreigner crime.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate= 2007-02-18
|publisher= ''[[Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)|Metropolis]]''.
|date= 16 February 2007 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Arudou disagreed with Saka's claim of informed dialogue on a taboo topic, arguing in an [[electronic journal]] that a magazine that "depicts foreigners as dangerous and evil" violates [[United Nations]] treaties pertaining to hate speech, incitement to racial hatred, and racial discrimination:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Gaijin Hanzai fails the [freedom of speech] test because it a) willfully spreads hate, fear, and innuendo against a segment of the population, b) fortifies that by lacking any sort of balance in data or presentation, and c) offers sensationalized propaganda in the name of "constructive debate". Dialog is not promoted by fearmongering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The magazine soon went off the market, and, according to an April 5, 2007 report from Teikoku Databank, Eichi Shuppan KK, the magazine's publisher, went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lepcha language''', or '''Róng language''' ([[Lepcha script|Lepcha]]: &lt;span style="font-family:'Mingzat', 'Mainwaring Rong', 'XenoType Lepcha', 'Noto Sans Lepcha';"&gt;ᰛᰩᰵ་ᰛᰵᰧᰶ&lt;/span&gt;; ''Róng ríng''), is a [[Himalayish languages|Himalayish language]] spoken by the [[Lepcha people]] in [[Sikkim]] and parts of [[West Bengal]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]].

==Population==
Lepcha is spoken by minorities in the Indian states of [[Sikkim]] and [[West Bengal]], as well as parts of [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]. Where it is spoken, it is considered to be an aboriginal language, pre-dating the arrival of the [[Tibetan languages]] ([[Sikkimese Tibetan language|Sikkimese]], [[Dzongkha]], and others) and more recent [[Nepali language]]. Lepcha speakers comprise four distinct communities: the Renjóngmú of [[Sikkim]]; the Támsángmú of [[Kalimpong]], [[Kurseong]], and [[Mirik]]; the ʔilámmú of [[Ilam District]], [[Nepal]]; and the Promú of southwestern [[Bhutan]]. Lepcha-speaking groups in India are larger than those in Nepal and Bhutan.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007&gt;{{cite book|title=A grammar of Lepcha |volume=5 |series=Tibetan studies library: Languages of the greater Himalayan region |first=Heleen |last=Plaisier |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] |year=2007 |isbn=90-04-15525-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpCXEc_9RWcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIL/&gt;

The Indian census reported 50,000 Lepcha speakers,&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|lep}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the number of native Lepcha speakers in India may be closer to 30,000.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

==Classification==
Lepcha is difficult to classify, but [[George van Driem]] (2001) suggests that it may be closest to the [[Mahakiranti languages]], a subfamily of the [[Himalayish languages]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem2001&gt;{{cite book|first=George |last=van Driem |year=2001 |title=Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region |publisher=Brill |isbn=90-04-12062-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiavPYCz4dYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepcha is internally diverse, showing lexical influences from different majority language groups across the four main Lepcha communities. According to Plaisier (2007), these [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Sikkimese Tibetan language|Sikkimese Tibetan]] influences do not amount to a dialectical difference.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

===Austroasiatic substratum===
[[Roger Blench]] (2013) suggests that Lepcha has [[Austroasiatic_languages#Previously_existent_branches|an Austroasiatic substratum]], which originated from a now-extinct branch of Austroasiatic that he calls "Rongic".&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2013. [https://www.academia.edu/5562335/Rongic_a_vanished_branch_of_Austroasiatic Rongic: a vanished branch of Austroasiatic].&lt;/ref&gt; Lepcha words of Austroasiatic origin identified by Blench (2013) are as follows.

==Features==
Lepcha is a non-[[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] Sino-Tibetan language, although it does have phonemic stress or pitch that may be marked in the [[Lepcha script]].&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;{{rp|37}} Much of its lexicon is composed of monosyllabic elements.&lt;ref name=NIL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikkim.nic.in/north/html/lepcha.htm |title=Lepchas and their Tradition |publisher=National Informatics Centre, Sikkim |work=Official Portal of NIC Sikkim State Centre |date=2002-01-25 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, words that are commonly considered [[obscenity|obscene]] or [[taboo]] in other languages are not treated as such by native speakers.&lt;ref name=NIL/&gt;

==Script and romanization==
{{main|Lepcha script}}
The [[Lepcha script]] (also known as "róng") is a [[syllabary|syllabic]] script featuring a variety of special marks and [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]]. Its genealogy is unclear. Early Lepcha manuscripts were written vertically, a sign of [[chinese writing system|Chinese]] influence.&lt;ref name=Coulmas&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas |first=Florian |title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems |publisher=Blackwell |year=1996 |isbn=0-631-21481-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3KdxBqjg5cC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the development of the Lepcha script, Lepcha literary works were composed in the [[Tibetan script]].&lt;ref name=NIL/&gt;

Lepcha language is romanized according to varying schemes, the prevailing system being that of Mainwaring (1876). Most linguists, including Plaisier (2007), whose system is used in this article, have followed modified versions of Mainwaring's system. Other linguists and historians have used systems based on European languages such as English, French, and German.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Retroflex phonemes /ʈ/, /ʈʰ/, and /ɖ/ are written in [[Lepcha script]] as ᰀᰥ ''kr'', ᰝᰥ ''hr'', and ᰃᰥ ''gr'', respectively. Most, though not all, instances of retroflex consonants indicate a word is of [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] origin. To distinguish this retroflex sound in [[Lepcha script]], a dot may be written underneath: ᰀᰥ᰷, ᰝᰥ᰷, and ᰃᰥ᰷. Native instances of non-retroflex ᰀᰥ ''kr'', ᰝᰥ ''hr'', and ᰃᰥ ''gr'' may be pronounced either as written or as {{angbr|tr}}, {{angbr|thr}}, and {{angbr|dr}}. For example, ''tagrikup'', "boy," may be said either {{IPA|[ta ɡri kɯʔp̚]}} or {{IPA|[ta ɖi kɯʔp̚]}}.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Lepcha has three glide consonants that may occur after certain initial consonants: {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}}. When the phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} operates as a glide, it can combine with {{IPA|/j/}} as a double-glide: ᰕᰥᰤᰩᰮ''mryóm'', "to spread over the ground, creep." Notably, syllables with the glide {{IPA|/l/}} are given their own independent forms in the [[Lepcha script]].&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Velar consonants {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} preceding front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} are palatalized as {{IPA|[kʲ]}} and {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}}, respectively. Fricatives {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are merged before {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Lepcha speakers tend not to distinguish between {{IPA|/z/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, pronouncing both as {{IPA|[z]}}~{{IPA|[dz]}}~{{IPA|[ʒ]}}. Additionally, initial {{IPA|/ŋ/}} is occasionally realized as {{IPA|[ɦ]}}. Under the influence of [[Nepali language|Nepali]], some Lepcha speakers have lost the distinction between {{IPA|/pʰ/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, and between {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Of the above phonemes, only {{IPA|/m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /k/, /t/, /p/, /r/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}} may be syllable-final. Native speakers tend to neutralize the difference between final {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. In syllable-final position, stops are realized as an unreleased stop, usually pronounced with a simultaneous {{IPA|/ʔ/}}: for example, {{IPA|/k/}} becomes {{IPA|[ʔk̚]}}.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

===Vowels===
According to Plaisier (2007), Lepcha has eight vowels:&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;{{rp|17–21}}
{| class="wikitable"
! !! [[Front vowel|Front]] !! [[Central vowel|Central]] !! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align=center
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i}} {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|í}} || {{IPA|ɯ}} {{angbr|u}} || {{IPA|u}} {{angbr|ú}}
|- align=center
! [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]
| || || {{IPA|o}} {{angbr|o}}
|- align=center
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
| {{IPA|e}}~{{IPA|ɛ}} {{angbr|e}} || {{IPA|ə}} {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|â}} || {{IPA|ɔ}} {{angbr|ó}}
|- align=center
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| || {{IPA|a}} {{angbr|á}} ||
|}
The phoneme denoted by {{angbr|í}} is shortened and appears in closed syllables; {{angbr|i}} is longer and appears in open syllables. The phoneme /e/ is realized as {{IPA|[e]}} in open syllables and in closed syllables before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} or {{IPA|/k/}}. Closed syllables ending in /p/, /m/, /l/, /n/, /r/, and /t/ show free variation between {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, and even {{IPA|[ɪ]}}. Distinctions between /o/ and /ɔ/ are often lost among non-literate speakers, particularly those highly fluent in [[Nepali language]], which does not contrast the sounds.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

==Grammar==
Lepcha grammar features nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. Word order is typically [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV). Lepcha morphology is somewhat [[agglutination|agglutinative]], though most bare Lepcha lexicon is made up of one- or two-syllable words. Nouns are arranged into either head-first or head-last noun phrases. Relative clauses and genitive phrases precede nouns, whereas markers for demonstratives, definiteness, number, case, and other particles follow the noun. Lepcha is an [[ergative language]], where the ergative case indicates transitivity and completedness of the event. There is no grammatical agreement between different parts of speech (i.e. verb conjugation). Adjectives follow nouns they modify, function as predicates, or stand independently as nominal heads. Adverbs generally directly precede verbs, and [[reduplication]] is generally productive for adverbs of time (e.g. ''nám'', "year" → ''nám-nám'', "yearly").&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

===Nouns===
According to Plaisier (2007), Lepcha has only two true "[[grammatical case|cases]]" that modify the noun morphologically: the [[definite article]] -''re'' and the [[dative case]] marker -''m''. All other noun markers, including for example the genitive marker, are actually invariable postpositions. A series noun markers may follow a single noun. Together, these cases and postpositions are:&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! Postposition !! Meaning
|-
| -ᰠᰴ / -ᰎᰴ &lt;br&gt; -sang/-pang || plural
|-
| -ᰛᰬ -re|| definite, topic
|-
| -ᰍᰪ/ᰍᰪᰰ &lt;br&gt; -nu/nun|| ergative,&lt;br&gt; ablative
|-
| - ᰮ -m || dative
|-
| -ᰠᰦ -sá || genitive
|-
| -ᰀᰦ -ká || locative 
|-
| -ᰕᰪ -mu || only
|-
| -ᰉᰬᰳ -nyet || both
|}

Plurals are marked differently according to whether they are human (-''sang'') or non-human (-''pang'') nouns. Notably, the plural is not used when the noun is followed by a number.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

According to Plaisier (2007), Lepcha [[personal pronoun]]s are as follows:&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! !! Singular&lt;br&gt;(Oblique) !! Dual !! Plural
|-
! First person
| ᰃᰨ go &lt;br&gt;ᰀᰠᰪ ''kasu'' || ᰀᰦᰉᰧᰶ kányí || ᰀᰦᰚᰫ káyú
|-
! Second person
|ᰝᰩ hó &lt;br&gt;ᰣᰦᰌᰨ ''ʔádo'' || ᰣᰦᰉᰧᰶ ʔányí || ᰣᰦᰚᰫ ʔáyú
|-
! Third person
| ᰝᰪ hu &lt;br&gt;ᰝᰪᰌᰨ ''hudo'' || ᰝᰪᰉᰧᰶ hunyí || ᰝᰪᰚᰫ huyú
|}
Oblique forms appear in italics above. Lepcha personal pronouns can refer only to humans; otherwise demonstratives are used. Personal pronouns may take the definite article ''-re''.&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

====Thematic classes====
Many Lepcha nouns can be grouped into one of several classes based on associated characteristics. For example, many animal names begin with the [[Lepcha script]] syllabic /sâ/: ᰠᰲᰶ ''sâr'' means "goat," ᰠᰶᰛᰤᰨᰮ ''sâryom'' means "otter," ᰠᰶᰜᰩᰭ ''sâlók'' means "rhinoceros," and ᰠᰶᰝᰪ''sâhu'' means "monkey." Other noun classes include /sâ/ and /ka/ for plants, and /pe/ or /pâ/ for snakes and bamboo products.&lt;ref name=NIL/&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Lepcha-language
|editor=Albert Grünwedel |first=George Byres |last=Mainwaring |publisher=Unger bros. |year=1898 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzlkAAAAMAAJ}} (multiple entries)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbs===
Lepcha verbs generally function [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s or, in [[relative clause]]s, as modifiers before a head-noun. Verbs may also be nominalized by a combination of suffixes. For example, ''zo'', "eat," may be suffixed to produce ''zo-shang-re'', "eating."&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Many [[intransitive verb]]s incorporate a [[causative]] -/y/- [[infix]], sometimes followed by a -/t/ suffix, to take a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sense: ᰕᰦᰭ''mák'', "die" → ᰕᰤᰦᰭ ''myák'', "kill;" ᰏᰶ''plâ'', "come forth" → ᰏᰤᰶ ''plyâ'', "bring forth;" ᰄᰫ''glú'', "fall down" → ᰄᰤᰳ/ᰄᰤᰬᰳ''glyat/glyet'', "drop."&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

Verbs are followed by grammatical suffixes and particles. Verbal particles indicating sureness, polite requests, authoritativeness, dubiousness, and other nonlexical information follow clauses. Below is a chart of such verb- and clause-final suffixes and particles largely following Plaisier (2007):&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! Suffix or&lt;br&gt;particle !! Meaning
|-
| -wám/-ʔám/-bám || progressive
|-
| nón || resultant 
|-
| -tho || exhaustive
|-
| -hát || perfective
|-
| -shang || infinitive
|-
| -bú || factual
|-
| -re || definite
|-
| ká || [[adhortative]]
|-
| gó || question
|-
| le || polite request
|-
| ma || assertive
|-
| ce || authoritative
|-
| te || dubiousness
|-
| pá || certainty
|-
| lyók || inference
|}

Verbs are negated by a [[circumfix]], ''ma–n(e)'': ''khut'', "to be able," becomes ''ma-khut-ne'', "to be unable."&lt;ref name=Plaisier2007/&gt;

The '''Masturbate-a-thon''' is an event in which participants [[masturbate]] to raise money for charity and increase the public awareness and dispel the [[shame]] and [[taboos]] that exist about this form of sexual activity. From 1998 to 2003, the Masturbate-a-thon raised around $25,000 for women’s health initiatives and HIV prevention, education and treatment organizations, and has contributed to debates about [[safer sex]] and alternative safe methods of sexual expression.&lt;ref name="The Royal Treatment: Time to Masturbate"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Masturbate-a-thon Uk.jpg|thumb|Masturbate-a-thon Logo used by 2006 London event|137x137px]]

In May 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silver|first1=Matty|title=Make time for yourselves during National Masturbation Month in May|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/make-time-for-yourselves-during-national-masturbation-month-in-may-20150413-1mjqpo.html|accessdate=12 June 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco–based sex toy shop [[Good Vibrations (business)|Good Vibrations]] declared May to be "[[Masturbation]] Month". Since then, it has encouraged people to get sponsors as a fundraiser for charities with a sex-positive focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empowher.com/sexual-well-being/content/may-national-masturbation-month | title=May is National Masturbation Month | publisher=Empowher | date=April 30, 2010 | accessdate=June 19, 2011 | author=Lloyd, Stacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Masturbate-a-Thon was originated by the collective Open Enterprises, which operates [[Good Vibrations (business)|Good Vibrations]]. The slogan "Come for a Cause" was coined by Rachel Venning, the founder of the sex toy shop [[Babeland]], formerly Toys in Babeland, which has branches in [[Seattle]], in [[Brooklyn]], and (two) in [[Manhattan]]. The Masturbate-a-Thon was built up by Good Vibrations, which encouraged other modern sex-toy businesses—such as Babeland; A Woman's Touch, in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin; Toronto's [[Come As You Are (sex shop)|Come As You Are]]; and Boston's Grand Opening—to hold events coinciding with "masturbation month" (May in the United States). In that year, the first live event was held at San Francisco's Campus Theater, by the [[Center for Sex and Culture]] (CSC)'s [[Carol Queen]] and her partner, Robert Lawrence. CSC is an education-based non-profit providing professional-level sex education. The annual events are used as a public-health-education device to increase awareness of [[Autoeroticism|self-pleasure]] as a strategy for [[Safe sex|safer]] and healthier sex and to de-stigmatize [[self-love]].

London hosted Europe's first "masturbate-a-thon" on 5 August 2006. It aims to remove the taboo and shame associated with masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Minerva|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|date=29 July 2006|volume=333|issue=7561|pages=268|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7561.268|pmc=1523434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of persons raised money for the charity [[Terrence Higgins Trust]] and the sexual- and reproductive-health agency [[Marie Stopes International]].&lt;ref name=pr&gt;[http://www.masturbate-a-thon.co.uk/main.htm#press Masturbate-a-thon press release] (retrieved August 6, 2006)  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423090305/http://www.masturbate-a-thon.co.uk/main.htm |date=April 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masturbate-a-thon, also called "Wank-a-Thon," was recorded by ZigZagProductions of London as part of an international documentary of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 18, 2006|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/18/channel4.broadcasting |accessdate=November 2, 2007| title=More tossers on TV|author = Leigh Holmwood|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plans to broadcast this on [[Channel 4]] as part of its [[Wank Week]] series were abandoned, including programming from Europe's fetish and leather week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 2, 2007|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4 |accessdate=November 2, 2007| title='Wank week' postponed|author=Jason Deans|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Masanobu Sato won the Masturbate-a-thon held by the Center of Sex and Culture in San Francisco after masturbating for nine hours and thirty-three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christina|first1=Eva|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101545096|page=68|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=SFcWmcGLXJ4C&amp;pg=PT68|accessdate=12 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, China's first masturbation contest was held in [[Shenzhen, China]] in celebration of [[World AIDS day]]. The event's organizers explained that the contest aims to promote masturbation as the safest means of sex and as an effective means for avoiding HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkins|first1=Brett|title=China's first masturbation contest held for World AIDS Day|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/338415|accessdate=12 June 2017|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Emily|title=Masturbation Contest In China Held To Celebrate Safe Sex On World AIDS Day (NSFW VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/03/chinese-wankathon_n_2232063.html|accessdate=12 June 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Montreal's first Masturbate-a-thon (aka "Wankfest") was on 4 May 2013 and raised money for the charity Head and Hands, a youth sex education and outreach organization, and Sexploreum, an adult education group dedicated to encouraging playfulness with sexuality. Masturbate-a-thon 3 in 2014 was cancelled due to lack of registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 21, 2013|url= https://masturbateathonmontreal.wordpress.com/ |accessdate=June 21, 2013| title='Masturbate-a-thon Montreal'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''McKinney v University of Guelph''''' [1990] 3 SCR 229 is the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case that decided that, for the purpose of determining the application of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', universities were not part of government. Therefore, the mandatory retirement age for university teachers did not violate equality rights under [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the ''Charter''. In reaching this holding, the Court refined the scope of the ''Charter'' as it applies to government bodies as well as the definition of "law" within the ambit of the ''Charter''.

==Background==
Three year prior to ''McKinney'', the Court held in ''[[Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 580 v Dolphin Delivery Ltd]]'' that the ''Charter'' only applied to the government but without defining what constitutes "government".

Eight professors and one librarian from the [[University of Guelph]] applied for declarations that the university's policy for mandatory retirement at age 65 as well as the Ontario ''[[Ontario Human Rights Code|Human Rights Code]]'', which allowed such policies, were unconstitutional because it violated their section 15 ''Charter'' rights to equality.

The issues before the court were: 
:1. whether the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to universities;
:2.  if the Charter does apply to universities, whether mandatory retirement policies violate s. 15;
:3.  whether the limitation of the prohibition against age discrimination in the Ontario Human Rights Code to persons between the ages of 18 and 65 violates s. 15; and
:4. if the limitation does violate s. 15, whether it is justifiable under s. 1 as a reasonable limit on an equality right.

==Reasoning of the Court==
LaForest J wrote the majority, with Dickson and Gonthier JJ concurring. In the similar fashion from ''Dolphin Delivery'', they looked at the meaning of [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32]] to determine the purpose of the ''Charter'', concluding it is a tool for checking the powers of the government over the individual. They further justified this conclusion by stating that if the scope were so widely read as to include private actions, it would impose too much a burden on the courts and would result in too much overlap with common law rules and statutes.

LaForest J's attention then moved to whether the University was a government body. The ''Public Purpose'' test alluded to in ''Dolphin Delivery'' is not determinative. The fact the school was created by statute and received a significant portion of its funding from government was insufficient. Nor was the fact it is regulated by government and fulfilled a public service sufficient. LaForest J noted that universities still function as autonomous bodies and the government had no direct power to control the school. Instead, the school is governed by a Board of Governors which is not the representative of government.

Despite the court ruling against the University's status as a government body, they nevertheless examined whether the retirement policy violated section 15. LaForest J stated that all actions pursuant to powers granted by law, not merely statutes, would be subject to ''Charter'' scrutiny.

The majority found that section 15 was violated because a distinction based on age discriminated against those who were old but capable of working. However, the violation was justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] due to the public necessity to have new teachers hired.
 
In a strong dissent, Wilson J (with Cory J concurring) examined a broad range of sources and proposed several tests including a "control test", "government function test" and a "government entity test". However, Wilson did not regard any of them as a panacea, since they all missed some aspect of government.

'''Mestizo Colombians''' technically refers to Colombians who are of mixed white (mostly Spanish) and American-Indian ancestry. However, due to the fluidity of ethnic categorization common in Latin America, for all practical purposes, it refers to non-white Colombians who do not belong to one of the recognized minority groups in Colombia (Afro-Colombians, Indigenous Colombians, and Romani). Colombians who simply identify with the mainstream Hispanic culture of the nation are usually categorized as Mestizos, regardless of their actual ancestry. As such, this category may include people who are fully of American-Indian descent, as well as those who are mixed with other races. 49% of the population is Mestizo. They constitute the largest ethnic group in the country with a share of 49%&lt;ref name="Colombia a country study "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Colombia.pdf|format=PDF|title=Colombia a country study, 2010|pages=86/87|language=es|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 58%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the whole country.

[[Miscegenation]] in Colombia began shortly after the establishment of the first settlers in the territory. It is a direct result of the shortage of European women in some sectors of the kingdom during the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|conquest]], because during the colonial period most European immigrants were male. The Spanish then joined mainly with native women of different ethnic groups. Mestizos are found almost everywhere in the country and is the largest population in Colombia, European contribution being almost exclusively on the paternal side (with indigenous contribution being mostly on the maternal side).

==Numbers and distribution==
Mestizo Colombians make up 49% (+23 million) of the [[Colombian people|Colombian population]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The various racial groups exist in differing concentrations throughout the nation, in a pattern that to some extent goes back to colonial origins. However, they can be found throughout the country, mainly in the Caribbean coast, Orinoquia region, Andean region, and intermediate cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">A '''neighborhood commons''' is a shared community space where neighborhood residents can come together to celebrate life, and young and old can be in each other’s presence but not in each other’s way. It can be a small-scale, multi-use facility, combining a sitting area, tot lot, playground, park, and community garden, designed and constructed on one or more vacant lots by residents, volunteer professionals, and youth work teams.

The term "neighborhood commons" was first widely used by landscape architect, educator, and psychologist [[Karl Linn]], who guided the creation of many such spaces during the 1960s through 1980s, primarily in the northeastern United States.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/arts/design/karl-linn-architect-of-urban-landscapes-dies-at-81.html|work=The New York Times|title=Karl Linn, Architect of Urban Landscapes, Dies at 81|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=Feb 13, 2005|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Karl Linn and community design centers ==

While teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in 1960, Linn and his students began to provide landscape design service to the residents of low-income African-American and Latino neighborhoods, helping them acquire materials and the assistance of volunteer work teams to construct neighborhood commons.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://vault.sierraclub.org/sierra/200105/profile.asp |first=Marilyn Berlin |last=Snell |title=Down-to-Earth Visionary - Karl Linn cultivates community in his urban gardens |work=Sierra magazine |publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|issue=May/June 2001|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linn recruited volunteer professionals such as artists, architects, landscape architects, social scientists, and lawyers to add their skills to the projects and mentor the students. The neighborhood commons were built as celebrations of community in the spirit of "urban barnraising." The students formed a Design Corps that served as a model for the Domestic Peace Corps (VISTA). In 1961, with growing demand for their service, Linn established the Neighborhood Renewal Corps Nonprofit Corporation of Philadelphia, a community design center in landscape architecture.

In 1962 he created a similar organization in Washington, D.C. One of their first projects was a "land bank" survey to identify vacant lots with the potential to become neighborhood commons. For the next 25 years while teaching at prominent colleges and universities, Linn guided or inspired into being numerous neighborhood commons.&lt;ref name="sc"/&gt; He worked hard to secure municipal support for these environmental self-help projects. In Philadelphia the work of the Neighborhood Renewal Corps received a lot of support and was gradually taken over by the city's Land Utilization Program. Unfortunately the focus shifted from involving residents in creating neighborhood commons to city crews constructing "vest-pocket parks." These parks, although much admired by design critics, were not perceived as belonging to the community and were frequently subjected to graffiti and vandalism.

Linn envisioned a neighborhood commons in every residential block as the physical framework for the development of a new kind of extended-family living based on mutual aid among neighbors and intergenerational support. Later in his career he observed that neighborhood commons in community gardens were most likely to be used and cared for since the gardeners go there regularly to attend to their plots.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;Many of these projects are described in Building Commons and Community by [[Karl Linn]], published by [[New Village Press]] in 2007.

The family of '''Northwest Solomonic languages''' is a branch of the [[Oceanic languages]]. It includes the [[Austronesian languages]] of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] and [[Buka Island|Buka]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], and of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], [[New Georgia]], and [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]] (excluding [[Bugotu language|Bugotu]]) in [[Solomon Islands]].

The unity of Northwest Solomonic and the number and composition of its subgroups, along with its relationship to other Oceanic groups, was established in pioneering work by [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvtxt|Ross|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Number 12: When Greed and Corruption Become the Norm''''' (released by the BBC on [[YouTube]] under the title '''''Betraying the Game: Anas Aremeyaw Anas investigates football in Africa''''') is an investigative documentary by [[Ghanaian]] award-winning journalist [[Anas Aremeyaw Anas]] and his investigative group, [[Tiger Eye P. I.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/All-set-for-premier-of-Anas-Number12-investigative-film-657946|title=All set for premier of Anas' #Number12 investigative film|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/sports/-when-greed-and-corruption-become-the-norm-set-to-premier-on-june-6-2018-133674|title=“When Greed and Corruption Become the Norm” set to premier on June, 6, 2018|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary which was premiered on 6 June 2018 sought to highlight the level of corruption in football and among football administrators in Ghana. The [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] provided technical support for the investigation and secured the right to show it to a global audience.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/BBC-version-of-Anas-Number-12-airs-658434|title=BBC version of Anas' 'Number 12' airs|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The idea for the documentary was born when Anas Anas was prompted by the action of certain football personalities in Ghana fingered in alleged corrupt acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://3news.com/anas-number-12-expose-a-blessing-or-curse/|title=Anas' Number 12 exposé: A blessing or curse? - 3newsgh|date=2018-06-04|work=3newsgh|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anas' main focus was on the President of the [[Ghana Football Association]], [[Kwesi Nyantakyi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anas Anas believed that the actions of the leaders of various national football groups had led to the national football team the Black Stars missing out on a place at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The culmination effect of effective management of football activities had led to a deterioration of Ghanaian football.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

During the course of interviewing, Nyantakyi hinted that he had considerable power to influence many sectors of the Ghanaian economy. He went further to suggest that he could facilitate business deals and involve the [[President of Ghana]], [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] whenever he needed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/Kwesi-Nyantakyi-s-wife-calls-on-God-ahead-of-Anas-No-12-Premiere-658195|title=Kwesi Nyantakyi’s wife calls on God ahead of Anas’ No. 12 Premiere|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such meetings with the president could be achieved if supposed foreign investors would pay some bribe to him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Prior to the screening of the documentary, Anas Aremeyaw Anas allowed President [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] to view part of the documentary that had his name and office mentioned. Subsequent to watching the documentary, the President lodged an official complaint at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of the [[Ghana Police Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2018/May-23rd/wanted-nyantakyi-abruptly-ends-morocco-trip-to-turn-himself-in.php|title=Wanted Nyantakyi abruptly ends morocco trip to turn himself in|last=|first=|date=24 May 2018|website=citifmonline.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complaint was due to the fact that  Kwasi Nyantakyi had mentioned the names of the president, his vice and others as people that had to be bribed in order to secure government contracts. The CID issued an arrest warrant for the arrest of Kwesi Nyantakyi, who was at that time on an official [[Confederation of African Football]] duty in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citinewsroom.com/2018/05/24/statement-kwesi-nyantakyi-remains-gfas-president/|title=Kwesi Nyantakyi remains our President - GFA|date=2018-05-24|work=Citi Newsroom|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the arrest warrant was issued, [[Kweku Baako Jnr|Abdul Malik Kweku Baako Jnr]]., editor-in-chief of ''The New Crusading Guide'' newspaper, expressed his disapproval of how the presidency handled the issue. According to him, there had been a gentleman's agreement between the party of Anas's [[Tiger Eye P. I.]] and the ''[[BBC]]'' and the presidency on delaying any action to be taken to a day prior to the official public premier of the documentary. He, however, said he understood why it was done and attributed it to social media allegations that the then yet-to-be released documentary had evidence of corruption at the seat of government.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailyguideafrica.com/cid-grabs-nyantakyi-at-the-airport-grilled-for-5-hours/|title=CID Grabs Nyantakyi At The Airport; Grilled For 5 Hours - Daily Guide Africa|website=dailyguideafrica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Kwesi_Nyantakyi_(2014).jpg|thumb|Kwesi Nyantakyi]]

Due to the arrest warrant, Kwesi Nyantakyi cut short his duty to return to Ghana on 24 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citinewsroom.com/2018/05/23/nyantakyi-turns-himself-in-to-cid-over-fraud-allegations/|title=Nyantakyi turns himself in to CID over fraud allegations|date=2018-05-23|work=Citi Newsroom|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was arrested at the airport and sent to the CID headquarters in Accra for interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-44228230|title=CID Police pick up GFA President for interrogation|date=2018-05-23|work=BBC News Pidgin|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; His phones and laptop were seized to facilitate their investigation and was questioned for five hours.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was released after his statements were taken. Though the initial aim of the documentary was on football, certain Ghanaian politicians were caught in the web. One of such politicians was [[Anthony Karbo]], the deputy minister for [[Ministry of Roads and Highways (Ghana)|Roads and Transport]]. He was invited to the CID headquarters as a person of interest and was asked to assist in investigations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
The investigative piece revealed widespread corruption in football in Ghana. Several match referees were caught receiving bribes in order to favour certain teams. In many instances, match officials and football administrators engaged in match-fixing deals and influenced who was called to feature for the national team or who got to play in a particular match. In all, 77 Ghanaian referees and 14 Ghana Football Association officials were caught in various acts of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/soccer/LIVE-UPDATES-Anas-expose-on-Ghana-Football-Number12-658051|title=LIVE UPDATES: Anas’ expose on Ghana Football (Number12)|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rainbowradioonline.com/~rainbowr/index.php/general-news/item/13188-number-12-cop-kofi-boakye-to-probe-bribe-taking-referees-gfa-statement|title=Rainbow Radio - #Number 12: COP Kofi Boakye to probe 'bribe taking referees'-GFA Statement|website=rainbowradioonline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also showed three individuals who rejected the bribes that were offered.

== Reactions ==
Prior to the screening of the investigative piece, certain people who believed they would be caught in corrupt deals used various means to deter  its premiere. These included some unidentified persons picketing at Anas’ office and at other properties reported to be owned by Anas Aremeyaw Anas. [[Kennedy Agyapong]], the Member of Parliament for [[Assin Central (Ghana parliament constituency)|Assin Central]] started a media campaign against the investigative methods of Anas Aremeyaw Anas. The campaign became fierce forcing veteran journalist and [[Mentorship|mentor]] to Anas, Kweku Baako Jnr, to publicly defend his [[protege]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some people also felt that the documentary had vindicated their concerns about football in Ghana. They included former minister for youth and sports Nii Lante Vanderpuye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Anas-Number-12-Ex-Sports-Minister-Nii-Lante-Vanderpuje-prays-to-be-vindicated-657986|title=Anas' Number 12: Ex-Sports Minister Nii Lante Vanderpuje prays to be vindicated|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the GFA were unhappy with Tiger Eye PI and claimed that since the documentary was about Ghana football, they should have been given the chance to watch the movie ahead of its premier or been given tickets to watch the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Number-12-GFA-responds-to-Anas-expos-with-strongly-worded-statement-658236|title=Number 12: GFA responds to Anas exposé with strongly worded statement|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Executive Director of Media Foundation for West Africa, Sulemana Braimah, wrote a piece which he titled "Why Anas' Number 12 is not a Journalistic Piece". In this piece, he tried to explain his point by stating that due to the ways and means used to acquire the contents of the investigative exposé, it cannot be accepted as a journalistic work. Not simply because it was put together by a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citinewsroom.com/2018/07/05/mfwas-sulemana-writes-why-anas-number-12-is-not-a-journalistic-piece/|title=MFWA's Sulemana writes: Why Anas' Number 12 is not a journalistic piece|date=2018-07-05|work=Citi Newsroom|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) in a media release by its Disciplinary Board on the 7th of July 2018 has penalized eleven (11) implicated referees with suspension, and banned eleven more for periods ranging between two and ten years.

== Premier ==
The documentary was premiered at the Accra International Conference Centre on 6 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2018/june-6th/number-12-ghanaians-ecstatic-as-anas-documentary-premiers-today.php|title=Number12: Ghanaians ecstatic as Anas documentary premiers today|last=|first=|date=|website=Myjoyonline.com|archive-url=|archive-date=6 June 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Ghanaians trooped to the conference centre to have a chance of seeing the documentary. The tickets for the premier were offered free of charge. In order to allow as many people as possible to see the documentary, four viewing sessions where offered on 6 and 7 June 2018. Former Presidents [[John Agyekum Kufuor]] and [[John Dramani Mahama]] viewed the investigative piece and expressed their shock at the level of corruption that had engulfed Ghana football but believed that the documentary would usher in a new era for Ghana football.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Anas-expos-Kufuor-close-to-tears-after-watching-excerpts-of-Number-12-657908|title=Anas exposé: Kufuor close to tears after watching excerpts of Number 12|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional shows were schedule for [[Kumasi]], [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] and [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

''Number 12'' was shown globally by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which had collaborated with Anas in the making of the documentary.

The BBC's version had focused more on corruption in Ghana Football and the conduct of African referees as opposed to the local version which was more on the conduct of Kwesi Nyantakyi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The documentary was also released on YouTube by BBC News Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eoFI-u3m88]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public nudity''' refers to [[nudity]] not in an entirely private context, that is, a person appearing nude in a [[public place]] or being able to be seen nude from a public place. Nudity on private property but where the general public is commonly free to enter, such as a shopping mall, public transport or swimming pool, is also considered public nudity. Nudity in the privacy of a person's home or grounds is not considered public nudity, nor is nudity at privately owned facilities where nudity commonly takes place, such as [[gym]]nasia, locker rooms, [[sauna]]s, or specific [[Nudist community|nudist clubs or resorts]]. [[Naturism]] is a movement that promotes social nudity in nature, most but not all of which takes place on private property.

==Western world==

===Social public nudity===
[[File:Woodstock Poland 2014 -- FKK.jpg|thumb|left|Public nudity is tolerated in some environments: men nude at the [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock Festival]], Poland]]
Not all people who engage in public nude events see themselves as naturists or belong to traditional naturist or nudist organizations. Some activists, such as Vincent Bethell, claim that association with naturism or nudism is unnecessary. Others will point out that many people who participate in events such as [[clothing-optional bike ride]]s or visit [[nude beach|clothing-optional beaches]] do so casually and without association or formal affiliation to groups or movements. Activist Daniel Johnson believes that labels and affiliations overly complicate a relatively simple phenomenon, alienate others from a fear of over-commitment or undesirable stereotypes, and thus get in the way of integrating nudity into everyday life.

The social norms or laws of each culture require the wearing of clothes in most situations, but this expectation may be suspended in limited circumstances. For example, there are many countries which have designated public areas as [[nude beach]]es, or where nude bathing is unofficially tolerated. In those places, a person would not face legal prosecution or official harassment merely for being nude.

Outside of those areas, community and [[legal]] [[acceptance]] of public nudity varies considerably.  To avoid offending the public in general, public authorities maintain what are sometimes called "standards of decency". What falls outside these standards are usually termed "[[indecent exposure]]", or similar terminology. These standards, however, vary with time and place. If the intent is to draw attention to oneself, it may be referred to as [[exhibitionism]], otherwise it may be to draw attention to a cause (see [[nudity and protest]]). There are also some people who disrobe in public to attract publicity to themselves, as a career move, such as some [[streaking|streakers]] at sporting events. There are also others who spontaneously disrobe in public, as an expression of their freedom and the shedding of inhibitions; an example being [[Nude swimming|skinny dipping]].

===Public social nude events===
[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 03.jpg|thumb|Public nudity is accepted in some environments: a [[nudist]] couple walks during [[Fremont Solstice Parade]], while clothed people watch.]]

Some people take part in non-sexual public nude events. These may be in a naturist resort or club or at a nude beach. Outdoor [[nude recreation]] can take place in private or rural areas, though generally limited to warm weather.

Others practice casual public nudity. Topfree sunbathing is considered acceptable by many on the beaches of Finland, France, Spain, Italy and most of the rest of Europe (and even in some outdoor swimming pools); however, exposure of the genitals is restricted to nudist areas in most regions. In the United States, topfree sunbathing and wearing [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]s are not common in many areas, but are limited to nude beaches in various locations. It is normally acceptable for men in the U.S. to be [[barechested]] or shirtless when engaged in outdoor recreational activities.

Where the social acceptability of nudity in certain places may be well understood, the legal position is often less clear cut. In England, for example, the law does not actually prohibit simple public nudity, but does forbid indecent exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of expression – nakedness in a public place|url=https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/10/31/freedom-of-expression-nakedness-in-a-public-place/|author=David Hart QC|date=31 October 2013|website=UK Human Rights Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means that successful prosecution hangs on whether there is a demonstrable intention to shock others, rather than simply a desire to be nude in a public place. Specifically, using nudity to "harass, alarm or distress" others is an offence against the Public Order Act of 1986. Occasional attempts to prove this point by walking naked around the country therefore often result in periods of arrest, followed by release without charge, and inconsistencies in the approach between different police jurisdictions. Differences in the law between England and [[Scotland]] appear to make the position harder for naked ramblers once they reach Scotland.

Photography of [[installation art|installations]] of massed nude people in public places, as made repeatedly around the world by [[Spencer Tunick]], claim artistic merit.

===Legal position===
{{Main|Indecent exposure|Clothing laws by country}}
[[File:Naked woman in inner city 3.jpg|thumb|A nude woman walking through a shopping street in [[Siegburg]], Germany]]

It is generally accepted in [[western countries]] that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in [[depictions of nudity|depiction of the human form]] in art of various forms. {{cn|date=September 2018}}

The lack of appropriate clothing may cause offence to others, giving raise to legal intervention in the form of charges described, for example, as indecent, offensive or disorderly conduct.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This is the position, for example, in Germany&lt;ref&gt;See [https://web.archive.org/web/20060216112454/http://niehenke.net/fkk/anyboard/archive/5225.html German position] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain, although local laws in the latter country can stipulate that public nudity is either restricted or not permitted. In [[Barcelona]], public nudity used to be regarded as a recognised right, although there have been successful prosecutions for public nudity even there and a local ordinance by the local council in May 2011 empowers the authorities to impose a fine for nudity and being bare chested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/barcelona-city-council-bans-nudity-and-semi-nudity-streets |title=Barcelona City Council bans nudity and semi-nudity on the streets |publisher=Catalan News Agency |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830135648/http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/barcelona-city-council-bans-nudity-and-semi-nudity-streets |archivedate=2012-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, public nudity is allowed on sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and ''other suitable places''  which effectively means any complaint will cause one to be arrested as a complaint is indication that the place was not "suitable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html Nudity and the law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081745/http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries public nudity is forbidden outright on the basis that nudity is inherently sexual. Many states of the United States fine offenders on that basis&amp;mdash;see [[Indecent exposure in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article619936.ece |title=Vermont does not have a state law against nudity in public |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Arkansas, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favorable opinion about) nudism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.UnconstitutionalArkansas.org |title=Arkansas Law § 5-68-204 Violates First Amendment Rights |publisher=UnconstitutionalArkansas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts, public nudity has been more accepted, especially at designated areas such as [[nude beach]]es and, even in the United States, e.g. during [[World Naked Bike Ride]] events or [[Bay to Breakers]]. In some states, such as Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech, as long as there is not the "intent to arouse". In the United Kingdom, nudity per se is not unlawful, but the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offences, according to a police spokesman in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-23354676|title=BBC News - Naturism numbers are reportedly up in the heatwave|date=18 July 2013|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=18 July 2013|quote=A police spokesman told the BBC there is no law against public nudity in the UK. 'Nudity itself is not illegal.

Gough's case concerned only charges brought against him in Scotland.  The ECHR rejected his complaint in October 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-147623|title=European Court of Human Rights ''Case of Gough v The United Kingdom'' Judgement|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that authorities in Scotland had not "unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression", though they did admit that the "acceptance of public nudity in a modern society is a matter of public interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qt.com.au/news/naked-rambler-stephen-gough-loses-landmark-court-c/2435330/|title=Naked rambler Stephen Gough loses landmark court case|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29800016|title=Naked rambler Stephen Gough loses human rights case|first=Danny|last=Shaw|date=28 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nudity and protest===
{{See also|Nudity and protest|Topfreedom}}

Nudity has sometimes been used to attract media and public attention to a cause. Nudity in [[protest]] was used as a tactic by the [[Doukhobor]]s in the early 20th century, and has been more widely used since the 1960s. Modern slogans include "Disrobe for disarmament", "Nudes, not nukes!", "Naked For Peace", and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'s "I'd rather go naked than wear fur!".

{{Main|Nudity in art}}

Though [[depictions of nudity]] have been an aspect of art at all times, [[contemporary art]] has extended the use of nudity to non-traditional forms. For example:

*[[Spencer Tunick]]'s [[Installation art|installations]] feature photographs of large numbers of nude people (up to 18,000) posed in artistic formations. In these formal images, the nude form becomes abstract due to the sheer number of people placed so closely together. For Tunick, the individual naked body is not important; it is the big group which becomes a "living sculpture" in the landscape.
*San Francisco Bay area photographer Jack Gescheidt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackphoto.com/|title=Jack Gescheidt photographer|author=|date=|website=www.jackphoto.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stages events as part of an ongoing series, called "The Tree Spirit Project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treespiritproject.com/|title=TreeSpirit Project - Raising awareness of the critical role of trees in our lives.|author=|date=|website=www.treespiritproject.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Photographer [[Henning von Berg]] directs whimsical art happenings with small groups of completely naked people in public urban locations around the globe. While placing a few nude women and men at crowded landmarks in downtown metropolises, he is searching to capture the inter-action between the naked amateur models and the thousands of very surprised passers-by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/072105/diverscite4.html |title=Naked city |accessdate=2012-05-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630173553/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/072105/diverscite4.html |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Berg also organized the world’s only-ever male nude photo shoot inside a parliament building, while hundreds of speechless people surrounded the group of six amateur models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Henning von Berg |url=http://www.henning-von-berg.com/English/Wirken/gallery/reichstag.htm |title=NAKED BERLIN – The Liberal Capital |publisher=Henning-von-berg.com |date=1999-07-07 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225003350/http://www.henning-von-berg.com/English/Wirken/gallery/reichstag.htm |archivedate=2012-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreation and sport===
[[File:PaintedCyclists2005 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Solstice Cyclists]] in [[Seattle]], 2005]]
{{See also|Nudity in sport|Nude recreation}}
Certain activities in public areas are more readily accepted to be done while naked, such as [[sun bathing]] and [[Human swimming|swimming]]. Everyday activities such as riding a train or bus, shopping, or attending school or work are almost never considered by the public to be appropriate without clothing.

Examples include going [[nude swimming]] at [[hot springs]], [[nude beaches]], [[naked hiking]], [[streaking]] and even [[roller skating]]. Sandy Snakenberg has organized nude skating and rollerblading events in San Francisco, the largest of their kind in the world. [[Nude beach]]es are found in many Western countries.

In recent times, it appears that public nudity is becoming more common with nude sporting and other activities being held. These include [[naked hiking]], canuding (nude canoeing), the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], [[Bay to Breakers]], [[Solstice Cyclists]]. [[Clothing-optional bike ride]]s are becoming regular events around the world.

In 2016 naked dining has become something of a fashion, with naked restaurants opening in [[London]],&lt;ref name="inde_Iche"&gt;{{Cite web | title = I checked out London's first naked restaurant and now I’m converted to eating in the nude | last = Hooton | first = Christopher | work = The Independent | date = 12 June 2016 | accessdate = 2016-06-15 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-bunyadi-review-i-checked-out-london-s-naked-restaurant-and-now-i-m-converted-to-eating-in-the-a7076871.html | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]]&lt;ref name="dail_Gues"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Guests strip off at launch of Australia’s first NAKED restaurant | last = Scrimshire | first = Jo | work = Mail Online | date = 27 May 2016 | accessdate = 2016-06-15 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3611850/Guests-strip-launch-Australia-s-NAKED-restaurant-Melbourne.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="inde_Obes"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Obese diners have been banned from a 'naked' restaurant | last = Cockburn | first = Harry | work = The Independent | date = 11 June 2016 | accessdate = 2016-06-15 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/obese-diners-banned-from-a-naked-restaurant-a7076466.html | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual public nudity===
[[File:Nude woman at Ponderosa 2007.jpg|thumb|Naked performer at the [[Nudes-A-Poppin']] erotic dance festival in [[Indiana]]]]
Nudity in public, if any, is most commonly non-sexual in nature. For example, aspects of the [[Nambassa]] [[hippie]] festivals held in [[New Zealand]] in the 1970s are regarded as non-sexual [[naturism]]. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3-day [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] festival, an estimated 35% spontaneously chose to remove their clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nambassa.com/johnlowe.html |title=Public nudity at Nambassa |publisher=Nambassa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring complete or partial nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979. {{ISBN|0-589-01216-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some nudity in public may give rise to controversy. Some people regard [[Exhibitionism|flashing]], [[streaking]] and [[mooning]] as [[indecent exposure]] and as sexual public nudity. Similarly, some people regard [[dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]], [[exhibitionism]], and [[voyeurism]] as offensive behaviour.

[[Burning Man]] camps range from non-sexual nudity to overtly sexually themed, while the [[Folsom Street Fair]] held in [[San Francisco]] is a leather and [[BDSM]] themed fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/burn/ |title=Burning Man nudity |publisher=Templetons.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nudes-A-Poppin']] is an annual [[beauty pageant|pageant]] in the United States for nude women and men competing in [[Erotic dancing|erotic dance]].&lt;ref name="top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askmen.com/top_10/travel/top-10-sex-festivals_4.html|title=Nudes-A-Poppin' Pageant|website=AskMen.com|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial nudity===

[[File:02 08 2013 woodstock0003.jpg|thumb|A topless woman publicly enjoys rain with barechested men at [[Przystanek Woodstock]] music fest, Poland, 2013.]]
In some cultures, toplessness by women in public is considered acceptable, while complete nudity is not.

==Religious and ritual nudity==

===Ritual nudity===
{{See also|Nudity in religion}}
[[File:The arrest of Adamites in a public square in Amsterdam. Etch Wellcome V0035701.jpg|thumb|left|The arrest of [[Adamites]] in a public square in Amsterdam]]

Although most ceremony and traditions involve dressing up, often with some preferential attire, certain cultural or religious traditions actually prescribe(d) ritual nudity. For example, ancient [[Sparta]] held a yearly celebration from 668 BC called [[gymnopaedia]] during which [[nudity|naked]] youths displayed their athletic and martial skills through the medium of [[war dance|war dancing]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cartledge, ''Spartan Reflections'' p.102&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Adamites]], an early Christian [[sect]], practiced "holy nudism", engaging in common worship in the nude. During the [[Middle Ages]], the doctrines of this obscure sect were revived: in the Netherlands by the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] and the [[Taborites]] in Bohemia, and, in a grosser form, by the [[Beghards]] in Germany. Everywhere, they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01135b.htm Adamites], Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be symbolic, especially for 'rebirth' to a new life phase, as in the case of [[baptism]] (originally taken by an adult, later often as a child - to symbolise the washing away of original sin - and/or at least partially covered up) or certain [[coming of age]] rites, such as cow jumping by young men of the East African [[Hamar people]] before they are eligible for marriage.

There is a tradition in some [[neopagan]] [[Wicca]]n covens of ritual nudity, called going [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]].

===Jainism===
[[File:Digambara monk Acarya Pushpadantasagara.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jain]] monk of [[Digambara]] tradition, 2010.]]
In [[India]], [[Digambara monk]]s reject any form of clothing and practice nudity. Digambara (lit. 'sky clad') is one of the two main sects of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/subdivisions/subdivisions.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics - Jain sects |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous cultures==
[[File:Yali old man &amp; women13.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yali people]] in [[New Guinea]]]]
In some [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in warm climates, public nudity (or near-complete nudity) has been, until the introduction of [[Western culture]] or [[Islam]], or still is, the social norm for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ Nudity throughout history] at activenaturists.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete nudity among men and complete or near-complete nudity among women is still common for [[Mursi people|Mursi]], [[Surma people|Surma]], [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]], [[Karimojong]], [[Kirdi]], [[Dinka]] and sometimes [[Maasai people]] in Africa, as well as [[Matses]], [[Yanomami]], [[Suruwaha]], [[Xingu peoples|Xingu]], [[Matis]] and Galdu people in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok/|title=what if nudity were a norm?|author=|date=14 October 2011|website=Active Naturists}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Australia and the Pacific===

[[Australian Aborigines]] before European settlement did not wear clothes in day-to-day life;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Afghanistan-to-Bosnia-Herzegovina/Australian-Aborigines.html|title=Australian Aborigines|website=everyculture.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were also ritually exposed as a functional part testing endurance, e.g., to undergo [[scarification]], as was also the case and [[Sepik River]] tribes in [[Papua New Guinea]].

'''Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution''',&lt;ref name="s51(xxvi)"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|51}}(xxvi).&lt;/ref&gt; commonly called "the race power", is the subsection of [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution]] granting the Australian Commonwealth, the power to make special laws for people of any race.

As initially drafted, '''s 51(xxvi)''' empowered the [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] to make laws with respect to: "The people of any race, ''other than the [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] race in any State'', for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws". The Australian people voting at the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] deleted the words in italics.

[[Edmund Barton]] had argued in 1898 that s 51(xxvi) was necessary to enable the Commonwealth to "regulate the affairs of the people of coloured or inferior races who are in the Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22constitution%2Fconventions%2F1898-1096%22 |title=Official Record of the Debates of the National Australasian Convention |location =Melbourne |date=27 January 1898 |pages=228–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite book |last=French |first=Robert |author-link=Robert French |title=Australian Constitutional Landmarks |editor=H.P. Lee and George Winterton |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK |year=2003 |pages=180–212 |chapter=The Race Power: A Constitutional Chimera |isbn=0-521-83158-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section was intended to enable the Commonwealth to pass laws restricting such migrant labourers such as the Chinese and [[Kanakas]]. Quick and Garran observed in 1901 that "It enables the Parliament to deal with the people of any alien race after they have entered the Commonwealth; to localise them within defined areas, to restrict their migration, to confine them to certain occupations, or to give them special protection and secure their return after a certain period to the country whence they came."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Quick |first1=J |author-link1=John Quick (politician) |last2=Garran |first2=R |author-link2=Robert Garran |title=The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth |year=1901 |url=https://archive.org/stream/annotatedconstit00quicuoft#page/622/ |page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were delegates, however, at the 1898 Convention who argued against the use of legislative power to deal specifically with alien races, accepting that people might be excluded from Australia based on race, but arguing that once people were admitted to the country they should be treated in the same way as other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22constitution%2Fconventions%2F1898-1097%22 |title=Official Record of the Debates of the National Australasian Convention |location =Melbourne |date=28 January 1898}} [[Charles Kingston]] at pp. 244-7, [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] at pp, 245–6 and [[Josiah Symon]] at p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of s 51(xxvi), is, subject to the Constitution itself, unfettered, in keeping with s 51 granting plenary powers to the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1998|litigants=[[Kartinyeri v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 at p. 355 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 51(xxvi) supports the rejection of legal equality requirements when considering legislation otherwise validly enacted under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1997|litigants=[[Kruger v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1997) 190 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 }} at pp. 44-5 per Brennan CJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus legislation empowered by other constitutional powers, such as in the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|ntnera2007531|Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was empowered by [[Section 122 of the Australian Constitution|section 122]],&lt;ref name="s122"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; may be racially discriminatory.

In ''Kartinyeri v Commonwealth'', the High Court was split on whether s 51(xxvi) could be used to enact legislation that adversely discriminated on the basis of race. Justices [[William Gummow|Gummow]] and [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]] held that the use of race as the ais of parliamentary power was inherently discriminatory and that benefits to the people of one race may be detrimental to people of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1998|litigants=[[Kartinyeri v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 at [81]-[85] per Gummow and Hayne JJ |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Justice Kirby]] disagreed, holding that the race power did not permit the enactment of laws to the detriment of the people of any race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1998|litigants=[[Kartinyeri v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 at [152] per Kirby J |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gaudron|Justice Gaudron]] held that it was difficult to conceive of circumstances in which a law to the disadvantage of a racial minority would be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1998|litigants=[[Kartinyeri v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 at [44] per Gaudron J |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report delivered to the Australian prime minister on 19 January 2012, it was recommended that a referendum be held for the repeal of s 51(xxvi), to be replaced by s 51A (which empowers the Commonwealth to make laws for Indigenous Australians, but also recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as Australia's first peoples) and s 116A (which prohibits racially discriminatory legislation or the making of laws under s51A that are not for the benefit of Indigenous peoples).&lt;ref name="Panel"&gt;{{Citation|title=Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution: Report of the Expert Panel |date=January 2012 |url=http://www.recognise.org.au/wp-content/uploads/shared/uploads/assets/3446_FaHCSIA_ICR_report_text_Bookmarked_PDF_12_Jan_v4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316172634/http://www.recognise.org.au/wp-content/uploads/shared/uploads/assets/3446_FaHCSIA_ICR_report_text_Bookmarked_PDF_12_Jan_v4.pdf |dead-url=no |archive-date=16 March 2015 |isbn=978-1-921975-29-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex selection''' is the attempt to control the sex of the offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an [[embryo]], as well as at [[childbirth]]. It has been marketed under the title '''family balancing'''.

According to the [[UNFPA|United Nations Population Fund]], the reasons behind sex selection are due to three factors and provide an understanding for sex ratio imbalances as well as to project future trends. The factors are:

(1) A preference for sons which stems from household structures “in which girls and women have a marginal social, economic and symbolic position, and consequently enjoy fewer rights.”&lt;ref name="sex imbalances"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Imbalances at Birth|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Sex%20Imbalances%20at%20Birth.%20PDF%20UNFPA%20APRO%20publication%202012.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These household structures also focus on security in which sons are expected to provide support to their parents throughout their life;

(2) Technological growth of prenatal diagnosis which allows parents to know the sex of their unborn child; and

(3) Low fertility which increases the need for sex selection by reducing the probability of having a daughter in smaller families.

The [[UNFPA|United Nations Population Fund]] states that “Local fertility restrictions and spontaneous rapid fertility decline below replacement levels tend to compel parents who want both a son and a small family size to resort to sex selection.”&lt;ref name="sex imbalances"/&gt;

== Preference for sex of child ==
In many cultures, male offspring are desired in order to inherit property, carry on the family name and to provide support for parents in old age.

In countries such as [[India]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Nepal]] sons have been favored over daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first1= S. |editor-last2= Lahiri-Dutt |title= Doing gender, doing geography: emerging research in India |location= New Delhi |publisher= Routledge |year= 2011 |page= 212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EB63--z4zK0C&amp;pg=PT212 |isbn= 978-0-415-59802-6 |editor-last= Ryju}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weiner&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first1= M. |editor-last2= Varshney |editor-first2= A. |editor-last3= Almond |editor-first3= G.

The overall preference was driven by men, of whom 49% preferred a son compared to 22% who preferred a daughter. Men's preference for sons was most pronounced among men aged 18 to 29.

=== Son preference ===
{{main|Son preference in China}}
[[File:2012 Birth Sex Ratio World Map.jpg|thumb|300px|World map of birth sex ratios, 2012]]
[[File:Danshan Nongguang Village Bulletin board.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[one child policy]] in [[China]] has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratios. Image shows a community bulletin board in Nonguang Village, [[Sichuan province]], China, keeping track of the town's female population, listing recent births by name and noting that several thousand yuan of fines for unauthorized births remain unpaid from the previous year.]]
There is a preference of parents to have a son over a daughter in many countries.&lt;ref name="Seager2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Seager|first=Joni|title=The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World|year=2009|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York, New York|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be observed through sex ratios of children in various countries.&lt;ref name="Seager2009"/&gt; Although biologically the sex ratio of children is around 95 girls to every 100 boys, this number generally evens out due to the higher infant mortality rate of boy infants.&lt;ref name="Seager2009"/&gt; Scholars argue that the expected birth sex ratio in a normal population is in the range of 103 to 107 males to females at birth.&lt;ref name=unfpa2012&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/Report_SexRatios_2012.pdf Report of the International Workshop on Skewed Sex Ratios at Birth] United Nations FPA (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kseb&gt;Kraemer, Sebastian. "The Fragile Male." British Medical Journal (2000): n. pag. British Medical Journal. Web. 20 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in a number of countries of [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]], the sex ratio of children is severely distorted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is particularly severe in [[China]] and [[India]]. The preference for sons over daughters can be connected to a number of reasons. In these countries, it is argued that son preference is linked to factors including economics, religion, and culture.&lt;ref name="Seager2009"/&gt; Having a son ensures that families are more economically secure by not having to provide dowry payments, but rather being on the receiving end of this practice.&lt;ref name="Seager2009"/&gt; In China, the [[one child policy]] has contributed to the sex imbalance, while the [[dowry system in India]] is responsible for a strong son preference. Furthermore, in countries where there are discriminatory practices regarding women inheriting, owning, or controlling land by law, having a son ensures that the family will not have to worry about the legal aftermath if something were to happen to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seager|first=Joni|title=The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World|year=2009|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York, New York|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be argued that parents in these countries are aware of the potential hardship their daughter would have to endure in her lifetime, and therefore prefer to have a son in order not to see their daughter endure such difficulties. Many times this son preference results in [[Female foeticide in India|female foeticide]] and pre-natal sex selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das Gupta|first=Monica|last2=Zhenghua|first2=Jiang|last3=Bohua|first3=Li|last4=Zhenming|first4=Xie|last5=Chung|first5=Woojin|last6=Hwa-Ok|first6=Bae|date=20 November 2003|title=Why is Son preference so persistent in East and South Asia? a cross-country study of China, India and the Republic of Korea|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220380412331293807|journal=Journal of Development Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=153–187|doi=10.1080/00220380412331293807|issn=0022-0388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Pre-implantation===
Two major types of pre-implantation methods can be used for social sex selection. Both of them are based on actively rendering the second [[XY sex-determination system|sex chromosome]] to be either a [[Y chromosome]] (resulting in a [[male]]), or an [[X chromosome]] (resulting in a [[female]]).&lt;ref name="dugdale2009"&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002327|Chromosome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Ericsson method====
The [[Ericsson method]], first applied in a [[Clinic|clinical setting]] in the 1970s by Dr. Ronald J. Ericsson, uses higher [[concentration]]s of sperm of the desired sex to increase the likelihood of [[Human fertilization|conceiving]] that sex. The method has a 70-72% success rate for [[boy]]s and a 69-75% success rate for [[girl]]s.&lt;ref name="beernink"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beernink |first1=FJ |last2=Dmowski |first2=WP |last3=Ericsson |first3=RJ |title=Sex preselection through albumin separation of sperm |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=382–6 |year=1993 |pmid=8425635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, approximately 50 gender selection centers in the United States use the Ericsson Method for artificial gender selection.&lt;ref name="silverman2010a"&gt;{{cite web |last=Silverman, M.D., Ph.D. |first= Andrew Y. |title=Gender Selection Ericsson Method |url=http://www.gender-select.com/gender_selection/ericsson-method/ |accessdate= February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ericsson method separates male and female sperm by passing them through a column filled with [[Constituents of human blood|blood protein]], [[human serum albumin]]. As the sperm enter the human serum albumin, the differences in [[mass]] between the X and Y chromosomes manifest as the lighter male sperm push deeper into the protein than the females dragged down by the [[weight]] of the extra "leg" of the X sex chromosome.&lt;ref name="dmowski1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dmowski |first1=WP |last2=Gaynor |first2=L |last3=Rao |first3=R |last4=Lawrence |first4=M |last5=Scommegna |first5=A |title=Use of albumin gradients for X and Y sperm separation and clinical experience with male sex preselection |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=52–7 |year=1979 |pmid=283932}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tiny difference creates separate layers of concentrated male and female sperm. The layers of gender-selected sperm are of higher concentrations but not pure. This lack of purity explains the 30% chance of gender selection failure of the Ericsson method.&lt;ref name="chenguu1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=M. |last2=Guu |first2=HF |last3=Ho |first3=ES |title=Efficiency of sex pre-selection of spermatozoa by albumin separation method evaluated by double-labelled fluorescence in-situ hybridization |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1920–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9363707 |doi=10.1093/humrep/12.9.1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IVF/PGD technique====
[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|right|350px| An 8-celled [[embryo]] prior to IVF/PGD analysis]]
{{Further|IVF|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}

After [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulation]], multiple eggs are removed from the mother. The eggs are fertilized in the laboratory using the father's sperm in a technique called [[IVF|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF). "[[In vitro]]" is [[Latin language|Latin]] for "within [[Test tube|glass]]". Fertilized eggs are called [[embryo]]s. As the embryos develop through [[mitosis]], they are separated by sex. Embryos of the desired gender are implanted back in the mother's [[uterus]].

Prior to fertilization with IVF, the fertilized eggs can be genetically [[Biopsy|biopsied]] with [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) to increase fertilization success.&lt;ref name="pehlivan2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pehlivan |first1=T |last2=Rubio |first2=C |last3=Rodrigo |first3=L |last4=Romero |first4=J |last5=Remohi |first5=J |last6=Simón |first6=C |last7=Pellicer |first7=A |title=Impact of preimplantation genetic diagnosis on IVF outcome in implantation failure patients |journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=232–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12676006 |doi=10.1016/S1472-6483(10)61715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an embryo [[Cell growth|grows]] to a 6-8 cell size, a small laser incision in the egg membrane (zona pellucida) allows safe removal of one of the cells.&lt;ref name="boada1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boada |first1=M. |last2=Carrera |first2=M. |last3=De La Iglesia |first3=C. |last4=Sandalinas |first4=M. |last5=Barri |first5=P.

The IVF/PGD technique is favored over the Ericsson method because of the stricter control of the offspring gender in the laboratory. Since only embryos of the desired sex are transferred to the mother, IVF/PGD avoids the small likelihood present in the Ericsson method of an undesired sperm fertilizing the egg. Gender selection success rates for IVF/PGD are very high. The technique is recommended for couples who will not accept a child of the undesired gender.&lt;ref name="kanavakis2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanavakis |first1=E |last2=Traeger-Synodinos |first2=J |title=Preimplantation genetic diagnosis in clinical practice |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=6–11 |year=2002 |pmid=11826017 |pmc=1734958 |doi=10.1136/jmg.39.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="silverman2010b"&gt;{{cite web |last=Silverman |first= Andrew Y. |title=Determine baby gender with IVF/PGD |url=http://www.gender-select.com/gender_selection/determine-baby-gender-with-ivfpgd/ |accessdate= February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Timing methods====
Timing methods aim to affect the sex ratio of the resultant children by having [[sexual intercourse]] at specific times as related to [[ovulation]]. Studies have not been consistent about whether timing methods have any influence on the sex of the baby, with some showing no correlation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilcox |first1=Allen J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=Clarice R. |last3=Baird |first3=Donna D. |title=Timing of Sexual Intercourse in Relation to Ovulation — Effects on the Probability of Conception, Survival of the Pregnancy, and Sex of the Baby |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=333 |issue=23 |pages=1517–21 |year=1995 |pmid=7477165 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199512073332301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others showing just the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harlap |first1=Susan |title=Gender of Infants Conceived on Different Days of the Menstrual Cycle |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=300 |issue=26 |pages=1445–8 |year=1979 |pmid=449885 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197906283002601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?rh11010 |volume = 15 |issue = 1 |pages = 79–84 |last = McSweeney |first = Léonie |title = Successful Sex Pre-selection using Natural Family Planning |journal = African Journal of Reproductive Health |date = March 2011 |pmid = 21987941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Shettles Method|Shettles method]], first formally theorized in the 1960s by [[Landrum B. Shettles]], proposes that sperm containing the X (female) chromosome are more [[Semen quality|resilient]] than sperm containing the Y (male) chromosome. The method advocates [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] two to four days prior to [[ovulation]]. By the time ovulation occurs, the [[cervix]] should contain a higher concentration of female sperm still capable of fertilization (with most of the male sperm already dead). Intercourse close to ovulation, on the other hand, should increase the chances of conceiving a boy since the concentration of Y sperm will be higher at the [[Menstrual cycle#Ovulation|height]] of the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref name="shettles1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=RH |title=Natural family planning and sex selection: fact or fiction? |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=165 |issue=6 Pt 2 |pages=1982–4 |year=1991 |pmid=1836712 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(11)90558-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Whelan method is an "[[Fertility awareness|intercourse timing]]" method that advocates the opposite of the Shettles method. The Whelan method suggests intercourse four to six days prior to ovulation to increase the likelihood of fertilization by male sperm.&lt;ref name="whelan2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Shettles |author2=D.M.

====Sperm sorting====
{{Main|Sperm sorting}}
Sperm sorting is an advanced technique that sorts sperm "in vitro" by [[flow cytometry]]. This shines a [[laser]] at the sperm to distinguish X and Y chromosomes, and can automatically separate the sperm out into different samples. During the early to mid 1980s, Dr. Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm"&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"&gt;US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5021244.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5021244&amp;RS=PN/5021244&lt;/ref&gt; was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of [[haploid]] expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins. Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the patent filing, both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the USDA were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,&lt;ref name=pmid3506896&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=L.

As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seidel GE Jr. |author2=Garner DL. | year = 2002 | title = Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa | url = | journal = Reproduction | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 733–743 | doi=10.1530/reprod/124.6.733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is already in commercial use for animal farming.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Landline, [http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1624149.htm Dairy farms use gender selection process], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently being trialed on humans in the US under the trademark MicroSort; it claims a 90% success rate but is still considered experimental by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].&lt;ref name=Microsort&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MicroSort, Inc. |title=MicroSort Information |url=http://www.microsort.net/ |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayor S |title=Specialists question effectiveness of sex selection technique |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7304 |pages=67 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11451774 |pmc=1120747 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7304.67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-implantation===
{{Further|Prenatal sex discernment|Sex-selective abortion}}
Sex selection after implantation can be performed by [[prenatal sex discernment]], followed by [[sex-selective abortion]] of any offspring of the unwanted sex. For prenatal sex discernment, a [[blood test]] can be taken from the mother for testing of small amounts of fetal DNA within it, and has been estimated to be reliable more than 98% of the time, as long as the samples are taken after the seventh week of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devaney |first1=Stephanie A. |last2=Palomaki |first2=Glenn E. |last3=Scott |first3=Joan A. |last4=Bianchi |first4=Diana W. |title=Noninvasive Fetal Sex Determination Using Cell-Free Fetal DNA |journal=JAMA |volume=306 |issue=6 |pages=627–36 |year=2011 |pmid=21828326 |pmc=4526182 |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14457670 |date=10 August 2011 |title=Baby gender blood tests 'accurate' |first=Michelle |last=Roberts |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-birth===
[[Sex-selective infanticide]] - Killing children of the unwanted sex. Though illegal in most parts of the world, it is still practiced.

Sex-selective [[child abandonment]] - Abandoning children of the unwanted sex. Though illegal in most parts of the world, it is still practiced.

Sex-selective [[adoption]] - Placing children of the unwanted sex up for adoption. Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex.

==Ethical concerns==
The application of these techniques to humans creates moral and ethical concerns in the opinion of some, while the advantages of sensible use of selected technologies is favored by others.

In contrast, in an interview study, sex-selection technology providers generally argued that sex selection is an expression of [[reproductive rights]], was initiated and pursued by women, and was a sign of female empowerment that allowed couples to make well-informed family planning decisions, prevented occurrences of [[unintended pregnancy]] and [[abortion]], and minimized [[Domestic violence|intimate partner violence]] and/or [[child neglect]].&lt;ref name=puri&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Puri |first1=Sunita |last2=Nachtigall |first2=Robert D. |title=The ethics of sex selection: a comparison of the attitudes and experiences of primary care physicians and physician providers of clinical sex selection services |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=2107–14 |year=2010 |pmid=19342036 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine concluded that it is ethically appropriate to employ these new reproductive technologies to avoid the birth of children suffering from X-linked genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (1999) Sex selection and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Fertil. Steril,72 595–598.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis and sex selection solely for non-medical reasons, the Committee claims, is morally inappropriate.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-09-01|year=|title=Sex selection and preimplantation diagnosis: A response to the Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine|first1= Julian |last1=Savulescu|first2= Edgar |last2=Dahl|url=https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/15/9/1879/2915330/Sex-selection-and-preimplantation-diagnosisA|journal=Human Reproduction|language=en|volume=15|issue=9|pages=1879–1880|doi=10.1093/humrep/15.9.1879|issn=0268-1161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[primary care physician]]s questioned whether women could truly express free choice under pressure from family and community.&lt;ref name=puri/&gt; In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to [[gender stereotype]]s that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence.&lt;ref name=puri/&gt; In addition, social risks of sex selection outweigh the social benefits of sex selection&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Post-conceptual selection by preimplantation testing (PGD) also involves preferential use of embryos, and termination of pregnancy for gender selection also raises many ethical questions of the [[abortion debate]].

==Demographic concerns==

In addition to the ethical concerns mentioned, issues of [[demographics]] arise in societies where social sex selection is common. A society may exhibit a widespread bias towards having children of a specific gender, either due to cultural biases or economic concerns (e.g. male children may be more employable in the future and thus provide more financial support). When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a [[gender imbalance]] that has undesirable consequences. This phenomenon has been observed in many nations in the [[Far East]], such as [[India]] and [[China]], where social sex selection has produced unnaturally high male/female ratios in the population. Couples in these areas use reproductive technologies to choose the sex of their children, which ultimately leads to a skew the human sex ratio toward a disproportionately male population.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P|first=Liu|last2=GA|first2=Rose|date=1996-11-01|title=Ethics of sex selection for family balancing.

In these nations, a lack of opportunity for many men to marry is believed to be producing increases in [[crime]], demand for [[prostitution]], mass [[emigration]], and the selling of brides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2723513.stm India's lost girls], BBC Online, 4 Feb 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 12-Jan-2007 China facing major gender imbalance"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=January 12, 2007 |title=China facing major gender imbalance |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16593301/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/china-facing-major-gender-imbalance/ |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's 'one child family' policy is considered largely responsible for the substantial imbalance of the sex ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ethics of sex selection for family balancing: Family balancing as a morally acceptable application of sex selection|first=Guido|last=Pennings|date=1996|journal=Human Reproduction|url=https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/11/11/2339/575347|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a019109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government reports show that the [[sex ratio]] for newborns is 118:100 (boys:girls), higher in rural areas such as [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]] (130:100) compared to the average of 104:100 in developed countries. It is believed that the ratio would increase further to the point that, by 2020, men of marriageable age would be unable to find mates, resulting in large social problems.&lt;ref name="AP 12-Jan-2007 China facing major gender imbalance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3601281.stm | work=BBC News | title=China fears bachelor future | date=April 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations, such as India, have attempted to curtail these gender imbalances with criminal statutes. In contrast, bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] of [[New York University]] has argued that governments should pay couples to choose to have female children. According to Professor Appel, "if female babies [were] worth their weight in [[rupees]] and [[Chinese yuan|yuan]], economic and educational opportunities for girls would soon follow."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In contrast, actual experience in Western cultures provides no evidence for any degree of gender imbalance from technologies which have long been available and legal – such as selective abortion or preimplantation embryo testing. When used for family balancing indications in such countries as the United States, pre-conceptual sex selection is widely sought without any preferential selection of males.A 1993 survey of more than 2300 pregnant women in the British population found no overall preference for either sex. These findings are largely consistent with other surveys conducted in the US.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Thus the right of individual families to determine whether or not to balance gender of offspring in their families is not and will not become, in many countries, a demographic issue. Furthermore, in countries where such demographic issues exist because of strong gender preferences in a segment of the population, regulatory and legal control of, without denial of access to, sperm sorting technology can be utilized to provide individuals with choices while ensuring that equal numbers of boys and girls are produced for population demographic equality.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==History and folk beliefs==
Sex selection is not new.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org prenatal sex selection"&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/prenatal-sex-selection{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a wide variety of social sex selections methods which have not been demonstrated to be effective. Because even implausible and ineffective methods have a "success" rate of 50%, many continued to be recommended by word of mouth.

The Greeks and Romans did not have a consistent theory of how sex was determined. Pliny the Elder claims that tying the right testicle of a ram will cause him to produce only females, but does not claim this about other creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', Book XXX, Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-Plutarch lists many Greek theories of sex determination, including heat and cold, left and right testicles, left and right sides of the body, sperm crossing or not crossing from one side of the womb to the other, and the strength or dominance of various body parts.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Placita Philosophorum'', Book V, Chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

An 18th-century French book called ''The art of boys'' suggested an extreme method of ensuring children of one sex. The author suggests that one testicle and one ovary are intended for each sex. By removing a testicle or ovary, children of the other sex can be guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Procope-Couteaux, ''L'art de faire des garçons'', 1770, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Census data from India show an imbalance in sex ratios among children in the early 20th century, such disparities almost always reflect a preference for sons.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org prenatal sex selection"/&gt;

In the past, son preference may have resulted in the neglect or killing of female infants. However, since the early 1980s, ultrasounds and other technologies have enabled parents to detect the sex of a foetus during prenatal screenings. Those who prefer sons may arrange to abort female foetuses. This has accelerated sex-ratio imbalances at birth in parts of the world. It is estimated that, over the past generation, tens of millions of female foetuses have been aborted. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org prenatal sex selection"/&gt;

Sperm sorting utilizes the technique of [[flow cytometry]] to analyze and 'sort' [[spermatozoa]]. During the early to mid-1980s, Dr. Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm"&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"/&gt; was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of [[haploid]] expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins. Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At the time of the patent filing, both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the USDA were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,&lt;ref name=pmid3506896/&gt; after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where "sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails".&lt;ref name=pmid3507347/&gt; USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, 'Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology' relies on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes.&lt;ref name=pmid18343491/&gt; Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called Hoechst 33342 which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seidel |first1=George E. |last2=Garner |first2=Duane L. |title=Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa |journal=Reproduction |volume=124 |issue=6 |pages=733–43 |year=2002 |pmid=12537000 |doi=10.1530/rep.0.1240733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a study published in 2006 indicated that mothers with [[toxoplasmosis]] have a significantly higher [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of boys to girls. This has been discussed in connection with the [[manipulation hypothesis]] of parasites.&lt;ref name="toxo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaňková |first1=Š. |last2=Šulc |first2=J. |last3=Nouzová |first3=K. |last4=Fajfrlík |first4=K. |last5=Frynta |first5=D. |last6=Flegr |first6=J. |title=Women infected with parasite Toxoplasma have more sons |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=122–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17028886 |doi=10.1007/s00114-006-0166-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study found a link between sex and the diet of the mother, but this may be due to statistical chance, and has yet to be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mathews |first1=F. |last2=Johnson |first2=P. J |last3=Neil |first3=A. |title=You are what your mother eats: evidence for maternal preconception diet influencing foetal sex in humans |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=275 |issue=1643 |pages=1661–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18430648 |pmc=2602810 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0105 |laysummary=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99346281 |laysource=NPR |laydate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

Sex selection is legal in most of the world. There is [[fertility tourism]] from the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article1965091.ece US clinic offers British couples the chance to choose the sex of their child] From The Times.

Sex selection is illegal in [[China]], but the Chinese government admits that the practice is widespread, especially in rural areas of China and among lawless groups such as [[ghettoized]] migrant workers in cities.&lt;ref name="AP 12-Jan-2007 China facing major gender imbalance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fsi.stanford.edu/news/gender_imbalance_in_china_20081027/ Gender imbalance in China] October 27, 2008 - Shorenstein APARC, AHPP, SCP News. By Shannon Davidson, Jennifer Bunnell and Fei Yan&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex selection is illegal in [[India]]. Prenatal determination of sex through [[ultrasound]] is also illegal in India.&lt;ref name=LoC&gt;Krishan S. Nehra, Library of Congress. [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/sex-selection/canada.php Sex Selection &amp; Abortion: Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994|Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act]] banned prenatal sex determination, and was strengthened by an amendment in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(15)00053-4/fulltext?rss=yes|title=Banning of fetal sex determination and changes in sex ratio in India|journal=The Lancet|volume=3|issue=9|date=September 2015|doi=10.1016/s2214-109x(15)00053-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were instituted to combat the prevalent practice of [[sex-selective abortion]]. However, these laws have generally failed to be effective in rural areas and, despite education efforts, sex-selective abortion continues to be widely practiced in India.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Techsoup-speedgeek.jpg|thumb|right|Speed Geek event during the launch of [[TechSoup]] Canada]]

'''Speed geeking''' is a participation process used to quickly view a number of presentations within a fixed period of time. Speed geeking gets its name from [[speed dating]], since they both employ similar techniques.

== Method ==

A large room is selected as the speed geeking venue. All the presenters are arranged in a large circle along the edge of the room. The remaining members of the audience stand at the center of the room. Ideally there are about 6-7 audience members for each presenter. One person acts as the facilitator.

The facilitator rings a bell to start proceedings. Once proceedings start, the audience splits up into groups and each group goes to one of the presenters. Presenters have a short duration, usually 5 minutes, to give their presentation and answer questions. At the end of the five minutes, the facilitator rings a bell. At this point, each group moves over to the presenter to their right and the timer starts once more. The session ends when every group has attended all the presentations.

== Advantages ==

Speed geeking is a great way to quickly view a number of presentations and demos in a short while. For example, one hour is enough time to view 12 presenters if you spend 5 minutes at each presentation. The 5 minute limit also keeps presentations short and interesting. Also the small table format gives participants an opportunity to connect on a more personal level.

==Disadvantages==
Each presenter has to give their presentation multiple times.

A '''storefront church''' is a [[church (building)|church]] housed in a commercial [[storefront]] building.

These buildings are often called "Storefront Churches" because they are buildings that were previously commercial properties that have been converted to a religious use.

Often, the inside of the building was converted by putting in chairs and a makeshift [[pulpit]]. 
The storefront church sometimes serves as a hub for many poor African Americans to see leadership in an all black area. Many storefronts emerged in the urban centers of the north and were filled with poor former slaves leaving the harsh memories of their former lives behind. Storefront churches are a center of [[social development]] and [[free speech]] in many poor African American communities to express their feelings about the struggles and hardships they faced every day in their lives. They also can provide a focus point for community unity and [[Community engagement|engagement]].

Storefronts are still very much a part of the [[Black church]] experience today; furthermore, the storefront church has also emerged within other cultures. A [[PBS]] report said “Storefront churches today are not just black and urban. Many have recently been established in Latino- and Asian-dominated neighborhoods, as well as poorer rural communities, typically serving similar functions as the storefront churches in historically black communities.”{{cn|date=February 2017}}

During the [[2003 Iraq invasion]], Sudanese Iraqis were among the many "[[Third Country National|third country]] refugees" who fled Iraq to refugee camps in Jordan. [[Human Rights Watch]] later criticised the [[International Organisation for Migration]] for allowing Sudanese diplomats from Amman to enter the camps and speak with Sudanese-origin persons, stating such was a breach of international refugee law, particularly as some of these same refugees may previously have fled Sudan.&lt;ref name="Watch"&gt;{{cite book|author=Human Rights Watch|title=FLIGHT FROM IRAQ: Attacks on Refugees and other Foreigner and their Treatment in Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjOjRI2C0PkC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=20 April 2013|publisher=Human Rights Watch|pages=13–|id=GGKEY:R34WNDGND76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swiss migration to France''' has resulted in [[France]] being home to one of the largest [[Swiss people|Swiss]]-born populations outside [[Switzerland]].

The '''Taz''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''plural'' Тазы, [[Transliteration|transliterated]] Tazy) primarily live in [[Russia]]. They formed in the 1890s, from intermarriages between [[Udege people|Udege]], [[Nanai people|Nanai]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. The Taz speak Russian and the [[Taz language]] (a [[Northeast Mandarin]] variety with loanwords from [[Udege language|Udege]] and [[Nanai language|Nanai]]). In the 1880s (?), around 1,050 Taz speakers existed; today only elders speak the language. &lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:F22ZKuLijFEJ:lingsib.unesco.ru/ru/languages/statistics_ru.xls+%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%8B+%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%8D&amp;hl=el&amp;gl=gr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10] {{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features dramatised reconstructions and analysis by experts in the field of ancient history. This is the story of bloody conflicts between the Greeks and the Persians that lasted for more than fifty years in the fourth century BC. It includes the famous battle of Marathon, a victory that has echoed down the year, and Thermopylae, where the Spartans made a heroic defence of the pass. The running battles did not cease until 449 BC, when the Persians finally gave up hope of annexing Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-History-Of-Warfare-Persian/dp/B0007KI91A/ref=pd_sim_d_h__4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1RSBVZHCMYHQP7FE9WTZ |title=The History of Warfare: The Greek And Persian Wars DVD: Amazon.co.uk: The War File: the History of Warfare: DVD &amp; Blu-ray |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/1467737/history-of-warfare-the-the-greek-and-persian-wars-movie.html |title=History of Warfare, The: The Greek And Persian Wars (DVD 2009) |publisher=DVD Empire |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|| 2 || [[Peloponnesian War|Hoplite Warfare]] || The nature of infantry warfare in the Peloponnesian Wars between the Greek city states of Athens and Sparta in 450 BC. The hoplites were the regular infantry of both sides, armed with the long thrusting spear and fighting in powerful phalanxes, but it was the Spartans who used them to greater effect, eventually defeating Athens and subjugating her utterly. The mighty armoured warriors at the heart of Greek legend were famous Hoplites. Fighting shoulder to shoulder, armed with their long thrusting spears and colourful shields, these were the men who dominated the battlefields of the ancient world during the conflicts of the Peloponnesian Wars.
In 450 BC, war erupted between the two great powers of ancient Greece, the Athenians and the Spartans. By the time the war had finished, the army, navy and city of Athens would be in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-History-Of-Warfare-Hoplite/dp/B0007KI910/ref=pd_sim_d_h__1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1D4MDHRRWES4TTXF8REB |title=The History of Warfare: Hoplite Warfare [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: The War File: the History of Warfare: DVD &amp; Blu-ray |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/1467733/history-of-warfare-the-hoplite-warfare-movie.html |title=History of Warfare, The: Hoplite Warfare (DVD 2009) |publisher=DVD Empire |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|| 4 || [[Gallic Wars]] || The Gallic Wars tells the story of the campaigns from 58 BC to 53 BC in which Julius Caesar and his Roman legions conquered Gaul and the mysterious island of Britannia. Caesar portrayed this invasion as genuine concern for Italian security but as the campaign developed, Rome's greatest commander began to hatch plans for the full conquest. This documentary sketches the conflict between Rome and Gaul, specifically Caesar's campaigns of 58–53 BC, culminating with the defeat of Vercingetorix at Alesia. The programme uses clips of actors dressed as Gauls and Romans, one of whom poses as Julius Caesar reading extracts from his De bello Gallico, and these re-enactment scenes are interspersed with academic talking heads. It's all standard classroom stuff that gets the facts across without much in the way of frills or style, but doubtless of value for students. Much time at the beginning of the programme is spent looking at the Celtic way of life in an attempt to redress the bias of the written Roman sources, although the identification of Stonehenge as a druidic monument is highly contentious, as is the idea that Caesar's conquests were in some way retribution for the Gallic sack of Rome back in 390 BC: Caesar was far more interested in the current political scene to care about what was, for him as much as for us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Warfare-Gallic-Wars-DVD/dp/B0007KI91K/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404872927&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=History+Of+Warfare%2C+The%3A+The+Gallic+Wars |title=The History of Warfare: The Gallic Wars [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: The War File: the History of Warfare: DVD &amp; Blu-ray |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/1467742/history-of-warfare-the-the-gallic-wars-movie.html |title=History of Warfare, The: The Gallic Wars (DVD 2009) |publisher=DVD Empire |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ||Bob Sessions|| Cromwell || 58 BC-50 BC ||  || {{Start date|df=yes|2005|2|7}} || 55 min ||

In 55 BC the ambitious Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, turned envious eyes towards the mysterious isle of Britain. Within a few short years, the mighty Roman war machine had tamed the Celtic tribal society and transformed it into a province of the Roman Empire. This is the story of the dark years of ancient Britain when the well-disciplined Roman Legions faced the fury of the united Celtic peoples of Britain.||[[Brian Blessed]] || Pegasus || 43–96 AD ||  || {{Start date|df=yes|2004|9|14}} || 55 min ||

The last of the fighting Gauls were up against one of military history's most inspired commanders – Julius Caesar and Roman legions of almost mythical invincibility. The extraordinary siege works constructed by the Romans not only kept Vercingetorix's army penned in but also managed to keep an enormous Gallic relief army out.||Jack Fortune || Pegasus || 52 BC ||  || {{Start date|df=yes|2008|4|19}} || 50 min ||

The great battle fought near the English seaside town of Hastings on 14 October 1066, was perhaps the most significant in England¹s history. The great victory won that day by Duke William of Normandy over Harold II of England was to shape forever the destiny of a nation. For at the end of a day of furious battle, the sun set not only on the dead and wounded who littered Senlac Hill, but also on the entire Anglo-Saxon way of life. The Battle of Hastings features atmospheric original reconstruction and re-enactment footage, plus dramatised eye-witness accounts. The very latest 3D computer mapping techniques combine with delightful images from the remarkable Bayeux Tapestry to tell the dramatic story of a battle which remains one of the most famous in military history.

|| 52 || [[Siege of Petersburg|Under Siege! – Petersburg 1864]] || Fought during the American Civil War, Petersburg should never have been 'under siege' at all. Union forces should have seized control of the town in June 1864, but, through a mixture of confusion and incompetence, they failed in their objective, and a yearlong siege followed. Petersburg is best remembered for the tragedy of the great crater, the result of a huge underground explosion in July 1864, into which the Union Army inexplicably charged, creating a ready-made killing zone. This unusual tactic was an extreme answer to solving the problem of siege warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Under-Siege-Petersburg-1864-DVD/dp/B0015YY6ZA/ref=pd_sim_d_h__4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1G4SWFW2W3JTEVSKMASD |title=Under Siege! – Petersburg 1864 [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: Under Siege: DVD &amp; Blu-ray |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fanatical French defence of the three forts – which had enormous psychological value to the whole nation – cost hundreds of thousands of lives and was, in part, the reason the Battle of the Somme was fought during the same year. The battle ebbed and flowed throughout the year and the forts were captured and recaptured many times before finally the fighting eased in December 1916. Unfortunately by this time almost 700,000 French and German troops had been killed or wounded trying to take or defend the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Under-Siege-Verdun-1916-DVD/dp/B0015YY6ZU/ref=pd_sim_d_h__10?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1EACGS6VYCXHCNHPYRNG |title=Under Siege! – Verdun 1916 [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: Under Siege: DVD &amp; Blu-ray |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|| 61 || [[Siege of Leningrad|Under Siege! – Leningrad 1941]] ||The siege was the longest and most enduring of World War Two if not the entire twentieth century. What was initially a planned attack to take the city in four weeks turned into a nine-hundred-day siege of immense proportions.
Since before Leningrad was called such she was called Saint Petersburg and in her long history had never been invaded, despite this Hitler announced that it was to be the first great Soviet city to fall and city was to be wiped off the face of the earth.

In 1941 the decision was taken Leningrad was a symbolic with Operation Barbarossa have three main objectives with army group south taking the industrial might of the Soviet Union heading to the oil fields of the Cacausses, army group Centre heading for the country's capital and political headquarters Moscow and Army group north with its orders to take the historical symbol of Bolshevism Leningrad because it was here in 1917 that the October Revolution was proclaimed. Hitler said that it was a war of ideology taking Leningrad will deprave the Russian people of the symbol to their revolution.
The German planned to take quickly the city so the same troops could be used the same troop to conquer Moscow. Leningrad will become Hitler's grave because it was proved that the fight for the city was a fight for pure survival and that Leningraders were not afraid of death but that death was affair of Leningrad.  Life, honour, happiness, everything was at stake in this mortal challenge. With stiff resistance containing and troops needed elsewhere, the Panzer battalions disengaged and went south to Moscow, leaving the long-range artillery. The battle of Leningrad had effectively became a siege. Surrounded on all sides, there was not an effective way to get supplies into the city, Goebbels saying that Leningrad is doomed to die of famine. The entire population was put on the ration of a few loaves of black bread per day, with many of some parts of the population turning to cannibalism. [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city|Health problems from the survivors many died later as a result]].

The 'Road of Life', a frozen lake that in January 1942 saw a passage through which vital supplies could be smuggled into the encircled city. Spring saw a pipeline to bring oil to the city under siege. The Soviet offensive in late 1943 saw 200,000 men make a pincer movement which by January 1944 was able lift the siege so that the city was no longer an island. The Siege of Leningrad had taken the lives of over 1&amp;nbsp;million of its citizens either from air attacks, artillery bombardments, starvation and disease; the population stood firm until the only Germans who entered the city were prisoners of war, being the only German soldiers to serve in a single army group during the entire war.

The siege was lifted, but it would take another year to completely defeat the German army, and with the lifting of the siege certain came down the iron certain with the return of Soviet oppression, seeing many heroes of Leningrad killed after the war because they were seen as potential enemies.

'''''The Tender''''' was a news blog covering life in [[San Francisco]]'s fifty square block [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin District]] &amp;mdash; published 2009–2011.

==History==

Originally titled "The Tenderblog", '''The Tender''' was published by couple Èlia Varela Serra (a native of Spain) and [[Miquel Hudin]] (a native northern Californian), focusing on the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]], [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]], [[Mid-Market, San Francisco|Mid-Market]], [[Tendernob]], and [[Little Saigon#San Francisco|Little Saigon]] neighborhoods of San Francisco.

When Serra and Hudin returned to Serra's native Spain&lt;ref name="elia"/&gt; in November 2011, the couple stopped publication, allowing the site to go dormant, its archives remaining online.&lt;ref name="elia"&gt;{{cite news

The '''Veneto Club''' is an Italian social club in [[Bulleen]], Victoria, Australia. It was established in the late 1960s on a site in the eastern suburbs, which had become an attractive area for Italian migrants to move to from the working class inner suburbs, when they had established themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulleen.localstats.com.au/demographics/vic/melbourne/north-east/bulleen Bulleen Demographics (VIC) Local Stats]&lt;/ref&gt; A  substantial [[Brutalist]] style building was erected in 1972-73, to the designed of the Italian émigré architect [[Ermin Smrekar]].&lt;ref name="Nelli"&gt;[http://vuir.vu.edu.au/15651/1/Nelli_2000compressed.pdf Adriana Nelli, 1954, Addio Trieste...The Triestine Community of Melbourne Doctor of Philosophy Victoria University 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Located at 191 Bulleen Road  Bulleen, the Veneto Club has its origins in the 1960s during informal gatherings of some Melbourne-based ‘Veneti’ gathered for social activities including [[Bocce]] games. In 1969 a group of Italian businessmen purchased  16 acres of land in Bulleen and erected a small shed, known as ‘la Baracca’, as a shelter and informal ‘clubhouse’. On December 8, 1973, the new Smrekar-designed building, was opened by The Hon. [[Billy Snedden]], in front of a crowd of 3000 people. The Italian Ambassador to Australia attended the opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venetoclubmelbourne.com.au/about-us/history/ Veneto Club website 'History']&lt;/ref&gt;

The site includes extensive grounds and playing fields, and is the venue for the Women’s National Basketball League (WNBL)team the [[Bulleen Boomers]] from 1984. the [[History Teachers' Association of Victoria]] was based here in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianplaces.com.au/bulleen Victorian Places, 2015 'Bulleen']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veteran Feminists of America logo.jpg|right]]

'''Veteran Feminists of America''' ('''VFA''') is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization for supporters  and veterans of the Second Wave of the feminist revolution. Founded by [[Jacqueline Ceballos]] in 1992, Veteran Feminists of America regularly hosts reunions for [[second-wave feminist]]s and events honoring feminist leaders.

==VFA Mission statement==

The purpose of Veteran Feminists of America is to honor, record and preserve the history of the accomplishments of women active in the feminist movement, to educate the public on the importance of the changes brought about by the women's movement, to preserve the movement's history and to inspire future generations.

==History==

The Veteran Feminists of America was created with the goals of remembering and recording the faces and retrospectives of the hundreds of pioneers who launched the 1960s feminist movement, often called [[second-wave feminism]]. 

At first, VFA gatherings consisted of a time and place to meet and reminisce, followed by an awards dinner captured for posterity on video.  Those videotapes are now archived at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at the [[Radcliffe Institute]] and the [[Sallie Bingham]] Center for Women's History and Culture at [[Duke University]]. Soon after their first reunion in 1992, [[Jacqueline Ceballos]] joined with Dorothy Senerchia and Mary Jean Tully to create the organization. [[Muriel Fox]] joined soon thereafter and has chaired the organization since 1994.

The original idea for a name, Veterans of Feminist Wars, was rejected because its acronym could be confused with that of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ceballos|first1=Jacqueline|title=A brief history by Jacqueline Ceballos, VFA Founder|url=http://www.vfa.us/History.htm|website=Veteran Feminists of America website|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first decade, VFA mainly honored individuals and groups for their work in establishing national and local organizations, raising public awareness about feminist issues, and lobbying for women's rights. In time, VFA's events spread geographically and reached into new areas across the country. 

In 1998, VFA Board member [[Barbara Love]], with help from her fellow VFA members, began compiling a directory of feminists, published in 2006 as ''Feminists Who Changed America: 1963-1975'' (University of Illinois Press). The book is a collection of 2,220 biographies of second-wave feminists who accomplished significant activist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Love|first1=Barbara|title=Feminists who Changed America|date=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Urbana|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/feminists-who-changed-america-1963-1975/oclc/70174994|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available as a searchable CD (www.fwca-cd.vetfems.org). ''Feminists Who Changed America'' — along with the videos from two decades of retrospective events — brings to life the history of feminism's [[Second-wave_feminism|second wave]]. It is meant to help to ensure that the achievements of the women's movement are not forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeLu|first1=Ardys|title=Review of Feminists Who Changed America.|journal=FemSpec|date=2007|volume=8|issue=1-2|page=122|url=http://www.femspec.org/8/abstracts.html#review|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VFA has a new partnership with the New York Historical Society Museum &amp; Library.  Its newly created Center for Women's History will be the venue to showcase the artifacts and stories that document modern feminism.
