      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11116">The '''Afghanistan–Pakistan barrier''' is a partly-built [[border barrier]] being constructed by Pakistan to restrict [[illegal immigration]] and infiltration across the [[Durand Line]], the porous, {{convert|2640|km}} international border between [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/02/why-the-durand-line-matters |title=Why the Durand Line Matters |first=Arwin |last=Rahi |date=21 February 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |work=[[The Diplomat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major General [[Shaukat Sultan]], former Pakistani military spokesman, said the move was necessary to block the infiltration of militants across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghanistan-Pakistan: Focus on bilateral border dispute |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/20801/afghanistan-pakistan-focus-on-bilateral-border-dispute |date=30 October 2003 |publisher=[[IRIN]] |accessdate=July 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RKqxzXrc?url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/20801/afghanistan-pakistan-focus-on-bilateral-border-dispute |archivedate=2014-07-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1500|mi|km|adj=on}} proposed fence was initially backed by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US backs Pakistani-Afghan border fence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/14/pakistan.afghanistan |date=14 September 2005 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=July 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RKrFdJLk?url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/14/pakistan.afghanistan |archivedate=2014-07-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2017, Pakistan had fenced 43 km of the border, primarily in the former [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]. The Durand Line is marked by 235 crossing points, some of which are susceptible to infiltration. The entire project is predicted to cost at least $532 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/the-fence-driving-a-wedge-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan |title=The Fence Driving a Wedge Between Pakistan and Afghanistan |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1 November 2017 |accessdate=6 November 2017 |first=Ismail |last=Dilawar |first2=Kamran |last2=Haider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fencing==
In September 2005, Pakistan stated it had plans to build a {{convert|1500|mi|km|adj=on}} fence along its border with Afghanistan to prevent insurgents and drug smugglers slipping between the two countries. Former Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] had subsequently offered to mine the border as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote        = WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said on Monday his country was doing all it could in the U.S.-led war against terrorism and offered to fence and mine its border with Afghanistan to stem Taliban infiltration. "I have been telling Karzai and the United States, 'Let us fence the border and let us mine it.' Today I say it again. Let us mine their entire border. Let us fence it. It's not difficult", Musharraf said, referring to Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

| quote = Now the other thing that I've said: if he thinks everyone is crossing from here, I've been saying let us fence the border and let us also mine the border. We are experts at mining, they should mine the border on their side. We will fence it on our side. If that is all right I am for it, so that they are not allowed to go across at all. And then let us see what is happening in Afghanistan. Why don't they agree to this, I've said this openly many times before, they don't do it, for whatever are their reasons. I know how effective the fence, the Indian fence which is about 1,800 kilometres, and they are fencing the Kashmir mountains also, it is so difficult. Why are they doing that, are they mad, they are spending billions of rupees. Because it is effective. Let's fence this border so that this blame game is killed once for ever.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans to fence and mine the border were again considered in 2007 and then in 2009, but they were not fully implemented. However, a {{convert|35|km}} long portion along selected border areas was fenced and the work was discontinued for lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan to mine, fence Afghan border|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/Politics/24-Jun-2011/Pakistan-to-mine-fence-Afghan-border|date=June 24, 2011|work=The Nation|accessdate=July 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RKtRZlMP?url=http://www.nation.com.pk/Politics/24-Jun-2011/Pakistan-to-mine-fence-Afghan-border|archivedate=2014-07-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Major General [[Athar Abbas]], the then spokesman for the army, said: "We did fence around 35km of the border area as it faced continuous militant incursions. It was a joint project of ISAF and Afghanistan. But then they backed out. It was a very costly project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan to fence, mine Afghan border|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/638649/plan-to-fence-mine-afghan-border|date=June 23, 2011|work=The Nation|accessdate=July 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RKtZLln6?url=http://www.dawn.com/news/638649/plan-to-fence-mine-afghan-border|archivedate=2014-07-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Musharraf period, a [[biometric]] system was installed by Pakistan on border crossings. Afghanistan had objected to the system. The bio-metric system remains intact at the border, although it is yet to be made fully functional.&lt;ref name="trench"/&gt;

==Afghan opposition==
{{main|Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes}}
The Pakistani plans for mining and fencing the border were renewed on 26 December 2006, but these plans were opposed by the Afghan government, citing that the fencing would result in "the limitation of the freedom of movement of [[Pashtun people|Pushtun]] tribes people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan to mine and fence Afghan border|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/697a844a-954e-11db-a911-0000779e2340.html|date=December 27, 2006|work=Financial Times|accessdate=July 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RKrasGnS?url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/697a844a-954e-11db-a911-0000779e2340,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F697a844a-954e-11db-a911-0000779e2340.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk|archivedate=2014-07-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Afghan opposition to the border fencing, the Angor Adda and Sheken areas saw a [[Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes|border skirmish]] in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clash erupts between Afghan, Pakistani forces over border fence|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/southasia/news/article_1293995.php/Clash_erupts_between_Afghan_Pakistani_forces_over_border_fence|date=April 20, 2007|work=Monsters and Critics|accessdate=July 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123143833/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/southasia/news/article_1293995.php/Clash_erupts_between_Afghan_Pakistani_forces_over_border_fence|archivedate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2013, the [[Afghan Foreign Ministry]] formally protested and raised 'grave concerns' over what it called "the Pakistani military's unilateral construction and physical reinforcement activities along the border in the eastern Ningarhar province".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Afghanistan protests Pakistan's border 'construction, physical reinforcement'|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/529763/afghanistan-protests-pakistans-border-construction-physical-reinforcement/|date=April 1, 2013|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=July 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RKtyhQtO?url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/529763/afghanistan-protests-pakistans-border-construction-physical-reinforcement/|archivedate=2014-07-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan does not recognize the Durand Line itself as a legitimate border between it and Pakistan, as it divides the [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun ethnic homeland]] in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-pakistan-border-durand-karzai/24957765.html|title=Karzai Orders Removal Of Pakistani Border Gate|date=13 April 2013|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan contends that the installation of a physical barrier would make this border permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6644043.stm|title=Pakistan progress on Afghan fence|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction progress==
In June 2016, after 3 years of construction, Pakistan completed a 1,100 km [[trench]] along the Afghan border in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province to ensure proper border-management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1126353/1100km-trench-built-alongside-pak-afghan-border-balochistan/ |title=1,100km trench built alongside Pak-Afghan border in Balochistan |author=Qaiser Butt |date=June 20, 2016 |publisher=The Express Tribune |accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was carried out by the Pakistani [[Frontier Corps]]. The purpose of the trench is to tighten border security by countering the flow of militants, smugglers, illegal movement and narcotics.&lt;ref name="trench"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1131547 |title=Trench dug at Pak-Afghan border to stop infiltration of terrorists |publisher=Dawn |date=13 September 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2014 |first=Syed Ali |last=Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Balochistan construction companies were contracted to supply manpower and arrangements. The 11-foot deep and 14-foot wide ditch will be extended along the whole border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cross-border movement: Ditch along Pak-Afghan border to cost Rs14 billion |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/816448/cross-border-movement-ditch-along-pak-afghan-border-to-cost-rs14-billion/ |date=January 3, 2015 |publisher=The Express Tribune |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VJNqe5H5?url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/816448/cross-border-movement-ditch-along-pak-afghan-border-to-cost-rs14-billion/ |archivedate=2015-01-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldinga Scrub Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the suburbs of [[Aldinga Beach, South Australia|Aldinga Beach]] and [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] about {{convert|46|km|abbr=off}} south by west of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] in [[South Australia]].  The park was proclaimed in November 1975 under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' for the purpose of protecting a parcel of undeveloped land considered to be 'a significant remnant of the natural habitat that once occurred all along the southern Adelaide coastline'.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name= Aldinga Scrub Conservation Park |feature= SA0000687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{Citation | author1=South Australia.

The '''Anton Melik Geographical Institute''' ({{lang-sl|Geografski inštitut Antona Melika}}) was founded in 1946 by the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. In 1976 it was named after the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[geographer]] and academy member [[Anton Melik]] (1890–1966), who was the first head of the institute. Since 1981, the institute has been a member of the Scientific Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Until 1992 the institute was mainly engaged with researching [[glacier]]s, glacial and fluvial transformations of land surfaces, [[flood]]ed areas, natural disasters, mountain farms, and social geography. Since 1993 the institute's main task has been to conduct geographical studies of [[Slovenia]] and its landscapes and to prepare basic geographical texts on [[Slovenia]] as a country and as part of the [[world]]. 

Research is mostly directed toward physical, social, and regional geography and thematic [[cartography]]. 

==Facilities==
It has nine organizational units: 

* Department of [[Physical Geography]] 
* Department of [[Social geography|Social Geography]] 
* Department of [[Regional geography|Regional Geography]] 
* Department of [[Natural Disaster]]s 
* Department of [[environmentalism|Environmental Protection]] 
* Department of the Geographical Information System
* Department of [[thematic map|Thematic Cartography]] 
* Geographical Museum
* Geographical Library 

The institute houses a map collection and three specialized geographical collections: Landscapes of Slovenia, Settlements of Slovenia, and Glaciers of Slovenia. It is headquarters of the Commission for the Standardization of Geographical Names of the [[Government of Slovenia|Government of the Republic of Slovenia]] (''Komisija za standardizacijo zemljepisnih imen Vlade Republike Slovenije''). 

==Publications==
The institute publishes three scholarly publications. ''[[Geografija Slovenije]]'' (Geography of Slovenia) is a series of books that appears in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] once or twice a year. ''[[Acta geographica Slovenica]]/[[Geografski zbornik]]'' is a journal published twice a year in [[English language|English]] and Slovene. The articles can be downloaded in Slovene or English from the [http://ags.zrc-sazu.si journal homepage]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Geografski informacijski sistemi v Sloveniji'' (Geographical Information Systems in Slovenia) is a bulletin published every second (even) year in Slovene.

It was excavated by Sir [[Mark Aurel Stein]] on his second Central Asian expedition (1906-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=M.

Aurel|title=Serindia|year=1921|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his local guides identified this site as the place he had earlier found woodslip manuscripts in Chinese and Brahmi script that had been sold to Stein at Khotan by Badruddin Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chavannes|first=Édouard|title=Les document chinois|year=1913|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=219, Pl.

In 1915 while in Khotan on his third Central Asian expedition (1913-6) Stein was sold further pieces, both stucco fragments and manuscripts, by Badhurddin Khan also purportedly from Balawaste. He had no means of verifying this but believed the style was consistent with this provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=M. Aurel|title=Innermost Asia|year=1928|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 94 pieces found by Stein can be combined to form a sequence of life-size Buddhas, [[Bodhisattva]]s, and divine beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gropp|first=G.|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica: Balawaste|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/balawaste-a-ruin-site-in-the-eastern-part-of-the-khotan-oasis-near-the-village-of-domoko|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stein dated the site to around 600&amp;nbsp;AD based on the clothing style of the Buddhist figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Aurel Stein and the Silk Road finds|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-silk-road-finds-maps-3/|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cabinet of the Faroe Islands''' (Faroese: Føroya Landsstýri) has been the chief executive body and the government of the [[Faroe Islands]] since the islands became self-governing in 1948. The cabinet is led by the Prime Minister (''løgmaður''). There are around 7 members of the Cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.fo/Default.aspx?ID=11721 mfa.fo, Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt; known as "Ministers" (landsstýrismaður or landsstýriskvinna), all of whom are also heads of specific government ministries. The ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister. The Faroese government currently consists of seven ministers including the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.fo/Default.aspx?ID=11726 Mfa.fo, Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colourful lakelets''' (Polish "Kolorowe Jeziorka") is the name of three (sometimes four) artificial [[pond]]s formed in place of former [[Mining|mine]]s at the slope of Wielka Kopa mountain (871 m) in [[Rudawy Janowickie]], range in [[Sudetes]] Mountains, [[Poland]]. The biggest one and the eldest (1785) was named Hoffnung and now became the Purple lakelet. Names of the other mines were: Neues Glück (1793, presently Azure Lakelet), and Gustav Grube (1796; the Green Lakelet). These places were mined (from 1785 to 1925) for [[pyrite]].

The lakelets have various surface elevation. The Purple lakelet (560 m) owes its colour to [[chemical composition]] of its banks and bottom which are abundant with [[iron compounds]], mainly pyrite. The pond is filled with water solution of [[sulphuric acid]] (pH = 3). It is highly recommended to avoid any contact with the water for it might be dangerous. Below Purple Lakelet there is a smaller hollow which is at times filled with waters falling from the pond above – it is called Yellow Lakelet.

The colour of Azure Lakelet (635 m; also called: Blue or Emerald) water is connected with the presence of [[copper]] [[ion]]s. Its water, besides its colour, is clean, thus during hot [[summer]] days there can be seen people bathing in it; water is usually quite cold here, though.

Green Lakelet (730 m; also called Black Pond), same as Azure Lakelet owes its colour to copper compounds. Depending on [[rainfall]], it temporarily disappears.

[[File:Cove Fort, Utah 5.JPG|thumb|Front view]]
[[File:Cove Fort, Utah 11.JPG|thumb|Interior]]
'''Cove Fort''' is a [[fort]] and historical site located in [[Millard County, Utah]].  It was founded in 1867 by [[Ira Hinckley]] (the paternal grandfather of [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]) at the request of [[Brigham Young]].  One of its distinctive features is the use of volcanic rock in the construction of the walls, rather than the wood used in many mid-19th-century [[American Old West|western]] forts.  This difference in construction is the reason it is one of very few forts of this period still surviving.

Cove Fort is the closest named place to the western terminus of [[Interstate 70]], resulting in  Cove Fort being listed as a [[control city]] on freeway signs, though the fort is historical and has no permanent population.

==History==
[[Image:CoveFortTelegraphRoom.jpg|thumb|Telegraph office]]
The site for Cove Fort was selected by Brigham Young because of its location about halfway between [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]], then the capital of the [[Utah Territory]], and the nearest city, [[Beaver, Utah|Beaver]].  It provided a [[Stopover|way station]] for people traveling the [[Mormon Road]].  A town would have been constructed at the Cove Fort site, but the water supply was inadequate to support a sizable population.  Another key factor in the selection of the site was the prior existence of a wooden-palisade fort, [[Willden Fort]], which provided shelter and safety for the work crews who constructed Cove Fort.

The fort is a square, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} on each side.  The walls are constructed of black [[volcanic rock]] and dark [[limestone]], both quarried from the nearby mountains.  The walls are 18&amp;nbsp;ft high and 4&amp;nbsp;ft thick at the base, tapering to 2&amp;nbsp;ft thick at the top.  The fort has two sets of large wooden doors at the east and west ends, originally filled with sand to stop arrows and bullets, and contains 12 interior rooms.

As a daily stop for two [[stagecoach]] lines, as well as many other travelers, Cove Fort was heavily used for many years, often housing and feeding up to 75 people at a time.  In addition to providing a place to rest, a [[blacksmith]]/[[farrier]] resided at the fort, who [[wiktionary:shod|shod]] horses and [[ox]]en, and also repaired wagon wheels.  With its [[telegraph]] office and as a [[Pony Express]] stop, it also acted as a regional communications hub.

==Restoration==
In the early 1890s, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] determined the fort was no longer required and leased it out, selling it to W.H. Kesler after the turn of the 20th century.  In 1989, the Hinckley family purchased the fort and donated it back to the Church.  The Church restored the fort, transported Ira Hinckley's [[Coalville, Utah]], cabin to the site, constructed a [[visitor center]], and reopened the fort as a historic site.  The site provides free guided tours daily, starting from about 8 am until one half-hour before sunset.

==Transportation==
{{see also|Interstate 70 in Utah}}
The first highway to traverse Cove Fort was the [[Arrowhead Trail (auto trail)|Arrowhead Trail]], which connected [[Salt Lake City]] with [[Los Angeles]]. When the [[U.S. Highway]] system was formed, this route became [[U.S. Route 91]], and is today [[Interstate 15]]. When the [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highway system]] was in the planning stages, planners noted no direct connection existed between the [[central United States]] and [[southern California]]. The result to fill this gap was a new freeway that would be built west from [[Green River, Utah]], towards Cove Fort, along a path that used to be inaccessible by paved roads. Since that time, Cove Fort has also served as the western terminus of Interstate 70.&lt;ref name=rambler&gt;{{cite web

In 2004, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] was testing a new typeface, [[Clearview (font)|Clearview]], designed to have improved readability at night with headlight illumination. One test sign was placed at [[Baltimore, Maryland]] – the eastern terminus of Interstate 70 – that listed Cove Fort as a [[control city]] with a distance of {{convert|2200|mi|km|abbr=on}}. One employee stated with the number of queries the department received about Cove Fort, the test was a success. The sign became so popular that after the test was over, federal authorities made arrangements with Maryland authorities to keep the sign permanently installed.&lt;ref name=rambler/&gt; The sign prompted a series of stories about Cove Fort to be published in the Baltimore area. Since that time, a small effort has been made by people in both states to lobby the [[Utah Department of Transportation]] to reciprocate by placing a sign at Cove Fort listing the distance to Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Dan Ashbel''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: דן אשבל; born 1949 in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]) is a retired Israeli Ambassador

==Biography==

Dan Ashbel was born in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1949. He studied [[Geography]] and [[English Literature]] at the [[University of Haifa]]. At a later stage he completed his [[Master's degree|Master]] in [[Political Science]] with a focus on the [[Middle East]]. 

Dan Ashbel is married to Zehava and they have three sons.

==Professional career==
From 1973 to 1975 Ashbel worked as a teacher at the [[Kfar HaNoar HaDati]] High School in [[Kfar Hasidim]] near Haifa. In 1975 he joined Israel's diplomatic Service, and in 1978 became First Secretary for press and cultural affairs at the embassy of Israel in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. This post ended in 1983. From 1983 to 1986, he held the posts of head of the director's office for the Center for Political Research and deputy press spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem. Between 1986 and 1989 he was counselor and DCM at the Israeli embassy in Austria. In 1989, he took up a three-year post as press counselor at the Israeli embassy to the United Kingdom in [[London]]. During that period he participated in the [[Madrid Peace Conference of 1991]].

Upon his return from London in 1992, Ashbel took over the responsibility for the Israeli cooperation program for [[Central Asia]]n countries. Later, he became the director of the Training Division and Europe II Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem. From 1994 to 1996 he was an instructor at Israel's National Defense College. This was followed by the post of Israel's [[Consul General]] for the Mid-Atlantic region in the USA, based in [[Philadelphia]] between 1997 and 2000. Ashbel then became director of the division of European Multilateral Institutions and coordinator for the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Euromed) in the Israeli Foreign Ministry. From March 2005 to October 2009, he was Israel's ambassador to [[Austria]]. This post included also the representation of Israel in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] and the United Nations International Organizations in Vienna. From 2006 to 2009, he was also the non resident ambassador of Israel to Slovenia. Since November 2009, Ashbel has been the Political Advisor to the [[Knesset]] (Israel's Parliament). From September 2011 to April 2016 Dan Ashbel served as Israel's Ambassador to Finland and Estonia.

[[File:Chikmagalur, India. (7793309142).jpg|thumbnail|Dirt Road in [[Chikmagalur]], India. ]]
[[File:DirtRoadCows.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cattle]] on a dirt road in [[Paraguay]].]]

A '''[[dirt]] road''' or '''track''' is a type of [[unpaved]] [[road]] made from the native material of the land surface through which it passes, known to highway engineers as [[subgrade]] material. Dirt roads are suitable for [[vehicle]]s; a [[Trail|narrower path]] for pedestrians, animals, and possibly small vehicles would be called a '''dirt track'''&amp;mdash;the distinction is not well-defined. Unpaved roads with a harder surface made by the addition of material such as [[gravel]] and [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] (stones), might be referred to as dirt roads in common usage but are distinguished as improved roads by highway engineers. (Improved unpaved roads include [[gravel road]]s, [[Gravel road#Laterite and murram roads|laterite roads, murram roads]] and [[macadam]]ized roads.) 

Compared to a gravel road, a dirt road is not usually [[Land grading|graded]] regularly to produce an enhanced [[Wiktionary:camber|camber]] to encourage rainwater to drain off the road, and drainage ditches at the sides may be absent. They are unlikely to have [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]]s through low-lying areas. This leads to greater waterlogging and erosion, and after heavy rain the road may be impassable even to [[off-road vehicle]]s. For this reason, in some countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], they are known as ''dry-weather roads''.


Dirt roads take on different characteristics according to the [[soil]]s and [[geology]] where they pass, and may be sandy, stony, rocky or have a bare earth surface, which could be extremely muddy and slippery when wet, and baked hard when dry. They are likely to become impassable after rain. They are common in [[rural area]]s of many countries, often very narrow and infrequently used, and are also found in [[metropolitan area]]s of many developing countries, where they may also be used as major highways and have considerable width.

Terms similar to '''dirt road''' are ''dry-weather road'', ''earth road'', or the "Class Four Highway" designation used in the [[People's Republic of China]]. A ''track'', ''dirt track'', or ''earth track'' would normally be similar but less suitable for larger vehicles.

==Driving on dirt roads==
While most gravel roads are all-weather roads and can be used by ordinary [[car]]s, dirt roads may only be passable by [[truck]]s or [[four-wheel drive]] [[vehicle]]s, especially in wet weather, or on rocky or very sandy sections. It is as easy to become bogged in sand as it is in mud; a high clearance under the vehicle may be required for rocky sections.

Driving on dirt roads requires great attention to variations in the surface and it is easier to lose control than on a gravel road. In addition to the hazards already mentioned, and potholes, ruts and ridges, problems associated with driving on gravel roads include:

*sharper and larger stones cutting and puncturing tires, or being thrown up by the wheels and damaging the underside, especially puncturing the [[fuel tank]] if not shielded
*stones skipping up hitting the car body, lights or [[windshield]]s when two vehicles pass each other 
*dust thrown up from a passing vehicle reducing visibility 
*'[[Washboarding|washboard]]' corrugations cause loss of control or damage to vehicle systems such as [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and [[steering]] 
*Skidding (loss of [[traction (engineering)|traction]]) on mud after rain.

===Laterite and murram roads===
In [[Africa]], parts of [[Asia]], and parts of [[Americas|America]], [[laterite]] soils are used to build dirt roads. However laterite,  called ''murram'' in [[East Africa]], varies considerably to earth and sand.  It ranges from a hard [[gravel]] to a softer earth embedded with small stones.  Not all laterite and murram roads are therefore strictly gravel roads.  Laterite and murram which contains a significant proportion of clay becomes very slippery when wet, and in the rainy season, it may be difficult even for [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles to avoid slipping off very [[Wiktionary:camber|cambered]] roads into the drainage ditches at the side of the road.  As it dries out, such laterite can become very hard, like [[sun-dried brick]]s.

[[Image:Eastern higlands fromnyanga.jpg|thumb|300px|Northern part of the Eastern Highlands range as seen from Nyanga town.]]

The '''Eastern or 'East African Highlands'''' is a [[mountain range]] in the east of [[Zimbabwe]] and one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. It extends for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} along Zimbabwe's eastern border with [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="EnZim"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range comprises three main mountain groups - [[Nyanga, Zimbabwe|Nyanga]] (to the north) which contains Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]], [[Africa]]'s second-longest waterfall [[Mutarazi Falls]] and the [[Honde Valley]] which leads into Mozambique; [[Bvumba]] Mountains (centrally situated near the city of [[Mutare]]); and [[Chimanimani]] (to the south). These regions are all sparsely populated, highland country and are covered in rich grassland and forests.&lt;ref name="EnZim" /&gt;

The Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains, which form the watershed between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East African Highlands''' physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]n physiographic provinces, so are part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]] and share many common plant and animal habitats with other mountain areas in the east of the continent.

==Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic==
The Higlands are home to the '''Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic''' [[ecoregion]]. The ecoregion includes the portion of the Higlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Highlands, Vumba Highlands, Chimanimani Mountains, Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Much of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.

In the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.

==Fauna==
This variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the Highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' the Samango [[Sykes' monkey]], [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highlands are also rich in birdlife&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996&lt;/ref&gt; including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts’s warbler inhabits the forest edge. &lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.

==Threats and preservation==
The mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. Large areas of the Highlands are protected, including the 171km2 [[Chimanimani National Park]] and [[Nyanga National Park]].

The '''European green infrastructure''' is an important part of the new (post-2010) EU strategy for [[biodiversity]] and biodiversity policy.

It is one of the main tools to tackle threats on biodiversity resulting from [[habitat fragmentation]], land use change and loss of habitats.
Green Infrastructure will play a decisive role in integrating biodiversity into other policies, such as agriculture, forestry, water, marine and fisheries, regional and cohesion policy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, transport, energy and land use policy. It is also an important tool for existing Directives such as the [[Water Framework Directive]], the Marine Framework Directive, [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] and Strategic Environment Assessment Directives.

In addition, particular attention will be given to strengthening the integration of green infrastructure aspects in the EU’s various funding programmes (e.g. structural and cohesion funds, CAP, LIFE) over the current and future financial programming period starting in 2013 and to improving the ecological coherence of the [[Natura 2000]] Network.

==Planning approach==
...

==GIS applications==
The continued development of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) and their increasing level of use is particularly important in the development of Green Infrastructure plans. The plans frequently are based on GIS analysis of many layers of geographic information.

'''GeoSpy''' is an outdoor recreational activity which combines geographic locations and maps with [[photography]] in a location-based game. To play the game requires a camera and a mobile [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planettechnews.com/online/geospy-org-a-new-outdoor-game-for-photographers-and-travelers |title=www.planettechnews.com |publisher=[[PlanetTech]] |date= |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several goals in the game, but the primary one is to find and create objects through pictures of objects and places which are uploaded to the game's website.

To create an object the participant requires a complete knowledge about the object, and the GPS coordinates and photos of the object that the participant has taken. Similarly, existing objects can be secured by visiting and photographing the object and posting the photo on the game’s website as proof that the competitor visited the object. The objects are divided into different categories namely Civil, Religious &amp; Historical, Natural, Technical and Military objects with further sub-categories such as hospitals, museums, factories, memorials, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techgreet.com/geospy-an-interactive-browser-game/ |title=TechGreet.com |publisher=www.techgreet.com |date= |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the game are called spies.

'''Guzgan''' ('''Guzganan''' or '''Quzghan''', in Arabic '''Juzjan''' or '''Juzjanan''') is the name of a [[historical region]] and early medieval principality in what is now northern [[Afghanistan]].

The area was known as "Guzgan" or in the plural form "Guzganan", whence Arabic "Juzjan"/"Juzjanan". Orientalist [[Vladimir Minorsky]] derived the name from a word meaning "[[walnut]]", a product for which the area is still known today. The 19th-century scholar [[Henry George Raverty]] suggested that the plural form emerged from the division of the country in two parts by the river [[Murghab River|Murghab]].{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=8 (note 11)}}

The boundaries of Guzgan were never well defined and fluctuated wildly over time. They certainly bear no relation to the modern administrative boundaries of [[Jowzjan Province]], named after it, or the neighbouring [[Faryab Province]], but historically included the lands around the towns of [[Maymana]] (capital of Faryab province), [[Andkhuy]], [[Shibarghan]] (capital of Jowzjan Province) and [[Sar-e Pol, Afghanistan|Sar-e Pol]] (capital of the [[Sar-e Pol Province|namesake province]]).{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=8 (note 11)}}{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}} Lying on the transition zone between the [[Central Asia]]n [[steppes]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]], the region was characterized by a mixture of sedentary, urban populations in the fertile river valleys, alongside [[nomad]] tribes engaged in [[pastoralism]], which is singled out as the region's main source of wealth by medieval geographers.{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}} Its location also meant that it was often used as a route for armies marching to and from Iran to Central Asia.{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}}

In the early 7th century, the region of Guzgan was counted as part of [[Tokharistan]]. As attested by legal documents that have tentatively been dated to the late 7th and early 8th century, the area was controlled by a local family that used the country Gozgan as the dynastic name, a custom of the era.{{sfn|Sims-Williams|2001|p=9}} Several are named, including Zhulad Gozgan, and Skag Gozgan, presumably one of his successors.{{sfn|Sims-Williams|2001|p=9}}

Guzgan was conquered by the [[Arabs]] under [[al-Ahnaf ibn Qays]] in 653/4, as part of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}} In 737, the area was the site of the decisive [[Battle of Kharistan]] between the Arabs under [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]], and the [[Turgesh]] under the ''[[khagan]]'' [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]].{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}} In 743, the [[Alid]] Yahya ibn Zayd, son of [[Zayd ibn Ali]], rose in revolt but was defeated and killed at Guzgan by the [[Umayyad]] governor, [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]]. His tomb was later a site of pilgrimage.{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}}{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=11}} In [[Abbasid]] times, the local governor resided in Anbar, possibly modern Sar-e Pol, but other accounts mention Shibarghan as the capital, and the geographers [[al-Muqaddasi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] considered al-Yahudiyya (modern Maynama) as the capital.{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}}

Despite the Arab conquest, a native dynasty, the [[Farighunids]], who claimed descent from the Persian mythological hero [[Faridun]] and bore the title of ''Guzgan-Khudha'', continued to rule from their capital, [[Kundurm]].{{sfn|Hartmann|1965|p=608}}{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=12}} They became vassals of the [[Samanids]] and then of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], one of whose daughters married the Farighunid emir Abu'l-Abbas Ma'mun Farighun. The latter was assassinated by his own troops in 1016, however, and Mahmud gave rule of the region to his chamberlain, [[Yalangtush]].{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=12}} The Farighunids were notable as patrons of the arts and literature; the most notable product of their court is the anonymous geographical work ''[[Hudud ul-'alam min al-mashriq ila al-maghrib]]''.{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=8 (note 11)}}&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Minorsky, Vasiliĭ Vladimirovich Bartolʹd, Clifford Edmund Bosworth.

[[File:Rosa 3465.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Peace (rose)|''Rosa'' {{tdes|Peace}}]]]]

'''Hybrid tea''' is an informal horticultural classification for a group of [[garden roses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Classification of genera |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/rhsplantfinder/plantnaming/classgenera.asp |accessdate=2012-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013959/http://apps.rhs.org.uk/rhsplantfinder/plantnaming/classgenera.asp |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by cross-breeding two types of roses, initially by hybridising [[Garden roses#Hybrid perpetual|hybrid perpetuals]] with [[Garden roses#Tea|tea rose]]s. It is the oldest group classified as a ''modern garden rose''.

Hybrid teas exhibit traits midway between both parents, being hardier than the often quite tender teas (although not as hardy as the hybrid perpetuals), and more inclined to [[remontancy|repeat-flowering]] than the somewhat misleadingly-named hybrid perpetuals (if not quite as ever-blooming as the teas). 

Hybrid tea flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, supported by long, straight and upright stems. Each flower can grow to 8–12.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Hybrid teas are the world's most popular type of rose&lt;ref&gt;[[D.G. Hessayon]]. ''The Rose Expert''. Mohn Media Mohndrunk. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; by choice due to their color and flower form. Their flowers are usually borne singly at the end of long stems which makes them popular as [[cut flowers]]. 

Most hybrid tea bushes tend to be somewhat upright in habit, and reach between 0.75 and 2.0 metres in height, depending on the cultivar, growing conditions and pruning regime. It is the provincial flower of Islamabad capital territory.

==History==
[[File:Rosa 'Mme Caroline Testout'.jpg|thumb|'Madame Caroline Testout']]
[[File:Rosa 'Soleil d'or2'.jpg|thumb|'Soleil d'Or']]
The birth of the world's first hybrid tea is generally accepted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosegathering.com/lafrance.html|title=La France: Hybrid Tea Rose|accessdate=2009-09-18|publisher=RoseGathering.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been [[Rosa 'La France'|'La France']] in 1867. It was raised by [[Jean-Baptiste André Guillot]], a French nurseryman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmefind.com/rose/bd.php?n=1041|title=Guillot|publisher=HelpMeFind.com|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did it by hybridising a tea rose, supposedly 'Madame Bravy', with a hybrid perpetual, supposedly 'Madame Victor Verdier', hence "hybrid tea".

Other early cultivars were 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam' (Bennett 1883), 'Souvenir of Wootton' (John Cook 1888) and 'Mme. Caroline Testout', introduced by Pernet-Ducher in 1890.

Hybrid tea roses did not become popular until the beginning of the 20th century, when Pernet-Ducher in Lyons, France, bred the cultivar 'Soleil d'Or' (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[[D.G. Hessayon]], ''The Rose Expert'', Mohn Media Mohndrunk, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
But the cultivar that made hybrid teas the most popular class of garden rose of the 20th century was the rose [[Rosa 'Peace'|{{tdes|Peace}}]] ('Madame A. Meilland'), introduced by [[Meilland International SA|Francis Meilland]] at the end of World War II, and one of the most popular rose cultivars of the 20th century. 

Michele Meilland Richardier cultivated a hybrid tea which had double flowers, with a coral inside and a yellow and pink outside. It was said to last very well when cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Autumn|first1=Stanley|title=Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Technology|date=October 1, 1995|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813521971|pages=37–38|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRJt7QqA7GEC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Michele+Meilland+Richardier+rose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l5tiHfjrae&amp;sig=EaghCrKJ-9XWkmmI0sBpxCrSZAw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kxyKVLymF5HxoASeyIGoDg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rose was classified as being part of the meilimona variety. The patent was filed on October 14, 1975 and was issued February 1, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents by Inventor Michele Meilland Richardier|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/michele-meilland-richardier|website=Justia Patents|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most hybrid tea cultivars are not fully hardy in continental areas with very cold winters (below −25&amp;nbsp;°C). This, combined with their tendency to be stiffly upright, sparsely foliaged and often not resistant to diseases, has led to a decline in hybrid tea popularity among gardeners and landscapers in favor of lower-maintenance "landscape" roses.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The hybrid tea remains the standard rose of the floral industry, however, and is still favored in small gardens in formal situations.

==Propagation==
This is usually done by [[Budding#Plant multiplication|budding]], a technique that involves grafting buds from a parent plant onto strongly growing [[rootstock]]s. One such rootstock is ''R. multiflora''.

Hybrid tea cultivars bred in continental areas (e.g. Canada) tend to be hardier than those hailing from more maritime regions (e.g. New Zealand).

==Examples==
[[File:Hybrid tea double delight.jpg|thumb|'Double Delight' hybrid tea]]
A very large number of hybrid tea [[cultivar]]s have been introduced by breeders over the years; some notable examples include [[Rosa 'Chrysler Imperial'|'Chrysler Imperial']], [[Rosa 'Double Delight'|'Double Delight']], [[Rosa 'Elina'|'Elina']], 'Fragrant Cloud', [[Rosa 'Mister Lincoln'|'Mister Lincoln']], [[Peace (rose)|{{tdes|Peace}}]] and [[Rosa 'Precious Platinum'|'Precious Platinum']].

'''ISO 3166-2:HT''' is the entry for [[Haiti]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Haiti, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[departments of Haiti|10 departments]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|HT}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Haiti. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative languages]]:
* (fr): [[French language|French]]
* (ht): [[Haitian Creole]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">'''Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy (IPSS)''' is a Passive Seismic Low Frequency technique used for mapping potential oil and gas hydrocarbon accumulations.

It is part of the geophysical techniques also known under the generic naming [[passive seismic]] which includes also the [[Seismic tomography|Passive Seismic Tomography]] and Micro Seismic Monitoring for petroleum, gas and geothermal applications. In a larger scale, Passive Seismic includes the [[IRIS Consortium|Global Seismic Network]] earthquakes monitoring (GSN).

Regarding petroleum and geothermal exploration (within a small scale), effect of fluid distribution on P- wave propagation in partially saturated rocks is the main responsible for the low frequency reservoir-related [http://www.pgexploration.com/resources/publications/ wavefield absorption].
 
The high level of attenuation, within the infrasonic bandwidth (below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz) of the seismic field observed in natural oil-saturated porous media during the last years (successfully explained by [https://books.google.it/books?id=_TkPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=mesoscopic+homogeneous+seismic+models&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJtCq_D0ip&amp;sig=uPNi3LY5j98O84W-7Sdntefr0sU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXuKqmqazXAhVPahoKHbHdBsAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoscopic%20homogeneous%20seismic%20models&amp;f=false mesoscopic homogeneous models]) is the main responsible of the passive seismic wave field shifting within a low frequency range.
 
Pressure differences between regions with different fluid/solid properties induce frequency-dependency of the attenuation (Qp and Qs reservoir factors) and velocity dispersion (Vp, Vs) of the low frequency wave field.

Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy techniques quantifies then the absorption and the wave field dispersion within the low frequency bandwidth giving the most predominant areas linked with possible oil-saturated and porous media.

The low frequency seismic field is not usually reachable by the active seismic surveys being either the explosive waves mainly in the high frequency and the vibroseis currently built not to reach such a low frequencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2190">'''Jean Palairet''' (1697–1774) was a French cartographer.

==Life==
Jean Palairet was born in [[Montauban]], but emigrated to [[England]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Eugene Horvath|title=A Canadian collection of Hungarica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MXfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=J.E.

While working as London agent for [[Jacob Boreel]], Palairet apparently played a part in introducing the game of [[cricket]] to the [[Netherlands]]: in 1765 he sent four balls and 12 bats to the Netherlands, and attempted to find a copy of a rule-book for the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalgardensblog.com/2009/06/06/cricket-on-beeckestijn/ Cricket on Beeckestijn], 6 June 2009.

'''Josué de Castro''', born Josué Apolônio de Castro (5 September 1908 in [[Recife]] – 24 September 1973 in [[Paris]]), was a Brazilian physician, expert on nutrition, geographer, writer, public administrator, and activist against world [[hunger]].

His book ''Geopolitics of Hunger'' was granted with The Franklin D. Roosevelt Foundation Award, in 1952. Two years later, he received the [[World Peace Council prizes|International Peace Prize]]. 

He taught at the University of Brazil (today's [[UFRJ]]) and was chairman of the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] ([[FAO]]). He was also a member of the Brazilian parliament and a diplomat. His political rights came to an end with the military coup of 1964, when he moved to France. For many years he was president of the ''Association Médicale Internationale pour l’Etude des Conditions de Vie et de Santé'' and member of other international organizations. He taught at [[Paris 8 University]] until his death.

==Main Works==
===The Geography of Hunger===
Ground-breaking ecological work about the political issue of hunger in Brazil. Published in 1946, the book emphasizes the socio-economic backgrounds of the biological manifestation of hunger and condemns the physical determinism.&lt;ref&gt;CASTRO, Josué de. ''Geografia da fome''. Rio de Janeiro: O Cruzeiro, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Geopolitics of Hunger===
Originally published in the U.S. with the title "The Geography of Hunger" in 1952, translated into 26 languages, is one of the classic works on food and population. His themes are very much the opposite of those sounded by the neo-Malthusians. He does not believe that hunger is the "natural result of overpopulation," but is rather a man-made phenomenon. Even more, he undertakes to demonstrate that hunger, rather than being the result of overpopulation, is the cause of it. The work presented new formulations for underdevelopment, and was granted with The Franklin D. Roosevelt Foundation Award.&lt;ref&gt;CASTRO, Josué de. ''Geopolítica da fome''. Rio de Janeiro: Casa do Estudante do Brasil, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death in the Northeast===
A book that aims to strike the interest for the Northeast Brazilian people’s situation. Written before military coup of 1964, and published during the military dictatorship, it clarifies the political turmoil and explosive tensions around the Brazilian agrarian system, established by feudalist Portuguese colonizers.&lt;ref&gt;CASTRO, Josué de. ''Sete palmos de terra e um caixão''. S. Paulo: Brasiliense, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of Men and Crabs===
Exiled at Paris, he wrote about the scene of his childhood.

The legal status of [[bitcoin]] (and related crypto instruments) varies substantially from state to state and is still undefined or changing in many of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042248 Assessing the Differences in Bitcoin &amp; Other Cryptocurrency Legality Across National Jurisdictions] ''Information Systems &amp; Economics eJournal.'' Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 25 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/coinmonks/cryptos-big-legal-problems-63b760385fea Crypto's Biggest Legal Problems] ''Crypto Law Review.'' Accessed 25 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;   

While some states have ''explicitly'' allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin, regulations and bans that apply to this [[cryptocurrency]] likely extend to similar systems as well.

The European Union has passed no specific legislation relative to the status of bitcoin as a currency, but has stated that VAT/GST is not applicable to the conversion between traditional (fiat) currency and bitcoin.

VAT/GST and other taxes (such as income tax) still apply to transactions made using bitcoins for goods and services. {{r|"regulation"|page=European Union}}

In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The exchange of traditional currencies for units of the 'bitcoin' virtual currency is exempt from VAT" and that "Member States must exempt, inter alia, transactions relating to 'currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender{{'"}}, making bitcoin a currency as opposed to being a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The exchange of traditional currencies for units of the ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency is exempt from VAT|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150128en.pdf|publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bitcoin currency exchange not liable for VAT taxes: top EU court|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/22/us-bitcoin-tax-eu-idUSKCN0SG0X920151022|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=Reuters|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to judges, the tax should not be charged because bitcoins should be treated as a means of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bodoni|first1=Stephanie|last2=Thomson|first2=Amy|title=EU's Top Court Rules That Bitcoin Exchange Is Tax-Free|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/bitcoin-virtual-currency-exchange-is-tax-free-eu-court-says-ig21wzcd|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=BloombergBusiness|agency=Bloomberg|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[European Central Bank]], traditional financial sector regulation is not applicable to bitcoin because it does not involve traditional financial actors.&lt;ref name=ECB&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Currency Schemes|date=October 2012|publisher=European Central Bank|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-92-899-0862-7|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|format=PDF|author=European Central Bank|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Others in the EU have stated, however, that existing rules can be extended to include bitcoin and bitcoin companies.{{r|"EUPARANNEX"}}

The European Central Bank classifies bitcoin as a convertible decentralized virtual currency.&lt;ref name="ECB" /&gt;{{rp|6}} In July 2014 the [[European Banking Authority]] advised European banks not to deal in virtual currencies such as bitcoin until a regulatory regime was in place.&lt;ref name=EBA&gt;{{cite web|title=EBA Opinion on 'virtual currencies'|url=http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/657547/EBA-Op-2014-08+Opinion+on+Virtual+Currencies.pdf|publisher=European Banking Authority|accessdate=8 July 2014|pages=46|format=pdf|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the European Parliament's proposal to set up a taskforce to monitor virtual currencies to combat money laundering and terrorism, passed by 542 votes to 51, with 11 abstentions, has been sent to the European Commission for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160524IPR28821/meps-call-for-virtual-currency-watchdog-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorism&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission also notably presented a "parallel" proposal aimed at preventing tax evasion techniques as revealed in the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coindesk.com/european-union-proposes-tighter-bitcoin-controls-panama-papers-response/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it was revealed that the proposal will require cryptocurrency exchanges and [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s to identify suspicious activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/the-european-union-wants-to-identify-bitcoin-users/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[G7]]'s [[Financial Action Task Force]] issued the following statement in guidelines which may be applicable to companies involved in transmitting bitcoin and other currencies, "Internet-based payment services that allow third party funding from anonymous sources may face an increased risk of [money laundering/terrorist financing]." They concluded that this may "pose challenges to countries in [anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing] regulation and supervision".&lt;ref name=fatf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-RBA-NPPS.pdf|title=Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Prepaid Cards, Mobile Payments and Internet-based Payment Services|work=Guidance for a risk-based approach|publisher=Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|accessdate=6 March 2014|location=Paris|page=47|format=PDF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 17 January 2017, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has passed a circular to inform all Nigerian banks that bank transactions in bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.naij.com/1083244-central-bank-nigeria-bans-transaction-bitcoins-onecoin-others.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the year, the CBN (through its Deputy Director on Banking and Payments System, Musa Itopa-Jimoh) clarified the circular and its stance on bitcoin, citing that a lot of people misinterpret the central bank’s recent warning. It noted that  "Central bank cannot control or regulate bitcoin. Central bank cannot control or regulate blockchain. Just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the Internet. We don’t own it".&lt;ref&gt;https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-says-we-cant-stop-bitcoin/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, a committee was set up by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) to look into the possibility of the country adopting the technology driving bitcoin and other digital currencies – blockchain. The committee has submitted its report but "several sub-committees are still working on the issue" according to the Director, Banking &amp; Payments System Department at CBN, Mr. ‘Dipo Fatokun.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.today.ng/technology/internet/2575/nigeria-adopted-bitcoin-technology-cbn&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies dealing in virtual currencies must register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (Fintrac), implement compliance programs, keep the required records, report suspicious or terrorist-related transactions, and determine if any of their customers are "politically exposed persons."

The law applies to non-Canadian virtual currency exchanges if they have Canadian customers. Banks may not open or maintain accounts or have a correspondent banking relationship with companies dealing in virtual currencies if that company is not registered with Fintrac.

Dealers in digital currency are regulated as money services businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/intro-eng.asp|title=Money services businesses (MSBs)|last=Canada|first=Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of|website=www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks complying with these new rules include [[Bangkok Bank]], [[SIAM Commercial Bank]] and [[Krungsri]].

On 29-6-2018 The SEC and Revenue Department of Thailand announced that Bitcoin trading would be subject to 15% Capital Gains Tax and 7% VAT. Exchanges would be required collect 15% Withholding and 7% VAT on all trades. This will require all customers of Bitcoin Exchanges to provide purchase price information to the Exchange, who will be required to track and report all trades. This announcement has the potential to a) Make regulated exchanges unprofitable b) Move trading in Thailand to exchanges that have not registered and are prepared to run the risks associated this not registering c) Move Bitcoin buy/sell business to LocalBitcoins.com, unregulated and unregistered individual traders that do not follow KYC rules. Because the approach of the SEC and Revenue Department is to invite companies to register, but are still unclear on the logistics of collecting taxes, anyone registering takes on significant risk if the Revenue Department decides to change the rules and backdate the changes. Note: The Revenue Department will not allow trade losses to be offset against profits.

They added that trading virtual currencies in Poland does not violate national or EU law, however, having virtual "currencies", involves many risks: (1) risk related to the possibility of loss of funds due to theft, (2) risk related to lack of guarantee, (3) risk of lack of universal acceptability, (4) risk related to the possibility of fraud, (5) risk of high price change. Because of these risks, the NBP and KNF warn against buying virtual currencies and investing in them. The NBP and KNF recognize that the purchase, possession and sale of virtual currencies by entities supervised by the KNF (e.g. banks) would be burdened with high risk and would not ensure a stable and prudent management of the financial institution. Financial institutions should be cautious about engaging and cooperating with virtual currency "trading" entities.

The [[Swedish Tax Agency]] has given a preliminary ruling on Value Added Tax (VAT) on bitcoins, stating that trade in bitcoins is not subject to Swedish VAT, but is instead subject to the Finansinspektionen (Financial Supervisory Authority) regulations and treated as a currency. The decision has been appealed by the Swedish Tax Authority.{{r|"regulation"|page=Sweden}}

The Swedish jurisdiction is in general quite favorable for bitcoin businesses and users as compared to other countries within the EU and the rest of the world. The governmental regulatory and supervisory body [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden)|Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority]] (Finansinspektionen) have legitimized the fast growing industry by publicly proclaiming bitcoin and other digital currencies as a means of payment. For certain businesses interacting with [[fiat money|fiat]] (mainly exchanges) the current regulation dictates that an application for approval/license must be filed and all the AML/CTF and KYC regulations applicable to more traditional financial service providers must be followed.

{{As of|2017}}, the government of the United Kingdom has stated that bitcoin is unregulated and that it is treated as a 'foreign currency' for most purposes, including VAT/GST.{{r|"regulation"|page=United Kingdom}}

Bitcoin is treated as 'private money'.  When bitcoin is exchanged for sterling or for foreign currencies, such as euro or dollar, no VAT will be due on the value of the bitcoins themselves. However, in all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency. Profits and losses on cryptocurrencies are subject to [[Capital gains tax#United Kingdom|capital gains tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax treatment of activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/briefs/vat/brief0914.htm|publisher=HM Revenue &amp; Customs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art ==
* [[Early Renaissance]] - The world famous frescos in the [[Boyana Church]] from 1239 AD have been described by [[Andre Grabar]] and many scholars, as Early Renaissance or precursors of Renaissance Art well before this period started in Italy. The murals are work of the unknown Boyana Master and his disciples who are believed to have been representatives of the Tarnovo Art School in the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396 AD). The frescos have been compared to the work of [[Giotto]] who is generally considered the first in a line of great artists who contributed to the Italian Renaissance. The Boyana Church has been declared by [[UNESCO]] a [[World Heritage site]].

[[City of Belgrade|Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]] currently consists of 17 municipalities, 10 urban and 7 suburban, but after World War II, over 30 more municipalities were created, abolished and merged with each other.

[[File:Belgrade municipalities02.png|250px|right|thumb|Metropolitan area of the City of Belgrade (click to enlarge)]]

== Territorial changes ==

It took 27 years (from 1944 to 1971) to territorially shape the modern metropolitan area of the City of Belgrade. Even after 1971 some changes occurred, but due to the internal reorganization, leaving the outer borders of the area intact. Certain ideas of the enlarging further the metropolitan area appeared in the early 1990s but were not realized (see "Further expansion" below). Some of the most important changes include:

* after 1944 - Belgrade consisted of the City of Belgrade, which covered the urban area (divided into [[raion]]s), and the [[Zemun]] and [[Vračar]] districts (''srez''), which covered the suburban areas. As the city expanded, almost entire area of the Vračar District today also makes urban section.
* 1952 - Raions were abolished and the urban section was divided into municipalities.
* 1955 - City of Belgrade and parts of the Zemun, Vračar and [[Podunavlje]] districts merged into the new, Belgrade District. At this point, the area was enlarged to 2,090&amp;nbsp;km², followed by the creation of many new urban municipalities.
* 1957 - New reorganization of the municipalities which reduced their number by merger.
* 1960 - Another reorganization and abolition of some municipalities (including [[Rakovica, Belgrade|Rakovica]] which was annexed to [[Čukarica]]). Metropolitan area enlarged as many municipalities from the bordering districts were annexed to the Belgrade's municipalities.
* 1965 - Abolition of the municipalities of [[Surčin]] (annexed to Zemun) and [[Krnjača]] (annexed to [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]]), reducing number of municipalities to 13: [[Barajevo]], [[Čukarica]], [[Grocka]], [[Novi Beograd]], [[Obrenovac]], [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]], [[Savski Venac]], [[Sopot]], [[Stari Grad, Belgrade|Stari Grad]], [[Voždovac]], [[Vračar]], [[Zemun]] and [[Zvezdara]].
* 1971 - Fourteenth and fifteenth municipalities, [[Lazarevac]] and [[Mladenovac]], annexed to the City of Belgrade, shaping its present territory (3,222&amp;nbsp;km²).
* 1974 - Sixteenth municipality, [[Rakovica, Belgrade|Rakovica]], split from Čukarica.
* 2003 - Seventeenth municipality, [[Surčin]], split from Zemun.

== Former municipalities ==

The list deals with all the municipalities which existed on the territory of the modern City of Belgrade since 1945, regardless if they were administratively part of Belgrade during their existence or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= ''Mala Enciklopedija Prosveta'', First edition | date = 1959 | publisher = ''Prosveta'', Belgrade }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Oto Bihalji-Merin | title= ''Mala Enciklopedija Prosveta'', Fourth edition | date = 1986 | publisher = ''Prosveta'', Belgrade | ISBN = 86-07-00001-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jovan Đ.

== Proposed municipalities ==

With successful 2000-2002 campaigning for Surčin's split from the municipality of Zemun (proclaimed separate municipality on 24 November 2003, separate administration from November 3, 2004), several other motions for the creation of new municipalities appeared. Acting mayor of Belgrade [[Zoran Alimpić]] stated in November 2007 that probably no new municipalities will be created before 2011 or 2012.&lt;ref name=nove&gt;[[Politika]], November 4, 2007, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017 none have been created.

* [[Avalski Venac]] - a movement originated from 1996. A motion for the re-creation of the municipality of Ripanj appeared in 2002. It sought the split from the municipality of Voždovac of its distant, suburban settlements in the area of the Avala mountain: Ripanj, [[Beli Potok (Belgrade)|Beli Potok]], [[Pinosava]] and [[Zuce]].&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{Citation | author = Dejan Aleksić | title = Dug i skup put do novih opština | trans-title = Long and costly road to the new municipalities | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 8 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a motion for Vrčin's split from the municipality of Grocka and creation of a joint sub-Avalan municipality also appeared, but wasn't that much vocal. If created, the new municipality would have a population of 28,949 (2011).&lt;ref name=popis/&gt; In September 2007 an official motion was started by the municipality of Voždovac to create this new municipality, which would also include [[Resnik, Belgrade|Resnik]] from the municipality of Rakovica which would raise population to 52,332.&lt;ref name=popis/&gt;&lt;ref name=nove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Politika, 20 October 2007, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Politika, 29 October 2007, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; It was supported by the local administration headed by the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] at the time, but not by the members of the same party on the city level. It was also proposed by the political party [[G17 Plus]] in 2010&lt;ref name=kvart&gt;{{Citation | author = Slobodan Kljakić  | title = Od šest kvartova do sedamnaest opština | trans-title = From six quarters to seventeen municipalities | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 2 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nova Stranka in 2015.&lt;ref name=zivko&gt;{{cite web | url = https://novastranka.rs/politika-nove/predlog-programa-za-promenu-statuta-grada-beograda/ | author = Nova Stranka | title = Predlog izmene statute Beograda | trans-title = Proposition on change of the Belgrade statute | date = 21 January 2015 | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Batajnica]] - a movement was very active in 2002, when Surčin also campaigned, but wasn't that much in the public media. Proposed municipality of Batajnica would split from the municipality of Zemun and comprise Batajnica and [[Ugrinovci]] (with [[Busije]] and [[Grmovac]]), with a population of 43,660 in 2011.&lt;ref name=popis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; The notion was supported by G17 Plus in 2010&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt; and Nova Stranka in 2015.&lt;ref name=zivko/&gt;
* [[Bežanijska Kosa]] - separation from the municipality of New Belgrade, which is considered too large anyway.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; Combined population of Bežanijska Kosa, Bežanija and [[Ledine]] is 45,017 (2011).&lt;ref name=popis/&gt; Also proposed by G17 Plus in 2010.&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt;
* [[Dobanovci]] - a motion for splitting from Zemun ceased when Surčin split from Zemun in 2003.&lt;ref name=nove/&gt;
* [[Dunavski Venac]] - the most vocal of all movements, asking for the area on the left bank of the Danube to split from the municipality of Palilula and basically re-create the municipality of [[Krnjača]] (under the new name), abolished in 1965. In 2003 a petition signed by 17,000 inhabitants from the area was handed to the Belgrade City Assembly which, at the time, judged that conditions for creation of new municipality were not fulfilled. The movement continued gaining a momentum until in 2005 Municipal assembly of Palilula finally accepted to support the move but later decided the opposite so the organization of the establishment of the municipality of Dunavski Venac announced it will sue the municipality of Palilula. The proposed new municipality, if accepted and confirmed by the Belgrade City assembly, would have an area of 407&amp;nbsp;km² and a population of 86,841 (2011).&lt;ref name=nove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;&lt;ref name=popis/&gt; Supported by G17 Plus in 2010&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt; and Nova Stranka in 2015.&lt;ref name=zivko/&gt;
* [[Kaluđerica]] - distant from its municipal seat Grocka, and with the population of 26,904 in 2011 three times larger, Kaluđerica makes one urban area with Belgrade.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;&lt;ref name=popis/&gt; In 2010 G17 Plus proposed new municipality of Kaluđerica, which would also contain [[Leštane]].&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt; In 2015, Nova Stranka proposed the detachment of Kaluđerica into separate municipality.&lt;ref name=zivko/&gt;
* [[Mirijevo]] - a movement which gained momentum during the ongoing protest from the local population against construction of the power transformer in the center of the neighborhood. Municipality, which would have a population of  41,407 (2011 Census),&lt;ref name=popis&gt;{{cite book|title=Stanovništvo po opštinama i mesnim zajednicama, Popis 2011|date=23 April 2015|publisher=Grad Beograd – Sektor statistike (xls file)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprise the neighborhood of Mirijevo, should split from the municipality of Zvezdara. However, the idea is on hiatus at the moment.&lt;ref name=nove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;
* New Belgrade I and New Belgrade II - proposed division of New Belgrade in two municipalities. Proposed by G17 Plus in 2010.&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt;
* [[Posavski Venac]] - a movement began in 2006 for separation from the municipality of [[Čukarica]]. Basically, it soughts the re-creation of the former Umka municipality (that is, section that belongs to Čukarica). It should consist of Železnik, Rušanj, Sremčica, Umka, Velika Moštanica, Pećani, Rucka, Ostružnica and [[Makiš]], with a population of 61,590 in 2011.&lt;ref name=popis/&gt;&lt;ref name=nove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; Also proposed by G17 Plus in 2010.&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt;
* [[Sremčica]] - to split from the municipality of Čukarica, if not as a part of the Posavski Venac.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; It has a population of 21,001 in 2011.&lt;ref name=popis/&gt;
* [[Vinča]] - a motion, as a result of big economic and demographic discrepancy between the western and eastern parts of the municipality of Grocka, mentions Vinča as the possible seat of the future municipality formed from the western part of the municipality of Grocka, comprising also [[Kaluđerica]], [[Boleč]], [[Leštane]], and [[Ritopek]], with a population of 53,179 in 2011.&lt;ref name=popis/&gt;
* [[Žarkovo]] - proposed by Nova Stranka in 2015 to split from Čukarica.&lt;ref name=zivko/&gt;
* [[Železnik]] - proposed by Nova Stranka in 2015. Apart from the neighborhood of Železnik, it was to include all separate settlements in the municipality of Čukarica, making it equal to the proposed Posavski Venac municipality.&lt;ref name=zivko/&gt;

== Future changes ==

* [[Čenta]] - the village in the Vojvodina's municipality of [[Zrenjanin]] (population of 3,050 in 2011)&lt;ref name=popis2011&gt;{{cite book|title= Comparative overview of the number of population in 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2002 and 2011 – Data by settlements, page 29|date=2014|publisher= Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, Belgrade|isbn=978-86-6161-109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located on the northern border of the municipality of Palilula. Now and then, motions by the locals, not very vocal though, appear, asking for Čenta to be annexed to the City of Belgrade. Majority of population work on the territory of Belgrade and one regular bus line of the Belgrade City public transportation is connecting Čenta to Belgrade.
* [[Opovo]] - the municipality in Vojvodina with a population of 10,440 in 2011,&lt;ref name=popis2011/&gt; considered by the state government for the incorporation into the City of Belgrade in 1992.
* [[Pančevo]] - the municipality in Vojvodina with a population of 123,414 in 2011,&lt;ref name=popis2011/&gt; considered by the state government for the incorporation into the City of Belgrade in 1992. Though a city and large industrial center of its own (76,203 inhabitants in 2011), Pančevo already functions as de facto Belgrade's suburb: only 16 kilometer away from Belgrade, many people from Pančevo work in Belgrade with a very dense [[commuting]], including a railway line "[[Beovoz]]" (''Belgrade train'') which connects the two cities, and two cities also make an almost continuous built-up area as the Belgrade spawned along the road which connects them (the industrial zone of the Belgrade's neighborhood of Krnjača). During the 1929-1941 period in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Pančevo, together with Belgrade and Zemun formed the Area of the City of Belgrade, official administrative entity within the kingdom. In 1957 idea of establishing [[trolleybus]] line Pančevo-Belgrade appeared in connection with future development of Pančevo industrial zone, but was dropped later.&lt;ref&gt;Politika, 1 November 2007, p.27 (reprint from 1957 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stara Pazova]] - the municipality in Vojvodina with a population of 65,792 in 2011,&lt;ref name=popis2011/&gt; it was one of the fastest growing in the province. Not officially considered for incorporation into the Belgrade, being on the outskirts of the city's metropolitan area, just like Pančevo, gravitates toward Belgrade. A [[commuter rail]]way line "Beovoz" connects Stara Pazova, Belgrade and Pančevo and some of the largest settlements in the municipality, like [[Nova Pazova]] or [[Novi Banovci]], almost make one continuous built-up area with the Belgrade's extreme north-western extension of Batajnica in the municipality of Zemun.

Expansion of the metropolitan area of Belgrade was actual in the 1991-1992 when a new territorial reorganization was prepared for the entire Serbia. The government of [[Radoman Božović]] proposed the detachment of the municipality of Mladenovac, for example, but also the incorporation of the municipalities of the province of [[Vojvodina]] ([[Opovo]] and [[Pančevo]]) into Belgrade. A new map, with such borders was even printed in the [[daily newspaper]] of [[Večernje novosti]] at the time, but in the end the borders remained unchanged.

In an interview in April 2008, regarding the upcoming [[general elections]], jointly with the local and provincial as well, former [[mayor of Belgrade]] in 2000-2001 period, [[Milan St. Protić]] stated that rural municipalities (like Obrenovac and Mladenovac) should be detached from Belgrade as they can't funcion efficiently as part of urban agglomeration.&lt;ref&gt;Politika, 20 April 2008, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, political party [[G17 Plus]], which was part of the ruling coalition in the city, proposed a new division with 24 municipalities. New proposed 7 municipalities were Avalski Venac, Batajnica, Bežanijska Kosa, Dunavski Venac, Kaluđerica (including Leštane), New Belgrade I and II (division of present municipality in two) and Posavski Venac.&lt;ref name=kvart/&gt; "Nova stranka", a political party formed by the former prime minister [[Zoran Živković (politician)|Zoran Živković]], proposed a new administrative division in the late 2015, which was to exclude the municipalities of Lazarevac, Obrenovac and Mladenovac from the City of Belgrade,&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; and creation of new urban municipalities: Avalski Venac, Batajnica, Dunavski Venac, Kaluđerica, Žarkovo and Železnik.&lt;ref name=zivko/&gt;

After the change in city government in 2014, a commission for the change of the City Statute was formed. It was announced in 2015 and 2016 that the new statute will also deal with the administrative division, return of the division of the municipalities within the city on urban and suburban, change in the municipal jurisdiction, etc., but as of October 2017 nothing changed. In October 2017, Belgrade's Administrative secretariat disclosed that the notions for Dunavski Venac, Avalski Venac and Kaluđerica were applied, but that all three were in a discord with the City Statute.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10541">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in the Cayman Islands'''. There are the mammal species in the [[Cayman Islands]], of which one is believed to be threatened.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.

===Infraclass: [[Eutheria]]===

====Order: [[Chiroptera]] (bats)====
----
The bats' most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in the world naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.

====Order: [[Rodent]]ia (Rodents)====
----
[[Image:Dasyprocta punctata guatemala 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Central American agouti]]]]
'''Rodentia''' is an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[mammal]]s  characterised by two continuously growing [[Incisors#The Rodent incisor|incisors]] in the upper and lower jaws which must be kept short by gnawing.&lt;ref name="rodent-encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | title = rodent - Encyclopedia.com | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-rodent.html | accessdate = 2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rodents: Gnawing Animals | url = http://www.kidport.com/RefLib/Science/Animals/Rodents.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forty percent of mammal species are rodents, and they are found in vast numbers on all continents other than [[Antarctica]].  Rodents have sharp incisors that they use to gnaw wood, break into food, and bite predators. Most eat seeds or plants, though some have more varied diets. Some species have historically been [[Pest (organism)|pests]], eating seeds stored by people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Leirs H |title=The Year of the Rat ends: time to fight hunger!|journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=65 |issue=4 |year=2009 |doi=10.1002/ps.1718 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121686000/abstract |pmid=19206089 |pages=351–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spreading disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A |title=Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol|volume=35 |issue=3|year=2009|doi=10.1080/10408410902989837|url=http://www.informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408410902989837 |pmid=19548807 |pages=221–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from the [[Latin]] word ''rodens'', "gnawing one" (from the verb ''rodere'', "gnaw").

In terms of number of [[species]]—although not necessarily in terms of number of organisms (population) or [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]—rodents make up the largest order of mammals. There are about 2,277 [[species]] of rodents (Wilson and Reeder, 2005), with over 40 percent of mammalian species belonging to the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Myers |first= Phil |year=2000 |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rodentia.html |title=Rodentia |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate= 2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central American agouti]] has been introduced to the Cayman Islands, and are found in forests, thick brush, savannas, and cultivated areas.

Because of [[Germany]]'s geographic position in the centre of Europe, as well as its long history as a non-united region of distinct tribes and states, there are many widely varying '''names of Germany''' in different languages, perhaps more so than for any other European nation. For example, the German language, the country is known as {{lang|de|Deutschland}}, in Spanish as {{lang|es|Alemania}}, in French as {{lang|fr|Allemagne}}, in Italian as {{lang|it|Germania}} (although Germans are called {{lang|it|tedeschi}}), in Polish as {{lang|pl|Niemcy}}, and in Finnish as {{lang|fi|Saksa}}.

==Names from Diutisc==
{{Further|Theodiscus}}
[[File:Schild-Deutsche Botschaft.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Official German-language plaque of a German embassy]]
[[File:Sachsenspiegel die wahl des deutschen Königs.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The German princes choose their king (Illustration in the [[Sachsenspiegel]]) ]]

The name ''Deutschland'' and the other similar-sounding names above are derived from the [[Old High German]] ''[[diutisc]]'', or similar variants from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Þeudiskaz'', which originally meant "of the people". This in turn comes from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word meaning "folk" (leading to [[Old High German]] ''diot'', [[Middle High German]] ''diet''), and was used to differentiate between the speakers of Germanic languages and those who spoke [[Celtic language|Celtic]] or [[Romance language]]s. These words come from *''teuta'', the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for "people" ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''tauta'', [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''tuath'', [[Old English language|Old English]] ''þeod'').

Also the [[Italian language|Italian]] for "German", ''tedesco'' (local or archaic variants: ''todesco'', ''tudesco'', ''todisco''), comes from the same [[Old High German]] root, although not the name for "Germany" (''Germania''). Also in the standardised [[Romansh language|Romansh]] language ''Germania'' is the normal name for Germany but in [[Sursilvan]], [[Sutsilvan]] and [[Surmiran]] it is commonly referred to as ''Tiaratudestga'', ''Tearatudestga'' and ''Tera tudestga'' respectively, with ''tiara/teara/tera'' meaning ''land''. French words ''thiois'', ''tudesque'', ''théotisque'' and ''Thiogne'' and Spanish ''tudesco'' share this etymology.

The Germanic language which ''diutisc'' most likely comes from is West Frankish, a language which died out a long time ago and which there is hardly any written evidence for today. This was the Germanic dialect used in the early [[Middle Ages]], spoken by the [[Franks]] in [[Western Francia]], i.e. in the region which is now northern [[France]]. The word is only known from the Latin form ''[[theodiscus]]''. Until the 8th century the Franks called their language ''frengisk''; however, when the Franks moved their political and cultural centre to the area where France now is, the term ''frengisk'' became ambiguous, as in the West Francian territory some Franks spoke Latin, some [[vulgar Latin]] and some ''theodisc''. For this reason a new word was needed to help differentiate between them. Thus the word ''theodisc'' evolved from the Germanic word ''theoda'' (the people) with the Latin [[suffix]] ''-iscus'', to mean "belonging to the people", i.e. the people's language.

In [[Eastern Francia]], roughly the area where Germany now is, it seems that the new word was taken on by the people only slowly, over the centuries: in central Eastern Francia the word ''frengisk'' was used for a lot longer, as there was no need for people to distinguish themselves from the distant Franks. The word ''diutsch'' and other variants were only used by people to describe themselves, at first as an alternative term, from about the 10th century. It was used, for example, in the [[Sachsenspiegel]], a legal code, written in Middle Low German in about 1220: '' Iewelk düdesch'' ''lant hevet sinen palenzgreven: sassen, beieren, vranken unde svaven''
(Every German land has its [[Graf]]: Saxony, Bavaria, Franken and Swabia).

The [[Teutoni]], a tribe with a name which probably came from the same root, did, through [[Latin]], ultimately give birth to the English words "Teuton" (first found in 1530) for the adjective German, (as in the [[Teutonic Knights]], a military religious order, and the Teutonic Cross) and "Teuton" (noun), attested from 1833. "Teuton" was also used for ''Teutonisch Land'' (land of the [[Teutons]]), it's abbreviation ''Teutschland'' used in some areas until the 19th century and it's currently used official variation ''Deutschland''.

In the northern French language area (northern France, [[Belgium]]), the neighboring Germanic dialects, areas and inhabitants of Flanders to Alsace are sometimes referred to as ''Thiois'', most likely still for the area between [[Maastricht]] and [[Aachen]] and for the traditional German speaking part of [[Lorraine]] (''Lorraine Thioise'') , The term is obsolete and derives from theodisc (see above)&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[:fr:Thiois|Thiois]]'' in the French wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Names from Germania==
[[File:Gaius Cornelius Tacitus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|upright|[[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus]]]]
The name ''Germany'' and the other similar-sounding names above are all derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[Germania]]'', of the 3rd century BC, a word simply describing ''fertile land'' behind the limes. It was likely the [[Gauls]] who first called the people who crossed east of the Rhine ''Germani'' (which the Romans adopted) as the original Germanic tribes did not refer to themselves as ''Germanus'' (singular) or ''Germani'' (plural).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wolfram |first=Herwig |title= The Roman Empire and its Germanic Peoples |publisher= University of California Press |pages=4–5 |year=1997 |isbn= 0-520-08511-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Julius Caesar]] was the first to use ''Germanus'' in writing when describing tribes in north-eastern [[Gaul]] in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'': he records that four northern [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes, namely the [[Condrusi]], [[Eburones]], [[Caeraesi]] and [[Paemani]], were collectively known as [[Germanic peoples|Germani]]. In AD 98, [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' (the Latin title was actually: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum''), an ethnographic work on the diverse set of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s outside the [[Roman Empire]]. Unlike Caesar, Tacitus claims that the name ''Germani'' was first applied to the [[Tungri]] tribe. The name ''Tungri'' is thought to be the [[endonym]] corresponding to the [[exonym]] ''Eburones''. 

19th-century and early 20th-century historians speculated on whether the northern Belgae were [[Celts]] or [[Germanic tribes]]. Caesar claims that most of the northern Belgae were descended from tribes who had long ago crossed the Rhine from Germania. However many tribal names and personal names or titles recorded are identifiably [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]. It seems likely that the northern Belgae, due to their intense contact with the Gaulish south, were largely influenced by this southern culture. Tribal names were 'qualifications' and could have been translated or given by the Gauls and picked up by Caesar. Perhaps they were Germanic people who had adopted Gaulish titles or names. The Belgians were a political alliance of southern Celtic and northern Germanic tribes. In any case, the Romans were not precise in their [[ethnography]] of northern [[barbarians]]: by "German(ic)" Caesar meant "originating east of the Rhine". Tacitus wrote in his book ''Germania'': "The [[Treveri]] and [[Nervii]] take pride in their German origin, stating that this noble blood separates them from all comparison (with the Gauls) and the Gaulish laziness".&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus: "Germania" par 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED2]] records theories about the Celtic roots of the Latin word ''Germania'': one is ''gair'', neighbour (a theory of [[Johann Kaspar Zeuss|Johann Zeuss]], a German historian and Celtic philologist) – in [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''gair'' is "neighbour". Another theory is ''gairm'', battle-cry (put forward by Johann Wachter and [[Jacob Grimm]], who was a philologist as well as collector and editor of [[fairy tale]]s). Yet another theory is that the word comes from ''ger'', "spear"; however, [[Eric Partridge]] suggests ''*gar'' / ''gavin'', to shout (as Old Irish ''garim''), describing the Germanic tribesmen as noisy. He describes the ''ger'' theory as "obsolete".

In English, the word "German" is first attested in 1520, replacing earlier uses of ''[[Alemanni|Almain]]'', ''Alman'' and ''[[Dutch people|Dutch]]''. In German, the word ''Germanen'' today refers to [[Germanic tribes]], just like the Italian noun "Germani" (adjective: "germanici"), and the French adjective "''germanique''", The English words "german" (as in "[[wikt:cousin-german|cousin-german]]") and the adjective "germane" are not connected to the name for the country, but come from the Latin ''germanus'', "siblings with the same parents or father"; just like Spanish "hermano", that is "brother", that is not cognate by any mean to the word "Germania".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Names from Alemanni==
{{see|Alemanni#Name}}
The name ''Allemagne'' and the other similar-sounding names above are derived from the southern [[Germanic tribe|Germanic]] [[Alemanni]], a [[Suebi]]c tribe or confederation in today's [[Alsace]], parts of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Switzerland]].

[[File:Alemannic-Dialects-Map-English.png|thumb|right|250px|The areas where [[Alemannic German]] is spoken]]
In English, the name "Almain" or "Alman" was used for Germany and for the adjective German until the 16th century, with "German" first attested in 1520, used at first as an alternative then becoming a replacement, maybe inspired mainly by the need to differ them from the more and more independently acting Dutch. In [[Othello]] ii,3, (about 1603), for example, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] uses both "German" and "Almain" when [[Iago]] describes the drinking prowess of the English:
:''I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are most potent in potting: your Dane, your '''German''', and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English. '' [...] ''Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your '''Almain'''; he gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle can be filled.''

[[Andrew Boorde]] also mentions Germany in his '' Introduction to Knowledge'', c. 1547:
:''The people of High '''Almain''', they be rude and rusticall, and very boisterous in their speech, and humbly in their apparel .... they do feed grossly, and they will eat maggots as fast as we will eat comfits.''

Through this name, the English language has also been given the [[Allemande]] (a dance), the [[Almain rivet]] and probably the [[almond furnace]], which is probably not really connected to the word "almond" (of Greek origin) but is a corruption of "Almain furnace". In modern German, ''Alemannisch'' ([[Alemannic German]]) is a group of dialects of the [[Upper German]] branch of the Germanic language family, spoken by approximately ten million people in six different countries.

Among the indigenous peoples of North America of former French and British colonial areas, the word for "Germany" came primarily{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} as a borrowing from either French or English. For example, in the [[Anishinaabe language]]s, three terms for "Germany" exist: ᐋᓂᒫ (''Aanimaa'', originally ''Aalimaanh'', from the French ''Allemagne'')&lt;!--syncoped: aanmaa--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Richard A. | title = Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Mouton de Gruyter | location = New York | isbn = 3-11-013749-6 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kelton"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelton | first = Dwight H. | title = Indian Names and History of the Sault Ste.

==Names from Saxon==
The names ''Saksamaa'' and ''Saksa'' are derived from the name of the Germanic tribe of the [[Saxons]]. The word "Saxon", Proto-Germanic *''sakhsan'', is believed (a) to be derived from the word [[seax]], meaning a variety of single-edged [[knife|knives]]: a Saxon was perhaps literally a swordsman, or (b) to be derived from the word "axe", the region axed between the valleys of the [[Elbe]] and [[Weser]]. 

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] the words that historically applied to ancient Saxons changed their meaning over the centuries to denote the whole country of Germany and the Germans. In some [[Celtic languages]] the word for the English nationality is derived from Saxon, e.g., the Scottish term ''[[Sassenach]]'', the Breton terms ''Saoz, Saozon'' and the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] terms ''Sais, Saeson''. "Saxon" also led to the "-sex" ending in [[Wessex]], [[Essex]], [[Sussex]], [[Middlesex]], etc., and of course to "[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]".

==Names from Nemets==
The Slavic [[exonym]]  ''nemets'', ''nemtsy'' derives from [[Proto-Slavic]] ''němьcь'', pl. ''němьci'', 'the mutes', 'not able (to speak)' (from adjective ''němъ'' 'mute' and suffix -''ьcь'').&lt;ref name="Vasmer"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vasmer|first=Max|title=Etymological dictionary of the Russian language|volume=Volume III|publisher=Progress|year=1986|location=Moscow|language=Russian|page=62|url=http://etymolog.ruslang.ru/vasmer.php?id=62&amp;vol=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It literally means ''a mute'' and can be also associated with similar sounding ''not able'', ''without power'', but came to signify ''those who can't speak (like us); foreigners''. The Slavic [[exonym and endonym|autonym]] (Proto-Slavic ''*Slověninъ'') likely derives from ''slovo'', meaning ''word''. According to a theory, early Slavs would call themselves the ''speaking people'' or the ''keepers of the words'', as opposed to their Germanic neighbors, the ''mutes'' (a similar idea lies behind Greek ''barbaros'', [[barbarian]] and Arab [[Ajam|عجم (ajam)]], ''mute)''. At first, ''němьci'' may have been used for any non-Slav foreigners, later narrowed to just Germans. The plural form is used for the Germans instead of any specific country name, e.g. ''Niemcy'' in Polish and ''Ńymcy'' in Silesian dialect. In other languages, the country's name derives from the adjective ''němьcьska (zemja)'' meaning 'German (land)' (f.i. Czech ''Německo''). Belarusian {{lang|be|Нямеччына}} (''Nyamyecchyna''), Bulgarian {{lang|bg|Немция}} (''Nemtsiya'') and Ukrainian {{lang|uk|Німеччина}} (''Nimecchyna'') are also from ''němьcь'' but with the addition of the suffix -''ina''.

According to another theory,&lt;ref name="Indo-European"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QIaAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=nemeti+etymology&amp;dq=nemeti+etymology&amp;ei=JxttSZPaOIjWNsy5sMwJ&amp;pgis=1 The Journal of Indo-European studies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolishEtym"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://grzegorj.w.interia.pl/lingwpl/przen.html |title=(in Polish) Etymology of the Polish-language word for Germany |access-date=2009-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402074013/http://grzegorj.w.interia.pl/lingwpl/przen.html |archive-date=2008-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nemtsy'' may derive from the Rhine-based, Germanic tribe of [[Nemetes]] mentioned by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]&lt;ref&gt;C. Iulius Caesar, "Commentariorum Libri VII De Bello Gallico", VI, 25. [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/gall6.shtml#25 Latin text]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref&gt;P. CORNELIVS TACITVS ANNALES, 12, 27. [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann12.shtml#27 Latin text]&lt;/ref&gt; This etymology is dubious for phonological ''nemetes'' could not become Slavic ''němьcь''.&lt;ref name="Vasmer"/&gt; 

In [[Russian language|Russian]], the adjective for "German", немецкий  (''nemetskiy'') comes from the same Slavic root while the name for the country is ''Germaniya'' (Германия). Likewise, in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] the adjective is "немски" (''nemski'') and the country is ''Germaniya'' (Германия).

Over time, the Slavic exonym was borrowed by some non-Slavic languages. The Hungarian name for Germany is ''Németország'' (from the stem Német-. lit. Német Land). The popular Romanian name for German is ''neamț'', used alongside the official term, ''german'', which was borrowed from Latin. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name for [[Austria]] النمسا ''an-Nimsā'' was borrowed from the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] word for Austria, "نمچه" – "Nemçe", from one of the [[South Slavic languages]] (in the 16–17th centuries the [[Austrian Empire]] was the biggest German-speaking country bordering on the Ottoman Empire) and like in Polish also doesn't refer to a specific country but only to the people occupying it. 

== Names from Baltic regions ==
In [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] the names ''Vācija'' and ''Vokietija'' contain the root vāca or vākiā. Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras Būga associated this with a reference to a Swedish tribe named [[Vagoth]]s in a 6th-century chronicle (cf. finn. ''Vuojola'' and eston. ''Oju-/Ojamaa'', '[[Gotland]]', both derived from the Baltic word; the ethnonym *vakja, used by the [[Votes]] (''vadja'') and the [[Sami people|Sami]], in older sources (''vuowjos''), may also be related). So the word for ''German'' possibly comes from a name originally given by West Baltic tribes to the Vikings.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, Litauisches etymol. Wörterbuch (Indogerm. Bibliothek II,7) Heidelberg/Göttingen 1965, page 1272&lt;/ref&gt; Latvian linguist Konstantīnos Karulis proposes that the word may be based on the Indo-European word ''*wek'' ("speak"), from which derive [[Old Prussian]] wackis ("war cry") or Latvian vēkšķis. Such names could have been used to describe neighbouring people whose language was incomprehensible to Baltic peoples. 
Those names may also derive from Slavic roots, if - then they would mean ''marauders'' or ''nomadic bandits'', which resembles similar meaning applied to the [[Philistines]], by [[Nubians]] or [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]].

== Names from East Asia ==
In East Asia, the names have generally been imported directly from German "deutsch" or Dutch "duits" in various ways.

The Chinese name is a phonetic approximation of the German proper adjective. The Vietnamese name is based on the Chinese name. The Japanese name is a phonetic approximation of the Dutch proper adjective. The Korean name is based on the Japanese name. This is explained in detail below:

The common Chinese name ({{zh|t={{linktext|德|國}}|s=德国|p=Déguó}}) is a combination of the short form of {{zh|t=德{{linktext|意|志}}|p=déyìzhì}}, which approximates the German pronunciation {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏ̯tʃ|}} of ''Deutsch'' ‘German’, plus {{lang|zh|國}} ''guó'' ‘country’.

The Vietnamese name ''[[wikt:Đức|Đức]]'' is the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation]] (''đức'' {{IPA-vi|ɗɨ́k|}}) of the character {{lang|zh|德}} that appears in the Chinese name.

Japanese language {{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:ドイツ|ドイツ]]}} (''doitsu'') is an approximation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|nl|[[wiktionary:duits|duits]]}} meaning ‘German’.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kōjien]], 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier written with the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese character compound]] {{lang|ja|{{linktext|獨|逸}}}} (whose {{lang|ja|獨}} has since been [[Shinjitai|simplified]] to {{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:独|独]]}}), but has been largely superseded by the above-mentioned [[katakana]] {{lang|ja|ドイツ}}.
The character {{lang|ja|独}} is sometimes used in compounds, for example {{lang|ja|独[[wiktionary:文|文]]}} (''dokubun'') meaning ‘[[German literature]]’, or as an abbreviation, such as in {{nihongo|独日関係|dokunichi kankei|German-Japanese relations}}.

The (South) [[Korean language|Korean]] name ''Dogil'' ({{lang|ko|독일}}) is the Korean pronunciation of the former Japanese name. The compound coined by the Japanese was adapted into Korean, so its characters {{lang|ko|獨逸}} are not pronounced ''do+itsu'' as in Japanese, but ''dok+il'' = ''Dogil''. Until the 1980s, South Korean primary textbooks adopted ''Doichillanteu'' ({{lang|ko|도이칠란트}}) which approximates the German pronunciation {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏ̯tʃ.lant|}} of ''Deutschland''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

The official North Korean name ''toich'willandŭ'' ({{lang|ko|도이췰란드}}) approximates the German pronunciation {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏ̯tʃ.lant|}} of ''Deutschland''. Traditionally ''Dogil'' ({{lang|ko|독일}}) had been used in North Korea until the 1990s{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.  Use of the Chinese name (in its Korean pronunciation ''Deokguk'', {{lang|ko|덕국}}) is attested for the early 20th century{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. It is now uncommon.

==Etymological history==
The terminology for "Germany", the "German states" and "Germans" is complicated by the unusual history of Germany over the last 2000 years.  This can cause confusion in German and English, as well in other languages.  While the notion of ''Germans'' and ''Germany'' is older, it is only since 1871 that there has been a [[nation-state]] of Germany.  Later political disagreements and the [[History of Germany since 1945|partition of Germany (1945–1990)]] has further made it difficult to use proper terminology.

Starting with [[Charlemagne]], the territory of modern Germany was within the realm of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  It was a union of relatively independent rulers who each ruled their own territories.  This empire was called in German ''Heiliges Römisches Reich'', with the addition from the late Middle Ages of ''Deutscher Nation'' (of (the) German nation), showing that the former idea of a universal realm had given way to a concentration on the German territories.

In 19th and 20th century historiography, the Holy Roman Empire was often referred to as ''Deutsches Reich'', creating a link to the later nation state of 1871.  Besides the official ''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'', common expressions are ''Altes Reich'' (the old Reich) and ''Römisch-Deutsches Kaiserreich'' (Roman-German Imperial Realm).

=== Pre-modern Germany (pre-1800) ===

{{Further|Germania|Theodiscus}}
Roman authors mentioned a number of tribes they called ''Germani''—the tribes did not themselves use the term. After 1500 these tribes were identified by linguists as belonging to a group of [[Germanic languages|Germanic language speakers]] (which include modern languages like German, English and Dutch).  ''Germani'' (for the people) and ''Germania'' (for the area where they lived) became the common Latin words for Germans and Germany.

Germans call themselves ''Deutsche'' (living in ''Deutschland''). ''Deutsch'' is an adjective ([[Proto-Germanic]] *''theudisk-'') derived from Old [[High German languages|High German]] ''thiota, diota'' (Proto-Germanic *''theudō'') meaning "people", "nation", "folk".  The word *''theudō'' is [[cognate]] with Proto-Celtic *''teutā'', whence the Celtic tribal name [[Teuton]], later anachronistically applied to the Germans. The term was first used to designate the popular language as opposed to the language used by the religious and secular rulers who used Latin.

In the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval]] and [[Early Modern period]], Germany and Germans were known as ''Almany'' and ''Almains'' in English, via [[Old French]] ''alemaigne'', ''alemans'' derived from the name of the [[Alamanni]] and [[Alemannia]].  These English terms were obsolete by the 19th century.  At the time, the territory of modern Germany belonged to the realm of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the Roman Empire restored by the Christian king of [[Franks|Francony]], [[Charlemagne]]).  This feudal state became a union of relatively independent rulers who developed their own territories. Modernisation took place on the territorial level (such as Austria, Prussia, Saxony or [[Bremen]]), not on the level of the Empire.

=== 1800–1871 ===

The French emperor, [[Napoleon]], forced the [[Emperor of Austria]] to step down as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1806.  Some of the German countries were then collected into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], which remained a military alliance under the "protection" of Napoleon, rather than consolidating into an actual confederation.  After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, these states created a [[German Confederation]] with the [[Emperor of Austria]] as president. Some member states, such as Prussia and Austria, included only a part of their territories within the confederation, while other member states brought territories to the alliance that included people, like the Poles and the Czechs, who did not speak German as their native tongue. In addition, there were also substantial German speaking populations that remained outside the confederation.

In 1841 [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] wrote the song ''[[Deutschlandlied|Das Lied der Deutschen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Note: Deutschlandlied has been the national anthem since 1922&lt;/ref&gt; giving voice to the dreams of a unified Germany (''Deutschland über Alles'') to replace the alliance of independent states. In this era of emerging national movements, "Germany" was used only as a reference to a particular geographical area.

In 1866/1867 Prussia and her allies left the German Confederation, which led to the confederation being dissolved and the formation of a new alliance, called the [[North German Confederation]]. It became a federal state with its constitution of 1 July 1867. The remaining South German countries, with the exception of Austria and Liechtenstein, joined the country in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich August Winkler: ''Der lange Weg nach Westen. Deutsche Geschichte 1806–1933'', Bonn 2002, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German Federation ===

{{Main|Unification of Germany|Reich}}
The first nation state named "Germany" began in 1871; before that ''Germany'' referred to a geographical entity comprising many states, much as "the Balkans" is used today, or the term "America" was used by the founders of "the United States of America."

In German constitutional history, the expressions ''Reich'' (reign, realm, empire) and ''Bund'' (federation, confederation) are somewhat interchangeable. Sometimes they even co-existed in the same constitution: for example in the German Empire (1871–1918) the parliament had the name ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', the council of the representatives of the German states ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]h''. When in 1870–71 the [[North German Confederation]] was transformed into the German Empire, the preamble said that the participating monarchs are creating ''einen ewigen Bund'' (an eternal confederation) which will have the name ''Deutsches Reich''.

Due to the history of Germany, the principle of federalism is strong. Only the state of Hitler (1933–1945) and the state of the communists (East Germany, 1949–1990) were centralist states. As a result, the words ''Reich'' and ''Bund'' were used more frequently than in other countries, in order to distinguish between imperial or federal institutions and those at a subnational level. For example, a modern federal German minister is called ''Bundesminister'', in contrast to a ''Landesminister'' who holds office in a state such as Rhineland-Palatinate or Lower Saxony.

As a result of the Hitler regime, and maybe also of Imperial Germany up to 1919, many Germans – especially those on the political left – have negative feelings about the word ''Reich''. However, it is in common use in expressions such as ''Römisches Reich'' (Roman Empire), ''Königreich'' (Kingdom) and ''Tierreich'' (animal kingdom).

''Bund'' is another word also used in contexts other than politics. Many associations in Germany are federations or have a federalised structure and differentiate between a ''Bundesebene'' (federal/national level) and a ''Landesebene'' (level of the regional states), in a similar way to the political bodies. An example is the [[German Football Association]] ''Deutscher Fußballbund''. (The word ''Bundestrainer'', referring to the national football coach, does not refer to the Federal Republic, but to the Fußball''bund'' itself.)

In other German speaking countries, the words ''Reich'' (Austria before 1918) and ''Bund'' (Austria since 1918, Switzerland) are used too. An organ named ''[[Bundesrat (disambiguation)|Bundesrat]]'' exists in all three of them: in Switzerland it is the government and in Germany and Austria the house of regional representatives.

====Greater Germany and "Großdeutsches Reich"====

In the 19th century before 1871, Germans, for example in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848–49, argued about what should become of Austria.  Including Austria (at least the German-speaking parts) in a future German state was referred to as the ''[[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland|Greater German Solution]]''; while a German state without Austria was the ''Smaller German Solution''.

In 1919 the Weimar Constitution postulated the inclusion of ''Deutsch-Österreich'' (the German-speaking parts of Austria), but the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]] objected to this. It was realised only in 1938 when Germany annexed Austria ''([[Anschluss]])''.  National socialist propaganda proclaimed the realisation of [[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland|Großdeutschland]]; and in 1943 the German Reich was officially renamed ''Großdeutsches Reich''.  However, these expressions became neither common nor popular.

In National Socialist propaganda Austria was also called ''[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]''.  After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' the previous territory of Germany was called ''[[Altreich (pre-1938 Nazi Germany)|Altreich]]'' (old Reich).

===German Empire and Weimar Republic of Germany, 1871–1945===
The official name of the German state in 1871 became ''Deutsches Reich'', linking itself to the former ''Reich'' before 1806 and the rudimentary ''Reich'' of 1848/1849. This expression was commonly used in official papers and also on maps, while in other contexts ''Deutschland'' was more frequently used.

Those Germans living within its boundaries were called ''Reichsdeutsche'', those outside were called ''Volksdeutsche'' (ethnic Germans). The latter expression referred mainly to the German minorities in Eastern Europe. Germans living abroad (for example in America) were and are called ''Auslandsdeutsche''.

After the forced abdication of the Emperor in 1918, and the republic was declared, Germany was informally called the ''Deutsche Republik''. The official name of the state remained the same.  The term [[Weimar Republic]], after the city where the National Assembly gathered, came up in the 1920s, but was not commonly used until the 1950s.  It became necessary to find an appropriate term for the Germany between 1871 and 1919: ''Kaiserliches Deutschland'' (Imperial Germany) or ''(Deutsches) Kaiserreich''.

==== Nazi Germany ====
After Adolf Hitler took power in 1933, the official name of the state was still the same. For a couple of years Hitler used the expression ''Drittes Reich'' ([[Third Reich]]), which was introduced by writers in the last years of the republic. In fact this was only a propaganda term and did not constitute a new state. Another propaganda term was ''Tausendjähriges Reich'' (Thousand years Reich). Later Hitler renounced the term ''Drittes Reich'' (officially in June 1939), but it already had become popular among supporters and opponents and is still used in historiography (sometimes in quotation marks).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich August Winkler: ''Der lange Weg nach Westen. Deutsche Geschichte 1933–1990'', Bonn 2004, p. 6/7.&lt;/ref&gt; It led later to the name ''Zweites Reich'' (Second Empire) for Germany of 1871–1919. The reign of Hitler is most commonly called in English ''Nazi Germany''. ''Nazi'' is a colloquial short for ''Nationalsozialist'', a person who supports national socialism.

===Germany divided 1945–1990===
[[File:Map-Germany-1947.svg|thumb|Occupied Germany in 1947, with western (green, blue and yellow) and eastern (red) occupation zones.]]
[[File:Deutsche Post - 1 Reichsmark.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stamp in occupied Germany, 1946: the neutral expression ''Deutsche Post'' instead of ''Deutsche Reichspost'', but still the old currency RM (Reichsmark)]]

After the defeat in World War II, Germany was occupied by the troops of Britain, France, the United States and Soviet Union. Berlin was a case of its own, as it was situated on the territory of the Soviet zone but divided into four sectors. The western sectors were later called West Berlin, the other one East Berlin. The communists tended to consider the Soviet sector of Berlin as a part of GDR; West Berlin was, according to them, an independent political unit. In the GDR ''Westberlin'' was the preferred spelling in order to de-emphasize the relationship to ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (the GDR capital).

After 1945, ''Deutsches Reich'' was still used for a couple of years (in 1947, for instance, when the Social Democrats gathered in Nuremberg they called their rally ''Reichsparteitag''). In many contexts, the German people still called their country ''Germany'', even after two German states were created in 1949.

==== Federal Republic of Germany ====
[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|The Federal Republic in blue, GDR in red and West Berlin in yellow, 1949–1990]]
The Federal Republic of Germany, ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', established in 1949, saw itself as the same state founded in 1867/71 but ''Reich'' gave place to ''Bund''. For example, the ''Reichskanzler'' became the ''Bundeskanzler'', ''reichsdeutsch'' became ''bundesdeutsch'', ''Reichsbürger'' (citizen of the ''Reich'') became ''Bundesbürger''.

Germany as a whole was called ''Deutschland als Ganzes'' or ''Gesamtdeutschland'', referring to Germany in the international borders of 1937 (before Hitler started to annex other countries). This resulted in ''all German'' (or ''pan germanique''—a chauvinist concept) aspirations. In 1969 the Federal Ministry for All German Affairs was renamed the Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations.

Until 1970, a number of expressions competed in the Federal Republic to designate the other German state (the communist German Democratic Republic). It was called ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (SBZ, Soviet Zone of Occupation), ''Sowjetzone'', ''Ostzone'', ''Mitteldeutschland'' or ''Pankow'' (many GDR politicians lived or worked in Berlin-Pankow).

==== German Democratic Republic ====
[[File:DDR international vehicle registration oval.svg|thumb|left|100px|International vehicle registration oval including the letters ''DDR'']]

In 1949, the communists, protected by the Soviet Union, established the ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (DDR, [[German Democratic Republic]], GDR). This state was not considered to be a successor of the Reich, but, nevertheless, to represent all ''good Germans''.  Rulers and inhabitants of GDR called their state simply DDR or ''unsere Republik'' (our republic).  The GDR still supported the idea of a German nation and the need for reunification. The Federal Republic was often called ''Westdeutschland'' or the BRD.  After 1970 the GDR called itself a "socialist state of German nation".  Westerners called the GDR ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (SBZ, Soviet Zone of Occupation), ''Sowjetzone'', ''Ostzone'', ''Mitteldeutschland'' or ''Pankow'' (the GDR government was in the Pankow district of Berlin).

=== Federal Republic of Germany 1990–present ===
In 1990 the ''German Democratic Republic'' ceased to exist. Five "neue Bundesländer" (new federal states) were established and joined the "Bundesrepublik Deutschland" (Federal Republic of Germany). [[East Berlin]] joined through merger with [[West Berlin]]; technically this was the sixth new federal state since West Berlin, although considered a de facto federal state, had the legal status of a [[Allied-occupied Germany|military occupation zone]].

The official name of the country is ''Federal Republic of Germany'' (Bundesrepublik Deutschland). The terms "Westdeutschland" and "Ostdeutschland" are still used for the western and the eastern parts of the German territory, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1605">A natural barrier refers to a physical feature that protects or hinders travel through or over.

[[Mountain|Mountains]], [[swamp|swamps]], [[desert|deserts]] and [[ice field|ice fields]] are among the clearest examples of natural barriers. [[River|Rivers]] are a more ambiguous example, as they may obstruct large-scale movement across them (especially by armies) but may facilitate smaller-scale movement along them in boats, once some of the people in the region have developed the relevant technologies. [[Sea|Seas]] have likewise been an obstacle at first, then a convenient medium for [[transport]] along [[coast|coastlines]], and finally a medium for intercontinental transport.

Natural barriers have been important factors in human history, by obstructing [[human migration|migration]] and [[invasion]]. For example, [[Jared Diamond]] argues that West European nations have been the dominant powers of the last 500 years because Europe's many natural barriers divided it into competing [[nation state|nation-states]] and this competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | first=Jared|last=Diamond|authorlink=Jared Diamond | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=0-393-03891-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of natural barriers are the Himalayas isolating the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the rest of Asia, the Grand Canyon, the Dead sea, and the Mississippi river.

'''Nevis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|iː|v|ɪ|s}} is a small island in the [[Caribbean Sea]] that forms part of the inner arc of the [[Leeward Islands]] chain of the [[West Indies]]. Nevis and the neighbouring island of [[Saint Kitts]] constitute one country: the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. Nevis is located near the northern end of the [[Lesser Antilles]] [[archipelago]], about 350&amp;nbsp;km east-southeast of [[Puerto Rico]] and 80&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Antigua]]. Its area is {{convert|93|km2}} and the capital is [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]].

Saint Kitts and Nevis are separated by a shallow {{convert|3|km|0|adj=on}} channel known as "[[The Narrows (Saint Kitts and Nevis)|The Narrows]]". Nevis is roughly conical in shape with a volcano known as [[Nevis Peak]] at its centre. The island is fringed on its western and northern coastlines by sandy beaches which are composed of a mixture of white coral sand with brown and black sand which is eroded and washed down from the volcanic rocks that make up the island. The gently-sloping coastal plain ({{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} wide) has natural freshwater springs as well as non-potable volcanic [[hot spring]]s, especially along the western coast.

The island was named ''Oualie'' ("Land of Beautiful Waters") by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] and ''Dulcina'' ("Sweet Island") by the early British settlers. The name ''Nevis'' is derived from the Spanish ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'' (which means [[Dedication of Saint Mary Major|Our Lady of the Snows]]); the name first appears on maps in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Hubbard"&gt;Hubbard, Vincent K. (2002). ''Swords, Ships &amp; Sugar: History of Nevis''. Corvallis, Oregon: Premiere, {{ISBN|1-891519-05-0}}, pp. 20–23 (Captain Gilbert, Captain Smith), 25 (pearl diving), 41–44 (name Dulcina, treaty with Spain, first settlement), 69–70 (privateers, Captain Francis), 79–85 (slave trade, Royal African Company, Queen of the Caribees), 86–102 (Caribs), 113–120 (d'Iberville, buccaneers), 138–139 (Great Britain's wealth derived from West Indian sugar and slave trade, 1776 starvation), 194–195 (Alexandra Hospital), 211–223 (electricity, Anguilla in 1967, OECD blacklist).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevis is also known by the [[sobriquet]] "Queen of the Caribees", which it earned in the 18th century, when its sugar plantations created much wealth for the British.

Nevis is of particular historical significance to Americans because it was the birthplace and early childhood home of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. For the British, Nevis is the place where [[Horatio Nelson]] was stationed as a young sea captain, and is where he met and married a Nevisian, [[Frances Nisbet]], the young widow of a plantation-owner.

The majority of the approximately 12,000 citizens of Nevis are of primarily African descent, with notable British, Portuguese and Lebanese minority communities. English is the official language,&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Kitts and Nevis|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sc.html|website=CIA World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the literacy rate, 98 percent, is one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere.

==Etymology==
In 1498, [[Christopher Columbus]] gave the island the name ''San Martin'' (Saint Martin). However, the confusion of numerous poorly-charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain meant that this name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, which is still known as [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]].

The current name ''Nevis''  was derived from a Spanish name ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'' by a process of abbreviation and [[anglicisation]]. The Spanish name means [[Dedication of Saint Mary Major|Our Lady of the Snows]]. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a 4th-century Catholic miracle: a snowfall on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Our Lady of the Snow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably the white clouds that usually cover the top of [[Nevis Peak]] reminded someone of this story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate.

Nevis was part of the Spanish claim to the Caribbean islands, a claim pursued until the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]], even though there were no Spanish settlements on the island. According to Vincent Hubbard, author of ''Swords, Ships &amp; Sugar: History of Nevis'', the Spanish ruling caused many of the Arawak groups who were not ethnically Caribs to "be redefined as Caribs overnight".&lt;ref name="Hubbard"/&gt; Records indicate that the Spanish enslaved large numbers of the native inhabitants on the more accessible of the Leeward Islands and sent them to [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]] to dive for pearls. Hubbard suggests that the reason the first European settlers found so few "Caribs" on Nevis is that they had already been rounded up by the Spanish and shipped off to be used as slaves.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

===Amerindians===
Nevis was first sighted by Columbus in 1493; the island had been settled for more than two thousand years by Amerindian people.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/default.asp?ProjectID=12 Nevis Heritage excavation reports, 2000–2002], Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton. Retrieved 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous people of Nevis during these periods belonged to the Leeward Island Amerindian groups popularly referred to as [[Arawaks]] and [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], a complex mosaic of ethnic groups with similar culture and language.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Samuel (1990). "The Prehistoric Settlement Pattern of Nevis, West Indies". ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 16, No. 4  (Winter 1989), p. 427-450.&lt;/ref&gt; Dominican anthropologist Lennox Honychurch traces the European use of the term "Carib" to refer to the Leeward Island aborigines to Columbus, who picked it up from the [[Taínos]] on [[Hispaniola]]. It was not a name the Caribs called themselves.&lt;ref name="Honychurch"&gt;Honychurch, Lennox (1997). "Crossroads in the Caribbean: A Site of Encounter and Exchange on Dominica". ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 28(3): 291–304.&lt;/ref&gt; "Carib Indians" was the generic name used for all groups believed involved in cannibalistic war rituals, more particularly, the consumption of parts of a killed enemy's body.

The Amerindian name for Nevis was ''Oualie'', land of beautiful waters. The structure of the Island Carib language has been linguistically identified as [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]].&lt;ref name="Honychurch" /&gt;

===Colonial era===
In spite of the Spanish claim, Nevis continued to be a popular stop-over point for English and Dutch ships on their way to the [[North America]]n [[continent]]. Captain Bartholomew Gilbert of Plymouth visited the island in 1603, spending two weeks to cut twenty tons of [[lignum vitae]] wood. Gilbert sailed on to [[Virginia]] to seek out survivors of the [[Roanoke settlement]] in what is now [[North Carolina]]. [[Captain John Smith]] visited Nevis also on his way to Virginia in 1607. This was the voyage which founded [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement in the New World.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

On 30 August 1620, James 6th of Scotland – [[James I of England]] asserted sovereignty over Nevis by giving a Royal Patent for colonisation to the [[Earl of Carlisle]]. However, actual European settlement did not happen until 1628, when Anthony Hilton moved from nearby Saint Kitts following a murder plot against him. He was accompanied by 80 other settlers, soon to be boosted by a further 100 settlers from London who had originally hoped to settle [[Barbuda]]. Hilton became the first Governor of Nevis. After the  [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]] between Spain and England, Nevis became the seat of the British colony and the [[Admiralty Court]] also sat in Nevis. Between 1675 and 1730, the island was the headquarters for the slave trade for the Leeward Islands, with approximately 6,000–7,000 enslaved West Africans passing through en route to other islands each year. The [[Royal African Company]] brought all its ships through Nevis.&lt;ref name="Hubbard"/&gt; A 1678 census shows a community of [[Irish immigration to Saint Kitts and Nevis|Irish people]] – 22% of the population – existing as either [[indentured servants]] or freemen.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/irish-indentured-labour-in-the-caribbean/  Irish indentured labour in the Caribbean]". Nationalarchives.gov.uk. March 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nevis FrenchSlavetrade.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of French [[slave trade]] in the 1876 book ''The 18th century: Its Institutions, Customs, and Costumes: France, 1700–1789''.]]

Due to the profitable [[Slave Trade]] and the high quality of Nevisian [[sugar cane]], the island soon became a dominant source of wealth for Great Britain and the slave-owning British plantocracy. When the [[Leeward Islands]] were separated from [[Barbados]] in 1671, Nevis became the seat of the [[Leeward Islands colony]] and was given the nickname "Queen of the Caribees". It remained colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to [[Antigua]] for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the British Leeward Islands.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; The island outranked larger islands like [[Jamaica]] in sugar production in the late 17th century. The wealth of the planters on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the Calendar State Papers in the British [[Colonial Office]] Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as  "head tax on slaves", a tax payable in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in [[Montserrat]], and 5,500 total in the other five islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers'' (1676). Number 1152, 1676. The British Colonial Office Public Records. Qtd. in Hubbard, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced by the fact that the [[sugar cane|cane juice]] from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of cane juice from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres).&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; Twenty percent of the [[British Empire]]'s total sugar production in 1700 was derived from Nevisian plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, David (1987). ''The West Indies: Patterns of Development, Culture and Environmental Change Since 1492''. Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Exports from West Indian colonies like Nevis were worth more than all the exports from all the mainland [[Thirteen Colonies]] of North America combined at the time of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

The enslaved families formed the large labour force required to work the sugar plantations. After the 1650s the supply of white indentured servants began to dry up due to increased wages in England and less incentive to migrate to the colonies.  By the end of the 17th century, the population of Nevis consisted of a small, rich planter elite in control, a marginal population of poor whites, a great majority of African-descended slaves, and an unknown number of [[Maroon (people)|maroons]], escaped slaves living in the mountains. In 1780, 90 percent of the 10,000 people living on Nevis were black.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; Some of the maroons joined with the few remaining Caribs in Nevis to form a resistance force. Memories of the Nevisian maroons' struggle under the plantation system are preserved in place names such as Maroon Hill, an early centre of resistance.

The great wealth generated by the colonies of the West Indies led to wars between Spain, Britain, and France. The formation of the United States can be said to be a partial by-product of these wars and the strategic trade aims that often ignored North America.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; Three [[privateers]] ([[William Kidd]] being one of them) were employed by the British Crown to help protect ships in Nevis' waters.&lt;ref name="Hubbard"/&gt;

During the 17th century, the French, based on Saint Kitts, launched many attacks on Nevis, sometimes assisted by the Island Caribs, who in 1667 sent a large fleet of canoes along in support. In the same year a Franco-Dutch invasion fleet [[Battle of Nevis|was repelled]] off Nevis by an English fleet. Letters and other records from the era indicate that the English on Nevis hated and feared the Amerindians. In 1674 and 1683 they participated in attacks on Carib villages in [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]], in spite of a lack of official approval from [[the Crown]] for the attack.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

On Nevis, the English built [[Fort Charles (Nevis)|Fort Charles]] and a series of smaller fortifications to aid in defending the island.  This included Saddle Hill Battery, built in 1740 to replace a deodand on Mount Nevis.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;{{rp|44,62,131}}

===Emancipation===
[[File:Nevis Methodist.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Charlestown Methodist Chapel, 1802. Pro-slavery mobs set the chapel ablaze in 1797, but the building was saved.]]

In 1706, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], the French Canadian founder of [[Louisiana]] in North America, decided to drive the English out of Nevis and thus also stop pirate attacks on French ships; he considered Nevis the region's headquarters for [[piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] against French trade. During d'Iberville's invasion of Nevis, French [[buccaneer]]s were used in the front line, infamous for being ruthless killers after the pillaging during the wars with Spain where they gained a reputation for torturing and murdering non-combatants{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. In the face of the invading force, the English militiamen of Nevis fled. Some planters burned the plantations, rather than letting the French have them, and hid in the mountains{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. It was the enslaved Africans who held the French at bay by taking up arms to defend their families and the island. The slave quarters had been looted and burned as well, as the main reward promised the men fighting on the French side in the attack was the right to capture as many slaves as possible and resell them in [[Martinique]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

During the fighting, 3,400 enslaved Nevisians were captured and sent off to Martinique, but about 1,000 more, poorly armed and militarily untrained, held the French troops at bay, by "murderous fire" according to an eyewitness account by an English militiaman. He wrote that "the slaves' brave behaviour and defence there shamed what some of their masters did, and they do not shrink to tell us so."&lt;ref name="Hubbard"/&gt; After 18 days of fighting, the French were driven off the island. Among the Nevisian men, women and children carried away on d'Iberville's ships, six ended up in Louisiana, the first persons of African descent to arrive there.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

[[File:JohnPinney.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Slave owner and trader John Pinney (1740–1818) of Montravers Plantation.]]

One consequence of the French attack was a collapsed sugar industry and during the ensuing hardship on Nevis, small plots of land on the plantations were made available to the enslaved families in order to control the loss of life due to starvation. With less profitability for the absentee plantation owners, the import of food supplies for the plantation workers dwindled. Between 1776 and 1783, when the food supplies failed to arrive altogether due to the [[American Revolution|rebellion in North America]], 300–400 enslaved Nevisians starved to death.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; On 1 August 1834, slavery was abolished in the [[British Empire]]. In Nevis, 8,815 slaves were freed.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; The first Monday in August is celebrated as [[Emancipation Day]] and is part of the annual Nevis Culturama festival.

A four-year apprenticeship programme followed the abolishment of slavery on the plantations. In spite of the continued use of the labour force, the Nevisian slave owners were paid over £150,000 in compensation from the British Government for the loss of property, whereas the enslaved families received nothing for 200 years of labour.&lt;ref&gt;Goveia, Elsa H. (1965). ''Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965. {{ISBN|0-88258-048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the wealthiest planter families in Nevis, the Pinneys of Montravers Plantation, claimed £36,396 (worth close to £1,800,000 today{{When|date=November 2018}}) in compensation for the slaves on the family-owned plantations around the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Bristol"&gt;[http://www.discoveringbristol.org.uk/showNarrative.php?sit_id=1&amp;narId=214&amp;nacId=822 Personal stories: Traders and Merchants – John Pinney]. In ''Bristol and Transatlantic Slavery'', a project by City Museum and the University of the West of England's Faculty of Humanities. Retrieved 8 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the early distribution of plots and because many of the planters departed from the island when sugar cultivation became unprofitable, a relatively large percentage of Nevisians already owned or controlled land at emancipation.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;Baker Motley, Constance (1998).

Retrieved 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Others settled on crown land. This early development of a society with a majority of small, landowning farmers and entrepreneurs created a stronger middleclass in Nevis than in Saint Kitts where the sugar industry continued until 2006. Even though the 15 families in the wealthy planter elite no longer control the arable land, Saint Kitts still has a large, landless working class population.&lt;ref&gt;Simmonds, Keith C. (1987).

{{see also|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

Nevis was united with Saint Kitts and [[Anguilla]] in 1882, and they became an [[associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967, though Anguilla seceded in 1971. Together, Saint Kitts and Nevis became independent on 19 September 1983. On 10 August 1998, a [[Nevis independence referendum, 1998|referendum on Nevis]] to separate from Saint Kitts had 2,427 votes in favour and 1,498 against, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed.

Before 1967, the local government of Saint Kitts was also the government of Nevis and Anguilla. Nevis had two seats and Anguilla one seat in the government. The economic and infrastructural development of the two smaller islands was not a priority to the colonial federal government.

When the hospital in Charlestown was destroyed in a hurricane in 1899, planting of trees in the squares of Saint Kitts and refurbishing of government buildings, also in Saint Kitts, took precedence over the rebuilding of the only hospital in Nevis.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; After five years without any proper medical facilities, the leaders in Nevis initiated a campaign, threatening to seek independence from Saint Kitts. The British Administrator in Saint Kitts, Charles Cox, was unmoved. He stated that Nevis did not need a hospital since there had been no significant rise in the number of deaths during the time Nevisians had been without a hospital. Therefore, no action was needed on behalf of the government, and besides, Cox continued, the Legislative Council regarded "Nevis and Anguilla as a drag on St. Kitts and would willingly see a separation".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hubbard, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a letter of complaint to the metropolitan [[British Foreign Office]] gave result and the federal government in Saint Kitts was ordered by their superiors in London to take speedy action. The Legislative Council took another five years to consider their options. The final decision by the federal government was to not rebuild the old hospital after all, but to instead convert the old Government House in Nevis into a hospital, named Alexandra Hospital after Queen Alexandra, wife of King [[Edward VII]]. A majority of the funds assigned for the hospital could thus spent on the construction of a new official residence in Nevis.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

After d'Iberville's invasion in 1704, records show Nevis’ sugar industry in ruins and a decimated population begging the [[English Parliament]] and relatives for loans and monetary assistance to stave off island-wide starvation.&lt;ref name="Hubbard"/&gt; The sugar industry on the island never fully recovered and during the general depression that followed the loss of the West Indian sugar [[monopoly]], Nevis fell on hard times and the island became one of the poorest in the region. The island remained poorer than Saint Kitts until 1991, when the fiscal performance of Nevis edged ahead of the fiscal performance of Saint Kitts for the first time since the French invasion.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt; 

Electricity was introduced in Nevis in 1954, when two generators were shipped in to provide electricity to the area around Charlestown. In this regard, Nevis fared better than Anguilla, where there were no paved roads, no electricity and no telephones up until 1967. However, electricity did not become available island-wide on Nevis until 1971.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

An ambitious infrastructure development programme was introduced in the early 2000s which included a transformation of the Charlestown port, construction of a new deep-water harbour, resurfacing and widening the Island Main Road, a new airport terminal and control tower, and a major airport expansion, which required the relocation of an entire village in order to make room for the runway extension.

Modernised classrooms and better equipped schools, as well as improvements in the educational system, have contributed to a leap in academic performance on the island. The pass rate among the Nevisian students sitting for the [[Caribbean Examination Council]] (CXC) exams, the Cambridge General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) and the Caribbean Advance Proficiency Examinations is now consistently among the highest in the English-speaking Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Janet (2000).

The formation of the island began in [[Pliocene|mid-Pliocene]] times, approximately 3.45 million years ago. Nine distinct eruptive centres from different geological ages, ranging from mid-Pliocene to [[Pleistocene]], have contributed to the formation. No single model of the island's [[Geochronology|geological evolution]] can therefore be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2000). "Saint Kitts and Nevis: Executive Summary". ''Country Reports''.

[[Nevis Peak]] (985 m /3,232&amp;nbsp;ft) is the dormant remnant of one of these ancient [[stratovolcano]]es. The last activity took place about 100,000 years ago, but active [[fumaroles]] and hot springs are still found on the island, the most recent formed in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1600-04= "Nevis Peak"] (2006). ''Global Worldwide Holocene Volcano and Eruption Information''. Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, 2006. Retrieved 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The composite cone of Nevis volcano has two overlapping summit craters that are partially filled by a lava dome, created in recent, pre-Columbian time. [[Pyroclastic flows]] and mudflows were deposited on the lower slopes of the cone simultaneously. [[Nevis Peak]] is located on the outer crater rim. Four other lava domes were constructed on the flanks of the volcano, one on the northeast flank (Madden's Mount), one on the eastern flank (Butlers Mountain), one on the northwest coast (Mount Lily) and one on the south coast (Saddle Hill, with a height of 375 metres). The southernmost point on the island is [[Dogwood Point]] which is also the southernmost point of the [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]].

During the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], when the sea level was 60&amp;nbsp;m lower, the three islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis and [[Sint Eustatius]] (also known as Statia) were connected as one island. [[Saba]], however, is separated from these three by a deeper channel.

There are visible wave-breaking reefs along the northern and eastern shorelines. To the south and west, the reefs are located in deeper water and are suitable for scuba diving. The most developed beach on Nevis is the  6.5&amp;nbsp;km  long [[Pinney's Beach]], on the western or Caribbean coast. There are sheltered swimming beaches in Oualie Bay and Cades Bay. The eastern coast of the island faces into the Atlantic Ocean, and can have strong surf in parts of the shore which are unprotected by fringing [[coral reef]]s. The colour of the [[sand]] on the beaches of Nevis is variable: on a lot of the bigger beaches the sand is a yellow grey in colour, but some beaches on the southern coast have darker, reddish, or even black sand. Under a microscope it becomes clear that Nevis sand is a mixture of tiny fragments of coral, many [[foraminifera]], and small crystals of the various mineral constituents of the [[volcanic rock]] of which the island is made.

===Geology===
Seven volcanic centers make up Nevis.  These include Round Hill (3.43 [[Myr|Ma]]), Cades Bay (3.22 Ma), Hurricane Hill (2.7 Ma), Saddle Hill (1.8 Ma), Butlers Mountain (1.1 Ma), Red Cliff and Nevis Peak (0.98 Ma).  These are mainly [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] [[lava dome]]s, with associated block and [[ash flow]]s, plus [[lahar]]s.Nevis Peak has the highest elevation at 984 m.  Cades Bay and Farm Estate Soufriere are noted areas of [[hydrothermal]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nevis Geology|url=http://caribbeanvolcanoes.com/nevis-geology/|website=Caribbean Volcanoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nevis Geological Profile|url=http://uwiseismic.com/ScientificPapers.aspx|website=The University of West Indies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water has been piped since 1911 from a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]] called the "Source", located 1800 feet up the mountain, to storage tanks at Rawlins Village, and since 1912, to Butler's Village.  Additional drinking water comes from Nelson's Spring near Cotton Ground and Bath Spring.  [[Groundwater]] has been extracted since the 1990s, and mixed with the Source water.&lt;ref name="Vincent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=Swords, Ships &amp; Sugar|date=2002|publisher=Premiere Editions International, Inc.|location=Corvallis|isbn=9781891519055|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial deforestation===
[[File:Nevis-lookingtosea.jpg|175px|thumb|left|On the western plain, looking south-southwest towards Charlestown]]

During the 17th and 18th centuries, massive [[deforestation]] was undertaken by the planters as the land was initially cleared for sugar cultivation. This intense land exploitation by the sugar and cotton industry lasted almost 300 years, and greatly changed the island's [[ecosystem]].

In some places along the windswept southeast or "Windward" coast of the island, the landscape is radically altered compared with how it used to be in pre-colonial times.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Due to extreme land erosion, the top soil was swept away, and in some places at the coast, sheer cliffs as high as 25 metres (82&amp;nbsp;ft) have developed.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel (1990). "The Prehistoric Settlement Pattern of Nevis, West Indies". ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 16, No. 4  (Winter 1989), p. 428: "The breakup of the fringing reef has itself contributed to extensive and accelerating coastal erosion on the windward coast of the island, where sea cliffs of unconsolidated volcanic gravels as high as 25 m have developed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Thick forest once covered the eastern coastal plain, where the Amerindians built their first settlements during the Aceramic period, complimenting the ecosystem surrounding the [[coral reef]] just offshore. It was the easy access to fresh water on the island and the rich food source represented by the ocean life sheltered by the reef that made it feasible for the Amerindians to settle this area around 600 BC.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; With the loss of the natural vegetation, the balance in runoff nutrients to the reef was disturbed, eventually causing as much as 80 percent of the large eastern fringing reef to become inactive. As the reef broke apart, it in turn provided less protection for the coastline.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

During times of maximum cultivation, sugar cane fields stretched from the coastline of Nevis up to an altitude at which the mountain slopes were too steep and rocky to farm. Nonetheless, once the sugar industry was finally abandoned, vegetation on the leeward side of the island regrew reasonably well, as scrub and secondary forest.

===Water resources===
[[File:Nevis Hot Spring.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A hot volcanic spring-water bathing pool at the Bath Spring.]]

Nevis has several natural freshwater springs (including [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson's]] Spring). The island also has numerous non-potable volcanic [[hot spring]]s, including most notably the Bath Spring near Bath village, just south of the capital Charlestown.

After heavy rains, powerful rivers of rainwater pour down the numerous [[ravine]]s (known as ghauts). When the water reaches the coastline, the corresponding coastal ponds, both freshwater and brackish, fill to capacity and beyond, spilling over into the sea.

With modern development, the existing freshwater springs are no longer enough to supply water to the whole island. The water supply now comes mostly from Government wells. The major source of potable water for the island is groundwater, obtained from 14 active wells. Water is pumped from the wells, stored and allowed to flow by gravity to the various locations.&lt;ref name="ECLAC"&gt;The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

===Climate===
{{See also|Saint Kitts and Nevis#Climate}}
The climate is tropical with little variation, tempered all year round (but particularly from December through February) by the steady north-easterly winds, called the [[trade winds]]. There is a slightly hotter and somewhat rainier season from May to November.

Nevis lies within the track area of tropical storms and occasional hurricanes. These storms can develop between August and October. This time of year has the heaviest rainfalls.

== Economy ==

The official currency is the [[Eastern Caribbean dollar]] (EC$), which is shared by eight other territories in the region.

[[Joseph Parry (politician)|Joseph Parry]], leader of the opposition, has indicated that he favours constitutional reform over secession for Nevis. His party, the NRP, has historically been the strongest and most ardent proponent for Nevis independence; the party came to power with secession as the main campaign issue.

In ''Handbook of Federal Countries'' published by [[Forum of Federations]], the authors consider the constitution problematic because it does not "specifically outline" the federal financial arrangements or the means by which the central government and Nevis Island Administration can raise revenue: "In terms of the NIA, the constitution only states (in s. 108(1)) that 'all revenues...raised or received by the Administration...shall be paid into and form a fund styled the Nevis Island Consolidated Fund.' [...] Section 110(1) states that the proceeds of all 'takes' collected in St. Kitts and Nevis under any law are to be shared between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration based on population. The share going to the NIA, however, is subject to deductions (s. 110(2)), such as the cost of common services and debt charges, as determined by the Governor-General (s.110(3)) on the advice of the Prime Minister who can also take advice from the Premier of Nevis (s.110(4))."&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Griffiths, Ann Lynn and Karl Nerenberg (2002).

According to a 1995 report by the Commonwealth Observer Group of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], "the federal government is also the local government of St Kitts and this has resulted in a perception among the political parties in Nevis that the interests of the people of Nevis are being neglected by the federal government which is more concerned with the administration of St Kitts than with the federal administration."&lt;ref&gt;''General Election in St Kitts and Nevis 3 July 1995: The Report of the Commonwealth Observer Group''.

In 1996, four new bills were introduced in the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, one of which made provisions to have revenue derived from activities in Nevis paid directly to the treasury in Saint Kitts instead of to the treasury in Nevis. Another bill, The Financial Services Committee Act, contained provisions that all investments in Saint Kitts and Nevis would require approval by an investment committee in Saint Kitts. This was controversial, because ever since 1983 the Nevis Island Administration had approved all investments for Nevis, on the basis that the constitution vests legislative authority for industries, trades and businesses and economic development in Nevis to the Nevis Island Administration.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, Fred (2002). Commonwealth Caribbean Constitutional Law. Cavendish Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84314-429-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All three representatives from Nevis, including the leader of the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these bills into the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that the bills would affect the ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that the bills would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared the conviction that the bills, if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;

The constitutional crisis initially developed when the newly appointed Attorney General refused to grant permission for the Nevis Island Administration to assert its legal right in the Courts. After a decision of the High Court in favour of the Nevis Island Administration, the Prime Minister gave newspaper interviews stating that he "refused to accept the decision of the High Court".&lt;ref&gt;''St. Kitts and Nevis Observer'' July 16–22, 1995. Qtd. in The Concerned Citizens Movement. "The Way Forward For The Island Of Nevis." ''Nevis, Queen of the Caribees''. Nevis Island Administration, September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the deteriorating relationship between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government, a Constitutional Committee was appointed in April 1996 to advise on whether or not the present constitutional arrangement between the islands should continue. The committee recommended constitutional reform and the establishment of an island administration for Saint Kitts, separate from the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;

The Federal Government in Saint Kitts fills both functions today and Saint Kitts does not have an equivalent to the Nevis Island Administration. Disagreements between the political parties in Nevis and between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government have prevented the recommendations by the electoral committee from being implemented. The problematic political arrangement between the two islands therefore continues to date.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt;

Nevis has continued developing its own legislation, such as The Nevis International Insurance Ordinance and the Nevis International Mutual Funds Ordinance of 2004,&lt;ref name="Finance"&gt;As reported by the Premier at the official Web site for [http://www.nevisfinance.com/About.cfm?Idz=1 Nevis Financial Services Departments and the Ministry of Finance, Nevis]. Retrieved 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but calls for secession are often based on concerns that the legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration might be challenged again in the future.

====Fiscal motivation for secession====
The issues of political dissension between Saint Kitts and Nevis are often centred around perceptions of imbalance in the economic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Anckar, Dag (2001). "Party systems and voter alignments in small island states". In ''Party Systems and Voter Alignments Revisited''. Eds. Lauri Karvonen and Stein Kuhnle. Routledge, 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-23720-3}}. p. 270: "To a historical rivalry between the islands must be added a structural economic imbalance".&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by many scholars,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Duval, David Timothy (2004). ''Tourism in the Caribbean: Trends, Development, Prospects''. Routledge, 2004. {{ISBN|0-415-30361-3}}, p. 102: "Nevis has claimed domination and exploitation by St Kitts and has come to view St Kitts as the 'larger omnipresent looming partner' (Premdas 2000). Such mistreatment (whether real or perceived), combined with the subordinate island's distinctive cultural and historical identity, has fostered an ambivalent relationship between internal core and periphery. These accusations and counter-attacks have been entrenched in the countries' collective memory and have, to some degree, permeated many aspects of society." See also: Phillips, Fred (2002). ''Commonwealth Caribbean Constitutional Law'' Cavendish Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|1-84314-429-8}}: "In ''Freedom in the Caribbean'', reference was made to the long history of grievance nurtured by Nevis against St Kitts [ever since] imperial legislation brought Nevis into the unitary state of St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla in 1882."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevisians have often referred to a structural imbalance in Saint Kitts' favour in how funds are distributed between the two islands and this issue has made the movement for Nevis secession a constant presence in the island's political arena, with many articles appearing in the local press expressing concerns such as those compiled by Everton Powell in "What Motivates Our Call for Independence":&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Everton (Ed.)

* Many of the businesses that operate in Nevis are headquartered in Saint Kitts and pay the corporate taxes to Saint Kitts, despite the fact that profits for those businesses are derived from Nevis.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;
* The vast majority of Nevisians and residents of Nevis depart the Federation from Saint Kitts. This meant that departure taxes are paid in Saint Kitts.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;
* The bulk of cargo destined for Nevis enters the Federation through Saint Kitts. Custom duties are therefore paid in Saint Kitts.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;
* The largest expenditure for Nevis, approximately 29 percent of the Nevis Island Administration's recurrent budget, is education and health services, but the Nevis Island Legislature has no power to legislate over these two areas.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;
* Police, defense and coast guard are a federal responsibility. Charlestown Police Station, which served as the Headquarters for police officers in Nevis, was destroyed by fire in December 1991. Police officers initially had to operate out of the ruin, until the Nevis Island Administration managed to raise the resources to re-house the police.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;
* Nevis experiences an economic disadvantage because of preferential treatment by the federal government for development of Saint Kitts.

====1998 referendum====
{{See also|Nevis independence referendum, 1998}}
A referendum on secession from the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis was held in 1998. Although 62% voted in favor of a secession, a two-thirds majority would have been necessary for the referendum to succeed.

== Government ==
{{main|Parishes of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

The island of Nevis is divided into five administrative subdivisions called [[parish]]es, each of which has an elected representative in the Nevis Island Assembly. The division of this almost round island into parishes was done in a [[circular sector]] pattern, so each parish is shaped like a pie slice, reaching from the highest point of [[Nevis Peak]] down to the coastline.

The parishes have double names, for example [[Saint George Gingerland]]. The first part of the name is the name of the [[patron saint]] of the parish church, and the second part of the name is the traditional [[common name]] of the parish. Often the parishes are referred to simply by their common names. The religious part of a parish name is sometimes written or pronounced in the possessive: Saint George's Gingerland.

The five parishes of Nevis are:
* [[Saint George Gingerland]]
* [[Saint James Windward]]
* [[Saint John Figtree]]
* [[Saint Paul Charlestown]]
* [[Saint Thomas Lowland]]

== Culture ==
{{See also|Music of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts Creole}}

''Culturama'', the annual cultural festival of Nevis, is celebrated during the Emancipation Day weekend, the first week of August. The festivities include many traditional folk dances, such as the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]], the [[Moko jumbies]] on stilts, Cowboys and Indians, and Plait the Ribbon, a [[May pole]] dance. The celebration was given a more organised form in 1974, including a Miss Culture Show and a [[Calypso music|Calypso]] Competition, as well as drama performances, old fashion Troupes (including Johnny Walkers, Giant and Spear, Bulls, Red Cross and Blue Ribbon), arts and crafts exhibitions and recipe competitions. According to the Nevis Department of Culture, the aim is to protect and encourage indigenous folklore, in order to make sure that the uniquely Caribbean culture can "reassert itself and flourish".&lt;ref&gt;Nevis Department of Culture (2006).

===Language===
The official language is English yet, [[Saint Kitts Creole]] (known on the island as 'Nevisian' or 'Nevis creole') is also widely spoken. The local creole is actually more widely spoken on Nevis than on the neighbouring island.

===Music, theatre and dance===
Nevisian culture has since the 17th century incorporated African, European and East Indian cultural elements, creating a distinct Afro-Caribbean culture. Several historical anthropologists have done field research Nevis and in Nevisian [[Immigration|migrant]] communities in order to trace the creation and constitution of a Nevisian cultural community. Karen Fog Olwig published her research about Nevis in 1993, writing that the areas where the Afro-Caribbean traditions were especially strong and flourishing relate to [[kinship]] and [[subsistence farming]]. However, she adds, Afro-Caribbean cultural impulses were not recognised or valued in the colonial society and were therefore often expressed through Euro-Caribbean cultural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Olwig, Karen Fog (1993). ''Global Culture, Island Identity: continuity and change in the Afro-Caribbean community of Nevis''. Chur, Switzerland: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of European forms appropriated to express Afro-Caribbean culture are the Nevisian and Kittitian ''Tea Meetings'' and ''Christmas Sports''. According to anthropologist [[Roger D. Abrahams]], these traditional performance art forms are "Nevisian approximation of British performance codes, techniques, and patterns". He writes that the Tea Meetings were staged as theatrical "battles between decorum and chaos", [[decorum]] represented by the ceremony chairmen and chaos the hecklers in the audience, with a diplomatic King or a Queen presiding over the battle to ensure fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, Roger D. (1983). ''Man of Words in the West Indies: Performance and the Emergence of Creole Culture''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins U P, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christmas Sports included a form of comedy and satire based on local events and gossip.&lt;ref name="Abrahams1" /&gt; They were historically an important part of the Christmas celebrations in Nevis, performed on Christmas Eve by small troupes consisting of five or six men accompanied by string bands from different parts of the island. One of the men in the troupe was dressed as a woman, playing all the female parts in the dramatisations. The troupes moved from yard to yard to perform their skits, using props, face paint and costumes to play the roles of well-known personalities in the community. Examples of gossip about undesired behaviour that could surface in the skits for comic effect were querulous neighbours, adulterous affairs, planters mistreating workers, domestic disputes or abuse, crooked politicians and any form of stealing or cheating experienced in the society. Even though no names were mentioned in these skits, the audience would usually be able to guess who the heckling message in the troupe's dramatised portrayals was aimed at, as it was played out right on the person's own front yard. The acts thus functioned as social and moral commentaries on current events and behaviours in Nevisian society. This particular form is called "Bazzarding" by many locals. Abrahams theorises that Christmas Sports are rooted in the pre-emancipation Christmas and New Year holiday celebrations, when the enslaved population had several days off.&lt;ref name="Abrahams1"&gt;Abrahams, Roger D. (1973). "Christmas Mummings on Nevis." North Carolina Folklore Journal (1973): pp. 120–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

American folklorist and musicologist [[Alan Lomax]] visited Nevis in 1962 in order to conduct long-term research into the black folk culture of the island. His field trip to Nevis and surrounding islands resulted in the anthology ''Lomax Caribbean Voyage'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, John.

Retrieved 8 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among the  Nevisians recorded were [[chantey]]-singing fishermen in a session organised in a rum shop in Newcastle; Santoy, the Calypsonian, performing [[Calypso music|calypsos]] by Nevisian ballader and local legend Charles Walters&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, Roger D.

Western Folklore, Vol. 27, No. 2 (Apr. 1968), pp. 77–95.&lt;/ref&gt; to guitar and [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]; and [[string band]]s, [[fife]] players and drummers from Gingerland, performing [[quadrilles]].

The island is also known for "Jamband music", which is the kind of music performed by local bands during the "Culturama Festival" and is key to "Jouvert" dancing.  The sounds of the so-called "Iron Band" are also popular within the culture; many locals come together using any old pans, sinks, or other kits of any sort; which they  use to create sounds and music. This form of music is played throughout the villages during the Christmas and carnival seasons.

===Architecture===
[[File:The Museum of Nevis History - Alexander Hamilton birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Museum of Nevis History]], Charlestown, housed in the restored Georgian building where [[Alexander Hamilton]] was born.]]
A series of earthquakes during the 18th century severely damaged most of the colonial-era stone buildings of Charlestown. The [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] stone buildings in Charlestown that are visible today had to be partially rebuilt after the earthquakes, and this led to the development of a new architectural style, consisting of a wooden upper floor over a stone ground floor; the new style resisted earthquake damage much more effectively.

Two famous Nevisian buildings from the 18th century are Hermitage Plantation, built of [[lignum vitae]] wood in 1740, the oldest surviving wooden house still in use in the Caribbean today, and the Bath Hotel, the first hotel in the Caribbean, a luxury hotel and spa built by John Huggins in 1778. The soothing waters of the hotel's [[hot spring]] and the lively social life on Nevis attracted many famous Europeans including Antigua-based [[Admiral Nelson]], and Prince William Henry, [[Duke of Clarence]], (future [[William IV of the United Kingdom]]), who attended balls and private parties at the Bath Hotel. Today, the building serves as government offices, and there are two outdoor hot-spring bathing spots which were specially constructed in recent years{{When|date=November 2018}} for public use.

An often repeated legend appears to suggest that a destructive 1680 or 1690 earthquake and [[tsunami]] destroyed the buildings of the original capital Jamestown on the west coast. [[Folklore|Folk tales]] say that the town sank beneath the ocean, and the tsunami is blamed for the escape of (possibly fictional) pirate [[Red Legs Greaves]].&lt;ref name="Gosse - Who’s Who"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gosse|first1=Philip|title=The Pirates' Who's Who by Philip Gosse|date=1924|publisher=Burt Franklin|location=New York|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19564/19564-h/19564-h.htm|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologists from the [[University of Southampton]] who have done excavations in the area, have found no evidence to indicate that the story is true. They state that this story may originate with an over-excited Victorian letter writer sharing somewhat exaggerated accounts of his exotic life in the tropical colony with a British audience back home.&lt;ref&gt;Machling, Tessa (2002). "Jamestown, Morton's Bay and James Fort: Myth, Port and Fort". ''Interim Report for the 2002 Season, Theme Two.'' University of Southampton.&lt;/ref&gt; One such letter recounts that so much damage was done to the town that it was completely evacuated, and was engulfed by the sea. Early maps do not, however, actually show a settlement called "Jamestown", only "Morton's Bay", and later maps show that all that was left of  Jamestown/Morton's Bay in 1818 was a building labelled "Pleasure House". Very old bricks that wash up on Pinney's Beach after storms may have contributed to this legend of a sunken town; however these bricks are thought to be dumped ballast from 17th and 18th century sailing ships.

[[File:Frozenground.gif|thumb|Northern Hemisphere [[permafrost]] (permanently frozen ground) in purple]]

The '''polar regions''', also called the '''frigid [[geographical zone|zones]]''', of [[Earth]] are the [[region]]s of the planet that surround its [[geographical pole]]s (the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s), lying within the [[polar circle]]s. These '''high latitudes''' are dominated by Earth's [[polar ice cap]]s: [[Arctic ice pack|the northern]] resting on the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[Antarctic ice sheet|the southern]] on the continent of [[Antarctica]].

== Terrestrial polar regions ==
===Definitions===
The [[Arctic]] has various definitions, including the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (currently Epoch 2010 at 66°33'44" N), or the region north of [[60th parallel north|60° north]] latitude, or the region from the North Pole south to the [[Tree line|timberline]]. The [[Antarctic]] is usually defined as south of [[60th parallel south|60° south]] latitude, or the continent of Antarctica. The 1959 [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] uses the former definition.

The two polar regions are distinguished from the other two climatic and biomatic belts of Earth, a [[tropics]] belt near the equator, and two [[middle latitudes|middle latitude]] regions located between the tropics and polar regions.

===Climate===
{{main|Polar climate}}
Polar regions receive less intense [[solar radiation]] than the other parts of Earth because the sun's energy arrives at an oblique angle, spreading over a larger area, and also travels a longer distance through the Earth's atmosphere in which it may be absorbed, scattered or reflected, which is the same thing that causes winters to be colder than the rest of the year in temperate areas.

The [[axial tilt]] of the Earth has a major [[Effect of sun angle on climate|effect on climate]] of the polar regions. Since the polar regions are the farthest from the [[equator]], they receive the least amount of sunlight and are therefore frigid. The large amount of ice and snow also reflects a large part of what little sunlight the Polar regions receive, contributing to the cold. Polar regions are characterized by the [[polar climate]], extremely cold temperatures, heavy [[glaciation]] wherever there is sufficient [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to form permanent ice, and extreme variations in daylight hours, with [[midnight sun|twenty-four hours of daylight]] in summer, and [[polar night|complete darkness]] at [[winter|mid-winter]].

===Circumpolar Arctic region===
[[File:Polar Bear 2004-11-15.jpg|thumb|North polar region polar bears]]

There are many settlements in Earth's north polar region. Countries with claims to Arctic regions are: the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Canada]] ([[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]), [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]]. Arctic circumpolar populations often share more in common with each other than with other populations within their national boundaries. As such, the northern polar region is diverse in human settlements and cultures.

===Antarctica and the Southern sea===

{{see also|Antarctica}}
The southern polar region has no permanent human habitation. [[McMurdo Station]] is the largest research station in [[Antarctica]], run by the [[United States]]. Other notable stations include [[Palmer Station]] and [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] (United States), [[Esperanza Base]] and [[Marambio Base]] ([[Argentina]]), [[Scott Base]] ([[New Zealand]]), and [[Vostok Station]] (Russia).

While there are no indigenous human cultures, there is a complex ecosystem, especially along Antarctica's [[coast]]al zones.  Coastal [[upwelling]] provides abundant nutrients which feeds [[krill]], a type of marine [[crustacea]], which in turn feeds a complex of living creatures from penguins to blue whales.

'''Regional organizations''' ('''ROs''') are, in a sense, [[international organization]]s (IOs), as they incorporate international membership and encompass [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] entities that operationally transcend a single [[nation state]]. However, their membership is characterized by boundaries and demarcations characteristic to a defined and unique geography, such as continents, or geopolitics, such as [[trade bloc|economic blocs]]. They have been established to foster cooperation and political and economic integration or dialogue among states or entities within a restrictive geographical or geopolitical boundary. They both reflect common patterns of development and history that have been fostered since the end of [[World War II]] as well as the fragmentation inherent in [[globalization]]. Most ROs tend to work alongside well-established multilateral organizations such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "Cooperation with regional organizations", in ''Annual Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization 1995'', ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; While in many instances a regional organization is simply referred to as an international organization, in many others it makes sense to use the term ''regional organization'' to stress the more limited scope of a particular membership. 

Examples of ROs include, a.o., the&lt;!--alphabetically--&gt; [[African Union]] (AU), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), [[Arab League]] (AL), [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EEU), [[European Union]] (EU), [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), [[Union for the Mediterranean]] (UfM), [[Union of South American Nations]] (USAN).

The '''Upper Sûre Natural Park''' ({{lang-lb|Naturpark Uewersauer}}, {{lang-fr|Parc Naturel de la Haute-Sûre}}, {{lang-de|Naturpark Obersauer}}) is a national park in north-western [[Luxembourg]].  Located in the [[Oesling]] region, the park is primarily an area of conservation and a specially protected area for wild birds.

At the heart of the park is the [[Upper Sûre Lake]], the largest area of water in Luxembourg.

==Objectives==
The objectives of the park are threefold:
*To protect the natural environment and ecosystem. The main principle underlying ecosystem protection in the park is that the environment is an integral network in which each element interacts and affects the functioning of the while. This means preserving the indigenous flora and fauna as well as protecting the purity of air, water, and soil quality.
*To develop economic activity, mostly forestry and low-density tourism as a means of creating employment and a high quality life. As a result, the transportation infrastructure throughout the park is excellent.  To achieve this, the park provides a host of leisure activities, from nature walks to tours of cultural monuments, to water sports on the Upper Sûre Lake. More than {{convert|500|km|mi}} of well maintained footpaths make this a popular spot for day trippers and a wide range of accommodation for the vacationer. A fair and festival is held in the park annually on the first weekend in July.
*To preserve the [[architecture|architectural]] heritage of the area, which ranges from large numbers of [[chapel]]s and disused mills to former slate [[quarry|quarries]] and castle ruins.

'''Wa State''' ([[Wa language|Wa]]: ''Mēng Vax'' or ''Meung Va''; {{zh |c = 佤邦 |p = Wǎ Bāng }}; [[Burmese language|Burmese]]: {{lang|my|ဝပြည်နယ်}}) is an unrecognised state in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) that is currently subsumed under the official '''Wa Special Region 2''' of northern [[Shan State]].&lt;ref name="phoenix"&gt;2004-12-29, [http://www.phoenixtv.com/phoenixtv/76575495906394112/20041229/477702.shtml 佤帮双雄], [[Phoenix TV]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,397549,00.html Soldiers of Fortune], Time Magazine. '''Quote:''' ''In return for keeping the peace, the UWSA was given full autonomy over what the regime termed "Special Region No. 2," which Bao christened "Wa state."''&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative capital is [[Pangkham]] ({{zh |c = 邦康 |p = Bāngkāng }}, formerly known as Panghsang, 邦桑). The name ''Wa'' derives from the [[Wa people|Wa ethnic group]], who speak a language in the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] family of languages.

Many of the Wa are [[animist]]s, and a small proportion of the population follows a derivative of either [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]]. The Wa were once known as the "Wild Wa" by the British due to their practice of [[headhunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/10/idUSBKK83023  "Headhunting days are over for Myanmar's "Wild Wa"", Reuters, Sep 10, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics and society ==
{{See also|United Wa State Party}}

Wa State is divided into northern and southern regions which are separated from one another, with the {{convert|13000|sqkm|abbr=on}} southern region bordering Thailand and consisting of 200,000 people.&lt;ref name="jqgc" /&gt; The total area of the region controlled by the Wa State is {{convert|17000|sqkm|abbr=on}}. Political leaders of the Wa State are mostly ethnic [[Wa people]]. The government of the Wa State emulates many political features of the government of [[China]], having a Central Committee and a central party known as the United Wa State Party. Whilst the Wa State is ''de facto'' highly autonomous from the control of the central Myanmar government,&lt;ref&gt;2009年9月, [http://www.ide.go.jp/Japanese/Research/Region/Asia/Radar/200909.html 不透明さ増すミャンマー情勢:2010年総選挙に向けて], IDE-JETRO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2011年11月15日, [http://www.excite.co.jp/News/reviewbook/20111115/E1321281192211.html 地図にない街、ワ州潜入ルポが凄い『独裁者の教養』], エキサイトレビュー&lt;/ref&gt; their relationship is based on peaceful coexistence and the Wa State recognises the sovereignty of the central government over all of Myanmar.&lt;ref name=jqgc&gt;2011-10-13, [http://www.jqgc.com/zgjq/18033.shtml 缅甸佤邦竟然是一个山寨版的中国], 军情观察&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quote:''' ''The official languages (designated by the current UWSP administration) are Mandarin and Wa.''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Southwest Mandarin]] and [[Wa language|Wa]] widely spoken by the population, with the language of education being [[Standard Mandarin Chinese]]. Television broadcasts within the Wa State are broadcast in [[Standard Chinese]] and Wa. Commodities within the Wa State are brought over from China, and the [[Renminbi]] is used for exchanges. [[China Mobile]] has cellular coverage over some parts of the Wa State.&lt;ref name=jqgc/&gt;

== History ==
For a long time, headman tribes were dispersed around the Wa mountainous area, with no unified governance. During the [[Qing dynasty]], the region became separated from the tribal military control of the [[Dai people]]. [[British rule in Burma]] did not administer the Wa States&lt;ref name="JGS"&gt;[[Sir J. George Scott]], ''Burma : a handbook of practical information''. London 1906, p.&lt;/ref&gt; and the border with China was left undefined.&lt;ref name="GanesanHlaing2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=N Ganesan|editor2=Kyaw Yin Hlaing|title=''Myanmar: State, Society and Ethnicity''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRQa0RuucF8C&amp;pg=PA269|date=February 1, 2007| publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-230-434-6| page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1940s, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], remnants of the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] retreated to territory within Burma as the communists took over mainland China. Within the mountain region [[Kuomintang]] forces of the [[:zh:泰北孤軍|Eighth Army 237 division and 26th Army 93 division]] held their position for two decades in preparation for a counterattack towards mainland China. Under pressure from the United Nations, the counterattack was cancelled and the army was recalled to northern Thailand and later back to [[Taiwan]]; however, some troops decided to remain within Burma. East of the [[Salween river]], indigenous tribal guerilla groups exercised control with the support of the Burmese Communist Party.

During the 1960s, the Burmese Communist Party lost its base of operations within central Burma, and with the assistance of the Chinese communists, expanded within the border regions. Many intellectual youths from China joined the Burmese Communist Party, and these forces also absorbed many local guerillas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wastate.com.cn/culturenewsInfo.asp?id=92 佤邦歷史], Wa State government&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese communists gained control over Pangkham, which became their base of operations.

At the end of the 1980s, the ethnic minorities of northeast Burma became politically separated from the Burmese Communist Party. On 17 April 1989, Bao Youxiang's armed forces announced their separation from the Burmese Communist Party, and formed the United Myanmar Ethnics Party, which later became the United Wa State Party. On 18 May, the Wa State and Myanmar military junta formed a ceasefire agreement.

Tensions between the central government and Wa state were heightened in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5385:myanmar-krieg-mit-rebellen-im-wa-staat-droht&amp;catid=28&amp;Itemid=70 Myanmar: Krieg mit Rebellen im Wa-Staat droht]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, peace initiative proposals by the Wa State were rejected by the Myanmar government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3000:naypyitaw-turns-down-was-latest-proposal&amp;catid=85:politics&amp;Itemid=266 Naypyitaw turns down Wa’s latest proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222015620/http://www.shanland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3000%3Anaypyitaw-turns-down-was-latest-proposal&amp;catid=85%3Apolitics&amp;Itemid=266 |date=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government warned on 27 April 2010 that the WHP program could push Myanmar and the Wa State into further conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3014:shan-rebel-leader-warns-burma-army&amp;catid=85:politics&amp;Itemid=266 Shan rebel leader warns Burma Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222015618/http://www.shanland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3014%3Ashan-rebel-leader-warns-burma-army&amp;catid=85%3Apolitics&amp;Itemid=266 |date=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communism ===
After the Communist Party of Burma lost control of its bases in central Burma in the late 1960s, it re-established itself in the northeast including Wa State, with the support of [[China]]. The Wa, like other ethnic groups were fighting for autonomy from Burma, and supported the CPB. They eventually rebelled along with the Kokang against the Burmese communist leadership, which was forced into exile across the Chinese border, at the time of the [[8888 Uprising]] in mainland Burma. Following the subsequent collapse of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP) rule under [[Ne Win]] in Burma, the WNO made ceasefire and peace agreements with the new military regime, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC).

== Subdivisions ==
Wa State comprises seven districts (townships) of what the Myanmar government officially deems as the Shan State. Internally, Wa State administers 15 districts within its territory.

== Geography and economy ==
[[File:Wa state.png|thumb|right|220px|Map of the Wa State]]

The region is mainly mountainous, with deep valleys. The lowest points are approximately 600 metres above sea level, with the highest mountains over 3000 metres. Initially the Wa State was heavily reliant on opium production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asienhaus.de/public/archiv/focus26-045.pdf Die Wa in Gefahr] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; With Chinese assistance, there has been a move towards growing rubber and tea plantations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmanet.org/news/2007/02/20/xinhua-general-news-service-china-develops-more-substitute-crops-for-opium-poppy-in-bordering-countries/ "Xinhua General News Service: China develops more substitute crops for opium poppy in bordering countries"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Wa State cultivates 220,000 acres of rubber.&lt;ref name="not fair"/&gt; Due to the resettlement of residents from mountainous areas to fertile valleys,&lt;ref name="nachrichten"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/BN2005-02-25.html BURMA NACHRICHTEN 4/2005, 25.

=== Illicit drug trade ===
{{See also|United Wa State Army}}

Using its 30,000 personnel, the [[United Wa State Army]] (UWSA) is the largest [[narcotics trafficking]] organization in [[Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It was once allied with the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (4,000 soldiers). The UWSA cultivates vast areas of land for the [[opium]] [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], which is later refined to [[heroin]]. [[Methamphetamine]] trafficking is also important to the economy of the Wa State.&lt;ref name="not fair"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-wa-idUSKCN1270R3?il=0 Myanmar's strongest ethnic armed group says drug label 'not fair']&lt;/ref&gt; The money from the [[opium]] is used for weapons. Although the [[Burmese government]] has begun taking measures to decrease the production of such drugs, it is an arduous task due to corruption at high levels in the government and a lack of infrastructure to carry out operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130128213515/http://www.mjfqw.com/bencandy.php?fid=44&amp;id=3007 缅甸第二特区佤邦,一切好象是中国的一个延伸], 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Wa State was declared by the UWSP as a drug-free zone and the cultivation of opium was prohibited.&lt;ref name="nachrichten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/myanmar/myanmar_strategic_programme_framework.pdf Myanmar Strategic Programme Framework]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water Remote Sensing''' studies the [[color of water]] through the observation of the [[spectrum]] of water leaving radiation. From the study of this spectrum, the concentration of optically active components of the upper layer of the water body can be concluded via specific [[algorithms]].&lt;ref name="Laanen"&gt;Laanen, M.L. (2007)."[http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/10799/8066.pdf?sequence=5Jun Yellow Matters- Improving the remote sensing of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter in inland freshwaters]" Ph.D. Thesis. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: The NL.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Water quality]] monitoring by [[remote sensing]] and close-range instruments has obtained considerable attention since the founding of EU Water Framework Directive.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;
[[File:The path covered by light from the sun through the water body to the remote sensing sensor.jpg|thumbnail|right|The path covered by light from the sun through the water body to the remote sensing sensor &lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;]]

== History ==

If water remote sensing is defined as the observation of the water from a distance in order to describe its color, without taking water samples, the gradual development of understanding of the transparency of natural waters and of the reason of their clarity variability and coloration has been sketched from the times of Henry Hudson (1600) to those of Chandrasekhara Raman (1930).&lt;ref&gt;Marcel, R., Wernand &amp; Winfried W.C.Gieskes (2012), "Ocean Optics from 1600 (Hudson) to 1930 (Raman) Shifting interpretation of natural water colouring", Paris, France: Union des oceanographes de France (published 1 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of water remote sensing techniques (by the use of satellite imaging, aircraft or close range optical devices) didn't start until the early 1970s. These first techniques measured the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] and thermal differences in the emitted energy from water surfaces. In general, empirical relationships were settled between the spectral properties and the water quality parameters of the water body.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;Ritchie, J.C; Zimba, P.V.; Everitt, J.H. (2003), “Remote Sensing Techniques to Assess Water Quality”, American Society for Photogrammetry Engineering and Remote Sensing, 69:695-704.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Ritchie et al. (1974) &lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, J.C.; McHenry, J.R.; Schiebe, F.R.; Wilson, R.B.(1974),“The relationship of reflected solar radiation and the concentration of sediment in the surface water of reservoirs”,Remote
 Sensing of Earth Resources Vol. III (F. Shahrokhi, editor),The University of Tennessee Space Institute, Tullahoma, Tennessee,3:57–72&lt;/ref&gt; developed an empirical approach to determine suspended sediments. This kind of empirical models are only able to use to determine water quality parameters of water bodies with similar conditions. In 1992 an analytical approach was used by Schiebe et al. (1992).&lt;ref name="Schiebe"&gt;Schiebe, F.R., Harrington, Jr., J.A.; Ritchie, J.C. (1992), “Remote sensing of suspended sediments: The Lake Chicot, Arkansas project”, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 13(8):1487–1509&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was based on the optical characteristics of water and water quality parameters to elaborate a physically based model of the relationship between the spectral and physical properties of the surface water studied. This physically based model was successfully applied in order to estimate suspended sediment concentrations.&lt;ref name="Ritchie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schiebe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Harrington, J.A., Jr., Schiebe, F.R.; Nix, J.F. (1992). “Remote sensing of Lake Chicot, Arkansas: Monitoring suspended sediments, turbidity and secchi depth with Landsat MSS”, Remote Sensing of Environment, 39(1):15–27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Water Remote sensing instruments allow to record the color of a water body, which provides information on the presence and abundance of optically active natural water components. The water color spectrum is defined as an apparent optical property (AOP) of the water. This means that the color of the water is influenced by the angular distribution of the light field and by the nature and quantity of the substances in the medium, in this case, water.&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"&gt;IOCCG (2000). Remote Sensing of Ocean Colour in Coastal, and Other Optically-Complex Waters. Sathyendranath, S. (ed.), Reports of the International Ocean-Colour Coordinating Group, No. 3, IOCCG, Dartmouth, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the value of this parameter will change with changes in the optical properties and concentrations of the optically active substances in the water, the inherent optical properties or IOPS.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt; The IOPS are independent from the angular distribution of light but they are dependent from the type and substances present in the medium as well.&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"/&gt; For instance, the diffuse [[attenuation coefficient]] of downwelling irradiance, Kd (it is often used as an index of water clarity or [[ocean turbidity]]) is defined as an AOP, while the [[absorption coefficient]] and the scattering coefficient of the medium are defined as IOPS.&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"/&gt;
There are two different approaches to determine the concentration of optically active water components by the study of the spectra. The first approach consist of empirical algorithms based on statistical relationships and the second approach consists of analytical algorithms based on the inversion of calibrated bio-optical models.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"/&gt; Accurate calibration of the relationships/models used is an important condition for successful inversion on water remote sensing techniques and the determination of concentration of water quality parameters from observed spectral remote sensing data.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;
Thus, these techniques depend on their ability to record these changes in the spectral signature of light backscattered from water surface and relate these recorded changes to water quality parameters via empirical or analytical approaches. Depending of the water constituents of interest and the sensor used, different parts of the spectrum will be analysed.&lt;ref name="Ritchie" /&gt;

[[File:Specific phytoplankton absorption spectra.xcf|thumbnail|right|Example of specific phytoplankton absorption spectra. In this graph the characteristic blue and red Ch-a peaks at 438 nm and 676 nm can be seen. Another visible peak is the Cyanophicocianin absorption maximum at 624 nm.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;]]By the use of Optical close range devices (e.g. [[spectrometers]], [[radiometers]]), airplanes or helicopters (airborne remote sensing) and satellites (space born remote sensing), the light reflected from the water bodies is measured. For instance, algorithms are used to retrieve parameters such as [[chlorophyll-a]](Chl-a) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentration, the absorption by [[colored dissolved organic matter]] at 440&amp;nbsp;nm (aCDOM) and [[secchi depth]].&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt; The measurement of these values will give an idea about the water quality of the water body being studied. A very high concentration of green pigments like chlorophyll might indicate the presence of an algal bloom, for example, due to eutrophication processes. Thus, the chlorophyll concentration could be used as a proxy or indicator for the trophic condition of a water body. In the same manner, other optical quality parameters such as suspended particles or Suspended Particulate matter (SPM), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Transparency (Kd), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) can be used to monitor water quality.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;

The '''''Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties''''' ({{zh|t=元和郡縣圖志|s=元和郡县图志|p=Yuánhé jùn xiàn tú zhì|w='''Yüan-he chün hsien t'u chih'''}}) compiled by [[Li Jifu]] during the [[Yuanhe reign]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]] is one of the earliest and most complete [[gazetteer]]s of China.&lt;ref name="Li_JiF"&gt;Li, Jifu, and He, Cijun: Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gazetteer was composed of 40 volumes of text with map and a two volume list of contents. The work was divided up by the 47 key geographic areas (镇) that existed at the time. Each area section included a map and was further broken down by prefecture, state, rivers, military battle sites, etc.

Currently only 34 volumes still exist. By the time of the Southern [[Song Dynasty]], the maps, list of contents, and six volumes were missing (Volumes 19, 20, 23, 24, 35, and 36). Because of the loss of the maps, the work is sometimes just titled '''''Yuanhe Records of Prefectures and Counties''''' (元和郡縣志/元和郡县志).
