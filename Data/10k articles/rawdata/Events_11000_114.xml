[[File:Amaury Sport Organisation logo.svg|thumb|Amaury Sport Organisation logo]]
The '''Amaury Sport Organisation''' (ASO) is part of the [[France|French]] media group, EPA ([[Éditions Philippe Amaury]]). It organises sporting events including the [[Tour de France]], [[Vuelta a España]] and [[Paris–Nice]] professional [[road bicycle racing|cycle road races]], and the [[Dakar Rally]]. In 2008 it organised the [[Central Europe Rally]], a [[rally raid]] [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]] in [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=aso_rt&gt;[http://www.centraleuroperally.com/2008/CER/presentation/us/r3_5-le-parcours.html Central Europe Rally 2008: 2008 Edition &gt; The Route&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428075332/http://www.centraleuroperally.com/2008/CER/presentation/us/r3_5-le-parcours.html |date=2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tour de France was instituted by the [[newspaper]] ''[[L'Auto]]'' in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letour.fr/indexus.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was closed after the 1939-45 War because of its links with the occupying Germans and a new paper, [[L'Équipe]], took over. ''L'Équipe'' (now part of EPA) organised the Tour until the race was taken over by its parent company, ASO.

ASO organises the [[Paris Marathon]], cycling events in [[Africa]] ([[Tour du Faso]]) and the Middle East ([[Tour of Qatar]]), [[golf]] (the [[Open de France]], [[Lacoste Ladies Open de France]] and [[Grand Prix Schweppes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aso.fr/fr/golf.html|title=Golf|publisher=ASO|language=French|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[sailing]] ([[Tour de France à la voile]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aso.fr/fr/voile.html|title=Voile|language=French|accessdate=25 August 2012|publisher=ASO}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASO also organises [[cyclosportive]]s events for amateur cyclists, including the [[L'Étape du Tour]] and [[La Etapa de la Vuelta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aso.fr/fr/epreuves-de-masse.html|title=Épreves grands public|language=French|publisher=ASO|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of ASO is Jean-Etienne Amaury, son of EPA founder [[Philippe Amaury]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

'''Apparent death''', colloquially known as '''playing dead''', '''feigning death''', or '''playing possum''', is a behavior in which animals take on the appearance of being [[death|dead]].  This form of [[Deception in animals|animal deception]] is an [[adaptive behavior]] also known as '''tonic immobility''' or '''thanatosis'''.  Apparent death can be used as a [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]] or as a form of [[aggressive mimicry]], and occurs in a wide range of animals.

When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as '''animal hypnosis'''.  According to Gilman et al.,&lt;ref name="Gilman et al., 1950"&gt;Gilman, T.T., Marcuse, F.L. and Moore, A.U., (1960). Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens. Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology, 43: 99-111&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation of "animal hypnosis" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily [[paralysed]] and unresponsive to external stimuli.  In most cases, this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator, although in [[sharks]] exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"&gt;Henningsen, A.D., (1994).  Tonic immobility in 12 elasmobranchs - use as an aid in captive husbandry. Zoo Biology 13: 325-332. {{doi|10.1002/zoo.1430130406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility.&lt;ref name="Jones 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.B|title=The tonic immobility reaction of the domestic fowl: a review|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=42|issue=1|year=1986|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.

===In sharks===
Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. [[dogfish sharks]], [[lemon shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watsky, M.A., and Gruber, S.H. (1990) Induction and duration of tonic immobility in the lemon shark, ''Negaprion brevirostris''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 8: 207-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davie, P.S., Franklin, C.E., and Grigg, G.C. (1993) Blood pressure and heart rate during tonic immobility in the black tipped reef shark, ''Carcharhinus melanoptera''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 12: 95-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[tiger shark]]s (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour.  Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical [[shark repellent]] has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tonic immobility|website=Shark defense: Chemical repellents|url=http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|accessdate=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, M.R., Dill, L.M., Marshall, G.J., and Buhleier, B. (2002) Habitat use and foraging behavior of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in a seagrass ecosystem. Marine Biology 140: 237-248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, K.N., Wetherbee, B.M., owe, C.G., and Meyer, C.G. (1999) Movements of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in coastal Hawaiian waters. Marine Biology 134: 665-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, E. J., et al. "The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868)." Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60. SCOPUS. Web. 22 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lauren Smith|title=Orcas vs great white sharks: in a battle of the apex predators who wins?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/nov/16/orca-whales-vs-great-white-sharks-in-a-battle-of-the-apex-predators-who-wins|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teleost fishes===
[[Goldfish]], [[trout]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[brown bullhead]], [[medaka]], [[paradise fish]], and [[topminnow]] have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;Table 2 in: Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt; [[oscar (fish)|Oscars]] seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F.T. (1977) Induction and duration of tonic immobility. The Psychological Record 27: 89-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar behavior has been reported for [[convict tang]]s in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J.C. (1991) Field observations of death feigning in the convict tang, ''Acanthurus triostegus'' (Linnaeus), with comments on the nocturnal color pattern in juvenile specimens. Journal of Aquariculture and Aquatic Sciences 6: 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In marine mammals===
In 1997, it was reported that around the [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]], a female [[orca]] was seen apparently inducing tonic immobility in a [[great white shark]]. The orca held the shark upside down to induce TI and kept the shark still for 15 minutes, causing it to suffocate to death.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This was the first recorded case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans.

Another case of orcas apparently inducing TI has been observed with [[stingrays]] in [[New Zealand]]. In this context, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths then quickly right themselves.  This inverts the stingray, thereby inducing TI, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Channel "The Whale That Ate Jaws" 11/29/2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===In reptiles===
Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in [[iguana]]s by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular.  The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.&lt;ref name="Prestrude"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Prestrude, A.M.  |author2=Crawford, F.T.|title=Tonic immobility in the lizard, iguana iguana|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=18|issue=2|year=1970|pages=391–395|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(70)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility can also be induced in the [[Carolina anole]].  The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.&lt;ref name="Hennig"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tonic immobility in Anolis carolinensis: Effects of time and conditions of captivity|year=1978|journal=Behavioral Biology|author1=Hennig, C.W  |author2=Dunlap, W.P.|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/s0091-6773(78)91180-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In rabbits===
In [[rabbit]]s, the physiological and behavioral responses to induced tonic immobility have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state. Tonic immobility is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. A 2006 study concluded that rabbits show symptoms that are in line with being stressed after being in a tonic immobility state, such as a faster heart rate and breathing.&lt;ref name="McBride et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Anne |year=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |volume= |issue= |pages=135–137 |doi= |url= http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/54860 |accessdate=September 2, 2013|display-authors=etal}} (downloadable .doc file). • Click [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf here] for PDF copy from hopperhome.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms that the promotion of tonic immobility to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners – holding the rabbit on its back and thinking the rabbits enjoy it – is misplaced; however, the researchers concluded that inducing tonic immobility in rabbits is appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.&lt;ref name="McBride et al." /&gt;

===In humans===
Tonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. While "freezing" in response to life-threatening situations is well-known, the common "freeze" response exhibited by victims of rape is often misunderstood as passive consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/galliano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/ Why many rape victims don’t fight or yell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

There is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning.

===As a scientific tool===
Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.  It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970.&lt;ref name="Gallup et al., 1970"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., Nash, R.F., Potter, R.J. and Donegan, N.H., (1970). Effect of varying conditions of fear on immobility reactions in domestic chickens (Gallus gullus).  Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 73: 442-445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallup, 1979"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., (1979).  Tonic immobility as a measure of fear in the domestic fowl.  Animal Behaviour, 27: 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"&gt;Jones, B. and Faure, J.M. (1981). Tonic immobility ("righting time") in laying hens housed in cages and pens. Applied Animal Ethology 7: 369-372&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.&lt;ref name="Forkman et al., 2007"&gt;Forkman, B., Boissy, A. Meunier-Salaün, M.-C. Canali, E. and Jones, R.B., (2007). A critical review of fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and horses.  Physiology &amp; Behavior, 92: 340-374&lt;/ref&gt;

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds.  This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck.&lt;ref name="Zamudio et al., 2009"&gt;Zamudio, S.R., Quevedo-Corona, L., Garcés, L. and De La Cruz, F. (2009).  The effects of acute stress and acute corticosterone administration on the immobility response in rats.  Brain Research Bulletin, 80: 331-336&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.

Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens,&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"/&gt; hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels,&lt;ref name="Jones, 1987"&gt;Jones, R.B., (1987).

Fear levels in laying hens carried by hand and by mechanical conveyors. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 36: 337-345&lt;/ref&gt; and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.&lt;ref name="Cashman et al., 1989"&gt;Cashman P., Nicol, C.J. and Jones, R.B. (1989).  Effects of transportation on the tonic immobility fear reactions of broilers. British Poultry Science, 30: 211-221&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethology|animal behaviour]], thanatosis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|θανάτωσις}}, meaning "putting to death"; ''[[cf. ]]'': [[Thanatos]]) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a [[prey]] evading a [[predator]], a male trying to [[mating|mate]] with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The [[French people|French]] biologist [[Georges Pasteur]] classifies it as a form of ''self-mimesis'', a form of [[camouflage]] or [[mimicry]] in which the "mimic" imitates itself in a dead state.&lt;ref name=Pasteur /&gt;

===For defense===
For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;Pasteur, G. (1982). "[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 A classificatory review of mimicry systems]". ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''13''': 169–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced,&lt;ref name="beetle"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miyatake|first1 = T|last2 = Katayama|first2 = K.|last3 = Takeda|first3 = Y.|last4 = Nakashima|first4 = A.|last5 = Mizumoto|first5 = M.|year = 2004|title = Is death-feigning adaptive? Heritable variation in fitness difference of death-feigning behaviour|journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume = 271|pages = 2293–2296|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2858|pmid=15539355|last6=Mizumoto|first6=M|issue=1554|pmc=1691851|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive.

In the [[Hognose|hog-nosed snake]], a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as [[cat]]s, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when [[rat]]s try to eat them.&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of Life'' (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, the [[Virginia opossum]] is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. "[[wikt:play possum|Playing possum]]" is an idiomatic phrase which means "pretending to be dead".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|title =The Chambers Dictionary|publisher =Allied Publishers|year =1998|page=1279|isbn =978-81-86062-25-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Francq|first = E.|year = 1969|title = Behavioural aspects of feigned death in the opossum ''Didelphis marsupialis''|journal = American Midland Naturalist|volume = 81|pages = 556–568|doi = 10.2307/2423988|issue = 2|jstor = 2423988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |title=Playing Possum |publisher=Wonderful West Virginia |author=Ann Bailey Dunn |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110406/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[instinct]] does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/wildlife/index.php?subject=Mammals&amp;id=71|title=Virginia Opossum|publisher=Mass Audubon|accessdate=May 11, 2011|quote=Opossums are frequently encountered as corpses along highways. Some biologists believe that many die as they feed on road-killed animals – a favorite food. Others believe that the opossums’ small brain (5 times smaller than that of a raccoon) suggests that they may just be too dumb to get out of the way of vehicles!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a [[brown bear]] is to lie face down, cover the face with ones hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack&lt;/ref&gt;

"Playing possum" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], [[asleep]], or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;

Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp ''[[Nasonia vitripennis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = King|first = B.|author2=H. Leaich |year = 2006|title = Variation in propensity to exhibit thanatosis in ''Nasonia vitripennis'' (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)|journal = Journal of Insect Behaviour|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 241–249|doi = 10.1007/s10905-006-9022-7|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.3100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cricket, ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Nishino|first = H.|year = 2004|title = Motor output characterizing thanatosis in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal = Journal of Experimental Behaviour|volume =207|issue = 22|pages = 3899–3915|doi=10.1242/jeb.01220|pmid = 15472021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For reproduction===
In the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'', male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|gift-giving]] and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Line Spinner Hansen |author2=Sofia Fernandez Gonzales |author3=Søren Toft |author4=Trine Bilde |year=2008|title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis''|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=546–551|doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/546.full|accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For predation===
''[[Nimbochromis]]'' (sleeper cichlids), [[endemic]] to [[Lake Malawi]] in [[East Africa]], are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. ''N. livingstoni'' then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close.&lt;ref name="fish"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene S. Helfman |author2=Bruce B. Collette |author3=Douglas E.

The '''Atwood Music Festival''', the longest running festival of its kind in the state of [[Mississippi]], is an annual festival held near the banks of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] in [[Monticello, Mississippi]] on [[Memorial Day]] weekend in May. Originally the Atwood Bluegrass Music Festival, because of a variety of different music styles performed was renamed the Atwood Music Festival. The Festival began as a joint effort by the [[Pearl River Basin Development District]] and the [[Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce]] in 1975 to promote the [[Atwood Water Park]] that had recently been completed by the [[Basin District]].

The Festival has been known to draw people from all over the nation.

[[File:Basse danse couleur.jpg|thumb|A courtly basse dance]]

The '''basse danse''', or "low dance", was a popular [[court dance]] in the 15th and early 16th centuries, especially at the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian court]]. The word ''basse'' describes the nature of the dance, in which partners move quietly and gracefully in a slow gliding or walking motion without leaving the floor, while in livelier dances both feet left the floor in jumps or leaps. The basse danse was a precursor of the [[pavane]] as a dignified processional dance {{harv|Cole|n.d.}}. The term may apply to the dance or the music alone.

==History==
The earliest record of a basse danse is found in an [[Occitan]] poem of the 1320s by [[Raimon de Cornet]], who notes that the ''[[joglar]]s'' performed them.

The ''bassa danza'' is described in the dance treatise of [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]], in northern Italy towards the end of the 15th century, and by his friend [[Antonio Cornazzano]], for whom it was the queen of all dance measures, low dance to be contrasted with the ''alta danza'', the "high" or leaping dance called the ''[[saltarello]]''. In Germany it became the ''Hofdantz'' {{harv|Kirstein|1969|p=119}}.

[[Thoinot Arbeau]] used the basse danse to explain his method of dance notation in his ''Orchésographie'' (1589). The dance was danced until 1725 but was extinguished soon after by the "high" dance technique of ballet {{harv|Kirstein|1969|pp=200, 206}}

The general measure of the basse danse was elaborated into different named sequences of steps and movements {{harv|Kirstein|1969|p=119}}. The basic measure is counted in sixes but, like the later [[courante]], often combines {{music|time|6|4}} and {{music|time|3|2}} time, using [[hemiola]] to divide the six as 3–3 or as 2–2–2. This rhythm matches the basic steps of the dance. Most basse danse music is in [[binary form]] with each section repeated {{harv|Hanning|2006|p=209}}.

The basse danse was often followed by a [[tourdion]], due to their contrasting tempi, and these were danced and composed in pairs ''[[Suite (music)|en suite]]'' like the "[[pavane]] and [[galliard]]" and the "[[allemande]] and [[courante]]" ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Grove|1885}}).

Early music consisted of songs based on a [[tenor]] [[cantus firmus]] and the length of the choreography was often derived from the verse of the ''[[chanson]]''. In performance 3 or 4 instrumentalists would improvise the [[polyphony]] based on this tenor. In others multiple parts were written, though choice of instrumentation was left to the performers.

Most famous, perhaps, are the basses danses assembled in 1530 by [[Pierre Attaingnant]] in the "Attaingnant Dance Prints", which were for four voices, typically improvised upon by adding melodic embellishment (Attaingnant rarely wrote ornamentation, though he did in "Pavin of Albart", an embellishment on "Pavane 'Si je m'en vois'") {{harv|Bernard|1972}}.

== Dance steps ==
[[File:Basse danse.jpg|right|thumb| A 16th-century basse danse]]
A treatise in the [[Bibliothèque royale Albert Ier|Royal Library of Belgium]] in Brussels{{Full citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--Library, shelf number needed; modern edition if one is availabel, if not, a secondary source describing the treatise.--&gt; gives us information about the elements of basse danse and the [[choreography]] of specific examples. The basse danse is based upon four steps: ''pas simple'', ''pas double'', ''démarche'' (also known as the ''reprise'') and ''branle''.

* ''Pas simples'' are done in pairs, dancers take two steps (typically first left and then right) in one measure counting 2–2–2.
* In ''pas double'', dancers take instead three steps, counting 3-3. These steps take advantage of the hemiola feel of the basse danse.
* In the ''démarche'', dancers take a step backwards and shift their weight forward and then back in three motions in the feel of {{music|time|3|2}}.
* In the ''branle'', dancers step to the left, shifting their weight left, and then close again, in two motions in the feel of {{music|time|6|4}}.

The ''révérence'', occurring typically before or after the choreography, is a bow or curtsey that takes place over the course of one measure.

The '''Battle of Argoed Llwyfain''' was fought between the forces of the [[Rheged|Kingdom of Rheged]] under the command of [[Urien]] and [[Owain mab Urien]] and the forces of the [[Bernicia|Kingdom of Bernicia]] under ''Fflamddwyn'' (Firestealer or Flamebearer).&lt;ref name="bbcwales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/early-welsh-literature/pages/taliesin.shtml |title=BBC Wales - Arts - Early Welsh literature - Taliesin |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of what is known about the battle comes from the early Welsh poem ''Gwaith Argoed Llwyfain'' by the [[poet]] and [[bard]] [[Taliesin]].&lt;ref name="bbcwales"/&gt; Supposedly on one Saturday, ''Fflamddwyn'' had surrounded the seat of power within Rheged and demanded that [[Rheged#Kings of Rheged|King]] [[Urien]] submit and provide [[hostage]]s. Urien's son [[Owain mab Urien|Owain]] and his friend ''Cenau'' rejected this proposal. Urien then stirred his men and fighting began. In the ensuing combat Fflamddwyn was slain, temporarily freeing Rheged of the [[Angles|Anglian]] menace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The history of the Anglo-Saxons, comprising the history of England from the ... - Sharon Turner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jk8CAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taliesin; or, The bards and druids of Britain.

'''''Chimes at Midnight''''' (onscreen title&lt;ref&gt;http://imgur.com/a/URsRh&lt;/ref&gt; and UK title: '''''Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight)''''', Spanish release: '''''Campanadas a medianoche'''''), is a 1965 English-language Spanish-Swiss{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=290}} [[Historical period drama|period]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by and starring [[Orson Welles]]. The film's plot centres on [[William Shakespeare]]'s recurring character [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] and the father-son relationship he has with [[Henry V of England|Prince Hal]], who must choose between loyalty to his father, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], or Falstaff.

Welles said that the core of the film's story was "the betrayal of friendship." It stars Welles as Falstaff, [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] as [[Prince Hal]], [[John Gielgud]] as [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], [[Jeanne Moreau]] as [[Doll Tearsheet]] and [[Margaret Rutherford]] as [[Mistress Quickly]]. The script contains text from five of Shakespeare's plays; primarily ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', but also ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', as well as some dialogue from ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. [[Ralph Richardson]]'s narration is taken from the works of chronicler [[Raphael Holinshed]].

Welles had previously produced a Broadway stage adaptation of nine Shakespeare plays called ''Five Kings'' in 1939.  In 1960, he revived this project in Ireland as ''Chimes at Midnight'', which was his final on-stage performance. Neither of these plays were successful, but Welles considered portraying Falstaff to be his life's ambition and turned the project into a film. In order to get initial financing, Welles lied to producer [[Emiliano Piedra]] about intending to make a version of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', and keeping the film funded during its production was a constant struggle. Welles shot ''Chimes at Midnight'' throughout Spain between 1964 and 1965; it premiered at the [[1966 Cannes Film Festival]], winning two awards there.

Initially dismissed by most film critics, ''Chimes at Midnight'' is now regarded as one of Welles' highest achievements, and Welles himself called it his best work. Welles felt a strong connection to the character of Falstaff and called him "Shakespeare's greatest creation". Some film scholars and Welles' collaborators have made comparisons between Falstaff and Welles, while others see a resemblance between Falstaff and Welles' father. Disputes over the ownership of ''Chimes at Midnight'' made it difficult to view the film legally until recently. It was released in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray in 2015. A new restoration by [[Janus Films]] and [[The Criterion Collection]] was screened at the [[Film Forum]] in New York January 1–12, 2016. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on August 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28756-chimes-at-midnight|title=Chimes at Midnight|website=The Criterion Collection|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

The film opens with Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow walking through the snow, then to a warm fire inside the Boar's Head Tavern, as the two reminisce. After a main credit sequence, the narrator explains that King [[Henry IV of England]] has succeeded [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]], is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand that Henry rescue Mortimer. The king refuses, and thus Mortimer's cousins begin to plot Henry's overthrow.

To Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal spends most of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, drinking and carousing with prostitutes, thieves and other criminals under John Falstaff's patriarchal influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke.

Back at the Boar's Head Tavern, Falstaff begins to tell Hal and Poins with increasing exaggeration the story of how the money was stolen from him. Hal and Poins poke holes in Falstaff's tale until they reveal their joke to the entire group. In celebration of the newly recovered stolen treasure, Falstaff and Hal take turns impersonating Henry, with a cooking pot crown and vocal impressions. Falstaff's Henry chastises Hal for spending his time with common criminals, but names Sir John Falstaff as his one virtuous friend. Hal's Henry calls Falstaff a "misleader of youth".

Hal visits the King at the castle and Henry scolds him for his criminal and unethical life-style. Henry warns Hal about Hotspur's growing army and its threat to his crown. Hal passionately vows to his unimpressed father that he will defend Henry and redeem his good name. The King's army, including Falstaff, parades through the streets and off to war. Before the battle, Henry meets with Worcester and offers to forgive all of Hotspur's men of treason if they surrender immediately. Hal vows to personally kill Hotspur. Worcester returns to his camp and lies to Hotspur, telling him that Henry intends to execute all traitors.

The two armies meet in the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]], but Falstaff hides in shrubs for most of the conflict. After a long and bloody fight, the King's men win the battle, after which Hotspur and Hal meet alone and duel; as Falstaff watches, Hal kills Hotspur. Henry sentences Worcester to death and takes his men as prisoners. Falstaff brings Hotspur's body to Henry, claiming that he killed Hotspur; Henry does not believe Falstaff, instead looking disapprovingly at Hal and the ignoble company he keeps.

{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=18%|quote="I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;&lt;br /&gt;
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!&lt;br /&gt;
I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,&lt;br /&gt;
So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;&lt;br /&gt;
But, being awaked, I do despise my dream."&lt;br /&gt;
— ''Henry IV, Part 2'', Act 5, Scene 5}}

The narrator explains that all of Henry IV's rebellious enemies had been killed by 1408, but that Henry's health has begun to deteriorate. At the castle, Henry becomes upset when told that Hal is once again spending time with Falstaff, and collapses. Hal visits the castle and discovers that Henry is sicker than he had realized. Hal vows to Henry to be a good and noble king. Henry finally has faith in Hal and advises him on how to be a king. Henry dies and Hal tells his men that he is now King Henry V.

Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit in front of a warm fire, continuing from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal went on to become a good and noble king.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=31–254}}

== Original stage productions ==
Welles' inspiration for ''Chimes at Midnight'' began in 1930 when he was a student at the [[Todd Seminary for Boys|Todd School for Boys]] in [[Woodstock, Illinois]]. Welles tried to stage a three-and-a-half-hour combination of several of Shakespeare's historical plays called ''The Winter of Our Discontent'' in which he played Richard III.&lt;ref&gt;France, Richard. ''The Theatre of Orson Welles''. Lewisberg and London: Bucknell University Press. 1977. {{ISBN|0838719724}}. pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; School officials forced him to make cuts to the production.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=35–36}} ''Chimes at Midnight'' originated in 1939 as a stage play called  ''Five Kings'', which Welles wrote and partially staged. It was an ambitious adaptation of several Shakespeare plays that chronicled the stories of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. Its sources were ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''{{mdash}}sometimes collectively called the "[[The War of the Roses (Shakespeare)#The .22Wars of the Roses.22 cycle|War of the Roses cycle]]".{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=3–4}} The grouping of ''Henry IV, Part 1'', ''Henry IV, Part 2'' and ''Henry V'' are often referred to as the ''[[Henriad]]''.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=124}}

=== ''Five Kings'' (1939) ===

''Five Kings'' was announced as part of the newly revived [[Mercury Theatre]]'s second season in 1938.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=358}} [[John Houseman]] had secured a partnership with the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]] to produce the play for {{US$|40,000}}, with an initial tour of Baltimore, Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia before debuting on Broadway.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=423}} Welles' intended to stage only the first part of the play{{mdash}}which was primarily taken from ''Henry IV Parts 1 and 2'' and ''Henry V''{{mdash}}during the tour while simultaneously rehearsing Part Two and finally debuting the full production on Broadway.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=448}}{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=424}} Houseman stated that the play's aim was "to combine the immediate quality of the Elizabethan with all the devices and techniques possible in the modern theatre."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=29}} The cast included Welles as Falstaff, [[Burgess Meredith]] as Prince Hal, [[John Emery (actor)|John Emery]] as Hotspur, Morris Ankrum as Henry IV and [[Robert Speaight]] as the Narrator.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=427–428}}{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=350}}&lt;ref&gt;France, Richard. ''Orson Welles on Shakespeare''. New York/London: Routledge. 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-93726-4}}. pp. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The play's music was composed by [[Aaron Copland]].{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=115}} Welles commissioned an elaborate revolving set to be built, but it was not completed during the five weeks allotted to rehearsals.

Welles avoided attending the rehearsals or finishing the play's final script and instead often went out drinking and socializing with co-star Meredith, with the result that only specific scenes or fragments of the play were ever rehearsed.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=428–430}} The Baltimore performance was eventually dropped and at the first dress rehearsal in Boston, it was discovered that the play was over five and a half hours long and contained 46 scenes. Welles cut 14 scenes and shortened others, which caused the built-in timer for the revolving set to move out of synchronization.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=432}} ''Five Kings, Part 1'' premiered at the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston, Massachusetts)|Colonial Theatre]] in Boston on February 27, 1939, and was a disaster.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=433–434}} Critics were either scathing or apologetic, and only the play's battle scenes received praise.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=440}} By the end of the Boston run, the Theatre Guild was on the verge of dropping the production, and canceled the D.C. engagement. Welles then edited the show to three and a half hours.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=434}} The play closed after only a few performances in Philadelphia, and the Theatre Guild terminated its contract with the Mercury Theater.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=438–439}} Photographs of the play's rehearsals show similarities to ''Chimes at Midnight'', including the Boar's Head Tavern set and the character blocking of the "chimes at midnight" scene with Falstaff, Shallow and Silence.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=139}}

=== ''Chimes at Midnight'' (1960) ===


Welles returned to the project in 1960, with performances in [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]]. This version, now retitled ''Chimes at Midnight'',{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=443}} was produced by Welles' old friend [[Hilton Edwards]] through his Dublin-based company [[Gate Theatre]].{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=448}} The cast included Welles as Falstaff, [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] as Prince Hal, Hilton Edwards as the Narrator,{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=364}} Reginald Jarman as Henry IV{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=268}} and [[Alexis Kanner]] as Hotspur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?cat=16 |title = From  THE TRINITY NEWS (a Dublin University Weekly) |accessdate = June 10, 2012 |work = http://www.wellesnet.com, March 10, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Welles and Edwards wanted [[Micheál Mac Liammóir]] to replace Jarman as Henry IV, but Mac Liammóir would only accept the role of Prince Hal.{{sfn|Lindsay-Hogg|2011|pp=68}} Hilton Edwards was officially credited as director, but Welles is usually acknowledged as the actual director and was often the director throughout rehearsals.&lt;ref name = "I have heard the CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?cat=16 |title = "I have heard the CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT" Orson Welles plays Falstaff in his final theatrical performance on the Dublin stage in 1960 |accessdate = June 11, 2012 |work = http://www.wellesnet.com, November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Lindsay-Hogg|2011|pp=64–65}} Welles' alleged biological son [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] also worked on the play as an actor and as Edwards's personal assistant.{{sfn|Lindsay-Hogg|2011|pp=63}} Welles' opinion of Falstaff had intensified since first playing the part, and his new version of the play focused more upon the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal than on the historical story of Hal's defeat of Hotspur.{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=441–442}} Most of the scenes from ''Henry V'' used in the first version before were removed.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=448}} Welles intended to perform the play in Belfast, Dublin and [[London]] before filming it in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=448}}

Rehearsals began in Russell Square, London, with a read-through. After a week of rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards directed the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned two days before the premiere and the cast had their first dress rehearsal, which lasted until 3 a.m.{{sfn|Lindsay-Hogg|2011|pp=63–66}} After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' correspondent, the play closed after five performances because of low attendances. It moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, where it fared no better. By the end of the second week, Welles had resorted to reading portions of the works of Irish author [[J. M. Synge]], and from ''[[Riders to the Sea]]'', to attract an audience.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=448}} Eventually the play simply became a version of ''An Evening with Orson Welles'', which would often include a question and answer section with the audience and Welles' solo performance of ''[[Moby Dick—Rehearsed]]'' or the works of [[Isak Dinesen]].{{sfn|Lindsay-Hogg|2011|pp=75}}

Welles continued to adjust the play throughout its short production, and at one point moved Mistress Quickly's speech about Falstaff's death to the very beginning of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood, Robert &amp; Beja, Morris (editor). ''Perspectives on Orson Welles''. New York: G. K. Hall &amp; Company. 1995. {{ISBN|0-8161-7344-3}}. pp. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Welles finally abandoned the entire project in late March 1960, when his friend [[Laurence Olivier]] offered him the chance to direct him in [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s play ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' on London's West End.{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=427}} According to Keith Baxter, Welles ended the play's run because he was bored with it, and at one point told Baxter "This is only a rehearsal for the movie, Keith, and I'll never make it unless you play Hal in that too." Five years later, Baxter and Welles' youngest daughter, [[Beatrice Welles]], who played Falstaff's page, were the only cast members from the play to appear in the film.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=268}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/beatrice-welles-to-introduce-restored-chimes-at-midnight-at-film-forum/|title=Beatrice Welles to introduce restored ‘Chimes at Midnight’ at Film...|last=wellesnet|date=December 31, 2015|language=en-US|access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chimes at Midnight'' was Welles' final performance in a theatrical play.&lt;ref name = "I have heard the CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT"/&gt;

== Production ==

=== Preproduction ===

In 1964, Welles met and befriended Spanish film producer [[Emiliano Piedra]], who wanted to work with him. Piedra did not think a Shakespearian film was marketable enough and proposed that Welles make a version of ''[[Treasure Island]]'' instead. Welles agreed  to this on condition that he could simultaneously make ''Chimes at Midnight'', and Piedra agreed not knowing that Welles had no intention of making ''Treasure Island''. Although some B-roll footage of the Alicante departing from port was shot early in the production, no scenes from ''Treasure Island'' were ever shot or even scripted. Welles got away with this trick throughout preproduction by building sets that could be used in both films, such as Mistress Quickly's Boar's Head Tavern, which would double as the Admiral Benbow Inn. Welles also cast each actor in both films, casting himself as Long John Silver, Baxter as Dr. Livesey, Beckley as Israel Hands and Gielgud as Squire Trelawney.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=267}} Ironically Welles would eventually play Long John Silver in the unrelated [[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|1972 film version]] of ''Treasure Island''.{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=249}}

Welles said that the Boar's Head Tavern was the only full set built for the film, and the other sets were simply dressed or decorated on location. Welles stated that he designed, painted and blow-torched the set, and designed all of the film's costumes.{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=249}} Early in pre-production Welles was approached by [[Anthony Perkins]] to play Prince Hal, but Welles had already promised the role to Keith Baxter.{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=380}}{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=274}} Hilton Edwards was initially cast as Justice Silence, but was replaced after he became ill.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=277}} The title ''Chimes at Midnight'' derives from ''Henry IV, Part 2'', where in response to Justice Shallow's reminiscing of their long-past school days, Falstaff states: "We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow".{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=32}} Welles scholar Bridget Gellert Lyons said that the film's title, "which is given further resonance by the repeated intoning of bells throughout the film, is associated for the audience with sadness and mortality more than youthful carousal."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=5}}

=== Filming ===
[[File:Orson-Welles-Falstaff.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Orson Welles]] in ''Chimes at Midnight'']]
The film was shot in Spain from September 1964 until April 1965, with a break in filming from late December until late February.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=30}} Welles' limitations on the film included a budget of $800,000 and actors [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[John Gielgud]] being available for five and ten days respectively,{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=461}} while [[Margaret Rutherford]] was only available for four weeks.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=276}} Welles later joked that during one scene which included seven principal characters, none of the actors were available and stand-ins were used for over-the-shoulder shots of all seven characters.{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=249}} Filming began in [[Colmenar, Málaga|Colmenar]] and included all of John Gielgud's scenes. Welles then traveled to [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], where the Royal Court scenes and Marina Vlady's scenes were shot, and to Madrid's [[Casa de Campo]] Park, where the Gadshill robbery scene was filmed. Madrid was also the location of the Boar's Head Tavern set, where Welles shot Moreau's and Rutherford's scenes. The production then traveled to [[Pedraza, Spain|Pedraza]] for some outdoor street scenes, and then to [[Soria]] to shoot in the snow for the opening shots. After shooting some scenes with Justice Shallow and Justice Silence in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]], Welles returned to Madrid in December to film the battle scenes in Casa de Campo Park for ten days.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=281–282}}{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=254}}

By late December, Welles had run out of money and the film was put on hold while he searched for additional funding.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=273}} However, some small scenes were shot during the break. Welles later said that he had rejected offers for funding that were conditional upon filming in color.{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=250}} Welles eventually secured funding from [[Harry Saltzman]]&lt;ref name = "BLACK AND MIDNIGHT HAGGLES"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=667#more-667 |title = BLACK AND MIDNIGHT HAGGLES |accessdate = June 11, 2012 |work = http://www.wellesnet.com, October 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and production officially resumed in late February with most of Keith Baxter's longer speeches and the Coronation scene in Madrid. Between March and April, Welles finished the film with filler shots, close-ups, the final rejection scene and most of Falstaff's speeches. According to Keith Baxter, Welles had stage fright and delayed all of his scenes until the very end of filming, except for scenes that included other actors.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=282}} Welles was timid about shooting his love scene with Moreau, and used a double whenever possible.{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=378}} Other filming locations included the Chateau [[Calatañazor]], Puerta de San Vincente, the Soria Cathedral{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=432}} and the city of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/article76983377.html|date=12 May 2016|journal=[[The Kansas City Star]]|first=Robert W.|last=Butler|title=‘Chimes at Midnight’ rings true to the great Orson Welles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles was harsh with his crew members and according to actor Andrew Faulds, "he spoke in five different languages to them and was pretty offensive{{mdash}}very demanding. I suppose he'd worked out that if you bullied actors, you didn't get the best from them whereas, to hell with the technicians. They had to do as they were told, and pretty quick."{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=166}} A scene depicting the assassination of [[King Richard II]], originally intended to open the film, was cut.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=264}}

=== Post-production ===

Keith Baxter said that the film's soundtrack was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|post-dubbed]] months after filming was completed, and that actors [[Fernando Rey]] and [[Marina Vlady]] were dubbed by different actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and [[Michael Aldridge]] recorded voices for several characters in post-production.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=278}} Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible hum of a power generator, used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=462}} The score was composed by [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]], who had worked with Welles on ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]''. The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?cat=16&amp;paged=2 |title = Angelo Francesco Lavagnino’s magnificent score for Orson Welles’s CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT |accessdate = June 11, 2012 |work = http://www.wellesnet.com, May 24th, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the editing, Welles showed a [[rough cut]] to the visiting head of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=282}}

== Style ==

=== Cinematography ===

Welles had originally wanted the entire film to use high-contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=260}} The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques to give the appearance of armies of thousands.{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=378}} Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=264}} It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence.{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=254}} In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, swish pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that "in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=132}}

The Battle of Shrewsbury sequence has often been called an anti-war statement by film critics and likened to contemporary films like ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[Culloden (film)|Culloden]]''. Shakespearean scholar [[Daniel Seltzer]] said that "the social consciousness of the movie is as alert as Shakespeare's, and thematically pertinent in Shakespearean terms too&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the footage of the Battle of Shrewsbury itself must be some of the finest, truest, ugliest scenes of warfare ever shot and edited for a movie."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=132}} Welles scholar [[James Naremore]] said that "the underlying eroticism of the chivalric code&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;is exposed in all its cruel perversity."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=132}} Tony Howard wrote that Welles used Shakespeare's historical plays "to denounce modern political hypocrisy and militarism."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Russell. ''Shakespeare on Film''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-63023-1}}. pp. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sound ===
Due to budgetary constraints, both the on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, in combination with Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long takes or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. "In effect," Anderegg writes, "Welles generates a constant tension between what we see and what we hear, a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=130}} During the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] sequence, Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots in the mud and the film's musical score to add to the chaos of the scene.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=132}}

=== Interpretation of Shakespeare ===

Welles' adaptation of five Shakespeare plays was not a chronological transcription of the original texts. Shakespearean scholar Kenneth S. Rothwell said that Welles "goes beyond mere tinkering with Shakespeare's scenes; [he] massively reworks, transposes, revises and deletes, indeed reconstructs them." These changes included taking lines of dialogue from one play and inserting them into scenes from another.{{sfn|Rothwell|1999|pp=86—87}} Specific changes include a scene near the end of the film in which Hal pardons an imprisoned street rabble-rouser just before his expedition to invade [[France]]; Welles slightly altered this scene from ''Henry V'', Act 2, Scene 2. In the film it is stated that this man is Falstaff, and that the incident he is pardoning is Falstaff's disturbance of Hal's coronation. Although both the pardoned prisoner and Falstaff are said to drink wine, Shakespeare does not imply that the pardoned prisoner is Falstaff.{{sfn|Rothwell|1999|pp=88}} In both ''Chimes at Midnight'' and in ''Henry V'', this scene is followed by Falstaff's death.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=245–254}} The film contains no true [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], since characters are never alone and do not speak directly to the audience during their speeches.{{sfn|Anderegg |1999 | pp=130}}  Henry IV is usually shown standing or sitting with very little action involved{{mdash}}this, says Anderegg, makes it appear that he speaks only to himself even when others are present. Gielgud was known for his classical interpretation of Shakespeare, and his performance consists almost entirely of words, which are unable to defeat either Northumberland's rebels or Hal's wild behavior. Throughout the film, Falstaff, Hal, and Hotspur imitate Gielgud, mocking the words of Henry IV.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=133}}

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
''Chimes at Midnight'' premiered to a positive audience reception at the [[1966 Cannes Film Festival]]. However, after ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]]'s unfavorable advance review, American distributor Harry Saltzman decided to give the film little publicity and minimal distribution when it was released in the U.S. the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors, Volume 1.'' The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 1181. {{ISBN|0-8242-0757-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical reception on its first release was mostly negative; the film was not regarded as one of Welles' best until years later. Crowther criticized the film's poor audio track and called it "a confusing patchwork of scenes and characters&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;designed to give major exposure to Jack Falstaff." Welles' performance, he said, was "a dissolute, bumbling street-corner Santa Claus."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=289}} [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]] called it "a film which seems to turn its back on brilliance."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=296}} A ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' review also criticized Welles, stating that "[he] is probably the first actor in the history of the theater to appear too fat for the role&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;he takes command of scenes less with spoken English than with body English", but that he is "never entirely bad."{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=168}}

[[Judith Crist]] praised the film as "stark, simple, concentrating on word and performance, serv[ing] as a reminder of where the substance of the play lies."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=291–292}} [[Pauline Kael]] also criticized the poor sound, but gave a favorable review overall, singling out the film's casting and calling Welles' performance "very rich, very full." She said the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence was "unlike any battle scene done on the screen before."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=298–300}} ''[[Cahiers du Cinema]]'' critic [[Serge Daney]] also praised both the film and Welles' ability to make great films on the subject of power.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=301}} Welles was disappointed with the film's reception, complaining that "almost nobody has seen it in America, and that drives me nuts."{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=465}}

=== Legacy ===

Welles held ''Chimes at Midnight'' in high regard. "It's my favorite picture, yes," he told interviewer Leslie Megahey in a 1982 interview for ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|BBC Arena]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way. It is the most successful for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Arena. ''The Orson Welles Story'' BBC Two/BBC Four. 01:51:46-01:52:16. Broadcast May 18, 1982. Retrieved 2012-08-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estrin, Mark W., and Orson Welles, ''Orson Welles: Interviews''. Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|203}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also considered it to be his most personal film, along with ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=262}} Many critics, including [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], also consider ''Chimes at Midnight'' to be Welles' finest work. Several years after its initial release, film critic [[Vincent Canby]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that ''Chimes at Midnight'' "may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made, bar none."&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent, "The Undiminished Chutzpah of Orson Welles." ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 2, 1975, Accessed on June 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] has called it "Welles' masterpiece, the fullest, most completely realized expression of everything he had been working towards since ''[[Citizen Kane]]''."{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=383}} In 2006, [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film as "a magnificent film, clearly among Welles' greatest work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060604/REVIEWS08/606040301/1004 |title=Roger Ebert review |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battle of Shrewsbury sequence has been particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' and the Battle on the Ice sequence in ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'', both directed by [[Sergei Eisenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, David A. ''The History of Narrative Film.'' W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York, Third Edition. 1996. {{ISBN|0-393-96819-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' used Welles' Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the [[Battle of Agincourt]],{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=132}} and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff in a way that was more influenced by ''Chimes at Midnight'' than from more traditional interpretations of the scene.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=140}} In 1988, director [[Patrick Garland]] staged a version of ''Chimes at Midnight'' starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublintheatrefestival.com/artists/display.asp?m=&amp;artistID=38 |title=Patrick Garland profile |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |work=dublintheatrefestival.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Anderegg said that ''Chimes at Midnight''{{'}}s use of wide angle lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]''{{mdash}}[[Gus Van Sant]]'s 1991 loose adaptation of ''Henry IV Parts 1 and 2''.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=123}}

In 2011, [[Bonhams|Bonham's Auction House]] sold a large archive of Welles' material that had once belonged to the film's executive producer Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Most of the material was from ''Chimes at Midnight'', and included Welles' original art-work, photographs and memoranda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?cat=16 |title = Bonhams to sell a Treasure Trove of Production Material on Orson Welles’s Masterpiece CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT |accessdate = June 11, 2012 |work = http://www.wellesnet.com, November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection was later donated to the [[University of Michigan]] for scholarly study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=1744 |title = Additions to Orson Welles collection at University of Michigan open to scholars |accessdate = December 7, 2012 |work = http://www.wellesnet.com, September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, for the [[British Film Institute]]'s ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' poll, 11 film critics and two directors voted ''Chimes at Midnight'' one of the 10 greatest films of all time, including McBride and [[Todd McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6a70cd80 |title=Chimes at Midnight |year=2012 |work=bfi.org.uk |accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Welles and Falstaff ==
[[File:Grützner Falstaff mit Kanne.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Eduard von Grützner's ''Falstaff with big wine jar and cup'' shows the traditional jolly and comical depiction of Falstaff that Welles rejected.]]

=== Welles' views on Sir John Falstaff ===
Welles considered Falstaff to be "Shakespeare's greatest creation"{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=4}} and said that the role was "the most difficult part I've ever played."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=261}} Keith Baxter believed that making the film was Welles' life's ambition.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=282}} Before the 1939 Boston premiere of ''Five Kings'', Welles told journalists "I will play him as a tragic figure. I hope, of course, he will be funny to the audience, just as he was funny to those around him. But his humor and wit were aroused merely by the fact that he wanted to please the prince. Falstaff, however, had the potential of greatness in him."{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=442}} Reviews for the 1939 play mention Welles' choice to downplay the traditional comedic elements of Falstaff in his performance.{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=139}} This reverence for the character increased over the years and by the time Welles made ''Chimes at Midnight'', his focus was entirely on the relationships between Falstaff, Hal and Henry IV. He believed that the core of the story was "the betrayal of friendship."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=5}} Welles called Hal's rejection of Falstaff "one of the greatest scenes ever written, so the movie is really a preparation for it. Everything prepares for it."{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=464}} Throughout the film, Hal constantly turns his back on Falstaff, foreshadowing the film's ending.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=7}}

Welles said, "the film was not intended as a lament for Falstaff, but for the death of [[Merry England|Merrie England]]. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed."{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=262}} Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the "Lost [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]" in Welles' work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called "the central theme in Western culture."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=124}} Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit."{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=100}} Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles' depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a "[p]ower baby&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=130}} Welles also called Falstaff "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama",{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=261}} and said that "the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only ''deliberately'', a clown."{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=442}}

=== Welles' personal connections to Sir John Falstaff ===
{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=left|width=25%|quote="[Falstaff]'s good in the sense that the hippies are good. The comedy is all about gross faults in the man, but those faults are so trivial: his famous cowardice is a joke— a joke Falstaff seems to be telling himself against himself...he asks for so little, and in the end gets nothing." - Welles on Falstaff{{sfn|Welles|Bogdanovich|1992|pp=100}}}}

Keith Baxter compared Welles to Falstaff, since they were both perpetually short of money, often lied and cheated people to get what they needed and were always merry and fun loving.{{sfn|Lyons|1989|pp=282}} Film scholar Jack Jorgens also compared Welles to Falstaff, stating that "to a man who directed and starred in a masterpiece and has since staggered through three decades of underfinanced, hurried, flawed films, scores of bit parts, narrations, and interviews which debased his talent, dozens of projects which died for want of persistence and financing, the story of a fat, aging jester exiled from his audience and no longer able to triumph over impossible obstacles with wit and torrential imagination might well seem tragic."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=138–139}} When [[Joss Ackland]] played Falstaff on the stage in 1982, he said that he was more inspired by Welles than by Welles' performance as Falstaff, stating that "like Falstaff, I believe he could have achieved so much, but it was frittered away."{{sfn|Anderegg|1999|pp=140}} Kenneth S. Rothwell has called Hal's rejection of Falstaff allegorical to Hollywood's rejection of Welles.{{sfn|Rothwell|1999|pp=86}} Welles had become deeply depressed in the late 1950s after the disappointment of making ''[[Touch of Evil]]'', his intended Hollywood come-back.{{sfn|Feder|2009|pp=180—181}}

Welles' biographer [[Simon Callow]] has compared Falstaff to Welles' father Richard Head Welles, stating that like Falstaff, Welles' father was "a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmer{{mdash}}and he is rejected by the person he loves the most."{{sfn|Callow|1996|pp=442}} Welles' father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along with him when he was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young protégé to bail him out of trouble.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=463}} The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles' relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=463}} Both of Welles' surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles' life-style and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until he cleaned up his act and stopped drinking; Welles' father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, "I always ''thought'' I killed him."{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=32}}

Welles' alleged biological son [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]], who was born out of wedlock to Welles and actress [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play ''Chimes at Midnight''. This was the only significant amount of time that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/books/review/luck-and-circumstance-by-michael-lindsay-hogg-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateema4 |title=Are You My Father, Orson Welles? |date=September 30, 2011 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 7, 2012 |first=Alex |last=Witchel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s when she was sixteen years old, Welles' eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles' influence on her.{{sfn|Feder|2009|pp=162}} Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered.{{sfn|Feder|2009|pp=203}} Welles' youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of ''Chimes at Midnight''.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pp=465}}

'''Conspiracies against the laity''' is a term coined by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in his 1906 play [[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]. The conspiracies refer to the methods used by professions to acquire prestige, power and wealth.

On the subject of such conspiracies, [[Tim Harford]] argued the following in his 2006 book [[The Undercover Economist]]: "... doctors, actuaries, accountants and lawyers manage to maintain high wages through... erecting virtual 'green belts' to make it hard for competitors to set up shop. Typical virtual green belts will include very long qualification periods and professional bodies that give their approval only to a certain number of candidates per year. Many of the organisations that are put forth to protect us from 'unqualified' professionals in fact serve to maintain the high rates of the 'qualified' to whom we are directed."

Shaw's sentiments echo Adam Smith's earlier writing: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7213">The '''Curse of Coogan's Bluff'''/'''Curse of Eddie Grant''' (1958–2010) was a [[sports-related curses|baseball-related superstition]] that allegedly prevented the [[San Francisco Giants]] [[Major League Baseball]] franchise from winning the [[World Series]] following the club's [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]] after the conclusion of the 1957 season. The curse began when upset Giants fans in the [[New York metropolitan area]] placed a hex on the relocated franchise. The curse ended when the Giants won the [[2010 World Series]] in their fourth World Series appearance since the move to San Francisco.

== Background and origin of the curse ==
Although the actual curse began in 1958, the story goes back to 1918 when [[Eddie Grant (baseball)|Eddie Grant]] was killed while fighting in World War I. The team honored him with a commemorative plaque on the center field wall at the [[Polo Grounds]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/5-legendary-baseball-curses6.htm|title=10 Legendary Baseball Curses|date=2012-08-16|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the franchise was based in New York, the Giants won five World Series titles, with the longest drought between titles being 21 years. The last championship as the New York Giants came against the [[Cleveland Indians]] in [[1954 World Series|1954]], notably featuring [[Willie Mays]]' famous [[The Catch (baseball)|catch]] in Game 1.

In the 1950s, Giants' owner [[Horace Stoneham]] began to consider moving the team to another city while needing a new stadium to replace the crumbling Polo Grounds. San Francisco mayor [[George Christopher]] negotiated with Stoneham, approving the move to San Francisco starting with the 1958 season. The approval caused the upset Giants fans to storm the field during the last home game before the relocation, stealing the Eddie Grant plaque and losing the team identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bondy|first=Filip|title=Bondy: Giants should be in N.Y. state of mind|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/giants-hope-world-series-curse-texas-rangers-embrace-new-york-roots-article-1.188519|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=October 25, 2010|access-date=May 2, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the move, upset Giants' fans in New York allegedly placed a hex on the [[San Francisco Giants]], claiming the franchise would never win the World Series while based in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayden|first1=Matthew|title=6 Insane Sports Stories|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_17209_6-insane-sports-stories-that-will-make-you-believe-in-curses.html|website=Cracked.com|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed all of the team's good luck is in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Gus|title=The Curse of Coogan's Bluff – The Worst Curses in Sports History|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2014/05/worst-curses-sports-history/the-curse-of-coogans-bluff|publisher=Complex|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Series appearances during the curse ==
During the 50 years after placing the alleged Curse of Coogan's Bluff, the Giants made three World Series appearances and lost each time, two of which in 7-game Series. In 1962, in Game 3 of the playoff series that decided who would win the [[National League]] pennant and play in the World Series, the Giants overcame a two-run deficit in the 9th inning against the [[Dodgers–Giants rivalry|rival]] [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to clinch the pennant. In Game 7 of the [[1962 World Series]] against the former crosstown [[Giants–Yankees rivalry|rival]] [[New York Yankees]], down 1–0 and with runners on second and third, [[Willie McCovey]] hit a sharp line drive, but the ball was caught by Yankees' second baseman [[Bobby Richardson]] to end the game and the Series.

In the [[1989 World Series]], the Giants were swept by another [[San Francisco Bay Area]] team, the [[Oakland Athletics]]. The 1989 Series was infamous for the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|large earthquake]] that struck the San Francisco Bay Area, delaying Games 3 and 4 of the World Series by 10 days. In the [[2002 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]], the Giants led 3 games to 2 heading back to Anaheim for Games 6 and 7, but the Giants lost the last two for the third World Series loss since moving to San Francisco. In Game 6 of that Series, the Giants held a commanding 5–0 lead heading into the 7th inning. However, the Giants allowed the Angels to score 6 unanswered runs in the 7th and 8th innings for one of the greatest comebacks in World Series history. The Giants lost Game 7 (and the Series) the next day 4–1.

== The end of the curse ==
In 2001, historian and author Mike Hanlon suggested to Giants owner [[Peter Magowan]] to have a new plaque to be installed at [[AT&amp;T Park]] in the effort of ending their curse. In 2006, the development of the new plaque began but took two years due to problems of production. In 2008, the Eddie Grant plaque was installed on the tower at the right field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The installation of the plaque would prove effective for the team's chances of winning the championship. In 2010, the Giants won the division after passing the [[San Diego Padres]] for the [[National League West|NL West]] division lead late in the season. The Giants qualified to play in the World Series after defeating the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[2010 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (who made back-to-back World Series appearances in the previous year) in the [[2010 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. The Giants defeated the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in five games to win the [[2010 World Series|World Series]] championship for the first time since moving to San Francisco in 1958, thus ending the 52-year Curse of Coogan's Bluff. Following their 2010 championship, the Giants would win two more world championships in the next four years—in [[2012 World Series|2012]] and in [[2014 World Series|2014]]. However they have yet to win the World Series clincher while playing in San Francisco.

'''Daeyeonggak Hotel fire''' was a [[skyscraper fire]] in Seoul, South Korea on December 25, 1971, that killed 164 people and injured 63 people.{{R|章孝思}} It remains the deadliest hotel fire in world history.

==Background==
The 22-storey Daeyeonggak Hotel (also called Hotel Taeyongak) was a luxury hotel completed in 1969.&lt;ref name="insufficient"/&gt; It had 222 rooms.&lt;ref name="seoulhotel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seoul hotel fire: 8 arrested|work=South China Morning Post|date=29 December 1971|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire and aftermath==
The fire burned for ten hours.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt; Many were unable to find the exit in the darkness. The fire department's ladders only reached the eighth floor, trapping those from the ninth to the 22nd storeys.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt; At least 38 people died leaping from windows to escape the inferno, some clinging to mattresses in an attempt to survive the fall.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt; 12 helicopters were mobilised to try to rescue guests from the roof using aerial slings. One man fell to his death from a helicopter.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt;

The authorities arrested eight people in connection with the disaster.&lt;ref name="FireExperts"/&gt; These included Kim Yong-san and four other hotel officials, who were charged with carelessness and improper construction, as well as two former city officials and a fire officer on charges of negligence.&lt;ref name="seoulhotel"/&gt;

The 162nd death was that of Yu Sien-yung, the minister of the Taiwanese embassy in Seoul, who lived alone in the hotel. He was trapped in the burning building for more than 10 hours and died in hospital, aged 64, on 4 January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotel fire toll up|work=South China Morning Post|date=5 January 1972|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the building was said to have played a part in the high death toll. The two internal staircases were designed for use in case of lift failures and not as fire exits, and filled with smoke during the fire, acting as chimneys.&lt;ref name="insufficient"&gt;{{cite news|title=Insufficient fire exits pushed up hotel deaths|work=South China Morning Post|date=30 December 1971|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fire turned hotel into death-trap chimney expert|work=South China Morning Post|agency=United Press International|date=28 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building had no external emergency staircase. The walls between the hotel rooms were not sufficiently fire resistant, hastening the spread of the blaze.&lt;ref name="insufficient"/&gt; The tower lacked many other safety features, including battery-operated exit lights.

Two senior fire services officers of the [[Hong Kong Government]] flew to Seoul on 11 January 1972 to confer with the South Koreans on fire prevention.&lt;ref name="FireExperts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fire experts off to Seoul|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=11 January 1972|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was remodeled after the fire. There was another fire there on 27 February 2010.

The '''Eglinton Trophy''' or '''Eglinton Testimonial'''&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Girouard, Page 105&lt;/ref&gt; is a Gothic style [[Sterling silver]] centrepiece presented by friends and admirers to the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|13th Earl of Eglinton]] to commemorate the medieval re-enactment known as the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839|Eglinton Tournament]] held at [[Eglinton Castle]], [[Kilwinning]], North Ayrshire in 1839. At 4 foot 8&amp;nbsp;inch (140&amp;nbsp;cm) in height and 1600 ounces (45&amp;nbsp;kg) in weight it is one of the largest and most extravagant trophies of its kind.

==History==
===Fund raising===
A committee, including [[John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Burghersh]], and chaired by the [[Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]],&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; King of the Tournament, was formed to set up a subscription to "present Eglinton with a piece of plate, to commemorate the revival of the days of chivalry".&lt;ref name="A232"/&gt; Two hundred and thirty-nine people subscribed to the production of the trophy, each being limited to a maximum of twenty guineas (Circa £900 in modern terms).&lt;ref name="A232"&gt;Anstruther, Page 232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and production===

The 4 foot 8&amp;nbsp;inch (140&amp;nbsp;cm) high trophy, weighing in at 1600 ounces (45&amp;nbsp;kg), was designed by Edmund Cotterill (1795–1860), made in a medieval [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] style by [[Garrard &amp; Co|Messrs. R &amp; S Garrard]], Silversmiths of London at a cost then of £1,775 (£78,277 in modern terms)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid Currency Converter] Retrieved : 2011-03-18&lt;/ref&gt; and took four years to complete.&lt;ref name="A233"&gt;Anstruther, Page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmund Cotterill was in charge of the design studio at Garrards in 1843 and at the time of the Empire Exhibition (1851) he was said to stand "at the head of the class of artists who model for silversmiths and his productions, annually exhibited at Messrs Garrard, have earned that house a celebrity which no other can equal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/vanda/MicroObject.asp?item=2&amp;themeid=1019&amp;object=1570&amp;row=2&amp;detail=about Victoria and Albert.] Retrieved : 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy is formed from modelled and cast silver components which were assembled together to create the final piece.&lt;ref name=gad&gt;[http://www.garrard.com/home/ Garrards &amp; Co.] Retrieved : 2012-08-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eglinton Trophy has a [[Hallmark]] and is therefore silver and not silver plate, it rises from a wide [[crenelated]] base on the sides of which are located the shields bearing the coats of arms of the fourteen Knights of the Tournament; a fifteenth shield is blank and four of the shields are in alcoves that extend from the base, accompanied by swords, quills, coronets, laurel leaf crown, etc. The 4 foot 8&amp;nbsp;inch (140&amp;nbsp;cm) trophy rises up as a highly ornate Gothic pulpit sitting beneath a pinnacled canopy under which Jane Georgiana, Lady Seymour, the Queen of Beauty stands in the act of placing a wreath upon the brow of the Earl of Eglinton, Lord and victor of the Eglinton Tournament.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Anstruther, Pages 231-232&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside the figure of the earl are the Knight Marshal, Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, with a dismounted squire, and a [[halbard]]ier, his escort and the presentation party.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Two hunting dogs are also present, together with two pages, one male and one female, and a lady in waiting. The squire and the lady in waiting give the impression of exchanging glances. A coat of arms is also displayed on a shield behind Lady Seymour.

The glass case that covers the trophy has wooded framed sections and rises up from an ornately carved eight-sided wooden base emblazoned with four coats of arms, earls coronets, and with a silver engraved dedicatory shield. This base stands around 2 feet and 10&amp;nbsp;inches (85&amp;nbsp;cm) in height.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; The dedicatory shield reads "Presented to Archibald, Earl of Eglinton, by the Visitors to the Eglinton Tournament held at Eglinton Castle. MDCCCXXXIX."

===The Hallmark===
A [[Hallmark]] is stamped on the base of the trophy, at the front. The Silver Standard Mark is a Lion [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant]] indicating .925 purity, known as Sterling silver; the City Mark is an uncrowned Leopard indicating London as the city of manufacture, after the year 1822; the Maker's Mark is an "RG" beneath a Crown, indicating [[Garrard &amp; Co|R &amp; S Garrard]] after 1835 when James Garrard retired. The Crown indicates that the company had become official Crown Jewellers, an honour conferred on them by Queen Victoria in 1843;&lt;ref name=gd/&gt;&lt;ref name=hm/&gt; the Date Letter however is a Gothic "G" for the year 1842;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freespace.virgin.net/a.data/dateletters/Lond/londonframe.htm Date Letters] Retrieved : 2012-08-13&lt;/ref&gt; and finally the Duty Mark stamp of Queen Victoria's head indicating that duty was paid on the item and that it was made before 1890.&lt;ref name=hm&gt;[http://www.925-1000.com/british_marks.html British Hallmarks] Retrieved : 2012-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent disparity in dates just reflects the fact that the trophy was returned from the [[Assay Office]] in 1842 and finally assembled, completed and stamped by the maker for delivery to the committee and its presention to the earl in 1843.&lt;ref name=gd&gt;[http://www.silvercollection.it/ENGLAGARRARD.html History of Garrard &amp; Co Ltd] Retrieved : 2012-08-14&lt;/ref&gt; The Maker's Mark is not in alignment with the official Hallmark, lying slightly above.

The trophy, presented to [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton]] in 1843, was originally housed within the library at [[Eglinton Castle]] and later at the Ayr County Hall in Ayr.&lt;ref name="A233"&gt;Anstruther, Page 233&lt;/ref&gt; It was featured and illustrated in ''The Illustrated London News'' of June 1843. The trophy is now kept, housed within its original glass and wood case, in Cunninghame House, headquarters of [[North Ayrshire Council]], having been loaned to the people of Ayrshire by the 14th Earl&lt;ref&gt;Montgomeries of Eglinton, Page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; it is however still the property of the present Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/chiefexec/minutes.nsf/a5ed4770df04d9db802572dd00471a99/64e857801db1d956802577c100341c77?OpenDocument NAC Minutes] Retrieved : 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while during the construction of the headquarters of the then Cunninghame District Council it was housed at Wellwood, the home of the [[Irvine Burns Club]] and the official Royal Burgh of Irvine Museum.

It was moved to the [[Eglinton Country Park]] visitor centre in 1989 for the re-enactment that marked 150 years since the tournament and was also loaned to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref name=gad/&gt; It is insured by [[North Ayrshire Council]] for an undisclosed, but considerable sum, and was lent to [[East Ayrshire Council]] for a short time in 2011 (April 30 to August 20) as the centrepiece to an exhibition of James Henry Nixons (1802–1857) Eglinton Tournament prints&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abbottandholderjv.co.uk/introduction.aspx Auction catalogue] Retrieved : 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; at the Dick Institute in [[Kilmarnock]].

The trophy is of great significance to the local and social history of the area and can be viewed by small groups during normal working hours by prior arrangement, after going through appropriate security procedures.

A second silver trophy was presented to the Earl by 300 citizens of Glasgow.&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;Eglinton Fair. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a silver statuette measuring 44cm in height representing a knight in full armour with a jousting lance and a horse bearing the Earl of Eglinton's coat of arms was acquired by the East Ayrshire Leisure Trust on behalf of [[East Ayrshire Council]]. It is believed this is the only surviving part of the "second silver trophy" and that the rest of the [[candelabrum]] was melted down for its silver content after it was sold by the Earl of Eglinton in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmarnock Standard, 29-08-2014, Page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The silver hallmark shows that the statuette dates to 1840, three years before the Eglinton Trophy was completed. The silversmiths were Benjamin Smith III of London and D.C.Rait of Glasgow.

The '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]] 1976''' was the 21st edition of the contest hosted by [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] and held in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The arena for the event was the [[World Forum (The Hague)|Nederlands Congrescentrum]]. [[Teach-In (band)|Teach-In]]'s victory in [[Stockholm]] the previous year gave The Netherlands the right to host the contest for the third time. The Contest was won by [[Brotherhood of Man]], who sang "[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]" in [[English language|English]], representing the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=ESC1976&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=292|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1976|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|The Hague}}
[[File:Statenhal Sebas Veldhuisen.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nederlands Congresgebouw – host venue of the 1976 contest.]]
The Hague is the seat of government of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the capital city of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[South Holland]]. It is also the third largest city of the Netherlands, after [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]]. Located in the west of the Netherlands, The Hague is in the centre of the [[Haaglanden]] [[conurbation]] and lies at the southwest corner of the larger [[Randstad]] conurbation.

The contest took place at the Congresgebouw (presently known as the ''[[World Forum (The Hague)|World Forum]]''). The venue was constructed in 1969.

== Format ==
The scoring system introduced in the previous year's competition returned in 1976. Each jury gave 12 points to the best song, 10 to the second best, then 8 to the third, and then 7 to 1 (from fourth to tenth best song, according to the jury). Unlike today, the points were not given in order (from 1 up to 12), but in the order the songs were performed. The current procedure was not established until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]].

== Participating countries ==
{{Further|List of countries in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
Sweden, Malta and Turkey withdrew from this contest reducing the number of participating countries down to eighteen from the previous competitions record of nineteen countries that took part. Austria and Greece returned to the contest.&lt;ref name=ESC1976 /&gt;

[[Sweden]] withdrew from the contest, as the broadcaster [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR) did not have enough money to host another contest if Sweden won again. A new rule was therefore introduced that in the future each broadcaster participating would have to pay a part of the cost of staging the contest. As the author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] notes in his book ''The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History'', there had been public demonstrations in Sweden against the contest, which also played a part in SR's decision to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=John Kennedy|title=The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History|publisher=Carlton Books|location=UK|year=2007|pages=64–67|isbn=978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same book also notes that the victorious song went on to become the biggest selling winning single in the history of the contest and won with 80.39% of the possible maximum score; a record under the voting system introduced in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=John Kennedy|title=The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History|publisher=Carlton Books|location=UK|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malta]], having selected Enzo Guzman with the song "Sing Your Song, Country Boy" to represent them, then withdrew from the contest for undisclosed reasons, as the singer has confirmed.&lt;ref name="eurovisionsongs" /&gt; Malta would not return to the competition until 1991. The entry from [[Greece]] aroused  controversy as it was about the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. The previous year Greece had withdrawn from the contest in protest over this matter. This year it was Turkey's turn to withdraw.

[[Liechtenstein]] attempted to submit an entry to the contest, but as they had no broadcasting service of their own, they were not allowed to. Their entry would have been "Little Cowboy" by Biggi Bachmann.&lt;ref name="eurovisionsongs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|title=No, No, Never!!! - Songs That Did Not Make It To Eurovision|publisher=''eurovisionsongs.net''|accessdate=2009-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301032000/http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|archivedate=2009-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A22080368|title=The Eurovision Song Contest 1956 – present|date=2007-04-26|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Returning artists ===
Four artists returned to the contest in 1976.  [[Fredi (singer)|Fredi]] who represented [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finland]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967]], [[Sandra Reemer]] returned having represented [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], [[Peter, Sue and Marc]] also returned  having represented [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Switzerland]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], and finally [[Anne-Karine Strøm]] represented [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norway]] again having last done so in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]]; she repeated her finishing result by coming last once more.

== Results ==
The following tables reflect the officially verified scores given by each jury, adjusted after the transmission. During the live broadcast, France failed to announce the 4 points they awarded to Yugoslavia, an error overlooked by the scrutineer, Clifford Brown. Thus in the live show, Norway were placed 17th and Yugoslavia 18th. After the broadcast, the scores were adjusted and the two nations swapped places, with Yugoslavia's score being adjusted from 6 to 10 points, moving Norway down to last place.

[[File:(Monte Carlo, from Fort Antoine, Monaco (Riviera)) (LOC) - The Library of Congress.jpg|thumb|A late 19th-century view of Fort Antoine and Monte-Carlo.]]
The '''Fort Antoine Theatre''' is a small [[amphitheatre]] on the Avenue de la Quarantaine in the [[Monaco-Ville]] ward of [[Monaco]]. The fort hosts open air plays in the summer months.&lt;ref name='Mon'&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Antoine|url=http://www.visitmonaco.com/en/Places-to-visit/Monuments/Fort-Antoine|work=Visit Monaco - Fort Antoine|publisher=Visit Monaco|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was originally constructed as a fortress in the early 18th-century before its destruction in 1944.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt; [[Rainier III|Prince Rainier III]] had the fortress rebuilt as a theatre in 1953.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt; The [[parapet]] of the fort is provided by [[pittosporum]] hedges.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt; The militaristic nature of its architecture has been retained with a [[bartizan]] and a pyramid of cannonballs at the centre of the theatre.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt;

'''Searchology 2009''' was an event hosted by [[Google]] announcing several novel changes in the Google search options. In previous years Google has used this platform to showcase two significant improvements in its search: Universal Search and [[Google Personalized Search|Personalized Search]]. Searchology 2009 focused on the users' intent.

== Wonder Wheel ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Wonder Wheel provides the user with a flash based interface having the searched query in the middle and the related queries at its branches. The text based results are still available but shifted rightwards. As the user clicks on the related query, the Wonder Wheel expands and the results at the right hand side of the page changes. The main aim of the Wonder Wheel is to guide the user to reach to the relevant resource in an intuitive manner.

== Google Squared ==
When a search is made via Google Squared, the results are presented in the form of rows and columns. Further, these results can be exported to an online spreadsheet program whereby it can be stored into a database.

Although it was presented to the group of media and people from search industry on May 12, 2009, yet it was not made public as Google’s Associate Product Manager Alex Komoroske admitted that owing to the search flaws in Google Squared, later it was launched in [[Google Labs]] on June 3, 2009.

== Rich Snippet ==
Rich Snippet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rich Snippets|url = https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/|website = Google Developers|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; displays additional data from other pages about the resources being displayed in the search result. In order to work, webmasters must incorporate open standards such as [[microdata (HTML)|microdata]], [[microformat]]s or [[RDFa]], and [[JSON-LD]] in their web pages. Google does not guarantee that the use of these open standards will result in rich snippets.

== Rich Card ==

On May 17, 2016, Google announce a new search result format builder called "Rich Card". Rich cards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rich Card|url = https://seoleap.blogspot.com/2016/08/rich-card-structure-data-in-search-console.html/|website = SEO Leap}}&lt;/ref&gt; are similar like Rich snippet, use schema.org Structured markup to showcase the content in a new visual format. Rich card for four content categories: Recipes, Events, Product and Reviews.

== Featured snippets==

When a user asks a question in Google Search, we might show a search result in a special featured snippet block at the top of the search results page. This featured snippet block includes a summary of the answer, extracted from a webpage, plus a link to the page, the page title and URL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Featured snippets in search |url = https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6229325|website = Search Console Help}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://seo.whoops.com.tw/seo/the-study-shows-featured-snippet-will-have-bad-effect/|title=2017研究顯示：Google精選摘要會對排名產生負面影響|date=2017-06-01|publisher=Whoops SEO|accessdate = 2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together''''' was a one-hour, [[Television advertisement|commercial]]-free [[benefit concert]] [[television special]] that aired [[simulcast]] in the United States on November 2, 2012 at 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CT]] [[live television|live]]  from [[New York City]] and [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]ed [[Mountain Time Zone|MT]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]].&lt;ref name="usa-orig"/&gt; The special raised money for the relief efforts from the aftermath of [[Hurricane Sandy]], which had struck the U.S. Northeast four days earlier.&lt;ref name="nyt-symp"/&gt; All proceeds went to the [[American Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="nyt-symp"/&gt;

==Production==
The concert was an effort of [[NBC]] and its affiliated channels, and its origins lay with [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'' show]] anchor [[Matt Lauer]] suggesting it to [[NBCUniversal]] CEO [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]].&lt;ref name="usa-orig"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2012/11/01/nbc-sandy-relief-telethon/1674991/ | title=Matt Lauer suggestion starts starry Sandy telethon | first=Gary | last=Levin | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured appearances and musical performances mostly by those associated with the affected areas, especially [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="nyt-symp"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/arts/music/songs-of-sympathy-at-hurricane-sandy-concert.html?_r=0 | title=Songs of Sympathy and Endurance, From Voices Touched by Hurricane | first=Jon | last=Pareles | authorlink=Jon Pareles | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 3, 2012 | page=A31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-stars"/&gt;  At least one, [[Long Island]]'s [[Billy Joel]], had properties damaged by the storm.&lt;ref name="rs-prep"/&gt;  Organization for the production was put together in a hurry, in the face of logistical and transportation difficulties in the wake of the storm.&lt;ref name="rs-prep"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hurricane-sandy-benefit-plans-came-together-overnight-say-organizers-20121101 | title=Hurricane Sandy Benefit Plans Came Together Overnight, Say Organizers | first=Steve | last=Knopper | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event took place at ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]''{{'s}} Studio 6A at the [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] in [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] in New York before a small audience.&lt;ref name="nyt-symp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-prep"/&gt;  The event followed somewhat in the manner and format of ''[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]]'', which raised money for the relief efforts from the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, and other recent disaster relief telethons.

Approximately $23&amp;nbsp;million was raised by ''Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together'' for the [[American Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | magazine=[[TV Guide]] | title=Hurricane Sandy telethon raises nearly $23 million | first=Robyn | last=Ross | date=November 5, 2012 | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Hurricane-Sandy-Telethon-1055520.aspx?rss=breakingnews&amp;partnerid=worldnow&amp;profileid=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iași National Theatre''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: Teatrul Național Vasile Alecsandri) in [[Iași]], [[Romania]], is the oldest national theatre and one of the most prestigious theatrical institutions in Romania. In 1956, it was given the name of the renowned Romanian playwright and poet [[Vasile Alecsandri]].

==History==
[[File:TNI 1846.jpg|thumb|left|The old building of the National Theatre, 1846]]
One of the first theatrical performance in Romanian language, was organized by [[Gheorghe Asachi]], and held in the capital of [[Moldavia]], Jassy/Iași, on 27 September 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-0mJ7blUGtQC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=first+theatrical+performance+in+Romanian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tiSaCCg2J7&amp;sig=-4Md-LKCHVTN2O_rilvV5Ta-m9c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NZAvTK8chJY468DZ1AE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20theatrical%20performance%20in%20Romanian&amp;f=false History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, a Romanian production took place in Iași on the stage of the Théâtre de varieté, built in 1832 for the French Fouraux troupe. 

The National Theatre was founded on 15 May 1840, as the ''Great Theatre of Moldavia'', when the Romanian language troupe, led by [[Costache Caragiale|Costache Caragiali]], was united with the French troupe, under a single direction of [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and the management of Costache Caragiali.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA933&amp;lpg=PA933&amp;dq=first+first+theatre+performance+Romanian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uK_HV7btXh&amp;sig=64VSDq6lqoxuIc1EYzH9dt2xN_c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nn8vTITwL8j_OcuDiIEC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20first%20theatre%20performance%20Romanian&amp;f=false The Cambridge guide to theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 1846, a new audience hall was inaugurated in the former mansion of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]], on the [[Seven hills of Iași|Hill of Copou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.teatrulnationaliasi.ro/pages/theatre History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
On the night of 17/18 February 1888, the theatre building was destroyed by the fire.

The efforts to build the new theatre edifice culminated in 1894 when a contract was signed with the Viennese architects [[Ferdinand Fellner|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]], who designed several theatres and palaces across Europe, including the theatres in: [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Oradea]], [[Timișoara]] and [[Chernivtsi]] (Romanian: Cernăuți). 
[[File:Teatrul Naţional Interior.jpg|thumb|left|The main auditorium]]
For the building work, a contract was signed with a Bucharest company, and the power station was built by a company from Berlin. The Theatre’s power station also supplied with electricity the 12 electric-arc lamps lighting the Theatre Square, marking the beginning of electrification in the city of Iași. The works to building took two years, and on 1 and 2 December 1896, the inauguration festivities took place with [[Alexander Flechtenmacher|Flechtenmacher]]'s ''National Overture'', the vaudevilles ''Muza de la Burdujeni'' (''The Muse from Burdujeni'') by [[Costache Negruzzi]] and ''Cinel-cinel'' (''The Riddle'') by Vasile Alecsandri, as well as the verse comedy ''Poetul romantic'' (''The Romantic Poet'') by [[Matei Millo]].

Nowadays, the building also hosts the [[Iași Romanian National Opera]].

The Iași National Theatre building is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Monuments in Romania|National Register of Historic Monuments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrimoniu.gov.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_IS.pdf The Romanian Register of Historical Monuments in Iași County]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
With a [[Neoclassic style|Neoclassic]] exterior and a richly decorated interior in [[Rococo]] and [[Baroque]] styles, the building is considered one of the most elegant in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romaniatourism.com/iasi.html IASI - City Highlights] at romaniatourism.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The main auditorium is organised in stalls, boxes and a balcony. The curtain painted by the Viennese M. Lenz, presents in the middle, an allegory of life with its three stages and, to the right side, the allegory of [[Greater Romania|Romanian Unification]]. The left-hand side, painted by Lenz’s apprentice, differs from the rest of the curtain in style and colouring.

The ceiling and the iron curtain were painted by Alexander Goltz. The iron curtain, which completely separates the scene from the hall, shows ornaments placed symmetrically, while the ceiling has as a narrative basis the Archetypal Story, shown in paradisiacal allegories, with nymphs and cupids framed in rococo stucco.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/teatrulnationaliasi/home/istoric The main theatre building]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1,418 electric lights and the chandelier with 109 Venetian crystal lamps light up a playhouse with a unique architectural personality.

The '''July 2010 Kampala attacks''' were suicide bombings carried out against crowds watching a screening of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final]] match at two locations in [[Kampala]], the capital city of [[Uganda]], on {{Nowrap|11 July}} 2010. The attacks left 74 dead and 71 injured. [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], an [[Islamist]] militia based in [[Somalia]] that has ties to [[Al-Qaeda]], claimed responsibility for the blasts as retaliation for Ugandan support for [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]].&lt;ref name="aol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uganda Blasts: American Killed, Missionaries Hurt|url=http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/uganda-bombing-american-aid-worker-nate-henn-killed-six-us-missionaries-injured/19550468|date=12 July 2010|accessdate=12 July 2010|publisher=AOL News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713201244/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/uganda-bombing-american-aid-worker-nate-henn-killed-six-us-missionaries-injured/19550468|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the trial of 13 Kenyan, Ugandan and Tanzanian alleged perpetrators of the bombings began at the High Court of Uganda.&lt;ref name="Lotoutsb"/&gt;

==Background==
The [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] militant group grew into a potent force against the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of [[Somalia]] and threatened attacks against foreign and [[AMISOM]] troops deployed against it in the country, including those from [[Uganda]]. The July 2010 attack in [[Kampala]] was seen as revenge against the Ugandan forces' presence in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Rest-of-World/Barely-4-years-old-Shabaab-is-Qaidas-face-in-east-Africa-/articleshow/6160474.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Barely 4 years old, Shabaab is Qaida's face in east Africa | date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Qaeda]] was also [[Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa#Somalia and Kenya|rumoured]] to have been involved in Somalia.

After expressing regret and indicating that he had taken part in the bombings under threat of decapitation, he was spared the death penalty.

===2015 sentencings after trial===
In March 2015, the trial of 13 other men suspected of having been involved in the 2010 Kampala bombings began at the High Court of Uganda. The hearings had been delayed for five years due to court challenges by the apprehended individuals, who accused the Ugandan police and security agencies of torture and illegal rendition. The seven Kenyans, five Ugandans, and one Tanzanian were each charged with terrorism, murder, attempted murder, and of being accessories to terrorism, All but one were accused of being Al-Shabaab members.&lt;ref name="Lotoutsb"/&gt;

The trial was again delayed when the prosecutor, [[Joan Kagezi]], was murdered on 30 March 2015, purportedly by agents of Al-Shabaab. The trial resumed in June 2015.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt;

In May 2016, all defendants were acquitted of being members of Al-Shabaab because, in 2010, that organization was not listed by Uganda as a terrorist organization. Seven of the suspects were convicted of terrorism, murder, and attempted murder. Ugandan [[Isa Ahmed Luyima]], who is thought to have orchestrated the attacks, Kenyan [[Hussein Hassan Agad]], Kenyan [[Idris Magondu]], Kenyan [[Habib Suleiman Njoroge]], and Kenyan [[Muhammed Ali Muhamed]] were sentenced to life imprisonment. The other two, Ugandan [[Hassan Haruna Luyima]] and Tanzanian [[Suleiman Hajjir Nyamandondo]], were sentenced to 50 years imprisonment. Five of the suspects were acquitted (Kenyan [[Yahya Suleiman Mbuthia]], Kenyan [[Muhammed Hamid Suleiman]], Kenyan [[Mohammed Awadh]], Ugandan [[Abubakari Batemetyo]], and Ugandan [[Ismail Kalule]]). Ugandan [[Muzafaru Luyima]] was acquitted of terrorism but convicted of aiding the attackers. He was sentenced to one year of community service. Two sets of brothers were tried in this case: Isa Ahmed Luyima and Muzafaru Luyima; Yahya Suleiman Mbuthia and Habib Suleiman Njoroge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newsweek.com/uganda-convicts-terrorists-al-shabab-2010-world-cup-bombing-464176 | title=Uganda: 7 Convicted of 2010 Al-Shabab World Cup Bombing | publisher=[[Newsweek]] | date=27 May 2016 | first=Conor | last=Gaffey | accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/africa/uganda-al-shabaab-bombings-conviction/ | title=8 sentenced in 2010 Al-Shabaab bombings | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=27 May 2016 | first1=Samson | last1=Ntale | first2=Ralph | last2=Ellis | accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-10821630 | title=Three Kenyan men charged with Uganda bomb attacks | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=30 July 2010 | accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000203140/four-kenyans-found-guilty-of-uganda-bombing | title=Four Kenyans found guilty of Uganda bombing | publisher=[[The Standard (Kenya)]] | first=Fred | last=Makana | date=27 May 2016 | accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Power-blackout-at-high-court-ahead-of-July-2010-bombings-verdict/688334-3219374-d7uupk/index.html | title=LIVE: Seven convicted, five acquitted in the July 2010 bomb case | publisher=[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]] | first=Anthony | last=Wesaka | date=27 May 2016 | accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Klondike derby''' is an annual event held by some [[Boy Scouts of America]] and [[Scouts Canada]] districts during the winter months and is based on the heritage of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoutdocs.ca/Klondike/|title=Klondike, Ho!|accessdate=October 9, 2007|author=Morland, Liam|work=Scoutdocs }}&lt;/ref&gt; BSA units have been running Klondike derbies since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Grandaddy of Klondike Derbies|journal=Scouting|author=Peterson, Robert|issue=January–February 1999|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/9901/a-klon.html|accessdate=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event varies by district, but the typical Klondike derby consists of several stations where patrols/units must test their [[Scoutcraft]] skills and their leadership abilities, earning points towards a total score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boyslife.org/outdoors/outdoorarticles/2638/plan-and-run-a-klondike-derby/|date=November 2007|title=Plan and Run a Klondike Derby|author=Derr, Aaron|accessdate=October 7, 2010|work=Boys' Life }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, one or more races are included while the Scouts navigate between stations.

The unit must transport their gear on a homemade sled pulled by the Scouts. Districts may have specific guidelines for the construction of sleds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/about/download/klondike.pdf |title=Plans for Klondike Derby Sled (Sledge) |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |work=Scouting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125234912/http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/about/download/klondike.pdf |archivedate=January 25, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations==
''Extreme Klondike!'' is a front-country, up-to-24-hour, cold-weather, personal and team challenge for older Scouts and Venturers often held in conjunction with Klondike Derby.  The aim of this variation is to increase/sustain older youth participation.  Part backpacking, part survival, and/or part winter camping, the mini-High-Adventure ''Extreme Klondike!'' collection of events aims to replicate trail life in the Great Northwest by presenting a wide range of basic-skill,  higher-standard challenges and letting the '[http://www.boyledtroop.org/index.php?title=Main_Page boy-led]' team decide who, when and how to complete each event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecumsehcouncilbsa.org/Chillicothe/Events/CHLKlondikeDerbyShipWreckedinAlaska|title=Chillicothe Klondike Derby 'Ship Wrecked in Alaska'|publisher=[[Tecumseh Council]]|year=2016|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecrater.com/p/23363300/n-12762-cac-pioneer-district-winter-camporee-2010|title=N-12762 CAC Pioneer District Winter Camporee 2010 Extreme Klondike Camp Belzer|publisher=[[eCRATER]]|date=September 19, 2015|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://storage.scoutingvermont.org/event/docs/5914/three_rivers_2014_klondike_derby_registration_information_and_form.pdf |title=Three Rivers District Klondike Derby |publisher=[[Green Mountain Council]] |year=2014 |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128014715/http://storage.scoutingvermont.org/event/docs/5914/three_rivers_2014_klondike_derby_registration_information_and_form.pdf |archivedate=January 28, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rheinpark-Köln-OSM.png|thumb|Map of the Cologne trade fair grounds (marked ''Messegelände'')]]
'''Koelnmesse GmbH''' (''Cologne Trade Fair'') is an international trade fair and exhibition center located in [[Cologne]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. With around 80 [[trade fair]]s and over 2,000 [[Business conference|conferences]] annually, Koelnmesse is one of the country's largest trade fair organisers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koelnmesse.com/en/messenundveranstaltungen/messenveranstaltungen_1.php Koelnmesse.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and with 284,000 m² exhibition floor area the third largest by area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auma.de/de/messemarkt/branchenkennzahlen/internationalemessen/seiten/hallenkapazitaeten.aspx Hall capacities by AUMA e. V.] Hall capacities by AUMA e. V.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cologne Trade Fair ground was founded in 1922. Until 2005, the trade fair was based in the historic Rheinhallen, and since then moved into new premises next to them. The old [[Fair Tower Cologne]] (''Messeturm Köln'') is a landmark building from 1928 and features a tower restaurant on the top floor.

Since 2018, the fair has been undergoing the greatest renovation works in its history. They are expected to last until 2030 and cost €600 million. Two thirds of that amount will be spent renovating the seven southern halls, dating from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rundschau-online.de/region/koeln/sanierung-vor-gamescom-die-koelnmesse-modernisiert-sieben-suedhallen-30629372# |publisher=Kölnische Rundschau |title= Die Kölnmesse modernisiert sieben Südhallen| date= 15 June 2018 |language=German |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''LICOPA affair''' ({{lang-fr|l'affaire LICOPA}}) was a diplomatic conflict between the [[People's Republic of Congo]] ([[Congo-Brazzaville]]) and [[Zaire]] (present-day [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) during the [[Cold War]] in the early 1970s. At the time the two neighbouring states found themselves on opposing sides in Cold War politics, with Zaire under [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] a Western ally and Congo a socialist state aligned with the [[Soviet Union]].

The Zairean authorities claimed that the Congolese embassy in [[Kinshasa]] had functioned as an intermediary between the Congolese League for Peace and Friendship between the Peoples (''LIgue COngolaise pour la Paix et l'Amitié entre les peuples'', LICOPA; 'licopa' is also the [[Lingala]] word for 'secret complot') and Zairean 'subversives'. According to Zaire, LICOPA trained Zairean opposition activists.&lt;ref name="congo"&gt;Bazenguissa-Ganga, Rémy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=15Qza8LQcFMC Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique]''. Paris: Karthala, 1997. p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rdc"/&gt; Several persons accused of involvement with LICOPA were arrested in Zaire, whilst others were forced into exile.&lt;ref name="rdc"/&gt;

On August 21, 1971, Zaire declared the Congolese chargé d'affaires in Kinshasa, Lieutenant Eyabo, to be a ''[[persona non grata]]''.&lt;ref name="congo"/&gt;

In an attempt to revive Congolese-Zairean relations, the Congolese authorities carried out arrests to appease Zaire. One of the arrested was Ando Ibarra, who had been charged ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in a Kinshasa court for endangering national security and spreading 'false rumours' in the Zairean army. Ibarra was sentenced to three years imprisonment in Congo.&lt;ref name="congo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rdc"&gt;''[http://www.congointer.com/congointercaddy.htm Interview de Jonas Caddy Cadima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131450/http://www.congointer.com/congointercaddy.htm |date=2009-01-06 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Congo never admitted that there had been any links between Ibarra and Lieutenant Eyado (as charged by Zaire). After being released, Ibarra was banished from Congo for ten years.&lt;ref name="congo"/&gt;

With over 140 years of history, the '''Lausanne Opera''' continues to respond to the public’s growing demand for lyrical performances. Once known as a municipal theater, it has transformed into a world renowned opera house that produces and co-produces their own productions. With a stage renovation in 2012, the Lausanne Opera offers a wide variety of operas, from baroque to contemporary, along with concerts and ballets. Thanks to its bold programming and emphasis on quality vocals and stage production, the Lausanne Opera welcomes over 45'000 spectators a year and continues to make itself known internationally. 

==History==
The opening ceremony took place on 10 May 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera-lausanne.ch/fr/lopera/un-peu-dhistoire.html |title=Opéra de Lausanne - Un peu d'histoire |publisher=Opera-lausanne.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{Lang|fr|Le duc de Guise}}''''' (full title ''{{Lang|fr|Le duc de Guise, ou Les ėtats de Blois}}'' (''The [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], or The Council of [[Blois]]))'' is an [[opéra comique]] in three acts by [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]], to a [[libretto]] by [[Eugène de Planard|François-Antoine-Eugène de Planard]] and [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]], based on a play from 1809 of the same name by [[François Just Marie Raynouard]]. The opera received its premiere on 8 September 1837 at the [[Opéra-Comique]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Tamvaco (2000), pp. 735-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera, which centres on the assassination of the Duc de Guise in 1588, was the third and last of Onslow's operas to be produced. The text and music were well received by the audience, but [[Gérard de Nerval]] complained in a review that they had not offered Jenny Colon the opportunity to display her talents.&lt;ref&gt;Tamvaco (2000), p. 736.&lt;/ref&gt;

Onslow made an arrangement of extracts of the opera for [[string quartet]] (his Op. 60).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon-romantique.com/Discographie-George-Onslow-Guise-ou-les-Etats-de-Blois-Le-Salon-Romantique.html Le Salon Romantique website], accessed 5 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://primavista.free.fr/guise.html ''Le duc de Guise''] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===2009–2011: ''Unser Star für Oslo'' and Eurovision Song Contest===
Meyer-Landrut decided to take part in the talent show ''[[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|Unser Star für Oslo]]'' (Our Star for Oslo), a newly created national television programme to select the German entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] in Oslo.&lt;ref name="welt"/&gt; The show was organised by public broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and private television station [[ProSieben]], as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant [[Stefan Raab]]. From 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she said, "I like to test myself. I wanted to see how I am perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can't judge myself at all."&lt;ref name="bunte"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harders|first=Antje|title=NACHGEFRAGT ... bei Nachwuchstalent Lena Meyer-Landrut|work=[[Bunte]]|date=July 2010|page=110|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her first appearance, performing "[[My Same]]" by British singer [[Adele]], Meyer-Landrut received much praise from the show's jury panel and was instantly considered the favourite.&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt; The following week, Adele's "My Same" entered the [[Media Control|German singles chart]] at number 61.&lt;ref name="adele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chartverfolgung / Adele / Single|work=musicline.de|url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Adele/?type=single|accessdate=24 March 2010|language=German|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202035831/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Adele/?type=single|archivedate=2 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer-Landrut reached the final of ''Unser Star für Oslo'', mainly performing lesser-known songs by international artists [[The Bird and the Bee]], [[Kate Nash]], [[Paolo Nutini]] and [[Lisa Mitchell]].

Through [[televoting]] the audience chose "Satellite", written by American [[Julie Frost]] and Dane John Gordon, to be her designated song in the event she won the show. In a second round of voting Meyer-Landrut was chosen as Germany's entry for the 55th Eurovision Song Contest, beating the last remaining contestant, [[Jennifer Braun]].&lt;ref name="esctoday Germany sends Lena"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klier|first=Marcus|title=Germany sends Lena Meyer-Landrut to the Eurovision Song Contest|work=esctoday.com|date=12 March 2010|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=15370|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for "Satellite" was shot during the night of the final and premiered on German television stations four days later.&lt;ref name="dwdl"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mantel|first=Uwe|title=Lenas "Satellite" feiert Premiere auf fünf Sendern|work=dwdl.de|date=16 March 2010|url=http://www.dwdl.de/story/25206/lenas_satellite_feiert_premiere_auf_fnf_sendern/|accessdate=22 July 2012|language=German|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191528/http://www.dwdl.de/story/25206/lenas_satellite_feiert_premiere_auf_fnf_sendern|archivedate=22 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Update (10/12/2017):''' Game developments have been '''suspended''' by devs due to lack of budget and is no longer being developed. There's no official info about how much of the game was developed.

'''''Liberation 71''''' is a [[first person shooter]] video game based on the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samakal.net/2014/03/27/48602|title=আসছে মুক্তিযুদ্ধের গেম 'লিবারেশন ৭১' - প্রযুক্তি প্রতিদিন - Samakal Online Version&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=samakal.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game is being developed by a group of young developers named "Team 71".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Islam|first1=Muhammad Zahidul|title=Games and app launched marking Independence Day|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/sci-tech/2014/mar/28/games-and-app-launched-marking-independence-day|website=dhakatribune.com|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective is to fight against the [[Pakistan Army]] in the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation war]] as a [[Mukti Bahini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prothom Alo Desk|title=HomeScience &amp; Tech  Computer game "Liberation 71"|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/science-technology/news/45869/Computer-game-on-Liberation-71|website=en.prothom-alo.com|publisher=Prothom Alo|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some young people got the idea of developing this game through communicating on the social network website [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/print-edition/news/2014/03/27/66100|title=কম্পিউটার গেম 'লিবারেশন ৭১' - খবর - কালের কণ্ঠ|work=কালের কণ্ঠ}}&lt;/ref&gt; They published the alpha version of the game on 25 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailysangbad.com/index_arch.php?view=details&amp;type=gold&amp;data=Tax&amp;pub_no=1718&amp;menu_id=28&amp;news_type_id=1&amp;val=159338|title=দৈনিক সংবাদ|work=thedailysangbad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long history of '''rioting in [[Cincinnati]]''', [[Ohio]], United States, since the city was founded in 1788. Some riots were fueled by racial tension, while others by issues such as employment conditions and political justice.&lt;ref name=Kiesewetter2001/&gt;

==1792==

The first riot recorded in Cincinnati was in 1792, after a merchant named John Bartle was beaten by a soldier. Fifty people were involved in the fighting.&lt;ref name=Kiesewetter2001/&gt; The riot between settlers and soldiers occurred when spring flooding had driven many people out of their cabins.&lt;ref name=Hurt1998/&gt;

==1829==
{{Main article|Cincinnati riots of 1829}}
By 1829, African Americans numbered almost 10% of the city's population.
In the [[Cincinnati Riots of 1829]], about 1,000 of them were driven out of the town by violent mobs. Some of the displaced people moved north to settle in Canada.&lt;ref name=Kiesewetter2001/&gt; After the 1829 riots, a growing number of whites became sympathetic to the rights of Negroes, as they were called then.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez2007/&gt;

==1836==
[[File:James G. Birney.jpg|thumb|[[James G. Birney]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] publisher whose press was twice destroyed during the 1836 riots.]]
{{Main article|Cincinnati riots of 1836}}
The [[Cincinnati Riots of 1836]] were caused by racial tensions at a time when African Americans, some of whom had escaped from slavery in the southern states of the United States, were competing with whites for jobs. The riots occurred in April and July.&lt;ref name=Brown1975/&gt; The rioters attacked both Negroes and the whites who supported them.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez2007/&gt; A former slave owner from [[Alabama]], [[James Gillespie Birney]], had become an abolitionist. In January 1836 he set up the ''Cincinnati Weekly and Abolitionist'', a newspaper sponsored by the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society.&lt;ref name=Bryant1994/&gt; The newspaper targeted slaveholders across the [[Ohio River]] in [[Kentucky]] with anti-slavery propaganda. This angered local businessmen who were keen to do business with the southern states.&lt;ref name=Aaron1992/&gt; A riot broke out in April in which buildings were burned and several blacks lost their lives. The riot was only brought under control when the governor intervened and declared martial law.&lt;ref name=Trotter1998/&gt; In July, the press that printed Birney's newspaper was twice destroyed, and further damage was caused to Negro properties.&lt;ref name=Stowe1890/&gt;

==1841==
{{Main article|Cincinnati riots of 1841}}
In the [[Cincinnati riots of 1841]], a mob of white men met in the Fifth Street Market and marched on "Little Africa", or "Buck Town"an area along the riverfront that was mainly inhabited by African Americans.  The African Americans were armed and ready. Whites secured a cannon, rolled it down sixth street, faced it toward Buck Town, the name of the area where African American's resided, and fired it, lives were lost. Martial law was declared, 300 black men were arrested. While they were in custody, many of their homes were attacked.&lt;ref name=Cayton2002/&gt;

==1853==
{{Main article|Cincinnati riot of 1853}}

The [[Cincinnati Riot of 1853]] broke out on 25 December 1853. An armed mob of about 500 German men with 100 women following marched on the home of Bishop John Purcell, protesting a visit by Cardinal [[Gaetano Bedini]], the emissary of Pope [[Pius IX]]. The Germans, many of whom had been involved in the European [[revolutions of 1848]], or whose families had been involved, identified Bedini with the forces of reaction and oppression. One protester was killed and over 60 were arrested.&lt;ref name=Connelly1960/&gt;

==1855==
{{main article|Cincinnati riots of 1855}}
The [[Cincinnati riots of 1855]] were clashes between "[[nativists]]" and [[German-Americans]]. The nativists supported J.D. Taylor, the mayoral candidate for the anti-immigrant American Party, also known as the [[Know-Nothing Party]]. German-Americans erected barricades in the streets leading into their [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood, and fired a cannon over the heads of a mob of nativists attacking them.&lt;ref name=Kiesewetter2001/&gt;

==1884==
[[File:Cincinnati Riots 1884 Barricade on Court Street.jpg|thumb|A hastily built barricade on Court Street, in 1884]] 
{{Main article|Cincinnati riots of 1884}}

The [[Cincinnati riots of 1884]], also known as the Cincinnati Courthouse riots, were the most violent in the history of the city. They were caused by public outrage over the decision of a jury to return a verdict of manslaughter in a perceived clear case of murder. A mob in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], United States attempted to find and lynch the man. In the violence that followed over the next few days, over 50 people died and the courthouse and jail were destroyed.&lt;ref name=OhioHistorySociety/&gt;

==1935==

In 1935 a fight between the students at Oyler School in Price Hill, one black and one white, quickly escalated. Police were forced to block the Eighth Street viaduct to separate groups of angry whites and blacks. During the riot, sixteen people were arrested.&lt;ref name=SafePassage/&gt;

==1967==

The [[Avondale, Cincinnati#Riots of 1967|Avondale riot of 1967]] followed years of police abuse and deteriorating living conditions in the poor black community of [[Avondale, Cincinnati|Avondale]].&lt;ref name=White2001/&gt; The riots followed the disputed June 1967 conviction of Posteal Laskey Jr., accused of being the [[Cincinnati Strangler]].&lt;ref name=Hall1998/&gt; The riots were ignited when Laskey's cousin, who was protesting the conviction, was arrested for loitering near the Abraham Lincoln statue at Rockdale Avenue and Reading Road on 12 June 1967.&lt;ref name=White2001/&gt;
Crowds filled the streets and threw bottles and firebombs at businesses.&lt;ref name=Hall1998/&gt; The [[Ohio National Guard]] was called in to restore order.
One person died and there were 404 arrests. In 1968, President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s Commission on Civil Disorders issued a report that blamed the riots on the poverty of the segregated neighborhoods in Cincinnati and the practice of police officers in "stopping Negroes on foot or in cars without obvious basis" and using loitering laws disproportionately against minorities.&lt;ref name=White2001/&gt;

==1968==

The [[Avondale, Cincinnati#Riots of 1968|Avondale riot of 1968]] broke out in Avondale after the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], a civil rights leader, in April 1968. A mob smashed store windows and looted the stores or burned the merchandise.&lt;ref name=Hall1998/&gt;
The Ohio National Guard was called to restore peace in [[Avondale, Cincinnati|Avondale]]. Two people were killed, at least 220 injured and 260 arrested during two nights of violence.&lt;ref name=Kiesewetter2001/&gt;

==2001==

{{Main article|2001 Cincinnati riots}}

The [[2001 Cincinnati riots]] were the largest urban disorders in the United States since the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]]. Three days of rioting were triggered by a fatal police shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager, Timothy Thomas.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001/&gt; On the third night of violence, looting, and vandalizing, [[Charlie Luken]], the mayor of Cincinnati at the time, issued a citywide curfew which happened to be accompanied by rain, and the riots stopped. The curfew was for all of Cincinnati, but was generally only enforced in the downtown area. There were no reports of rioting from the 13th or later. The immediate crisis had ended but the immediate damage was estimated at $3.6 million. Many business in the downtown area were damaged in the riots. Many of  63 rioters were indicted on felony charges.&lt;ref name=McCain21042001/&gt;

Sixty-four songs written by one-hundred and nineteen songwriters have won the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], an annual competition organised by member countries of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. The contest, which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956, is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. The contest's winner have been determined using numerous [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|voting techniques]] throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or [[Televoting|televoters]]. The country with the song that was awarded the most points is declared the winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/addons/files/Extract_ESC2007Rules.pdf Extract from the rules for the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest].

There have been 60 contests, with one winning country each year except the tied [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969 contest]], which had four.

[[File:Asteroidsscale.jpg|thumb|The comparative sizes of the first nine asteroids that were visited by spacecraft]]
The following tables list all [[minor planets]] and [[comet]]s that have been visited by spacecraft.
&lt;!-- For "Notes", use the following terms:
Orbited - when the spacecraft orbited the minor planet or comet
Flyby - when the spacecraft approached within reasonable distance (~10,000 km) of the minor planet or comet
Distant flyby - when it was further than the flyby distance
Landed - when a landing was done on the minor planet or comet
 --&gt;

== List of minor planets visited by spacecraft ==

Since the 1990s, a total of 13 [[minor planet]]s – currently all of them are [[asteroid]]s and [[dwarf planet]]s – have been visited by [[space probe]]s. Note that [[natural satellite|moons]] (not directly orbiting the Sun), [[comet]]s and [[planet]]s are not minor planets and thus are not included in the table below.

In addition to the listed objects, three asteroids have been imaged by spacecraft at distances too large to resolve features (over 100,000&amp;nbsp;km), and are hence not considered "visited". Asteroid [[132524 APL]] was imaged by ''[[New Horizons]]'' in 2006 at a distance of 101,867&amp;nbsp;km, [[2685 Masursky]] by ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' in 2000 at a distance of 1,600,000&amp;nbsp;km, and [[307 Nike]] by [[Pioneer 10]] in 1972 at a distance of 8,800,000&amp;nbsp;km. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]], a spacecraft in Earth orbit, has imaged several large asteroids, including [[2 Pallas]] and [[3 Juno]].

In 2009, '''Bernice Novack''' and her son, [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach]] hotel heir '''Ben Novack Jr.''', were murdered three months apart. '''Narcy Novack''' (née Narcisa Véliz Pacheco; born 1956), Ben's estranged wife, was convicted of orchestrating the murders and after a highly publicized trial, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack, brother guilty of plotting murders"&gt;{{cite news|title=Narcy Novack, brother guilty of plotting murders|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/20/2859191/verdict-is-in-at-narcy-novack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes ==

On April 5, 2009, Ben's 87-year-old mother, Bernice, was found dead in her [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] home. Her husband [[Ben Novack|Ben Novack Sr.]], who built the hotel and owned it until 1977, had died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben Novack Sr.,78 Is Dead; Founder of Fontainebleau|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/07/us/ben-novack-sr.78-is-dead-founder-of-fontainebleau.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=Associated Press|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=7 April 1985|location=MIAMI BEACH, FL.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was initially ruled to be the result of an [[accidental death|accidental]] fall while trying to get out of her car,&lt;ref name="Bernice Novack, former model and wife of Fontainebleau hotelier"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernice Novack, former model and wife of Fontainebleau hotelier|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2009/04/09/4118904.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after her son's murder three months later, a subsequent police investigation revealed that her death was a [[homicide]].&lt;ref name="Bernice Novack case shows coroner, police aren't perfect"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernice Novack case shows coroner, police aren't perfect|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-07-19/news/fl-novack-mayocol-b071910-20100719_1_bernice-novack-suspicious-deaths-sistrunk-boulevard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==

Narcy Novack, from [[Fort Lauderdale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/12/17/sentencing-day-in-narcy-novack-family-killings-case/|title=Narcy Novack Sentenced To Life In Family Killings Case|date=17 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was arrested for the murders of her husband and mother-in-law in July 2010, three days shy of a year after her husband's death. Her brother, Cristóbal Véliz, was also accused of enlisting Alejandro Gutiérrez-García, Joel González, and Denis Ramírez to participate in both murders.&lt;ref name="Widow Arrested in Murder of Ben Novack Jr., son of Miami Hotel Legend"&gt;{{cite news|title=Widow Arrested in Murder of Ben Novack Jr., son of Miami Hotel Legend|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20010021-504083.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcy and Véliz were tried together in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]room in [[White Plains, New York]] in 2012. The duo's defense was to blame Narcy's only daughter from a previous marriage, May Abad, for having orchestrated the killings, stating that she was motivated to collect on Ben Novack Jr.'s estate, including a large collection of [[Batman]] memorabilia.&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack Sentenced To Life In Family Killings Case"&gt;{{cite news|title=Narcy Novack Sentenced To Life In Family Killings Case|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/12/17/sentencing-day-in-narcy-novack-family-killings-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors alleged that Narcy was afraid that her husband would leave her for his mistress, and that a [[prenuptial agreement]] would only leave her $65,000 instead of the bulk of her late husband's estate.&lt;ref name="NBC Dateline showcases millionaire murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Dateline showcases millionaire murder|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-09-07/news/fl-novack-nbc-dateline-tophat-20120907_1_ben-novack-cristobal-veliz-bernice-novack}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed she was motivated by "hatred, greed, and [[vengeance (concept)|vengeance]]."&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack Sentenced To Life In Family Killings Case"/&gt;

== Verdict ==

At the conclusion of the trial, Narcy and Veliz were each convicted of [[murder]], [[conspiracy to commit murder]], [[domestic violence]], [[stalking]], [[money laundering]], and [[witness tampering]]. Narcy waived her right to appear in court when the guilty verdict was read. She also did not appear in court when she was sentenced to [[life in prison without parole]].&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack Sentenced To Life In Family Killings Case"/&gt; Novack is currently [[incarceration|incarcerated]] at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee|Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack back in court to fight for marital assets"&gt;{{cite news|title=Narcy Novack back in court to fight for marital assets|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20130611/NEWS/306110086/Narcy-Novack-back-court-fight-marital-assets}}&lt;/ref&gt; Véliz was also sentenced to life in prison without parole and he is currently incarcerated at the [[United States Penitentiary, Big Sandy]] in [[Inez, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack back in court to fight for marital assets"/&gt; Gutiérrez-García, González, and Ramírez all [[guilty plea|pleaded guilty]] to lesser charges.

In accordance with the [[slayer rule]], Narcy Novack will be unable to inherit her husband's estate. Ben Novack Jr.'s estate, valued at $4.2 million, is expected to go to Novack's daughter May Abad and her two adult sons.&lt;ref name="Narcy Novack case: Daughter poised to inherit multimillion dollar estate (NY/FL)"/&gt;

== History ==
In 1953, in Genoa Mario Porcile opened a classical ballet school, assisted by his friend and [[La Scala]] dancer Ugo Dell'Ara. In 1955 they opened the first Italian festival dedicated solely to ballet, set up for many years in the famous Nervi parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|305px|right|The Eastern Mediterranean in 1450, just before the Fall of Constantinople. Venetian possessions are in green and red. By 1463, the Ottoman dominions would have expanded to include the Byzantine Empire (purple), and most of the smaller Balkan states.]]

The '''First Ottoman–Venetian War''' was fought between the [[Republic of Venice]] and her allies and the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1463 to 1479. Fought shortly after the [[Fall of Constantinople|capture]] of [[Constantinople]] and the remnants of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by the Ottomans, it resulted in the loss of several Venetian holdings in Albania and Greece, most importantly the island of Negroponte ([[Euboea]]), which had been a [[Lordship of Negroponte|Venetian protectorate]] for centuries. The war also saw the rapid expansion of the Ottoman navy, which became able to challenge the Venetians and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] for supremacy in the Aegean Sea. In the closing years of the war, however, the Republic managed to recoup its losses by the ''de facto'' acquisition of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Cyprus]].

== Background ==
Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1203–1204), the lands of the [[Byzantine Empire]] were divided among several western [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] ("[[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]]") [[Crusader states]], ushering in the period known in Greek as ''[[Latinokratia]]''. Despite the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty in the later 13th century, many of these "Latin" states survived until the rise of a new power, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Chief among these was the Republic of Venice, which had founded an extensive maritime empire, controlling numerous coastal possessions and islands in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] and [[Aegean Sea]]s. In its first conflict with the Ottomans, Venice had already lost the city of [[Thessalonica]] in 1430, following a long [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|siege]], but the resulting peace treaty left the other Venetian possessions intact.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1453, the Ottomans captured the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], and continued to expand their territories in the [[Balkans]], [[Asia Minor]] and the Aegean. [[Serbian Despotate|Serbia]] was conquered in 1459, and the last Byzantine remnants, the [[Despotate of Morea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] were subdued in 1460–1461.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian-controlled [[Duchy of Naxos]] and the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colonies of [[Lesbos]] and [[Chios]] became tributary in 1458, only for the latter to be directly annexed four years later.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman advance thus inevitably posed a threat to Venice's holdings in southern Greece, and, following the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] in 1463, in the Adriatic coast as well.&lt;ref name="Finkel63"&gt;Finkel (2006), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (1976), pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreak of the war ==
According to the Greek historian [[Michael Critobulus]], hostilities broke out because of the flight of an Albanian slave of the Ottoman commander of Athens to the Venetian fortress of Coron ([[Koroni]]) with 100,000 silver [[akçe|aspers]] from his master's treasure. The fugitive then converted to Christianity, and demands for his rendition by the Ottomans were therefore refused by the Venetian authorities.&lt;ref name="Setton241"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Using this as a pretext, in November 1462, [[Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey]], the Ottoman commander in central Greece, attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto ([[Nafpaktos]]). On 3 April 1463 however, the governor of the Morea, [[Isa-Beg Ishaković]], took the Venetian-held town of [[Argos]] by treason.&lt;ref name="Setton241"/&gt;

Although Venice, dependent on the trade with the Ottomans, had in the past been reluctant to confront them in war, the urgings of the papal legate, Cardinal [[Bessarion]], and an impassioned speech by the distinguished Council member [[Vettore Cappello]], tipped the balance, and on 28 July, the Senate narrowly voted for declaring war on the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].&lt;ref name="Setton243"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Pius II]] used this opportunity to form yet another Crusade against the Ottomans: on 12 September 1463, Venice and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] king [[Matthias Corvinus]] signed an alliance, followed on 19 October by an alliance with the Pope and Duke [[Philip the Good]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Setton249"/&gt; According to its terms, upon victory, the Balkans would be divided among the allies. The Morea and the western Greek coast ([[Epirus]]) would fall to Venice, Hungary would acquire [[Bulgaria]], Serbia, Bosnia and [[Wallachia]], the Albanian principality under [[Skanderbeg]] would expand into [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and the remaining European territories of the Ottomans, including Constantinople, would form a restored Byzantine Empire under the surviving members of the Palaiologos family.&lt;ref name="Shaw65"&gt;Shaw (1976), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as [[Karamanids]], [[Uzun Hassan]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]].&lt;ref name="Shaw65"/&gt;

== Campaigns in the Morea and the Aegean, 1463–1466 ==
The new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the [[Captain General of the Sea]] [[Alvise Loredan]], landed in the Morea, while Matthias Corvinus invaded Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Finkel63"/&gt; At the same time, Pius II began assembling an army at [[Ancona]], hoping to lead it in person.&lt;ref name="Shaw65"/&gt;

[[File:Peloponnese Middle Ages map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the Morea in the Middle Ages]]
In early August, the Venetians retook [[Argos]] and refortified the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], restoring the [[Hexamilion wall]] and equipping it with many cannons.&lt;ref name="Setton248"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the [[Acrocorinth]], which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with Ömer Bey's forces, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October, which resulted in the wounding and subsequent death of the Marquis {{ill|Bertoldo d'Este|it|Bertoldo II d'Este}} (son of [[Taddeo d'Este]]). The Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion and to Nauplia ([[Nafplion]]).&lt;ref name="Setton248"/&gt; In Bosnia, Matthias Corvinus seized over sixty fortified places and succeeded in taking its capital, [[Jajce]] [[Siege of Jajce|after a 3-month siege]], on 16 December.&lt;ref name="Setton250"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottoman reaction was swift and decisive: Sultan [[Mehmed II]] dispatched his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović]], with an army against the Venetians. To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the [[Golden Horn]] (named after the "kadirga" type of [[galley]]), and of two forts to guard the Straits, [[Kilitbahir Castle|Kilidulbahr]] and [[Çanakkale|Sultaniye]].&lt;ref name="Crusades326"&gt;Setton, Hazard &amp; Norman (1969), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans: although messages received from Ömer Bey had warned of the strength and firepower of the Venetian position at the Hexamilion, Mahmud Pasha decided to march on, hoping to catch them at unawares.&lt;ref name="Setton248"/&gt; In the event, the Ottomans reached the Isthmus just in time to see the Venetian army, demoralized and riddled with [[dysentery]], leave its positions and sail to Nauplia.&lt;ref name="Setton249"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman army razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea. Argos fell, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance. [[Zagan Pasha]] was re-appointed governor of the Morea, while Ömer Bey was given Mahmud Pasha's army and tasked with taking the Republic's holdings in the southern Peloponnese, centered around the two forts of Coron and Modon ([[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]).&lt;ref name="Setton249"/&gt;

Sultan Mehmed II, who was following Mahmud Pasha with another army to reinforce him, had reached Zeitounion ([[Lamia (city)|Lamia]]) before being apprised of his Vizier's success. Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Crusades326"/&gt; However, the Sultan's attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus' approaching army. A new Ottoman army under Mahmud Pasha then forced Corvinus to withdraw, but Jajce was not retaken for many years after.&lt;ref name="Setton250"/&gt; However, the death of Pope Pius II on 15 August in Ancona spelled the end of the Crusade.&lt;ref name="Shaw65"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SigismondoMalatesta.jpg|thumb|The noted ''[[Condottieri|condottiere]]'' Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini. His tenure in command of the land forces in the Morea (July 1464 to January 1466) failed to reverse the Republic's fortunes.]]
In the meantime, for the upcoming campaign of 1464, the Republic had appointed [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Sigismondo Malatesta]], the ruler of [[Rimini]] and one of the ablest Italian generals, as land commander in the Morea.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; The forces available to him along with mercenaries and ''[[stratioti]]'', however, were limited, and in his tenure in the Morea he was unable to achieve much. Upon his arrival in the Morea in mid-summer, he launched attacks against Ottoman forts, and engaged in a siege of [[Mistra]] in August–October. He failed to take the castle, however, and had to abandon the siege at the approach of a relief force under Ömer Bey.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while Ömer Bey's army roamed the countryside. The mercenaries and stratioti in Venice's employ were becoming disgruntled at the lack of pay, while increasingly, the Morea was becoming desolate, as villages were abandoned and fields left untended.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 253–255&lt;/ref&gt; The bad supply situation in the Morea forced Ömer Bey to withdraw to Athens in fall 1465.&lt;ref name="Setton284"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Malatesta himself, disenchanted by the conditions he encountered in the Morea and increasingly anxious to return to Italy and attend to his [[House of Malatesta|family]]'s affairs and the ongoing feud with the Papacy, remained largely inactive throughout 1465, in spite of the relative weakness of the Ottoman garrisons following the withdrawal of Ömer Bey from the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Aegean, the new Venetian admiral, [[Orsato Giustinian]], tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital [[Mytilene]] for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced him to withdraw.&lt;ref name="Setton251"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed, and Giustinian died at Modon on 11 July. His successor, [[Jacopo Loredan]], spent the remainder of the year in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles.&lt;ref name="Setton251"/&gt; In early 1465, Mehmed II sent peace feelers to the Venetian Senate in 1465. Distrusting the Sultan's motives, these were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Venetians were embroiled in a conflict with the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of [[Rhodes]], who had attacked a Venetian convoy carrying Moorish merchants from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]].&lt;ref name="Setton277"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; This event enraged the Mamluks, who imprisoned all Venetian subjects living in the [[Levant]], and threatened to enter the war on the Ottoman side. The Venetian fleet, under Loredan, sailed to Rhodes under orders to release the Moors, even by force. In the event, a potentially catastrophic war between the two major Christian powers of the Aegean was avoided, and the merchants were released to Venetian custody.&lt;ref name="Setton277"/&gt;

By 1465 the [[Maniots|Maniot]] Kladas brothers, [[Krokodeilos Kladas|Krokodelos]] and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti on behalf of Venice against the Turks in Southern Peloponnese. They put [[Vardounia]] and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor.&lt;ref&gt;Longnon, J. 1949. ''Chronique de Morée'': Livre de la conqueste de la princée de l’Amorée, 1204-1305. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1466, [[Vettore Cappello]], the most vociferous proponent of the war, replaced Loredan as Captain General of the Sea. Under his leadership, the Venetian war effort was reinvigorated: the fleet took the northern Aegean islands of [[Imbros]], [[Thasos]] and [[Samothrace]], and then sailed into the [[Saronic Gulf]].&lt;ref name="Setton283"/&gt; On 12 July, Cappello landed at [[Piraeus]], and marched against [[Athens]], the Ottomans' major regional base. He failed to take the [[Acropolis]], however, and was forced to retreat to [[Patras]]. Patras, being the capital of Peloponnese and the seat of the Ottoman [[Bey]], was being besieged by the joint forces of Venetians and [[Greeks]] under the ''provveditore'' of the Morea, [[Jacomo Barbarigo]] and [[Sparta]]n commander Michael Rallis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spyridon Trikoupis]], ''Istoria tis Ellinikis Epanastaseos'' (London, 1853–1857) Vol 2, p84-85&lt;/ref&gt; Before Cappello could arrive there, and as the city seemed on the verge of falling, Ömer Bey suddenly appeared with 12,000 cavalry, and drove the outnumbered besiegers off. Six hundred Venetians and a hundred others were taken prisoner out of a force of 2,000, while Barbarigo himself was killed, and his body impaled, while a hundred Greeks fell and Rallis was captured and impaled.&lt;ref name="Setton284"/&gt; Cappello, who arrived some days later, attacked the Ottomans, but was heavily defeated. Demoralized, he returned to Negroponte with the remains of his army. There Cappello fell ill and died on 13 March 1467.&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Triarchy of Negroponte#Later history|Negroponte]] itself was taken by the Turks three years later.

== The war in Albania, 1466–1467 ==
In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians. Under their leader, [[Skenderbeg]], they had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy.&lt;ref name="Finkel63"/&gt; For the Albanians, the outbreak of the Ottoman–Venetian War offered a golden opportunity to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, they provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] and [[Shkodër|Scutari]]. Notable Montenegrin feudal lord [[Ivan Crnojević]] was of high significance for the defence of Scutari, for which he gained fame in Venice. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of [[Elbasan]], allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south.&lt;ref name="Finkel64"&gt;Finkel (2006), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated [[Ballaban Badera|Ballaban Pasha]] and lifted the [[Second Siege of Krujë|siege]] of the fortress of Croia ([[Krujë]]) attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it.&lt;ref name="Crusades327"&gt;Setton, Hazard &amp; Norman (1969), p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setton278"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated.&lt;ref name="Crusades327"/&gt; The Ottomans [[Third Siege of Krujë|failing again]] to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance.&lt;ref name="Setton283"&gt;Setton (1978), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus ([[Lezhë]]), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage.&lt;ref name="Finkel64"/&gt; The Albanians were left to their own devices, and were gradually subdued over the next decade.

== Final Albanian campaigns, 1474–1479 ==
After Skanderbeg died, some Venetian-controlled northern Albanian garrisons continued to hold territories coveted by the Ottomans, such as [[Žabljak Crnojevića]], [[Drisht]], [[Lezha]], and [[Shkodra]]—the most significant. Mehmed II sent his armies to take Shkodra in 1474&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts15/AH1474.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000842/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts15/AH1474.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed. Then he went personally to lead the [[siege of Shkodra]] of 1478-79. The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1479)|Treaty of Constantinople]] as a condition of ending the war.

After the Venetian War the Ottomans attacked [[Hungary]], but their army was defeated in the [[Battle of Breadfield]].

A '''pylon turn''' is a flight maneuver in which an aircraft banks into a circular turn, in such a way that an imaginary line projecting straight out the side of the aircraft (nominally the wing) points to a fixed point on the ground.  The maneuver originated early in the 20th century in [[air racing]].

In some contexts, simply making a turn around a fixed point on the ground (such as a physical pylon) is called a "pylon turn".  In these cases, the altitude may be incorrect for the maneuver to be a proper "pylon turn" where all three parameters (altitude, speed, bank angle) come together for the wing to point to the fixed turning center on the ground.

== Racing ==
The pylon turn was originally used in [[air racing]], where courses were set up with [[pylon (disambiguation)|pylon]]s to mark a location on the ground, and the planes would have to turn around at that point before returning to the airstrip. Pylons are also used in triples to set up a triangular circuit for aviation races—races in which all competitors must stay ''outside'' of the three pylons.

== Delivery ==
A pylon turn is part of a maneuver also known as '''long-line loiter'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US3724817 1973 patent for "Long line loiter technique"]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used to deliver messages or packages by plane without needing to land. In this maneuver it is possible to lower a bucket on a line to the ground in such a way that the bucket remains stationary on the ground, permitting transfer of material. It was used during [[Operation Auca]] and depicted in the film ''[[End of the Spear]]'', to give gifts to the [[Huaorani]] people of [[Ecuador]] where there was no landing strip. Later some mail services have used the same technique to deliver mail where there are no available landing strips.

==Geometry==
The mechanics of the maneuver allow it to occur only at the "[[pivotal altitude]]", which is a geometric and aerodynamic construction of [[ground speed]] and altitude above the ground.

== Combat use ==

The first notable combat use of the pylon turn was in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1964,&lt;ref name=Ballard&gt;{{cite web|title=Development and Employment of Fixed-Wing Gunships, 1962-1972|url=http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/gunships.pdf|publisher=Air Force Historical Studies Office|accessdate=7 February 2011|author=Jack S.

Later, the more advanced [[Lockheed AC-130]] was used in the same way.  Using this maneuver allowed gunners to fire continuously and efficiently at a stationary target for an extended period of time, without needing to make several passes.  Another huge advantage of pylon turns was that the gunfire was accurate enough to be used even in close proximity to friendly troops, which had never before been possible in air power. Also, a similar method is used by attack helicopters, on which the armament shoots forward. In this case the helicopter strafes sideways in a circle around a single target. This method improves shooting accuracy, increasing hit probability.

The '''Radio 1 Madonna controversy''' was a series of events that occurred as a result of [[BBC Radio 1]]'s decision not to playlist American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] single "[[Living for Love]]" in February 2015. Despite receiving moderate airplay from commercial radio in the United Kingdom, the single was not added to Radio 1's playlist, leading to accusations of [[ageism]]. The controversy stemmed from an article that appeared in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', which quoted an unnamed Radio 1 insider describing Madonna as "old" and "irrelevant".&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt; In response, the singer's fans posted numerous requests for the song on BBC's social media accounts, and several artists criticized Radio 1's music policy, prompting the station to release a statement defending their decision not to play the track.

The controversy received significant media coverage in the United Kingdom and internationally, sparking a wider discussion about ageism in the music industry. "Living for Love" was subsequently added to [[BBC Radio 2]]'s C-list, before being promoted to the B-list. The station caters to audiences who are aged 35 and higher. Commercially, the single peaked at number 26 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], for the week ending 28 February 2015.

==Background==
[[File:Scott Mills.jpg|thumb|left|Radio 1's [[Scott Mills]]: "I don't think we play Madonna anymore".&lt;ref name="scottmillsinterview"/&gt;|alt=Scott Mills sitting at a radio station desk.]]
Madonna has received considerable airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]] since the beginning of her career and made her first appearance on the station on 22 December 1986, when she was interviewed by [[Simon Bates]] during the promotion of the film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/50b9bc6fd7bf4211b6e8b341bed98e5c |title=Simon Bates Show |date=22 December 1986|publisher=[[BBC Music]]|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer gave subsequent interviews to [[Jakki Brambles]], Bates, [[Simon Mayo]], [[Sara Cox]], [[Jo Whiley]], and [[Chris Moyles]] in 1990, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2001, and 2006, respectively. The station also broadcast the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] in 1990 and [[The Girlie Show World Tour]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e09678d26fbb40948b34dae2e9f38744 |title=Madonna in Concert|date=21 July 1990 |publisher=BBC Music |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/703e766a2c3b475696f29f3120f0bfa1 |title=Madonna by Public Demand |date=27 December 1993|publisher=BBC Music |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 2008, Madonna headlined [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]] at [[Mote Park]], in [[Maidstone]] to promote the release of her album ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/2008/lineup/ |title=Radio 1's Big Weekend 2008 - Line-up |publisher=BBC Music |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first single from the album, "[[4 Minutes]]" (2008), was added to the station's A-list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/playlist/ |title=BBC Radio 1 - Playlist |publisher=BBC Music |accessdate=7 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718071949/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/playlist/ |archivedate=18 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Madonna released her twelfth studio album, ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]''. The lead single, "[[Give Me All Your Luvin']]", and subsequent releases from the album were not added to the Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]], two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ [[Scott Mills]] defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There is a lot of research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [She's] probably not at the top of their list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that."&lt;ref name="scottmillsinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/23/scott-mills-young-listeners-dont-care-about-madonna-anymore-583468/ |title=Scott Mills: Young listeners don't care about Madonna anymore|work=Metro|location=UK |date=23 September 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at a [[Radio Academy]] event in 2014, the station's Head of Music, George Ergatoudis, stated that its audience had "moved on" from Madonna, and that the majority of her fans were "over 30". He added that the [[BBC Trust]] had decided to make Radio 1 as a station appealing to a younger demographic, a factor which determines their daytime playlists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lizzie|last=Dearden |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/madonna-urges-music-industry-to-deal-with-ageism-taboo-after-radio-1-playlist-snub-10106742.html |title=Madonna urges music industry to deal with ageism 'taboo' after Radio 1 playlist snub|work=[[The Independent]] |date=13 March 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2014, Madonna's thirteenth studio album ''[[Rebel Heart (Madonna album)|Rebel Heart]]'' became available for pre-order. Unlike other countries, first single "[[Living for Love]]" was only made available for pre-order in the United Kingdom, and was not chart-eligible until 25 February 2015.&lt;ref name="rollstonetwentith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/madonna-responds-to-rebel-heart-leak-by-releasing-six-songs-20141220|title=Madonna Responds to 'Rebel Heart' Leak by Releasing Six Songs|date=20 December 2014|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2014, "Living for Love" started to receive airplay on commercial radio, most notably [[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]], where the song was eventually added to the station's playlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corner |first=Lewis |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a629471/madonna-fans-urge-bbc-radio-1-to-play-living-for-love.html |title=Madonna fans urge BBC Radio 1 to play 'Living for Love'|work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=17 February 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2015, [[Annie Mac]] played "Living for Love" on Radio 1 during her evening dance show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wmtns |title=Annie Mac's Friday Night, Benji B Special Delivery &amp; Tough Love Mini Mix |publisher=BBC Music |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', Mac said that her mission was to "represent the landscape of new music honestly", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. "I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, then I think it's going to be all right to play it", Mac concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam |last=Sherwin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/annie-mac-on-being-the-first-woman-to-take-over-from-zane-lowes-radio-1-weekday-evening-show-10094589.html |title=Annie Mac speaks on being the first woman to take over from Zane Lowe's Radio 1 weekday evening show |work=The Independent |date=8 March 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 14 February 2015 quoted an unnamed BBC Radio 1 insider who stated that "Living for Love" would not be played on the station because Madonna is "irrelevant" and "old".&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hastings |first=Chris |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2953948/Get-goove-Radio-1-bans-Madonna-56-irrelevant-old-teenage-listeners.html |title=Get out of the goove! Now Radio 1 bans Madonna, 56, for being 'irrelevant and old' for its teenage listeners|work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=14 February 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio 1 later denied the claims on their Facebook page, stating that the station "does not ban anyone". One of its representatives explained that tracks are chosen on "musical merit" and that an artist's age is never a factor when choosing songs for their playlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby |first=Sam |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a629426/bbc-radio-1-on-madonna-ban-reports-artists-age-is-never-a-factor.html |title=BBC Radio 1 on Madonna ban reports: 'Artist's age is never a factor' - Music News |work=Digital Spy |date=17 February 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Daily Mail'' article quickly went viral, and hundreds of messages were left on Radio 1's Facebook page from Madonna's fans urging the station to play "Living for Love". Support for the singer soon spread to the station's [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]] accounts, with fans posting links to the "Living for Love" video, her performance at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]], and posts claiming that the BBC was being discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31517956/is-madonna-really-banned-from-the-bbc-radio-1-playlist |title=Is Madonna really banned from the BBC Radio 1 playlist?|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 June 2015|last=Izundu|first=Chi Chi|date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna received support from artists such as [[Boy George]], [[La Roux|Elly Jackson]], Diplo and [[Rita Ora]]. [[Shirley Manson]] wrote on her Twitter account that Madonna should "contemplate suing Radio 1 for discrimination in the workplace", and that the station's music policy was "bordering on, if not actively, unlawful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowman |first=Patrick |url=http://www.idolator.com/7581515/madonna-bbc-radio-1-ban-shirley-manson-legal-intervention-ageism-la-roux-elly-jackson |title=Madonna’s BBC Radio 1 Ban: Shirley Manson Suggests Legal Intervention, La Roux’s Elly Jackson Cracks Jokes |publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] |accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media response to the controversy was generally in support of Madonna, with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s [[Dan Wootton]] criticising Radio 1's decision to not play the track. Describing the station's daytime playlist as the "Cray List" in his column, Wootton listed several artists who struggle to receive Radio 1 airplay, including [[Robbie Williams]], [[Take That]], and [[Meghan Trainor]].&lt;ref name="thesun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/bizarre/158196/radio-1-age-ban-made-me-hopping-mad/|title=Radio 1 'age ban' made me hopping Mad |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|last=Wootton|first=Dan|authorlink=Dan Wootton |accessdate=7 June 2015|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna posted a newspaper clipping that featured the story on her Twitter and Instagram accounts, and thanked her fans for their support. In an interview with Wootton in ''The Sun'', the singer called the omission "unfair" and "discriminatory", and felt  that [[ageism]] was a taboo that is still not being talked about.&lt;ref name="thesun"/&gt; She also recalled discussing the incident with her manager [[Guy Oseary]] and admitted that it was perplexing for her to learn that artists in their fifties do not get played on radio, without exceptions. "We've made so many advances in other areas&amp;nbsp;— civil rights, gay rights&amp;nbsp;— but ageism is still an area that's taboo and not talked about and dealt with," she concluded.&lt;ref name="thesun"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/12/madonna-age-playlist-bbc-radio-1|title=Madonna's age played no role in playlist snub, says BBC Radio 1 |work=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BBC rebuttal and aftermath==
The BBC was quick to refute allegations of ageism, and explained that songs were chosen on a case-by-case basis for inclusion on their weekly playlist. Their representative noted that [[Sir Paul McCartney]] had two songs on the playlist, although critics pointed out that both of these tracks were collaborations with younger artists (McCartney featured on "[[Only One (Kanye West song)|Only One]]", with [[Kanye West]], and "[[FourFiveSeconds]]", with [[Rihanna]]).&lt;ref name="tdt"/&gt; The station further listed [[David Guetta]], the [[Foo Fighters]], and [[Sia Furler|Sia]] as examples of older artists making their playlist. In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Radio 1's controller [[Ben Cooper (media executive)|Ben Cooper]] explained that the station has not "banned" Madonna, and that a group of twelve 16–24 aged personnel would meet on a regular basis to review the network's musical output, determining the relevant musical choice for their demographic.&lt;ref name="tdt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh |first=Anita |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/madonna/11490233/Radio-1-boss-Madonna-isnt-banned-she-just-needs-some-better-songs.html |title=Radio 1 boss: Madonna isn't banned, she just needs some better songs |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 March 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Mills defended the station's decision not to play the song. He stated, "[Radio 1 are] trying to get the average age of the listener down and, to be honest, most Madonna fans are in their 30s and 40s. I don't actually mind the new single, but do I think Radio 1 should play it? Probably not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/madonna/83753 |title=Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defends decision to keep Madonna off station's playlist |work=[[NME]] |date=21 March 2015 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Official Charts Company]], "Living for Love" moved towards the top-twenty of the [[UK Singles Chart]] with two days of available sales as reported in their mid-week chart report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/madonna-s-living-for-love-hurtling-towards-official-chart-top-20__8211/|title=Madonna's Living For Love hurtling towards Official Chart Top 20|last=Copsey|first=Robert|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately debuted at number 26 on the chart with sales of 17,936 copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ellie-goulding-spends-fourth-week-at-number-1-on-official-singles-chart__8227/|title=Ellie Goulding spends fourth week at Number 1 on Official Singles Chart|last=Myers|first=Justin|date=1 March 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015|publisher=Official Charts Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/analysis/read/sam-smith-tops-first-streaming-integrated-uk-albums-chart/061022|title=Sam Smith tops first streaming integrated UK Albums Chart|last=Jones|first=Alan|date=1 March 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=[[Music Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming Madonna's 71st top-forty single, extending her record as the female artist with the most top-forty UK singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6487504/madonna-scores-historic-71st-top-40-uk-single|title=Madonna Scores Historic 71st Top 40 U.K. Single|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=1 March 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">The '''Recession of 1949''' was a downturn in the United States lasting for 11 months.  According to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the recession began in November 1948 and lasted until October 1949.&lt;ref name = NBER&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-01|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=NBER Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=NBER }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1948 recession was a brief economic downturn; forecasters of the time expected much worse, perhaps influenced by [[Great Depression|the poor economy in their recent lifetime]].&lt;ref name=Zarnowitz&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Cycles: Theory, History, Indicators, and Forecasting|author=[[Victor Zarnowitz|Zarnowitz, Victor]]|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=1996 | isbn = 0-226-97891-5 | page = 416}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recession began shortly after [[Harry Truman|President Truman]]'s "[[Fair Deal]]" economic reforms.  The recession also followed a period of monetary tightening by the [[Federal Reserve]].&lt;ref name=Labonte&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-05|url=http://www.fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/7962.pdf|title=The Current Economic Recession|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=2002-01-10|author=Labonte, Marc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010043009/http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/7962.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the recession the GDP of US==
During this recession, the [[Gross Domestic Product]] of the United States fell 1.7 percent.  In October 1949, the unemployment rate reached its peak for the cycle of 7.9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/cps/ Labour Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey], [[Bureau of Labour Statistics]].  Retrieved on September 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main causes of the recession==
Many{{who|date=November 2018}} regard the aftermath of the end of World War II to be the main cause of the recession.
According to C. A. Blyth "the most important cause of 1948-1949 recession was substantial fall in the fixed investments". *[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1926046]

==The severity of this recession==
Maximum unemployment was about 7.9%.
Change in Gross National Product GNP reduced by up to -1.5%.
Department store sales fell 22%.
The wholesale price and cost of living indexes fell 12 and 5 points.

'''''Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night''''' is a 1988 [[Cinemax]] television special originally broadcast on January 3, 1988, starring triple [[Hall of Fame]] inductee ([[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]) rock/pop singer/songwriter [[Roy Orbison]] and backing band [[TCB Band]] with special guests including [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[k.d. lang]] and others. The special was filmed entirely in black and white. After the broadcast the concert was released on VHS and Laserdisc. A live album was released in 1989.

==Background==
The special consisted of a performance of many of Orbison's hits at the then [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]]'s Coconut Grove nightclub in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], filmed on September 30, 1987, approximately fourteen months before his death. Three songs, "[[Blue Bayou]]", "[[Claudette (song)|Claudette]]", and "Blue Angel", were filmed but not included in the original broadcast due to time constraints.

Other celebrity admirers of Orbison were in the audience, including [[David Lynch]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Sandra Bernhard]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. The backing band was the TCB Band, which accompanied [[Elvis Presley]] from 1969 until his death in 1977: [[Glen Hardin|Glen D. Hardin]] on piano, [[James Burton]] on lead guitar, [[Jerry Scheff]] on bass, and [[Ron Tutt|Ronnie Tutt]] on drums. Male background vocalists, some of whom also joined in on guitar, were [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[J.D. Souther]] and [[Steven Soles]]. The female background vocalists were [[k.d. lang]], [[Jennifer Warnes]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]]. During the end credits, several of the band members are shown talking about how Orbison influenced them.

Soon after the release on VHS and Laserdisc a bootleg CD titled 'A Black and White Night, Roy Orbison in Concert with the Billion Dollar Band' surfaced, being a rare collectors item nowadays. This CD, which came before any official CD-release of the concert, has the same 15 songs in the same order as the original VHS/Laserdisc release and has catologue number RO.LA.87, referring to the artist, place and year of the recording.

The audio from this special was released as an [[album]] by [[Virgin Records]] in 1989, titled ''[[A Black &amp; White Night Live]]''. After Orbison's death, his family provided the video to public television stations to air during their fund-raising campaigns.

==Releases==
The concert has been released in several home video formats, including [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]], [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. The soundtrack has been released on [[CD]], [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] that features both Stereo and Multi Channel Mixes, 12" vinyl LP, and [[DVD-Audio]].
The Laserdisc release follows the tracklist of the broadcast and VHS, while the DVD release contains the two previously unreleased songs "Blue Bayou" and "Claudette". The HD DVD, released in 2007, and the Blu-ray, released in September 2008, include those two songs as well as the previously-unreleased song "Blue Angel" as a bonus track.

The DVD features standard definition 480i video in a standard 4:3 aspect ratio and three [[Lossy compression|lossy]] soundtracks: Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1

The Blu-ray features high definition 1080i video in a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio and two [[Lossless compression|lossless]] soundtracks: [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] 5.1 and LPCM 2.0
*Also features the lossy soundtrack Dolby Digital 5.1 and, by extension, the lossy DTS core of the DTS-HD MA

The HD DVD features high definition 1080i video in a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio and at least one lossless soundtrack: [[Dolby TrueHD]] 5.1 Surround

February 24, 2017 saw the release of a re-edited 30th Anniversary Version of the Concert retitled "Roy Orbison Black &amp; White Night 30," that contains footage that is not available on the out-of-print Blu-Ray and HD DVD releases that Image Entertainment distributed in 2007/2008.  The sequencing has been corrected to represent the actual Live song order at the concert.  There is also new bonus footage with alternative versions of various songs that also can be viewed as part of the main concert.  The audio is English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and English LPCM 2.0.  Optional English SDH subtitles are not provided.

According to the official Roy Orbison discography by Marcel Riesco,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1005700738|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Roy Jr.|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Alex,, Slate, Jeff,, Riesco, Marcel|year=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition= First|location=New York|pages=248|oclc=1017566749}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''[[A Black &amp; White Night Live]]''''', the [[live album]], was compiled and released posthumously from the television special in October 1989, and included the song "Blue Bayou" which was cut from the original broadcast for time limitations. However it did not include the songs "Blue Angel" or "Claudette" which were also cut from the original broadcast for the same reason. The live album has been released several times in different formats, but the newly released ''"Black &amp; White 30"'' features all the tracks, plus bonus selections never before heard.

Dyson first entered Parliament in the {{NZ election link|1993}}, winning the {{NZ electorate link|Lyttelton}} electorate against [[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s [[David Carter (politician)|David Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Part 1: Votes recorded at each polling place |publisher=[[Chief Electoral Office (New Zealand)|Chief Electoral Office]] |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the {{NZ election link|1996}}, the Lyttelton electorate was abolished, and Dyson stood in {{NZ electorate link|Banks Peninsula}}, losing to Carter, who had in the meantime become an MP through winning the [[Selwyn by-election, 1994|1994 Selwyn by-election]]. She became a [[party-list proportional representation|list MP]] owing to her position on the Labour Party's list. In the {{NZ election link|1999}}, however, she defeated Carter to win Banks Peninsula. She has remained the MP for the area since that time; however before the 2008 election the boundaries were changed and it was renamed [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]].

When the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] won power in the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 general election]], Dyson was appointed to a number of minor ministerial roles, including Disability Issues and Associate Health and Associate Social Development. However, she resigned them on 31 October 2000 after being caught [[Driving under the influence|drink driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=157822 |title=$9.50 cab ride would have saved Dyson |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |first=Vernon |last=Small |date=1 November 2000 |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regained most of her ministerial responsibilities on 4 June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_politics_story_skin/42646 |title=Dyson gets all her portfolios back |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |date=5 June 2001 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a reshuffle on 31 October 2007, Dyson took on the portfolio of [[Minister for Social Development (New Zealand)|Social Development]], which she held until the Clark government lost power at the 2008 general election. Despite the swing against Labour at that election, Dyson won her new electorate of Port Hills with an increased margin than that of Banks Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-40.html Port Hills results 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decision08.co.nz/Electorates/ElectoratesDisplay/tabid/65/cat/104/Default.aspx Decision 08: Port Hills]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 Dyson's Resource Management (Requiring Authorities) Amendment Bill, which would amend the [[Resource Management Act 1991]] to reintroduce a public interest test for projects seeking requiring authority, was drawn from the member's ballot.&lt;ref name=rmabill&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/f/4/7/00DBHOH_BILL9739_1-Resource-Management-Requiring-Authorities-Amendment.htm |title=Resource Management (Requiring Authorities) Amendment Bill |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was defeated at its first reading.&lt;ref name=rmabill/&gt;

Dyson was re-elected as the MP for [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]] at the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]]. She is currently the Labour spokesperson for Conservation, Senior Citizens, and Internal Affairs and chairs the Parliamentary Select Committee on Government Administration .&lt;ref name="Ruth Dyson"/&gt; When [[Lianne Dalziel]] confirmed that she would contest the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|2013 Christchurch mayoralty]], her Christchurch Earthquake Recovery portfolio was split and assigned to Dyson and [[Clayton Cosgrove]] in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Two MPs to take over Dalziel's portfolio |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8907042/Two-MPs-to-take-over-Dalziels-portfolio |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson contested the {{NZ election link|2014}} against [[Nuk Korako]] of the National Party and chose not to be placed on Labour's party list.&lt;ref name="Dyson keeps PH"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mathewson |first1=Nicole |last2=Stylianou |first2=Georgina |last3=Fulton |first3=Tim |title=Labour's Dyson keeps Port Hills |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/10524885/Labours-Dyson-ahead-in-Port-Hills |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140923064032/http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/10524885/Labours-Dyson-ahead-in-Port-Hills |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=23 September 2014 |work=[[The Press]] |date=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on preliminary counts, Dyson has a majority of 1,865 votes over Korako.&lt;ref name="Dyson keeps PH" /&gt;

Following the formation of the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Sixth Labour Government]] in 2017, Dyson was elected Labour's [[Senior Whip of the Labour Party|Senior Whip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bracewell-Worrall |first=Anna |title=Ruth Dyson selected as Government whip |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/10/ruth-dyson-selected-as-government-whip.html |accessdate=30 October 2017 |newspaper=NewsHub |date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45196">[[File:Anita Sarkeesian 2013.jpg|thumb|Media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]] drew attention to sexism in video gaming with her video series ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'']]

'''Sexism in video gaming''' is prejudiced behavior or [[discrimination]] based on [[sex]] or [[gender]] as experienced by people who play and create [[video game]]s, primarily women. This may manifest as [[sexual harassment]] or in the way [[Gender representation in video games|genders are represented in games]], such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.

The demographics of [[video game culture]] have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2014 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|date=April 2014|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]|page=3|url=http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ESA_EF_2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change, as well as publicized incidents of harassment such as the [[Gamergate controversy]] in 2014, have contributed to industry professionals and media increasingly paying attention to issues related to sexism in video gaming.

==Harassment==

=== Form ===
Harassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests.&lt;ref name= BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=James|title=Sexual harassment in the world of video gaming|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, female players are also [[stalking|stalked]], whether online or offline.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Women are sometimes marginalized as "intruders", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as [[the Sims]], [[music video game]]s or [[casual games]]. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing "girl games" or disliking violent games.&lt;ref name="pricec"&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Matthew|title=Sexism in Video Games: There Is Sexism in Gaming|url=http://blog.pricecharting.com/2012/09/emilyami-sexism-in-video-games-study.html|publisher=Price Charting|date=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or [[video game developer|game developers]], even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game.&lt;ref name="szfrauen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/frauenrollen-in-computerspielen-sexspielzeug-1.1554509|title=Frauenrollen in Computerspielen – Sexspielzeug – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/sexismus-in-videospielen-wo-feminismus-als-terrorismus-gilt-1.1389210|title=Sexismus in Videospielen – Wo Feminismus als "Terrorismus" gilt – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inrocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/2013/03/19/actualite/le-milieu-geek-bien-trop-sexiste-11375418/|title=Les Inrocks – Le milieu geek, bien trop sexiste ?|work=Les Inrocks|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of the [[NES]], video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men.&lt;ref name="no girls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/medias/jeux-video-et-machisme-c-est-loin-d-etre-fini-554125|title=Playstation 4 (PS4) et Xbox One: la surenchère sexiste – L'Humanité|work=L'Humanité|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads.&lt;ref name="no girls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|title=No girls allowed – Polygon|work=Polygon|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name="guard twit"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1reasonwhy: the hashtag that exposed games industry sexism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter|author=Mary Hamilton|date=November 28, 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry|date=November 27, 2012|publisher=[[Time Magazine|Time]] Newsfeed|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that females claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Kate|last2=Weststar|first2=Johanna|last3=Meloni|first3=Wanda|last4=Pearce|first4=Celia|last5=Legault|first5=Marie-Josée|title=Developer Satisfaction Survey 2014 Summer Report|url=http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|website=gameqol.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211032252/http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|archivedate=December 11, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women remain outsiders in video game industry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burrows|first1=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to "meetings" that were actually romantic dates.

Sexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Digitized Lives, T.V. Reed&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as '[[Promotional model|booth babes]]', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/forum/thread/242422 |title=Booth Babes and the Expo |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverstein |first=Jonathan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1558683 |title=Sexy 'Booth Babes' Under Siege – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny Arcade"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX Code of Conduct|url=http://east.paxsite.com/safety-and-security|website=Penny Arcade|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime |first=Arielle |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5294440/why-cant-ces-quit-booth-babes |title=Why can't CES quit booth babes? |publisher=The Verge |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelion |first=Leo |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21373094 |title=BBC News – CES 'booth babe' guidelines revised but ban rejected |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency ===
Insults are frequent in [[Online game|online gaming]]. However, according to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service [[Xbox Live]]), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Leary|first=Amy|title=In Virtual Play, Sex Harassment Is All Too Real|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/sexual-harassment-in-online-gaming-stirs-anger.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from [[Riot Games]] lists racism and homophobia at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using science to reform toxic player behavior in League of Legends|author=Dennis Scimeca|date=May 16, 2013|work=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/using-science-to-reform-toxic-player-behavior-in-league-of-legends/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/13/homophobia-and-harassment-in-the-online-gaming-age|author=Nathan Meunier|date=January 13, 2010|title=Homophobia and harassment in the online gaming age|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing [[Halo 3]] online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/culture/74637/jeux-video-etude-sexisme-joueurs|title=Jeux vidéo: une étude confirme le sexisme des joueurs – Slate.fr|work=Slate.fr|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/halo-3-gamers-are-often-sexist-too-61564|title=Study: Female Gamers Receive Verbal Abuse From Male Gamers – Pacific Standard: The Science of Society|work=Pacific Standard|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewey|first1=Caitlin|title=Men who harass women online are quite literally losers, new study finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/20/men-who-harass-women-online-are-quite-literally-losers-new-study-finds/|work=Washington Post|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males "attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|last3=Ponti|first3=Giovanni|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|date=15 July 2015|volume=10|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pages=e0131613|pmid=26176699|pmc=4503401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words "gay" or "queer" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as "somewhat hostile" while 14% perceived it as "very hostile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Gay-rights-group-plans-talk-on-silencing-slurs-by-3224946.php|title=Gay rights group plans talk on silencing slurs by online gamers|date=July 16, 2009|author=Kim, Ryan|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should "return to the kitchen", along with other slurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waterlow|first1=Lucy|title='Rape and death threats are common': Women gamers reveal the vile online abuse they receive EVERY DAY from men who say they should 'get back in the kitchen'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3454588/Women-gamers-reveal-vile-online-abuse-receive-DAY-men-say-kitchen.html|publisher=DailyMail|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribution of computer and video gamers in the United States from 2006 to 2017, by gender|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/232383/gender-split-of-us-computer-and-video-gamers/|website=Statista|publisher=Electronic Software Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsanz.org.nz/journal/docs/WSJNZ291Todd64-67.pdf|last1=Todd|first1=Cherie|website=WSJNA291Todd|publisher=WSANZ|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Halloran|first1=Kate|title=‘Hey dude, do this’: the last resort for female gamers escaping online abuse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/24/hey-dude-do-this-the-last-resort-for-female-gamers-escaping-online-abuse|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Events in 2007 to 2017 brought sexual harassment in video gaming to mainstream media's attention in the United-States,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; United Kingdom and Germany:&lt;ref name="szfrauen"/&gt;

She was hesitant to jump into multiplayer and practiced by herself before going online.

== Effects ==

A study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due the [[Proteus effect]], manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a [[virtual reality]] game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher [[rape myth]] acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that [[blame the victim]], and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experiences of self-objectification via avatars.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|volume=29|pages=930–938|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f2e07096-3845-4e7d-9513-0e443ffe3778@sdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=S074756321200369X&amp;db=edselp|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experie...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In another study, 181 students from a private [[liberal arts]] college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to [[control group]]), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref name="DillBrown2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|last2=Brown|first2=Brian P.|last3=Collins|first3=Michael A.|title=Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=5|year=2008|pages=1402–1408|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bègue|first=Laurent|last2=Sarda|first2=Elisa|last3=Gentile|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Bry|first4=Clementine|last5=Roché|first5=Sebastian|date=2017-03-31|title=Video Games Exposure and Sexism in a Representative Sample of Adolescents|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5374198/|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00466|issn=1664-1078|pmc=5374198|pmid=28408891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely.  Theories such as the [[cultivation theory]], [[social cognitive theory]], ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breuer|first=Johannes|last2=Kowert|first2=Rachel|last3=Festl|first3=Ruth|last4=Quandt|first4=Thorsten|date=April 2015|title=Sexist Games=Sexist Gamers?

They write that "Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles:  Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions.|journal=Sex Roles|date=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player.  On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as "hi everybody" or "alright team let's do this" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznekoff|first1=Jeffrey H.|title=Communication in multiplayer gaming: Examining player responses to gender cues|journal=New Media &amp; Society|date=2012|volume=15|issue=|pages=541–556|doi=10.1177/1461444812458271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres.

A study was conducted on 154 Italian male high school volunteers. They were tasked with playing one of three different types of games. The first was ''Grand Theft Auto''. Females in this game are secondary, usually strippers and prostitutes that are used as sexual objects by players. The second was ''Half Life 1'' and ''Half Life 2''. Although this game is violent, the female character plays a lead role and is not depicted in a sexist or sexual manner. Lastly, there was ''Dream Pinball 3D'' and ''Q.U.B.E. 2'', which contain no violence or sexuality. Afterward, the volunteers were shown one of two pictures that showed females as victims of violence. Participants then rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded or indifferent on a scale of 1, ''not at all'' to 7, ''very much''. The study concluded that those that identified strongly with the male characters in the sexist-violent video game, ''Grand Theft Auto'', showed the least amount of empathy towards the female violence victims. "The portrayal of men in the media as socially powerful and physically violent reinforces assumptions about how men and boys should act in society, as well as how they should treat women and girls.

Female activists actively promote changes in the way women are portrayed in games and how they are treated by the industry and gaming public as a whole. Media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], for example, has – through her organization [[Feminist Frequency]] – given lectures and training to help change gaming culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/how-anita-sarkeesian-wants-video-games-to-change-1688231729|title=How Anita Sarkeesian Wants Video Games To Change|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of [[The Independent Game Developers' Association|TIGA]], "typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low. There is only a comparatively small pool of potential female employees available to work in the games industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/15/video-game-industry-diversity-problem-women-non-white-people|title=The video game industry has a diversity problem – but it can be fixed|last=Ramanan|first=Chella|date=2017-03-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives on the part of gaming companies include codes of conduct and the adoption of trainings and standards to ensure safe and respectful workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2013/01/18/women-and-video-gamings-dirty-little-secrets/#4ec6cbe42e8c|title=Women And Video Gaming's Dirty Little Secrets|last=Files|first=The ForbesWoman|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to combat sexism, the French government in 2016 proposed pieces of legislation that would give bonuses or incentives to video game creators that promote a more positive image of female characters in their games.  Furthermore, these proposals outline a rating system that distinguishes games that promote a positive female representation and those that do not, with the latter getting the highest age 18 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/16569-france-is-reviewing-ways-to-combat-sexism-in-video-games|title=France is Reviewing Ways to Combat Sexism in Video Games|last=Kim|first=Matt|date=June 5, 2016|website=Inverse.com|publisher=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/4/11857930/france-sexism-video-games-label-women|title=France Considers Cracking Down on Sexism in Video Games|last=Toor|first=Amar|date=June 4, 2016|website=Theverge.com|publisher=|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simcoe County Pride Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|right| [[Simcoe County]] unveils the pride flag for the first time during the 2014 Simcoe Pride, joining a large number of other lower-tier municipalities in the County.]]
[[File:1297451494295 ORIGINAL.jpg|thumb| [[Oro-Medonte]] Township was one of several Simcoe County communities that raised a flag for pride week 2013.]]

'''Fierté Simcoe Pride''' is an annual festival held in [[Simcoe County]], [[Ontario]], during the end of July and beginning of August each year. It is a celebration of the diversity of the [[LGBT]] community in Simcoe County. It is one of the larger regional [[gay pride]] festivals in [[Canada]], featuring flag raisings and proclamations from across the County, educational events, artistic and cultural events, and a large signature closing event. Since forming, the organisation has expanded gradually, involving more year round events. In 2016, the organisation celebrated its fifth anniversary Pride.

==Leadership and organization==
Pride Week and year-round events are run by Fierté Simcoe Pride, a not-for-profit, volunteer-run organisation. The mission of Fierté Simcoe Pride is to "create and offer inclusive events, services, and educational opportunities that rise above heterosexism, hetero-normativity and homo/bi/transphobia, promoting safe communities within Simcoe County." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoepride.com/about.html "Simcoe Pride - About Us"] ''Fierté Simcoe Pride'' .&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation also uses a list of objectives and values as guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoepride.com/about.html "About"] ''Fierté Simcoe Pride''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fierté Simcoe Pride is managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, who handle the finances, logistics and operations of the organisation and events. They also oversee the long-term vision, objectives and values. In addition, volunteers are involved in running the events.

The events are funded through donations, sponsorships, in-kind support, and fundraisers.

==LGBT history in Simcoe County==
[[File:Madame Outrageous at The Den.jpg|thumb|Drag queen "Madame Outrageous", founder and president of the Craig Russell Fan Club, at Dusty's Den in the early 2000s]]
Organizing for the LGBT community in Simcoe County has been traced back to the mid 1980s/early 1990s with faith-based communities, various community-based committees, social groups and school-based supports.

These community based supports either relied on fundraising from a small pool of supporters, were offered for a fee or were sponsored through an organization. With a lack of sustainability, many of these supports no longer exist or have evolved into different resources like those offered by Rainbow Health Ontario and programming provided by the AIDS Committee of Simcoe County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://d17.osstf.ca/Default.aspx?DN=dacc348d-9870-49de-95b6-50966823ae51 "LGBT Youth Needs Assessment: Making It Better Today"] ''Rainbow Health Ontario'', January, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early celebrations and community ===
In 1984, the Gays and Lesbians Alliance of Simcoe County (GLAS) formed and ran until 2001. They held a cruise on the Serendipity Princess from 1996 to 2000, subsequently the boat cruise was run by: The Spot (bar) in 2001 and 2002, Club C'est La Vie from 2003 to 2005, Dusty's Den in 2006 and 2007, and Club Chill Events in 2008.

The Simcoe County Metropolitan Community Church (SCMCC), led by Reverend Carol Galbraith founded in the early '90s, around 1993, and advocated for the [[LGBT]] community as well as the legalization of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library2.usask.ca/srsd/perceptions/1606.html "Metropolitan Community Churches"] ''Perceptions: The Gay &amp; Lesbian Newsmagazine of the Prairies ''.&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided support to the community and each year held a banquet and awards ceremony to honour people and organizations who supported and advocated for the lesbian, gay, bisexual an transgender community the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/advocacy/simcoe_mcc.htm "Simcoe County Metropolitan Community Church: 2001 Heroes"] ''Equal Marriage'', September 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The congregation met at Grove Street United Church and existed until the mid to late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskokaregion.com/news-story/3605578-gay-congregation-opens-the-doors-as-church-grows/ "Gay congregation opens the doors as church grows"] ''Huntsville Forester'', December 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== H.O.P.E. Theatre Troupe and youth ===
The Holding On through Peer Education (H.O.P.E.) Theatre Troupe (through the ACSC, now the Gilbert Centre) was a program that had some success with securing funding in the late 1990s, however it was limited. Although not an LGBT specific program, LGBT youth found it to be a safe space. In the early 2000s the program was no longer sustainable due to lack of funding.  The LGBT Youth Drop-In, a sponsored program of the AIDS Committee of Simcoe County had success in the early 2000s although the program depended on community fundraisers and in-kind donations. Eventually this program could no longer sustain itself.

In 2011 two Ryerson University students identified a need to support LGBT youth in Simcoe County. They started the LGBT Youth Connection with their own resources and support of other organizations. The program is still running, and has expanded from Barrie into other parts of the county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acsc.ca/youth "Youth Programming"] ''ACSC''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening Closets ===
In 2003, Huronia Transition Homes formed the Diversity Committee and ran the Opening Closets conference, which took place every other year. They eventually renamed themselves the Opening Closets Conference Committee. The conference was an opportunity to inform and train a variety of workers on sexual diversity and LGBT issues. In 2009 the Opening Closets conference had a particular focus on LGBT youth. This committee has been, to the best of knowledge, non-active since 2010.

=== Formalizing Pride and community work ===
In May 2002, [[PFLAG]] Barrie formed, running meetings to support for families, allies and people who are LGBT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pflag_barrie.tripod.com/pflagbarrie/id3.html "PFLAG Barrie - Our Meetings].&lt;/ref&gt; The group struggled for several year, and had different people run it, until October 2008 when a dedicated family took it over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2010/08/21/coming-out-as-a-family "Coming out as a family"] ''Barrie Examiner'' Saturday, August 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; To the best of knowledge, the group has been inactive since 2011.

From 2003 to 2005 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskokaregion.com/news-story/3606302-gays-disappointed-flag-not-flying/ "Gays disappointed flag not flying"]  ''Huntsville Forester'' August 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.muskokaregion.com/news-story/3604370-county-homosexual-community-to-celebrate-gay-pride-week/ "County homosexual community to celebrate Gay Pride Week"]  ''Huntsville Forester'' August 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskokaregion.com/news-story/3602483-gay-community-celebrates-pride-week/ "Gay community celebrates Pride Week"]  ''Huntsville Forester'' August 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  a Pride week was run by the Simcoe County Pride Committee with the main events taking place in [[Barrie, Ontario]], as well as support from [[Midland, Ontario]], [[Penetanguishene]], [[Bradford West Gwillimbury]] and [[Orillia]].

In 2008, LGBTA Barrie formed (formalizing in 2009), holding fundraisers and bar events at Memories. They also did a flag raising in 2008 to honour [[International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia]] (IDAHOT) and ran a pride week in August 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2009/05/15/community-speaks-out-about-homophobia "Community speaks out about homophobia"]  ''Barrie Examiner'', Friday, May 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Simcoe Pride formed, the Board decided to hold Simcoe Pride Week in or around the month of August (as opposed to during June, the popular month to hold Pride events) to honour the past pride events that existed in the County.

=== School-based support ===
The Georgian LGBTQA Association of Georgian College formed in 2009, holding a flag raising at the Barrie Campus. It has since rebranded twice, now operating under the name of Georgian Pride. In March of that year they held a World Café in partnership with Rainbow Health Ontario (RHO). After this conference, several organizations and events formed, such as Muskoka Pride (first as a picnic, then a committee in 2010),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskokapride.com/past-muskoka-pride-picnics.html "Past Muskoka Pride Picnic &amp; Events] ''Muskoka Pride''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Simcoe County LGBTQ Network, and the Safety and Equity Conference.

In 2010 the [[Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation]] District 17 Human Rights Committee organized their first conference for students who participated in their Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs).  The conferences was organized in 2010 and 2011 to support students through educational and leadership development.

=== 2009 to present day ===

A pride week and flag raising were held in Barrie in 2010 from August 23 to 27 by LGBTA Barrie, with events and a boat cruise organized by Club C'est La Vie and community members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2010/08/21/coming-out-as-a-family "Coming out as a family"] ''Barrie Examiner'' Saturday, August 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Barrie Pride formed, holding a successful first pride week and first pride parade in the second week of June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2014/03/05/barries-first-pride-parade-is-scheduled-for-june-14 "Barrie's first Pride Parade is scheduled for June 14"] ''Barrie Examiner'', Thursday, March 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Barrie Pride was again held in June 2015, 2016, and 2017.

Simcoe Pride was founded on May 13, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/simcoepride/info?tab=page_info "About Simcoe Pride"] ''Simcoe Pride (Facebook Page)''.&lt;/ref&gt; with a small committee of volunteers. Much like past pride groups, the committee started off will small fundraisers, such as dances, drag shows and brunches. However, the founders made it clear that it would be a "lasting force" in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2012/08/02/simcoe-pride-aims-to-boost-countys-gay-community "Simcoe Pride aims to boost county's gay community"] ''Barrie Examiner'', Thursday, August 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inaugural Pride Week ===
The inaugural Simcoe Pride Week run by Simcoe Pride, which was planned in under three months, was held in 2012 from August 3 to 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoepride.com/past-pride-weeks.html "Past Pride Weeks"]  ''Simcoe Pride''&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of one event, the dusk till dawn movie night in [[Oro-Medonte]], this pride week was all hosted in Barrie. No boat cruise was held that year, due to limited resources. However, they did have a flag raising, spiritual service/blessing, candlelight vigil and march, a community art show and silent auction, and ended the week with a family fun fair and pride prom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2012/08/07/several-activities-planned-for-simcoe-pride-week "Several activities planned for Simcoe Pride Week"] ''Barrie Examiner'', Tuesday, August 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Growth of support ===
Following the inaugural festival, Simcoe Pride began planning for pride week 2013, which took place from August 2 to 10. Simcoe Pride Week 2013 was larger than the year before, with eight days of events spread over nine days. In addition to hosting the first annual boat cruise, that did not happen the year before, the pride week (and its flag raisings) expanded from Barrie to other communities in the county, including [[Ramara]], Oro-Medonte, [[New Tecumseth, Ontario|New Tecumseth]] , Orillia, [[Innisfil]], Bradford West Gwillimbury, Midland and Penetanguishene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orilliapacket.com/2013/07/26/pride-in-simcoe "Pride in Simcoe"] ''Orillia Packet &amp; Times'', Friday, July 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other events included Saturday a family fun fair, dusk till dawn movie night, candle light vigil, 'Make It Safe' march, community art show and silent Auction, and all-ages semi-formal and close-off party.

The march, named 'Make It Safe', was held in response of an act of violence against a community member who was targeted and assaulted. Though violence and discrimination toward LGBT people is not unheard of, any victims are afraid to speak out. Although the march was planned earlier, organizers changed the name to reflect the violent attack as well as to raise awareness about other issues LGBT individuals face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoe.com/news-story/3922359-victim-using-barrie-pride-march-to-heal/ "Victim using march to heal"] ''Barrie Advance'', August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2013/08/07/simcoe-pride-hosts-candlelight-vigil-and-march-in-barrie "Simcoe Pride hosts candlelight vigil and march in Barrie"] ''Barrie Examiner'', Wednesday, August 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Simcoe Pride Week was held from July 31 to August 9, 2014. This pride week was a considerably large festival in comparison to the past prides, this is because the week had support from the county and the largest amount of municipalities yet, with flag raisings at the County of Simcoe, and in Barrie, Orillia, Bradford West Gwillimbury, Ramara, Innisfil, Wasaga Beach, [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]], New Tecumseth, Midland, Penetanguishene, [[Clearview, Ontario|Clearview]], and Oro Medonte. With the exception of Clearview, all also proclaimed pride along with [[Severn, Ontario|Severn]] and [[Adjala–Tosorontio]]. [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]], which has a policy against flag raisings and proclamations, did promote the festival on their website as a way to provide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theenterprisebulletin.com/2015/01/27/clearview-residents-express-disappointment-in-council-saying-pride-flag-should-be-flown "Clearview residents express disappointment in council, saying Pride flag should be flown"] ''Collingwood Enterprise Bulletin'', Tuesday, January 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Essa, Ontario|Essa]], [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]], Tay, and [[Tiny, Ontario|Tiny]] did not participate; [[Beausoleil First Nation]] did not reply and [[CFB Borden|Canadian Forces Base Borden]] was not sent a request.

As well as the growth in municipal support, the festival had more events across the county garnering over a thousand in attendance during the week and 2,500 attendees at year round events according to festival organizers.

=== 2015 Pride and advocacy work ===
Fierté Simcoe Pride 2015 was held from July 30 to August 8. With the continued growth of support from community members, municipalities and media, there was an increased efforts to get the rest of the County to participate in Fierté Simcoe Pride.

In January 2015, the decision to fly the pride flag in Clearview was stalled at a Council meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecreemoreecho.com/2015/01/decision-to-fly-pride-flag-in-clearview-stalls-at-council-table/ "Decision to fly pride flag in Clearview stalls at council table"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Creemore Echo'', Friday, January 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Township had a policy against issuing proclamations in support of organizations, and usually didn't raise flags either but in 2014, an exception was made and council agreed to fly the pride flag at the municipal office for the first time. Councillor Robert Walker me the request opposition saying that in his Christian belief he would not be supporting it.
At a Council meeting later in January, residents spoke in support of raising the flag and urged Council to review its policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoe.com/news-story/5277970-clearview-should-fly-pride-flag-say-residents/ "Clearview should fly Pride flag, say residents"] ''The Wasaga Sun'', Tuesday, January 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After pressure from local residents and the attention of local, nation and international Pride organizations - including York Region Pride, [[Fierté Canada Pride]] and [[InterPride]] - Clearview Council reviewed its policy at the April 13 meeting and ruled in favour of issuing proclamations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoe.com/news-story/5558421-clearview-council-changes-rules-on-proclamations/ "Clearview council changes rules on proclamations"] ''The Wasaga Sun'', Wednesday, April 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecreemoreecho.com/2015/04/clearview-council-to-consider-proclamations/ "Clearview council to consider proclamations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710195622/http://www.thecreemoreecho.com/2015/04/clearview-council-to-consider-proclamations/ |date=2015-07-10 }} ''The Creemore Echo'', Friday, April 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theenterprisebulletin.com/2015/04/15/discussion-of-future-of-creemores-collingwood-street-bridge-pits-romantics-against-realists "Discussion of future of Creemore’s Collingwood Street bridge pits romantics against realists "] ''The Collingwood Enterprise Bulletin'', Thursday, April 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearview has currently not approved to raise the flag due to the availability of flagpoles and flag etiquette, however Simcoe Pride is working with the township to find an appropriate place to raise the flag.

In January 2015, Tiny Township decided 4-1 to proclaim Simcoe Pride Week 2015. They also requested a flag raising. The motion revised a resolution passed in March 2007, to the effect that the Franco-Ontario flag would be raised each year during Francophone Week, but that requests for other declarations and flag raisings would not be accepted. This Council decided to consider such requests case by case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tinycottager.org/site/?p=1346 "Report on Council: January 26, 2015"] ''The Tiny Cottager'', Monday, January 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 there was 16 proclamations, 14 flag raisings, and one banner unveiling at Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoepride.com/past-pride-weeks.html "Past Pride Weeks"] ''Fierté Simcoe Pride''&lt;/ref&gt; Tay, Springwater and Essa, did not participate; Canadian Forces Base Borden was sent a request but was unable to participate, and Collingwood maintained a no flag raising and no proclamation policy but supports pride in other ways.

As of 2015, an annual theme is selected for each Pride Week that reflects the current context of the queer community in the region and helps shape the festivities, the inaugural theme being "Freedom To Be."

=== Fifth anniversary and onward ===

Fierté Simcoe Pride 2016 was held from July 27 to August 6, 2016, under the theme "Celebrate." This also marked the fifth anniversary of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoe.com/community-story/6788662-pride-flags-raised-across-north-simcoe/ "Pride flags raised across north Simcoe"] ''Midland Mirror''&lt;/ref&gt; The festival saw a record amount of support from communities, with 20 of the 22 communities within Simcoe County proclaiming Pride or holding a flag raising.

"'''SpongeBob, You're Fired'''" is a [[television special]]{{sfn|Grossman|Sean|2013|loc=0:11–0:18}} of the American animated television series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. It serves as the 11th episode of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 9)|ninth season]] and the 189th overall episode. The animation directors were the supervising director, [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]], and was written by [[Marc Ceccarelli]], [[Luke Brookshier]], and [[Mr. Lawrence]]. Ceccarelli and Brookshier also served as [[storyboard]] directors. The episode originally aired in Greece on July 3, 2013. In the United States, it aired on [[Nickelodeon]] on November 11. In this episode of the series, which follows the adventures and endeavors of [[spongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob gets fired from the [[Krusty Krab]] after [[Mr. Krabs]] discovers he can save a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] by eliminating him. SpongeBob subsequently decides to apply at other restaurants.

"SpongeBob, You're Fired" was first screened at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. Prior to broadcast on television, the episode created a level of controversy for its depiction of unemployment. It eventually sparked a political debate when [[Media Matters for America]] and [[Al Sharpton]] of [[MSNBC]] accused both the ''[[New York Post]]'' and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] of using the episode "to slam poor people who use social services".&lt;ref name=Newscorp/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharpton1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharpton2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJ/&gt; The premiere of "SpongeBob, You're Fired" drew 5.2 million viewers, the biggest audience viewership for a ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' episode in two years since "Frozen Face-Off" in July 2011.

==Plot summary==
[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] is going about his usual day at work at the [[Krusty Krab]]. All of a sudden, his employer, [[Eugene Harold Krabs|Mr. Krabs]], [[Dismissal (employment)|fires]] him from his job as a fry cook. According to Mr. Krabs, he can save a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] if he cuts SpongeBob's salary completely. SpongeBob offers to [[Volunteering |work for free]], which Mr. Krabs says he considered but learned it would be illegal and that he could lose his vending license. [[Squidward Tentacles]], SpongeBob's apathetic co-worker, asks if he can be fired as well, but Mr. Krabs refuses because Squidward has more [[seniority]]. SpongeBob cries in [[Depression (mood)|depression]] all the way home. Squidward, although gleeful over SpongeBob not working at the Krusty Krab anymore, asks Mr. Krabs who will be the new fry cook. His boss informs him that, to save money, he will take over the kitchen, much to Squidward's dismay.

At home, SpongeBob, still distraught, explains the situation to his best friend and neighbor [[Patrick Star|Patrick]]. Patrick, however, tells him that being unemployed is "the best gig I know" and promises to return in the morning to introduce SpongeBob to "the unemployed lifestyle." The next morning, the two friends meet up and start SpongeBob's first day of "glorious unemployment," or as Patrick likes to call it, "Fun Employment." Patrick shows SpongeBob the following activities: 1.) Going to Squidward's garden and getting him to throw vegetables at them after ruining some of his flowers, 2.) Taking a "[[siesta]]" and 3.) Having a free lunch with friends at [[Sandy Cheeks]]' tree dome. Sandy, who is carrying out an experiment in [[nutrition]], is surprised to see SpongeBob there and tells SpongeBob that he should find a new job after she learns he was fired. Deciding that Sandy is right, SpongeBob thanks Patrick for trying to help him but points out that, while unemployment might be fun for him, SpongeBob needs a job. Patrick is fine with this and tells his best friend that he should do what he feels is right.

Over the next few days, SpongeBob tries getting a job at a [[hot dog]] joint, a [[Pizza|pizzeria]], a [[Taco stand|taqueria]], and finally an [[Noodle|Asian noodle house]]. He is fired each time for making a type of patty ("weenie patties," a "pizza patty," a "[[burrito]] patty" and a "noodle patty" respectively) instead of what each respective restaurant itself specializes in. After being dismissed from the noodle house, SpongeBob goes home and prepares some homemade [[pet food]] for Gary, noticing that they're out of store bought food. Gary loves the food, but the gluttonous Patrick shares it. Eventually, the doorbell rings, and SpongeBob answers, but he is [[kidnap|stashed into a body bag]] shaped like a hot dog bun and taken back to the hot dog joint, where he is forced to work because, surprisingly, the customers loved the weenie patties that SpongeBob created. Soon, all four of the restaurant managers who fired SpongeBob before are fighting over him because their customers loved the patty creations he made.

A mysterious person in a Krabby Patty costume arrives, defeats all four of the restaurant managers, saves SpongeBob, and takes him back to the Krusty Krab, which has faltered ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume and explains that, as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again. Mr. Krabs admits that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs installs a [[pay toilet]] that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.

The episode was criticized for dialogue referencing the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (Food Stamps benefit). In a scene from the episode, [[Patrick Star]] tries to show SpongeBob "the benefits of being unemployed", to which SpongeBob replies, "Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job." The scene was meant to demonstrate the title character's "eternal optimism and willingness to get back to work...in a way that's still funny and relatable".&lt;ref name=Inqui/&gt; However, some political activists claimed the "notorious line" was a "slam" to the Food Stamps benefit.&lt;ref name=Inqui&gt;{{cite web|title=SpongeBob SquarePants Fired, Sparks Political Debate [Video]|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1019991/spongebob-squarepants-fired-political-debate-food-stamps/|work=The Inquisitr|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; A report by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' alleged that the episode may have had a [[political agenda]] about the [[social safety net]]. It added that "It's not the first time SpongeBob has waded into social commentary, though usually when it does, it bugs the right and supports the left." ''The Hollywood Reporter'' cited the previous episodes "[[SpongeBob's Last Stand]]" and "Selling Out" for where "environmentalism is glorified" and "large businesses are demonized".&lt;ref name=THR/&gt;

According to various sources, the story line is said to be "symbolic of a harsh economic climate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SpongeBob SquarePants ignites real-life media firestorm over social services after losing his job at the Krusty Crab|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/05/spongebob-squarepants-ignites-real-life-media-firestorm-over-social-services-after-losing-his-job-at-the-krusty-crab/|work=National Post|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisman|first=Aly|title=SpongeBob Gets Fired From His Job Amid 'Harsh Underwater Economy' And Sparks A Real-Life Political Debate|url=http://www.chron.com/technology/businessinsider/article/SpongeBob-Gets-Fired-From-His-Job-Amid-Harsh-4954779.php|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SpongeBob Gets Fired From His Job Amid 'Harsh Underwater Economy' And Sparks A Real-Life Political Debate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/SpongeBob-Gets-Fired-From-His-Job-Amid-Harsh-4954779.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot eventually sparked a political debate for its depiction of unemployment.&lt;ref name=MSN&gt;{{cite web|title=SpongeBob gets fired, prompts political debate about food stamps|url=http://now.msn.com/spongebob-squarepants-episode-prompts-political-debate|publisher=MSN|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisman|first=Aly|title=SpongeBob Gets Fired From His Job Amid 'Harsh Underwater Economy' And Sparks A Real-Life Political Debate|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/technology/businessinsider/article/SpongeBob-Gets-Fired-From-His-Job-Amid-Harsh-4954779.php|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=November 5, 2013|date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the premiere, the ''[[New York Post]]'' published an article on the episode.

Nickelodeon declined to comment on the issue caused by the message of the episode.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;{{cite web|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Former Gay Propagandist SpongeBob SquarePants Is Now a Conservative Darling|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2013/11/spongebob-squarepants-fox-news-food-stamps-unemployment-episode|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russell Hicks of Nickelodeon said the show is "tapping into the news of the moment, but did not specifically address any political leanings or ideologies within the episode." In a statement, Hicks said "Like all really great cartoons, part of SpongeBob's long-running success has been its ability to tap into the zeitgeist while still being really funny for our audience. As always, despite this momentary setback, SpongeBob's eternal optimism prevails, which is always a great message for everyone."&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{cite web|last=McCalmont|first=Lucy|title=Jobless SpongeBob nets fans on right|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/jobless-spongebob-nets-fans-on-right-99375.html|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ARMED FORCES PROVIDE GLITTERING CEREMONY FOR STATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT MOD 45159937.jpg|thumb|The 1st Battalion, [[Irish Guards]] accompanied by the [[Band of the Irish Guards]] provide a Guard of Honour at the [[House of Lords]] for the State Opening of Parliament in 2016.]]
The '''State Opening of Parliament''' is an event which formally marks the beginning of a session of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It includes a [[speech from the throne]] known as the '''Queen's Speech''' (or the '''King's Speech'''). The State Opening is an elaborate ceremony showcasing British history, culture and contemporary politics to large crowds and television viewers.

It takes place in the [[House of Lords]] chamber, usually in May or June, but traditionally in November, in front of both Houses of Parliament. The monarch, wearing the [[Imperial State Crown]], reads a speech that has been prepared by his or her government outlining its plans for that parliamentary year. A State Opening may take place at other times of the year if an election is held early due to a [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|vote of no confidence]] in the government. In 1974, when two general elections were held, there were two State Openings.

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] has opened every session of Parliament since her accession, except in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] respectively. Those two sessions were opened by [[Lords Commissioners]], headed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ([[Geoffrey Fisher]] in 1959 and [[Michael Ramsey]] in 1963), empowered by the Queen. The [[Lord Chancellor]] ([[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Viscount Kilmuir]] in 1959 and [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Lord Dilhorne]] in 1963) read the Queen's Speech on those occasions.

==Significance==
The State Opening of Parliament is a ceremony loaded with historical ritual and symbolic significance for the governance of the United Kingdom. In one place are assembled the members of all three branches of government, of which the Monarch is the authority and nominal head in each part: the [[Crown-in-Parliament]], (the Queen, together with the House of Commons and the House of Lords), constitutes the legislature; the [[King-in-Council|Queen-in-Council]], Her Majesty's Ministers (who are members of one or other House, and members of Her Majesty's [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]) constitute the executive; the Queen-on-the-Bench, consisting of Her Majesty's Judges, although not members of either House, are summoned to attend and represent the [[judiciary]]. Therefore, the State Opening demonstrates the governance of the United Kingdom but also the [[separation of powers]]. The importance of international relations is also represented through the presence in the Chamber of the ''[[Diplomatic corps|corps diplomatique]]''.

==Sequence of events==
[[File:Parliament_at_Sunset.JPG|thumb|The Palace of Westminster is home of the two houses of the British Parliament. It is here where the monarch travels to open parliament.]]

The ceremonial surrounding the opening of parliament can be broken down into several parts:

===Searching of the cellars===
First, the cellars of the [[Palace of Westminster]] are searched by the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] in order to prevent a modern-day [[Gunpowder Plot]]. The Plot of 1605 involved a failed attempt by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill the Protestant [[James I of England|King James I]] and aristocracy. Since that year, the cellars have been searched, now largely, but not only, for ceremonial purposes. This is supervised by the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], and the Yeomen are paid for their services with a small glass of [[port wine]].

===Assembly of Peers and Commons===
The peers assemble in the House of Lords wearing their [[Privilege of peerage#Robes|robes]]. They are joined by senior representatives of the judiciary and members of the diplomatic corps. The Commons assemble in their own chamber, wearing ordinary day dress, and begin the day, as any other, with prayers. The [[Speaker of the House of Commons]] makes his usual procession towards the Commons Chamber, accompanied by his Household, the Mace, and a [[police inspector]] who makes a traditional cry of "Hats off, strangers." This commands those in Central Lobby to remove their hats in deference to the highest-ranking commoner in the realm.

===Delivery of Parliamentary hostage===
Before the monarch departs from Buckingham Palace the [[Treasurer of the Household|Treasurer]], [[Comptroller of the Household|Comptroller]] and [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household|Vice-Chamberlain of the Queen's Household]] (all of whom are Government whips) deliver ceremonial white staves to her.&lt;ref name="SN02829"&gt;House of Commons briefing note: The Whip's Office Doc ref. SN/PC/02829. Last updated 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord Chamberlain]], on behalf of the monarch, keeps the '''hostage MP''' (usually the Vice-Chamberlain) "prisoner" for the duration of the state opening, by tradition as a surety for the safe return of the monarch. The hostage MP is well entertained until the successful conclusion of the ceremony, when he or she is released upon the safe return of the Queen.&lt;ref name="SN02829" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_8697000/8697429.stm|title=Democracy Live, 25 May 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Opening of Parliament|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_182439|work=Directgov|accessdate=7 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929221228/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_182439|archivedate=29 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vice-Chamberlain's imprisonment is now purely ceremonial, though he does remain under guard; originally, it guaranteed the safety of the Sovereign as he or she entered a possibly hostile Parliament. The tradition stems from the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who had a contentious relationship with Parliament and was eventually beheaded in 1649 during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] between the monarchy and Parliament. A copy of Charles I's death warrant is displayed in the robing room used by the monarch as a ceremonial reminder of what can happen to a monarch who attempts to interfere with Parliament.

===Arrival of royal regalia===
Before the arrival of the sovereign, the [[Imperial State Crown]] is carried to the Palace of Westminster in its own State Coach ({{Citation needed span|date=November 2018|text=usually}} the [[Australian State Coach]]). From the [[Victoria Tower]], the Crown is passed by the sovereign's Bargemaster to the Comptroller of the [[Lord Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain's]] office, under the watchful eye of the [[Crown Jeweller]]. It is then carried, along with the Great [[British crown jewels#Swords|Sword of State]] and the [[Cap of Maintenance]], to be displayed in the [[Royal Gallery]]. Also brought in this procession, usually in [[King Edward VII's Town Coach]], are two [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]s, separate from the three used by parliament, to be displayed by the Sergeants-at-Arms in the Royal Procession.

=== Arrival of the Sovereign and assembly of Parliament ===
{{see also|State Procession at the UK Opening of Parliament}}

[[File:King Edward VIII opening Parliament.jpg|thumb|[[King Edward VIII]] surrounded by heralds of the [[College of Arms]] on his only State Opening of Parliament, on 3 November 1936]]

The monarch arrives at the Palace of Westminster from Buckingham Palace in a state coach (since 2014, the [[Diamond Jubilee State Coach]]), entering through the Sovereign's Entrance under the [[Victoria Tower]]; the monarch is usually accompanied by his or her consort and sometimes by other members of the royal family. Members of the armed forces line the procession route from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster. As [[God Save the Queen|the national anthem]] is played, the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] is hoisted to replace the [[Union Flag]] upon the Sovereign's entrance and remains flying whilst she is present. Then, after he or she takes on the [[Coronation of the British Monarch#Sovereign's robes|Parliament Robe of State]]&lt;ref&gt;Over this robe is worn the collar and George of the [[Order of the Garter]]; the George used is a larger than usual gold representation of St. George slaying a dragon and heavily set with diamonds made for George III.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The peers also wear their Parliament Robes, also made of crimson velvet and [[miniver]] (although the miniver is now often replaced with the much cheaper white rabbit fur). These robes are closed over the right shoulder with bands of gold lace and miniver—four for a duke; three and a half for a marquess; three for an earl or countess; two and a half for a viscount or viscountess and two for a baron or baroness.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imperial State Crown]] in the Robing Chamber, the monarch proceeds through the Royal Gallery to the House of Lords, usually accompanied by his or her consort and immediately preceded by the [[Earl Marshal]], and by one peer (usually the [[Leader of the House of Lords]]) carrying the [[Cap of Maintenance]] on a white rod, and another peer (generally a retired senior military officer) carrying the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Swords|Great Sword of State]], all following the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] and his white stick, commonly the practical implement of ceremonial ushers, raised aloft. Once seated on the throne, the monarch, wearing the Imperial State Crown, instructs the House by saying, "My Lords, pray be seated"; her consort takes his seat on the throne to her left and other members of the royal family may be seated elsewhere on the dais (for instance the Prince of Wales may be seated on a chair of state on a lower portion of the dais to the monarch's right.)

===Royal summons of the Commons to the Lords' chamber===
Motioned by the monarch, the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] raises his wand of office to signal to the [[Black Rod|Gentleman/Lady Usher of the Black Rod (known as Black Rod)]], who is charged with summoning the House of Commons and has been waiting in the Central Lobby. Black Rod turns and, under the escort of the Door-keeper of the House of Lords and a police inspector, proceeds to the Members' Lobby of the [[House of Commons]], and reaches the doors of the Commons.

[[File:John Hampden portrait.jpg|thumb|Leading 17th-century parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] is one of the [[Five Members]] annually commemorated]]
In 1642, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] stormed into the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the [[Five Members]], who included the celebrated English patriot and leading parliamentarian [[John Hampden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Bagley, A. S. Lewis (1977). "Lancashire at War: Cavaliers and Roundheads, 1642-51 : a Series of Talks Broadcast from BBC Radio Blackburn". p. 15. Dalesman&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting.&lt;ref name="State opening"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/guides/newsid_81000/81909.stm "Democracy Live: Black Rod"]. BBC. Retrieved 6 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On Black Rod's approach, the Doorkeeper of the Commons orders that the doors are slammed shut against him, symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch.&lt;ref name="State opening"/&gt; The Usher of the Black Rod then strikes with the end of his ceremonial staff (the Black Rod) three times on the closed doors of the Commons Chamber, and is then admitted. (There is a mark on the door of the Commons showing the repeated indentations made by Black Rods over the years.) The Sergeant-at-Arms introduces Black Rod. At the bar, Black Rod bows to the Speaker before proceeding to the table, bowing again, and announcing the command of the monarch for the attendance of the Commons, in the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr [or Madam] Speaker, The Queen commands this honourable House [pauses to bow to both sides of the House] to attend Her Majesty immediately in the House of Peers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A tradition has developed in recent years for this command to be greeted with a defiant topical comment by republican-leaning Labour MP [[Dennis Skinner]], upon which, with some mirth, the House rises to make their way to the Lords' Chamber.&lt;ref name="State opening"/&gt; This customary intervention was omitted by Mr Skinner in 2015, claiming that he had "bigger fish to fry than uttering something", due to a dispute over seating with the Scottish Nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/27/dennis-skinner-queens-speech-quip-fighting-scots-nats|title=Dennis Skinner explains lack of Queen's speech quip: 'I was fighting Scots Nats'|last=Gani|first=Aisha|date=2015-05-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner resumed the practice in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dennis-skinner-zings-queens-speech-7995683&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procession of the Commons===

The Speaker proceeds to attend the summons at once. The Sergeant-at-Arms picks up the [[ceremonial mace]] and, with the Speaker and Black Rod, leads the Members of the House of Commons as they walk, in pairs, towards the House of Lords. By custom, the members saunter, with much discussion and joking, rather than formally process. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] followed by The [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[First Secretary of State]] or another member of the government and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition usually walk side by side, leading the two lines of MPs. The Commons then arrive at the Bar of the House of Lords. The only people required to bow are the House of Commons Speaker, Commons Clerk, senior Lords official Black Rod and the Sergeant-at-Arms. No person who is not a member of the Upper House may pass the Bar unbidden when it is in session; a similar rule applies to the Commons. They remain standing at the Bar during the speech.

=== Delivery of the speech from the throne===
[[File:Thrones in the House of Lords c1902.jpg|thumb|The royal thrones, c. 1902]]

The monarch reads a prepared speech, known as the "[[Speech from the Throne]]" or the "Queen's Speech", outlining the Government's agenda for the coming year. The speech is written by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister and their cabinet members]], and reflects the legislative agenda for which the Government seeks the agreement of both [[Houses of Parliament]]. It is traditionally written on goatskin [[vellum]], and presented on bended knee for the monarch to read by the [[Lord Chancellor]], who produces the scroll from a satchel-like bag. Traditionally, rather than turning his back on the Sovereign, which might appear disrespectful, the Lord Chancellor walks backwards down the steps of the throne, continuing to face the monarch. [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Lord Irvine of Lairg]], the Lord Chancellor at the time, sought to break the custom and applied successfully for permission to turn his back on the sovereign and walk down the steps forwards. The next Lord Chancellor, [[Jack Straw]], continued the former tradition but succeeding Lord Chancellors have chosen to walk forwards.

The whole speech is addressed to "My Lords and Members of the House of Commons", with one significant exception that the monarch says specifically, "Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public services will be laid before you", since the budget is constitutionally reserved to the Commons.

The monarch reads the entire speech in a neutral and formal tone, implying neither approval nor disapproval of the proposals of Her Government: the monarch makes constant reference to "My Government" when reading the text. After listing the main bills to be introduced during the session, the monarch states: "Other measures will be laid before you", thus leaving the government scope to introduce bills not mentioned in the speech. The monarch mentions any state visits that she intends to make and also any planned state visits of foreign heads of state to the United Kingdom during the parliamentary session. The monarch concludes the speech in saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels". 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditionally, the members of both houses of Parliament listen to the speech respectfully, neither applauding nor showing dissent towards its contents before it is debated in each house. This silence, however, was broken in 1998, when Queen Elizabeth II announced the government's plan of abolishing the right of [[hereditary peer]]s to sit in the House of Lords. A few Labour members of the House of Commons cried "yes" and "hear", prompting several of the Lords to shout "no" and "shame". The Queen continued delivering her speech without any pause, ignoring the intervention. The conduct of those who interrupted the speech was strongly criticised at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6710000/newsid_6710100/6710121.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;bbcws=1 |work=BBC News | title=1998: Queen's speech to end peers | date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/24/newsid_4007000/4007601.stm |work=BBC News | title=1998: Queen's speech spells end for peers | date=24 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure of monarch===
[[File:State Opening of Parliament 2008 I (3082920424).jpg|thumb|right|The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace in the [[Irish State Coach]] via [[Whitehall]] and [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] in 2008.]]
[[File:State Opening of Parliament 2015 (17982787869).jpg|thumb|right|The return procession crossing [[Horse Guards Parade]] in 2015.]]
Following the speech, the monarch and his or her retinue leave the chamber. The monarch bows to both sides of the House of Peers and then leaves the chamber, in the reverse order of the usual procession, before the Commons bow again and return to their Chamber.

===Debate on the speech===
After the departure of the Queen from the palace, each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an "Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech." But first, each House considers a bill ''[[pro forma]]'' to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. In the House of Lords, the bill is called the [[Select Vestries Bill]], while the Commons equivalent is the [[Outlawries Bill]]. The bills are considered for the sake of ceremony only, and do not make any actual legislative progress. For the address in reply, a chosen member moves "That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, as follows". The following is the form used in the House of Lords and is nearly identical to that used in the House of Commons:
{{quote|Most Gracious Sovereign,

We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords 
, 2.07&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first speech of the debate in the Commons is, by tradition, a humorous one given by a member selected in advance. The consideration of the address in reply to the Throne Speech is the occasion for a debate on the Government's agenda. The debate on the Address in Reply is spread over several days. On each day, a different topic, such as foreign affairs or finance, is considered. The debate provides an indication of the views of Parliament regarding the government's agenda.

Following this debate, a vote is taken on the Government Programme. If the Government loses the vote, it is considered to be a [[motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|vote of no confidence]].

=="Dressed down State Opening"==
On two occasions, in 1974 and 2017, the State Opening has been conducted in a "dressed-down" manner, due to the snap general elections held in those years. This form of ceremony has been marked by several changes. Most noticeably, the Queen attended in a hat and morning dress, rather than the traditional crown, ball gown, and robe of state. The Imperial State Crown is carried in front of the Queen, in the same manner as the Sword of State and Cap of Maintenance. Also, no carriages or coaches are used, and the Queen arrives at Westminster by motorcar. There is no military escort in the streets for this procession. Finally, certain personages, such as Heralds and Officers of Arms, are not in attendance at the ceremony. Other than these changes, the ceremony remains largely the same.

==Cancellation in the 2010s==
Throughout the twentieth century (including in wartime) the State Opening took place on an annual basis, with the following exceptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Queens Speech: Proposers of the Loyal Address in the House of Commons since 1900 |url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04064/SN04064.pdf |website=UK Parliament |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There were two State Openings in 1914 (and no State Opening in 1915);
* There were two State Openings in 1921 (and no State Opening in 1923);
* There were two State Openings in 1924 (and no State Opening in 1925).
After 1925, the State Opening invariably took place every year (and twice in 1974 - see above) until 2010, since when the government has twice cancelled the event: 
* In 2011 the State Opening was cancelled by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative/Lib-Dem coalition]] 'without consultation', to ease the planned introduction of [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|legislation for fixed-term Parliaments]];&lt;ref name="2011cancellation"&gt;{{cite web |title=Government accused of 'abuse of power' after cancelling 2011 Queen's speech |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/13/government-cancels-2011-queens-speech |website=The Guardian |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2018 the State Opening was again cancelled, by the [[Second May ministry|Conservative minority government]], in what was described as a 'highly unusual move' to double the Parliamentary session to two years 'avoiding a vote on controversial legislation at the height of talks over the UK's departure from the EU'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theresa May cancels 2018 Queen's Speech to give more time to push through Brexit laws |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-cancels-2018-queens-speech-push-through-brexit-laws-a7795541.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2011 cancellation was criticised as having been 'driven not by any coherent philosophy about constitutional change but by short-term, narrow party interests'.&lt;ref name="2011cancellation" /&gt;

==Origins==
{{For|broader historical background|Parliament of England|Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
The Opening of Parliament&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, H.S., 'The Staging of Ceremonies of State in the House of Lords' in ''The Houses of Parliament: History, Art, Architecture'' London: Merrell 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; began out of practical necessity. By the late 14th century, the manner in which the King gathered his nobles and representatives of the Commons had begun to follow an established pattern. First of all, [[Peerage of England|Peers]]' names were checked against the list of those who had been [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|summoned]], and representatives of the Commons were checked against the [[High Sheriff|sheriffs']] election returns. The Peers were robed and sat in the [[Painted Chamber]] at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]; the Commons were summoned, and stood at the Bar (threshold) of the Chamber. A speech or sermon was then given (usually by the [[Lord Chancellor]]) explaining why Parliament had been summoned, after which the Lords and Commons went separately to discuss the business in hand. The monarch normally presided, not only for the Opening but also for the deliberations which followed (unless prevented by illness or other pressing matters).

In the Tudor period, the modern structure of Parliament began to emerge, and the monarch no longer attended during normal proceedings. For this reason, the State Opening took on greater symbolic significance as an occasion for the full constitution of the State (Monarch, Lords and Commons) to be seen. In this period, the parliamentary gathering began to be preceded by an open-air State [[Procession]] (which often attracted large numbers of onlookers): the Monarch, together with Household retinue, would proceed in State from whichever royal residence was being used, first to Westminster Abbey for a service (usually a [[Votive Mass|Mass of the Holy Ghost]], prior to the Reformation), and thence on foot (accompanied by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in their robes) to the Palace of Westminster for the Opening itself.

===Wriothesley Garter Book, 1523===
[[File:Parliament of Henry VIII 1523.jpg|thumb|Opening of Parliament by [[Henry VIII]] at [[Bridewell Palace|Bridewell]] 
in 1523; a contemporary illustration from the [[Sir Thomas Wriothesley|Wriothesley]] Garter Book]]
The Wriothesley Garter Book, a 1523 illustration by Sir [[Thomas Wriothesley]], depicts King Henry VIII seated in Parliament in that year. It shows a remarkable visual similarity between State Openings of the 16th and 21st centuries. In both cases, the monarch sits on a [[throne]] before the Cloth of Estate, crowned and wearing a crimson robe of state; at his right hand sit Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Archbishop of York]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], with arms above under a cardinal's hat, and [[William Warham]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with arms above. Behind stands [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], [[Bishop of London]].&lt;ref&gt;See catalogue entry, royal collection[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book]
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cap of Maintenance]] and [[Sword of State]] are borne by peers standing before the monarch on the left and right respectively; the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] stands alongside, bearing his white wand of office, near the [[Garter King of Arms]] in his [[tabard]] displaying the [[Royal arms of England|royal arms]] (Sir Thomas Wriothesley himslf, the illustrator).&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue entry from 'Royal Treasures, A Golden Jubilee Celebration', London, 2002. per catalogue entry, royal collection[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book]
&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Royal retinue are arrayed behind the King (top right). In the main body of the Chamber, the Bishops are seated on benches to the King's right wearing their parliamentary robes, with the Mitred Abbots behind them. The Lords Temporal are seated to the King's left and on the cross-bench, the status of peers is indicated by the number of miniver bars (white fur edged with gold oak-leaf lace) on their peerage robes: 4 for a duke, 3½ for a marquess, 3 for an earl, 2½ for a viscount, and 2 for a baron. Thus there are 2 dukes, both wearing ducal coronets, the first holding a Marshal's Baton, thus he is the [[Duke of Norfolk]], [[Earl Marshal]] of England. Sir [[William Weston (prior)|William Weston]], Prior of the [[Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]], premier baron in the roll of peers, dressed in black, sits at the end of the cross-bench.&lt;ref&gt;See catalogue entry, royal collection[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book]
&lt;/ref&gt; The judges (red-robed and [[coif]]ed) are on the [[woolsack]]s in the centre (two [[Chief Justice]]s, eight judges, and four [[Serjeants-at-Law]]&lt;ref&gt;See catalogue entry, royal collection[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book]
&lt;/ref&gt;), and behind them kneel the clerks (with quills and inkpots). At the bottom of the picture members of the House of Commons can be seen behind the Bar of the House, with Sir [[Thomas More]],&lt;ref&gt;See catalogue entry, royal collection[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/1047414/the-wriothesley-garter-book]
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speaker of the House of Commons]], in the centre, wearing his black and gold robe of state.

Since that time the ceremonial has evolved, but not dramatically. Mitred Abbots were removed from Parliament at the time of the Reformation. In 1679 neither the procession nor the Abbey service took place, due to fears of a [[Popish Plot]]; although the procession was subsequently restored, the service in the Abbey was not. The monarch's role in the proceedings changed over time: early on, the monarch would say some introductory words, before calling upon the Lord Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) to address the assembly. James I, however, was accustomed to speak at greater length himself, and sometimes dispensed with the Chancellor's services as spokesman. This varying pattern continued in subsequent reigns (and during the Commonwealth, when Cromwell gave the speech), but from 1679 onwards it became the norm for the monarch alone to speak. Since then, the monarch (if present) has almost invariably given the speech, with the exception of George I (whose command of English was poor) and Victoria (after the death of Prince Albert). A dramatic change was occasioned by the destruction of the old Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834; however, the new palace was designed with the ceremony of the State Opening very much in mind,&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine, D., 'The Palace of Westminster as Palace of Varieties' in ''The Houses of Parliament: History, Art, Architecture'' London: Merrell 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern ceremony dates from its opening in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/archives-state-opening/ "The State Opening of Parliament - A Perspective from the Archives"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001023925/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/archives-state-opening/ |date=1 October 2015 }}, www.parliament.uk.

In 1998, adjustments were made to the ceremonial inside Parliament to shorten the proceedings. The [[herald]]s, instead of processing with the monarch, arrived at Parliament earlier and had a separate procession. The number of court officials in the procession was reduced, including one of the [[lady in waiting|ladies in waiting]] and the [[Crown Equerry]]. Also omitted were the three [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|Heads of the Armed Services]], represented instead by the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]. [[Gold Stick and Silver Stick|Silver Stick in Waiting]] (the Commander of the Household Cavalry) no longer processed, although Gold Stick-in-Waiting (the honorary Colonel of the Household Cavalry) retained a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Opening loses some pomp|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/11/98/queen_speech/216684.stm|accessdate=18 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=24 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[governor-general]] or, in the case of [[States and territories of Australia|Australia's states]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's provinces]], the relevant [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]] or [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]], respectively, usually delivers the speech from the throne.

In India, the [[President of India]] opens Parliament with an address similar to the Speech from the Throne. This is also the case in Commonwealth Republics with a non-executive Presidency such as [[Malta]], Mauritius and [[Singapore]].
[[File:56255 Haakon VII trontalen 1950.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Haakon VII]] delivering the Speech from the Throne in [[Stortinget]] in 1950.]]
In the Netherlands a similar ceremony is held on the third Tuesday in September, which is called [[Prinsjesdag]] in the Netherlands. Article 65 of the constitution states that "A statement of the policy to be pursued by the Government is given by or on behalf of the King before a joint session of the two Houses of the States General that is held every year on the third Tuesday in September or on such earlier date as may be prescribed by Act of Parliament." In Norway, the King is required by Article 74 of the constitution to preside over the opening of the Storting after it had been declared to be legally constituted by the president of the Storting. After he delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government's policies for the coming year, a member of the government reads the Report on the State of the Realm, an account of the government's achievements of the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=30059 |title=Opening of the Storting |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.royalcourt.no |publisher=Royal House of Norway |access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Sweden a similar ceremony as the British was held until 1974, when the constitution was changed. The old opening of state was in Sweden called ''Riksdagens högtidliga öppnande'' ("The solemn opening of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]") and was, as the British, full of symbolism. After the abolition of the old state opening, the opening is now held in the Riksdag but in the presence of the [[King of Sweden|monarch]] and his family. It is still the King who officially opens the parliament. After the opening of parliament the King gives a speech followed by the Prime Minister's declaration of government. 

In Israel, a semi-annual ceremony, attended by the [[President of Israel|President]], opens the winter and summer sessions of the [[Knesset]]. Though in the past he was a guest sitting in the Knesset's upper deck, the President now attends the ceremony from the speaker's podium and gives his own written address regarding the upcoming session. In the first session of each legislative period of the Knesset, the President has the duty of opening the first session himself and inaugurating the temporary Knesset speaker, and then conducting the inauguration process of all of the Knesset members. 

In some countries with presidential or similar systems in which the roles of [[head of state]] and head of government are merged, the chief executive's annual speech to the legislative branch is imbued with some of the ceremonial weight of a parliamentary state opening. The most well-known example is the [[State of the Union address|State of the Union Address]] in the United States. Other examples include the [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] in the Philippines, a former American dependency. These speeches differ from a State Opening in at least two respects, however: they do not in fact open the legislative session, and they are delivered by the chief executive on his or her own behalf. In Poland, the [[President of Poland]] delivers his speech to the ''[[Sejm]]'' and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] at the First Sitting of these Houses, which is similar to Speech from the Throne. It is rather a custom than a law. Most [[President of Poland|Presidents of Poland]] delivered the Speech to the [[Parliament of Poland|Parliament]]. The exception was in 2007, when President [[Lech Kaczyński]], instead of addressing the ''Sejm'', watched the First Sitting of the 6th term ''Sejm'' from the Presidential box in the Press gallery.

'''''Tarzan and His Mate''''' is a 1934 American [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] action adventure film based on characters created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. Directed by [[Cedric Gibbons]], it was the second in the [[Tarzan]] film series to star [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. In 2003, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
Tarzan and his wife [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]] live in the jungle, along with their chimpanzee [[Cheeta]]. [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]] and his business partner Martin Arlington, leading a large party of locals, meet them on their way to take ivory from an elephant burial ground. Holt had visited the burial ground with Tarzan on an earlier trip, during which he had also met Jane. Holt had sought Tarzan out, as he was the only one who knew the way to the burial ground. On this trip, Holt tries to convince Jane to return with him to civilization by bringing her gifts such as clothing and modern gadgets. Jane tells him she would rather stay with Tarzan. She does agree to convince Tarzan to act as their guide.

When Tarzan calls an elephant, Arlington gets the idea that they can use elephants as pack animals, enabling them to haul much more ivory. When Jane tries to convince Tarzan to call more elephants, she explains to him about hauling the ivory away. Tarzan, thinking that taking the ivory is profaning the burial ground, refuses. In addition, he refuses to even lead them to the burial ground, now that he knows of their intent. Arlington and Holt have everything they own tied up in this venture and are frantic to continue on. Arlington asks Holt how they found the burial ground the first time, and Holt explains that they had followed a dying elephant. Seizing on that idea, Arlington shoots an elephant, mortally wounding it so that it will lead them to the burial ground.  Only Jane's intervention keeps Tarzan from murdering Arlington. 

After being abandoned by Tarzan and Jane, Arlington and Holt lead their baggage carriers, led by Saidi, a friend of Jane and Tarzan's, to the burial ground, following the wounded elephant. Elephants, aware of the impending disgrace of their sacred ground, turn up in the hundreds, and threaten to exterminate Holt and Arlington's party. Tarzan and Jane arrive in time to save them, after which Arlington feigns repentance, promising to leave the next day without the ivory. Satisfied, Tarzan agrees to guide their departure, and sends the elephants away.

Early the next morning, Arlington ambushes Tarzan, shooting him out of a tree. Tarzan falls into the water, and Arlington thinks he has killed him. After Arlington leaves, a hippopotamus rescues a semi-conscious Tarzan and carries him to a group of chimpanzees, which tend to him. Tarzan has received a head wound, but the bullet only grazed him, though it has left him very weak. The head chimpanzee applies plant sap to staunch the bleeding. 

Arlington returns to the group, claiming that he saw Tarzan being killed by an [[alligator]]. A distraught Jane agrees to return to civilization. Arlington and Holt have their baggage carriers each take a tusk from the burial ground, and they begin to head back. Cheeta leaves Jane and looks for Tarzan. Chased by a lion, Cheeta escapes and comes upon the chimpanzee group tending to Tarzan.

As Tarzan recuperates, the safari makes its way through the jungle. Cheeta returns and lets Jane know that Tarzan is alive. However, shortly after the safari is confronted by a hostile tribe of "lion men", who kill two of the bearers and intend to kill the entire safari. Under cover of gunfire, most of the safari makes it to some nearby caves, set into the face of a rocky cliff. The bearer who was carrying the ammunition crate is killed on the way. When Saidi makes an attempt to retrieve the crate, he is captured by the lion men. Cheeta escapes and runs off to tell Tarzan

The safari watch in horror the next morning as Saidi is staked out to a tree, as the lion men intend to use him as bait to call lions to attack the safari. When Holt rushes out to save him, he is wounded by a thrown spear. Wounded, he begins to free Saidi when the lions show up and tear him and Saidi to pieces. Meanwhile, Cheeta has returned to Tarzan, who while still weak, sets off after Cheeta.

The lions attempt to get at the safari, but are held off by Jane and Arlington and one of the bearers. When the bearer goes down on a ledge, Arlington goes out to save him, and he is attacked by a lion. Arlington is killed, but Jane kills the charging lion. As the lions become more aggressive, Tarzan and the chimpanzees arrive. The chimpanzees begin to throw the lion men out of the trees, where they are set upon by the lions. Jane kills two lions before she runs out of ammunition. As she is about to be attacked by the last lion, Tarzan arrives and kills it with his knife. Shortly after, a large herd of elephants arrives, trampling the lions, killing several and running the remainder off. 

With the lion men and the lions routed, the elephants, along with Tarzan, Jane, and Cheeta, return the ivory to the burial ground.

[[File:Nanking Theatre.jpg|thumb|''Tarzan and His Mate'' being shown in [[Shanghai]]'s [[Nanking Theatre]]]]

In 1932 M.G.M’s ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan The Ape Man]]'' cost $652,675 to make, and took $2.54 million at the box office. [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], keen to capitalize on the success of the first film (as were M.G.M), began negotiations in March 1932 for future Tarzan films. Discussions between Burroughs’ representative, Ralph Rothmund and M.G.M executives, [[Irving Thalberg]] and Sam Marx, had begun in March 1932, and a new contract was signed in May of that year for a second Tarzan feature, with an option for a further two. Burroughs’ received $45,000. Also in May, Burroughs contacted producer [[Bernard H. Hyman]] with the suggestion that Tarzan films be released as seasonal events. In mid-June 1932, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that former independent producer Bud Barsky was to write the "original yarn" for the yet to be titled Tarzan sequel, and was to be assisted by M.G.M staffers R. L. Johnson and Arthur S. Hyman.&lt;ref name="forever"&gt;See John Taliaferro's biography of Burroughs, ''Tarzan Forever'', p. 282, {{ISBN|0-684-83359-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Story conferences were held in March, with the author of the play ''White Cargo'' [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]], producer Bernie Hyman, supervising art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], and production manager Joe Cohn. These early drafts toyed with the idea of a fight with a huge mechanical crocodile, and a spectacular jungle fire. By May 1933, a dialogue continuity by Howard Emmett Rogers was completed. This and earlier script and conference ideas became the basis for the various drafts of the eventual screenplay credited to [[James Kevin McGuinness]].&lt;ref name="forever"/&gt;

Special effects were to be overseen by Cedric Gibbons and executed by M.G.M’s [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] and [[Warren Newcombe]], James Basevi and [[Irving Reis]]. For their day, the special effects of the film were complex, involving such devices as [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte paintings]], [[Miniature effect|miniatures]], [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screens]], and [[Rear projection effect|rear projection]].&lt;ref name="forever"/&gt;

A June 29, 1933 Hollywood Reporter news item announced that [[W. S. Van Dyke]] (director of the first ''Tarzan The Ape Man''), was to be Gibbons' co-director. By July 1, 1933, Van Dyke was dropped from the project, and Gibbons was announced as the film's sole director. In September 1933, however, the Hollywood Reporter announced that [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]], was to take over the direction of one of Gibbons' units.&lt;ref name="media"&gt;Media History Digital Library accessed 6th January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming on ''Tarzan and His Mate'' began August 2, 1933. Joining [[Johnny Weissmuller]] for the sequel were [[Rod La Rocque]] (who had just appeared in ''[[S.O.S. Eisberg|S.O.S. Iceberg]]'' (1933), co-starring [[Leni Riefenstahl]], one of the last German-U.S co-productions, due to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]), [[Murray Kinnell]] ([[The House of Rothschild]]), and [[Frank Reicher]] (one of 17 films he appeared in 1934). Problems soon developed. After 3 ½ weeks of shooting, the first unit was shut down; Gibbons had shot a lot of excess footage, and costs were spiraling. When it resumed, Gibbons was no longer the director, in his place was Jack Conway as dialogue director with James C. McKay directing a number of animal sequences. A late August 1933 Hollywood Reporter news item announced that Rod La Rocque had been pulled from the cast, and replaced by [[Paul Cavanagh]] in the role of Martin Arlington, ‘because of miscasting’. The roles of Tom Pierce and Van Ness were also changed, and Frank Reicher and Murray Kinnell were replaced by Desmond Roberts and William Stack, respectively.&lt;ref name="media"/&gt;
 
Some sources report Jack Conway directed most of the picture; however [[Maureen O’Sullivan]] has said James C. McKay actually directed the film. His official credit on the picture was Animal Director. McKay (1894-1971) had a resume full of various credits, and he jumped back and forth between the jobs of director and editor. McKay had received a Production Assistant credit on ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'' (1931) directed by [[W. S. Van Dyke]]. McKay was initially given the director's chair for the sequel, ''[[Tarzan Escapes]]'' (1936), indicating M.G.M must have been happy with the work he did on ''Tarzan and His Mate''; however there would be many changes to the cast and crew on that film too (including Elmer Sheeley replacing Cedric Gibbons as art director!). 

Plans to film in Africa were scrapped and several locations around [[Los Angeles]] were used, including Sherwood Forest, [[Sherwood Dam|Lake Sherwood]], [[Whittier, California]], [[Big Tujunga Creek|Big Tujunga]],  and [[Willow Creek, California|China Flat]].&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/501073/Tarzan-And-His-Mate-Movie-Clip-Did-You-Get-Your-Worm-.html |title=Tarzan And His Mate (1934) - (Movie Clip) Did You Get Your Worm? |website=Tcm.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bert Nelson and George Emerson, the M.G.M animal trainers, doubled for Weissmuller. Trapeze artists Alfred Codona and the Flying Codonas, who had performed in the first Tarzan film, also doubled for Weissmuller and O'Sullivan, and acted as the elder Cheeta. Dressed in ape suits, The Picchianis performed in the film, and one of the troupe doubled for Weissmuller in a tree jumping sequence. Nelson also doubled for Paul Cavanagh. As with ''Tarzan the Ape Man'', [[Indian elephant]]s taken from M.G.M's zoo had attachments fixed to their ears and tusks to suggest [[African elephant]]s. During the [[crocodile]] wrestling scene, a mechanical crocodile, equipped with nigrosine dye sacks to simulate blood, was used. Perhaps the highlight of the action sequences occurs with the elephants vs. lions battle. Travelling matte shots were used to depict lions leaping up and holding on to elephants, who then seized them with their trunks and hurled them down, or crushed them beneath their feet.&lt;ref name="media"/&gt; Tarzan rides a [[rhinoceros]] in one scene - a first for film. The rhino, Mary, was imported from the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck|Hagenbeck Zoo]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany. Weissmuller did the scene himself, sustaining only minor scrapes to sensitive places from Mary's rough hide.&lt;ref name="forever"/&gt;

Filming was not completed until the end of March 1934, because of re-takes and additional aerial scenes involving Jane and Tarzan. Betty Roth, wife of lion owner Louis Roth, doubled for O'Sullivan in some close contact scenes with lions near the film’s conclusion. O’Sullivan was absent for over a month recovering from an appendectomy. M.G.M had spent $1,279,142 on the production. In early April 1934, after previews M.G.M cut the film, editing out fourteen-and-a-half minutes.&lt;ref name="media"/&gt;

Although a hit, it did not earn as much as the first Tarzan film in the United States. Internationally it was a huge success, despite the fact that it was banned in Germany by the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist Party]] on the grounds that it showed a Nordic man in brutal surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geostan.ca/mate.html |title=Visitor anti-robot validation |website=Geostan.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's cult status is largely due to O’Sullivan wearing one of the [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/239394536412764167/ most revealing costumes] in screen history at that time; a halter-top and a loincloth that leave her thighs and hips exposed. Because Jane is a ‘lady’ from England (not Baltimore, as in Burroughs' novel), with manners and poise, her wearing such a provocative outfit is particularly naughty and symbolic of her sexual freedom. In this [[Motion Picture Production Code|pre-Code]] film Jane sleeps in the nude, swims nude with Tarzan, is constantly touched by Tarzan, has a scene in which she is stranded in the jungle without clothes on, and is seen nude in silhouette when dressing in a well lit tent. That Jane and Tarzan sleep together is all the more startling by Hollywood standards because they aren’t married; the end credits list O'Sullvan as Jane ‘Parker,’ emphasizing that she was single and living in sin.&lt;ref name="sin"&gt;Vieira, Mark A. (1999), ''Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, p. 180, {{ISBN|0-8109-4475-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene that caused the most commotion, the ‘underwater ballet’ sequence, was available in three different versions that were edited by M.G.M to meet the standards of particular markets.&lt;ref name="forever"/&gt; Gibbons' wife Dolores del Rio had performed a risque nude swim in ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932), a sequence that is said to have inspired the one in Tarzan. Tarzan and Jane (O'Sullivan's swimming double, [[Josephine McKim]], who competed in the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]] with [[Johnny Weissmuller]]), dance a graceful underwater ballet with Jane completely nude. When she rises out of the water, Jane (now Maureen O’Sullivan) flashes a bare breast. Such big-screen impropriety was rare at the time, and if seen at all was usually done by dancing girl extras, or non-white actresses due to the time's double-standards (witness the topless ‘native’ girls at the start of the film, or the topless ‘natives’ in the 1935 ''[[Sanders of the River]]''). The new Production Code Office thought O'Sullivan's scant costume, coupled with her sexual charisma, was too much. In April, [[Joseph Breen]], director of public relations of the MPPDA, reported to his president, [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]], that ''Tarzan and His Mate'' had been rejected because of shots in which "the girl was shown completely in the nude."&lt;ref name="sin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tcm"/&gt;

:Breen: "The man in the shot wore a loin cloth, but a critical examination of the shot indicated that the woman was stark naked. There were four or five shots of the woman… which showed the front of the woman's body."&lt;ref name="sin"/&gt;

When M.G.M production head [[Irving Thalberg]] protested the jury's decision by claiming that the 1928 film ''[[White Shadows in the South Seas]]'' had "fifty naked women" in it, the jurors screened that film and determined that none of the women were naked. According to film historian [[Rudy Behlmer]]: "From all evidence, ''three'' versions of the sequence eventually went out to separate territories during the film's initial release. One with Jane clothed in her jungle loin cloth outfit, one with her topless, and one with her in the nude.&lt;ref name="sin"/&gt; However, by April 24, 1934, all prints of ''Tarzan and His Mate'' in all territories were ordered changed. Additionally, the New York Censors previewed the film, and insisted that the scene involving Cavanagh lowering his nude body into a portable bathtub be eliminated as well. It was not until [[Ted Turner]] took over the M.G.M film library that a positive print of the original film was discovered in the vaults and released in 1986.&lt;ref name="sin"/&gt;

'''The English Mercurie''' is a [[literary hoax]] purporting to be the first English [[newspaper]]. It is apparently an account of the English battle with the [[Spanish Armada]] of 1588, but was in fact written by the second [[Earl of Hardwicke]], Philip Yorke, in the 18th century as a literary game with some friends. Although the hoax was debunked in 1839, copies of the Mercurie are still mistakenly referred to as factual accounts in the modern era.

== The contents of the English Mercurie ==

With its [[Blackletter|gothic]] [[nameplate (publishing)|nameplate]], faded [[typeface]] and [[Early Modern English]] spelling, The English Mercurie&lt;ref name="exmsft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exmsft.com/~davidco/History/drake1.htm|title=The English Mercurie  – July 23rd, 1588|date=8 March 2012|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308034434/http://exmsft.com/~davidco/History/drake1.htm|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has many of the hallmarks of an early English [[newsbook]]. It contains the dateline of "[[Whitehall]], July 23d, 1588", and the claim that it is "published by AUTHORITIE", "For the Prevention of false Reportes". 
The four pages start with the spotting of the [[Spanish Armada]] by a Captain Fleming near [[Plymouth]], and go on to describe the actions of [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] and Rear Admirals "Hawkins" (a reference to [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Sir John Hawkins]]) and "Forbisher" (a misspelling of [[Sir Martin Frobisher]]). 
The newsbook gives a vivid account of the Spanish fleet's actions, saying
&lt;blockquote style="background:white; padding:1em; border:1px solid #999999;"&gt;
But about one in the Afternoone, they came in Sighte of the Spanish Armado two Leagues to the Westward of the Eddistone, sailing in the Form of a half-Moon, the Points whereof were seven Leagues asunder.&lt;ref name="exmsft.com"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Mercurie estimates the size of the Spanish fleet at 150 ships, and provides information about ships captured by the English fleet.
The second section carries the dateline of [[Ostend]], 27 July, which contains a report of the organisation of the Spanish invasion force that was to follow the Armada, with "thirty thousand Foote and eighteen hundred Horse". 
The newsbook then closes with a third report, dated London, 23 July, and describes how [[Queen Elizabeth I]] held an audience with dignitaries from the city of [[London]], including the "Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council and Lieutenancie".

== History of the hoax ==

=== Hardwicke's literary game ===
The orchestrator of the hoax was [[Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke]], along with his friend Dr [[Thomas Birch]], and possibly Yorke's brother [[Charles Yorke|Charles]]. They produced five issues&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Raymond, Joad (1998) 'Introduction: Newspapers, forgeries, and histories', Prose Studies, 21: 2, 1–11&lt;/ref&gt; of which three were printed and two were manuscript newsletters.
Dr Birch bequeathed the manuscript and printed copies of the English Mercurie to the [[British Museum]] in 1766, without any explanation of their origin.

=== Acceptance as historical fact ===
The English Mercurie was referred to by [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]], a Scottish antiquarian and political writer, in his 1794 book ''The Life of Thomas Ruddiman''&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, George (1794) ''The Life of Thomas Ruddiman'' (available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=FqwEAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;
It predated the ''[[Mercurius Gallobelgicus]]'' which is widely accepted in studies of the [[history of journalism]] to be the true first newspaper{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} which was written in Latin and appeared in 1594 in Cologne, Germany, and distributed across Europe.
Chalmers adduced the Mercurie as evidence of English invention, saying
&lt;blockquote style="background:white; padding:1em; border:1px solid #999999;"&gt;It may gratify our national pride to be told, that mankind are indebted to the wisdom of Elizabeth, and the prudence of Burleigh, for the first newspaper.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The uncovering of the hoax ===
Chalmers's assertion was unchallenged for 45 years until Thomas Watts uncovered the existence of the original manuscript in the archives of the British Museum in 1839.&lt;ref name="Early British Newspapers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/552|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition= Eleventh |first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|publisher=New York : Encyclopaedia Britannica|volume=19|page=552|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the handwriting on the manuscript as being identical to that used in a letter from Yorke as part of Dr Birch's collection.
There were other inconsistencies, including the typeface and some spellings&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and Watts also found corrections on the manuscript in Dr Birch's handwriting&lt;ref name="Early British Newspapers" /&gt; The motivation of the authors in creating the English Mercurie is unknown, although it has been speculated that it was not an intentional attempt to mislead, but rather a literary game.&lt;ref name="Early British Newspapers" /&gt;

=== Modern uses of the English Mercurie ===

British television network [[Channel 4]] contained a reference to The English Mercurie as "a newspaper report of Drake's role in the Spanish Armada" in a website for its series ''Elizabeth's Pirates''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/pirates/findout1.html|title=Elizabeth's Pirates|date=6 October 2011|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006013754/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/pirates/findout1.html|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Library of Australia]] includes The English Mercurie in its catalogue, among other apparently genuine historical documents from the Tudor and Stuart periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/421997|title=The English mercurie|first=Francis|last=Drake|date=31 March 1588|publisher=C. Barker|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikipedia page for the Spanish Armada cites The English Mercurie as evidence that 30,000 troops were waiting in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] for the fleet so they could mount their invasion&lt;ref&gt;[[Spanish Armada#cite note-35]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tichborne Claimant'''''  is a 1998 British dramatic film directed by [[David Yates]] and starring [[Robert Pugh]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[Robert Hardy]]. The film is based on the [[Tichborne case]], a historical case of [[identity theft]]. In 1854, Roger Tichborne, then-heir to the [[Tichborne baronets|Tichborne Baronetcy]] disappeared while traveling in [[South America]]. He was thought likely to have set sail with the ship ''Bella'', which was shipwrecked off the coast of the [[Empire of Brazil]], with no known survivors. In 1865, Thomas Castro (an Australian butcher), started claiming to be the missing heir. The dispute over his identity lasted to his death in 1898, and he is mostly known as "the Claimant". While Castro is currently considered an [[List of impostors|impostor]], doubts considering his real identity have persisted to the present. 

==Plot==
Based on the [[Tichborne case]], the film is set in the late 19th century. The film concerns a claimant to the [[Tichborne baronets|Tichborne Baronetcy]].

Lord Tichborne, the ninth-richest nobleman in England, disappears after a South American shipwreck. Some years later his erudite Afro-English valet, Bogle, is sent to investigate rumors that Tichborne survived and settled in Australia. An alcoholic ruffian answers Bogle's inquiries claiming to be the lost heir. Bogle suspects fraud, but conspires with the claimant to split the inheritance should the latter successfully pass himself off to friends, family and the courts. As the claimant returns to England to continue his charade, enough people confirm his identity to make both the claimant and Bogle believe that he just might be the rightful heir after all.

The '''Time of Remembrance and Reconciliation for Those Who Lost Their Lives during the Second World War''' (May 8 and May 9) is an annual international day of remembrance designated by [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/59/26 Resolution 59/26]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/remembranceday/|title = Time of Remembrance and Reconciliation for Those Who Lost Their Lives during the Second World War|date = n.d.|accessdate = 8 May 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on November 22, 2004. The resolution urges 'Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, non-governmental organizations and individuals' to pay tribute to the victims of [[World War II]].

'''''Buddy Bears''''' is the name given to painted, life-size [[fiberglass]] bear sculptures developed by  [[Klaus and Eva Herlitz]], in cooperation with  [[sculptor]] [[Roman Strobl]]. The raised arms of the standing Buddy Bears are aligned on the dissemination of friendliness and optimism, and thus mediate a positive mood.  "The Buddy Bear has become an unofficial ambassador for Germany and is a symbol of Berlin since 2001. The story of the Buddy Bears started with an artistic event in Berlin in 2001. Inspired by the idea of bringing art in the streets of a metropolis like the [[CowParade|cow parade]] in Zurich and New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azernews.az/culture/92771.html|title=Kapellhaus hosts "Buddy Bear" award ceremony|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Classic Buddy Bears presented far beyond Berlin’s city limits, the circle of United Buddy Bears came into being in 2002. The Exhibition travel around the world promoting  "peace, international understanding and tolerance among the nations, cultures and religions of this world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsspaces.com/Blogger/KastleWaserman/Article/ArtisticBearHugBerlinsBuddyBears.aspx ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first activities were presented as the ''Buddy Bear Berlin Show''. In 2001, artists painted approximately 350 bears to appear in the public domain, as decorative elements in the streets of Berlin. Four different bear designs (one standing on all four paws, one standing on two legs, one standing on its head and one in a sitting position) took part in this activity in the city centre of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fruitsq.com/gs/berlin/buddy.html Buddy Bears on the streets of Berlin], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, many of the bears were sold at auctions in aid of child relief organisations.  Nowadays, these Berlin Buddy Bears are exclusively presented on private premises, in front of hotels and embassies as well as in the foyers of various office buildings.

There have already been exhibitions of the original ''Buddy Bears''  — designed by local artists — in the cities of [[Shanghai]] (2004), [[Buenos Aires]] (2005) and [[St. Gallen]] / [[Switzerland]] (2006).

''United Buddy Bears'' is an international art exhibition with more than 140 two metre tall fiberglass bears. Under the motto: "We have to get to know each other better, it makes us understand one another better, trust each other more, and live together more peacefully", more than 140 countries acknowledged by the [[United Nations]] are represented, promoting  "tolerance, international understanding and the great concept of different nations and cultures living in peace and harmony". The bears stand "hand in hand" in a "peaceful circle" ('''The Art of Tolerance'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherryelsewhere.wordpress.com/tag/united-buddy-bears/|title=The Art of Tolerance|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The bears were on display between June and November 2002, in a circle around the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Around 1.5 million people visited this first exhibition.

On 6 November 2002, the bears were moved to new locations, including their respective countries [[Embassy|embassies]] in Berlin, or back to country that they were based on. Some of the bears were auctioned off to raise money for [[UNICEF]].

After the circle of "United Buddy Bears" had been such an overwhelming success in 2002, a new circle was created in 2003. The idea was to send the circle on a global tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/overview.html |title=Global Tour |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their global tour, the "United Buddy Bears" promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding. The circle changes every time it reaches a new city. This is not only due to the local conditions, but also to their constantly changing order, as the bears are always set up in alphabetic order, following the local language of the host country. This always leads to new and sometimes politically very interesting proximities.

Entry to the exhibitions is always free. This makes it possible for many school classes to visit the exhibitions in the morning — as part of their lessons — to explore and learn a lot about the culture, history, landscape, economy and music of all five continents in a playful manner. During past exhibitions more than 40 million visitors have already admired the colorful United Buddy Bears.

In every metropolis, the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are supported by the government, the foreign ministries, the mayors and the UNICEF organisations. Heads of state – for example the Japanese [[Prime Minister]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], the German [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Horst Köhler]] and First Lady of Egypt, [[Suzanne Mubarak]] as well as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors such as Sir [[Peter Ustinov]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080816050318/http://www.buddy-baer.com/typo3temp/pics/044b41489f.jpg ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackie Chan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiechankids.com/files/Buddy_Bear_Factory_Visit.htm |title=Jackie Chan and the Buddy Bears |publisher=Jackiechankids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiane Hörbiger]], [[Mia Farrow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6207/1664/1600/mia%20farrow.jpg |title=Mia Farrow and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Photos1.blogger.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris Berben]] and [[Ken Done]] have opened these exhibitions all over the world. ''United Buddy Bears Special Ambassador'' is the actress [[Dennenesch Zoudé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/berlin-20092010/message-of-greetings.html |title=Dennenesch Zoudé and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aid for children in need==
Buddy Bear activities and help for children in need have formed an inseparable unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} New ''United Buddy Bears'' are often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} designed to replace the previous unique sculpture of a particular country. Many countries are already represented with the third or fourth bear. The previous bears designed on behalf of the respective countries are generally sold at auctions.

{{As of | 2018 | September}} donations and selling ''Buddy Bears'' at auction had generated a total of [[Euro]] 2,300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/charity/charity-activities/overview.html|title=Buddy Bears -&amp;nbsp;Charity Activities - Overview|website=www.buddy-baer.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid of UNICEF and of local organisations helping children in need.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Involved artists==
In the early years, the Bears were designed by regional artists and Berlin celebrities for the exhibition ''Art in the City''.&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''Buddy Bär Berlin Show'', page 20, 21 ff, Neptun Verlag AG, CH-8280 Kreuzlingen, {{ISBN|3-85820-152-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 onwards, thanks to support from [[Lufthansa]], [[Air Berlin]] and the [[:de:Deutscher Hotel- und Gaststättenverband|Berlin Hotel Association]], artists from all five continents took part in the
international project ''United Buddy Bears''. More than 240 artists from over 150 countries have taken part in this project to date,&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''United Buddy Bears — The Art of Tolerance'', Page 52 – 357, Berlin, 2009/10, {{ISBN|978-3-00-029417-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as, for example [[Arik Brauer]], [[René Cadena Ayala]], [[:de:Hernando León|Hernando León]], [[Ibrahim Hazimeh]], [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]], [[SEO (artist)|Seo Soo-Kyoung]], [[:de:Helge Leiberg|Helge Leiberg]], [[Leda Luss Luyken]], [[Ludmila Seefried-Matějková]] – this is also echoed by the artist and UNICEF Australian National Ambassador, [[Ken Done]].

'''Henry Wallace "Wally" Kinnan''' (March 7, 1919 – November 22, 2002) was a decorated [[World War II]] hero, also was one of the first well known U.S. pioneer television broadcast meteorologists. Kinnan held [[American Meteorological Society]] Television Seal #3. Kinnan, who also served in World War II as a B-17 bomber pilot and then an Advanced Weather Officer attaining the rank of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] in the [[United States Air Force]] before resigning in March 1953 to enter broadcasting in Oklahoma.

==Personal and family background==
Kinnan was born to David V. Kinnan and Hazel Hamer. He met his wife, the former Marjorie G. Ahrendt at [[North High School (Columbus, Ohio)|North High School]] in Columbus, OH where they both attended. He has two sons, David E. Kinnan, Esq. and [[Timothy A. Kinnan]]. Both of his sons followed in his footsteps and joined the US Air Force. David was an [[United States Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps|Air Force JAG Officer]] and Tim went on to a full military career as a [[fighter pilot]] and [[general officer]].  Wally was a trumpet player with the [[Jimmy Dorsey]] Orchestra and [[Charlie Barnet]] during his undergraduate years at Ohio State out of love for music and as a way to help pay for school.

==Education==
Kinnan attended [[North High School (Columbus, Ohio)|North High School]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. After graduation he attended [[Ohio State University]] where he was a mechanical engineering undergraduate. He was a member of the [[Theta Tau|Theta Tau Fraternity]] and the Ohio State Football band.  He left Ohio State to enlist in the [[United States Army Air Forces]].  He studied Meteorology from 1947 to 1948 at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and took an advanced course in Tropical Meteorology in 1951 at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Military service in World War II==
Kinnan enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] on March 31, 1942 at [[Fort Hayes]], [[Columbus, Ohio]].  He began flight training as an aviation cadet in September 1942 and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] upon graduation from pilot training on  April 12, 1943.  While in casual status at [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Army Airfield]] he broke the fighter gunnery record.  He initially trained to be a fighter pilot, however, the Air Corps needed bomber pilots and Kinnan, like many others, were reassigned to bombers.  From there he went on to bomber transition and deployed overseas as a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] pilot with the [[429th Bombardment Squadron]], [[2d Operations Group|2nd Bomb Group]], based at [[Massicault Airfield]], [[Tunisia]], as part of the [[Twelfth Air Force]].

===Combat pilot===
Kinnan's aircraft was shot down over [[Eygalières]], [[Vichy France]] on August 17, 1943.  He sustained shrapnel injuries which were compounded when he bailed out too close to the ground and made hard impact.  His injuries prevented him from attempting evasion and he was captured.

Kinnan’s recount of his bail-out of his bomber aircraft was harrowing even in the telling.  After taking fire that damaged the aircraft, alighting the #4 engine and wounding the other pilot; the crew immediately began bail-out procedures.  Kinnan, the only pilot at the control yoke, maintained as much control of the aircraft as possible to ensure that his crew members were all safely out.  Once they were out he put the aircraft into as stable a configuration that he could to maintain altitude and attitude.  But the badly damaged aircraft, on fire, lost the right wing and continued to descend. In order to bail-out, Kinnan had to make his way to the nose hatch. However, the erratic flight of the damaged B-17 required him to crawl and pull himself along.

As Kinnan was crawling, his parachute caught on some part of the aircraft which left Wally in frantic state trying to unbind himself and his parachute from the rapidly descending aircraft. During this process he had unbuckled his parachute and was never able to put it back on properly. Finally able to free himself he launched himself from the airplane, up and out the normally facing downward hatch and pulled his parachute's ripcord.

Kinnan and M/Sgt Henry Petroski were the last two to exit, falling amidst the burning debris of their aircraft. Because he had not been able to properly restrap the parachute on, when it opened it twisted him up causing a severe back injury. This, plus the wounds he had sustained from the flak bursts while still in the aircraft made it impossible for him to evade capture once he was on the ground.

===Prisoner of war===
He was first taken to a Hospital in [[Arles]]. Kinnan strongly credits his German captors in France with great humanity and care of his injuries. However, after just only over a week in France they transferred him to another hospital that was part of [[Dulag Luft]] near Frankfurt, where his treatment was much more stern. Once processed he was transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]] near Sagan, now Żagań in Poland, in mid-September 1943. The reality of the situation in the Stalag system was even more dire and cruel, where life often hinged on having enough to eat.

Near the end of 1943, there were many new prisoners coming into the camp. Kinnan persuaded the German captors to find some decent musical instruments so they could put on some organized musical programs. Kinnan and a group of Who’s Who’s of music that were all interred in German Camps founded a band called the ''Sagan Serenaders''. Kinnan and Pilot Officer Leonard Whiteley of the British Royal Air Force organized and led the group. The Serenaders received donated musical instruments from aid organizations and whatsoever the German captors could scrounge up. One instrument was an unusual trombone that Wally described as a plumber's nightmare.  They 'sacrificed' this instrument so that other POW's could turn it into a still.

Included in this group were pianist [[John Bunch]], who would later play with bandleaders [[Woody Herman]] and [[Benny Goodman]]; Tiger Ward; John Brady; Hi Bevins; Nick Nagorka and trumpeter Vince Shank who later would play with [[Russ Morgan]]. The Serenaders had four trumpets, two trombones, five saxophones, and four rhythm instruments. Wally Kinnan once said, "We were beginning to talk seriously about taking the band on tour in the U.S. when and if we could manage to survive the war." The 1963 motion picture ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', which greatly depicts some of the Serenders and Kinnan's experiences, showed a choir singing while the escape started but in actuality, it was the Serenaders.  The Serenaders contributed to the effort regularly by practicing their instruments to mask the sound of digging.

Kinnan's youngest son, USAF Lt. Gen. [[Timothy Kinnan]], relates that his father, through encoded letters to his wife Marjorie, informed the [[United States Department of War|United States War Department]] that fifty of the escapees were recaptured by the Germans and executed by firing squad. The letters were decoded by the U.S. government and then sent on to Kinnan's wife.

Towards the end of the war as the [[Red Army]] were nearing Stalag Luft III, the Germans forced marched 12,000 prisoners to [[Stalag VII-A]] in Bavaria. When the German guards marched the prisoners, including the band members, out of the camp, some assumed they were being marched into a field for execution. However, the forced march proceeded through a blizzard to Spremberg almost 200 miles away. Many of the POWs died during the trek. Food was scarce and Bunch credited Kinnan with saving his life by sharing a potato. After the arrival of General [[George S. Patton]]’s [[United States Army Central|Third Army]], on April 29, 1945, Kinnan and his fellow POWs in Stalag VII-A were liberated. Kinnan would then spend his processing time at Camp Lucky Strike before being sent stateside. Official records have initial capture date as August 17, 1943 with official repatriation to the United States as of June 30, 1945.

==Post-war service==
After being repatriated, Kinnan attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and received his degree in Meteorology. After the creation of the [[United States Air Force]] in 1947, Kinnan became a USAF Weather Officer.

During the [[Korean War]], Kinnan served in weather service assignments on Kwajalein Atoll, Guam and Hawaii.  He was a pioneer of the Severe Storm Center of the [[Air Weather Service]]. Deciding a career in broadcast meteorology was an exciting field, he resigned his commission from the Air Force in 1953 to become one of the earliest on-camera meteorologists.

==Career in Meteorology as "The Weatherman"==

Kinnan, who was affably nicknamed "The Weatherman", was a well-known personality in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].  Kinnan worked alongside [[sports commentator|sports anchor]] [[Jim Graner]] at [[WKYC-TV]] in Cleveland;&lt;ref name="WKYC History PDF"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|title=History of WKYC-TV 1948-2010|url=http://www.wkyc.com/company/about_us/history_of_wkyc.pdf|work=[[WKYC|WKYC.com]]|publisher=WKYC-TV, Inc|accessdate=August 25, 2010|quote=1969: 'Newsday 90' hits the airwaves with anchors Virgil Dominic, weatherman Wally Kinnan and [[Jim Graner]] on sports...|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, from 1978 to 1980, he worked at station [[WTSP]] in Tampa, FL.

Kinnan was one of the first three meteorologists, joining [[Francis K. Davis]] and [[Kenneth H. Jehn]], to earn the "Seal of Approval" from the [[American Meteorological Society]]. Wally often told the story of how they drew straws to determine who would be the first, second, and third meteorologist to earn the seal. Kinnan was number 3, while Davis and Jehn were numbers 1 and 2, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ametsoc.org/memdir/seallist/get_listoftv.cfm List of AMS Seal of Approval holders]&lt;/ref&gt;

He later went on to serve on the Board of the American Meteorological Society for Radio and Television Broadcasting and the Committee on Industrial Meteorology.

He was also the founding Director of the Franklin Institute Weather Center with Col. [[Robert C. Miller]] of the Fawbush-Miller Tornado team.

Kinnan died at the age of 83 of an aortic aneurysm on Friday, November 22, 2002 in Houston, Texas.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia  [http://broadcastpioneers.com] posthumously inducted Kinnan into their Hall of Fame in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6036">A '''watchnight service''' is a late-night [[Christian]] [[church service]]. In many different [[Christian denominations|Christian traditions]], such as those of Baptists, Methodists and Pentecostals, watchnight services are held late on [[New Year's Eve]], and ends after midnight. This provides the opportunity for Christians to review the year that has passed and [[Repentance (theology)|make confession]], and then prepare for the year ahead by [[Christian prayer|praying]] and [[New Year's resolution|resolving]].&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Ewing Ritchie|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bV4MAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=watchnight+service&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sc76TtPCLuq02gXA0uCJAg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=watchnight%20service&amp;f=false| title = The Religious Life of London|year=1870|publisher = [[Tinsley Brothers]]|accessdate = 28 December 2011|quote=At A WATCH-NIGHT SERVICE: Methodism has one special institution. Its lovefeasts are old-old as Apostolic times. Its class meetings are the confessional in its simplest and most unobjectionable type, but in the institution of the watch-night it boldly struck out a new path for itself. In publicly setting apart the last fleeting moments of the old year and the first of the new to penitence, and special prayer, and stirring appeal, and fresh resolve, it has set an example which other sects are preparing to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[service of worship|services]] often include singing, praying, exhorting, and [[preaching]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna M. Lawrence|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=94bTO6O2bDAC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=watchnight+service&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PtL6TpuuNMyAsgKawtmwAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=watchnight%20service&amp;f=false| title = One Family Under God: Love, Belonging, and Authority in Early Transatlantic Methodism|date=5 May 2011|publisher = [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|accessdate = 28 December 2011|quote=In 1740, Wesley started watch-night services for the coal miners of the Kingswood area, offering this nocturnal worship as a godly alternative to spending their evenings in ale-houses. The watch-night services consisted of singing, praying, exhorting, and preaching for a number of hours. Wesley meant to establish it as a monthly practice, always at full moon to keep the meeting well lit. In America, this service often supplanted times of traditional drunken revelry, like New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodism==
{{further|Wesley Covenant Prayer}}
Following the lead of the Moravian Brethren who began having "watch" services in 1733, the founder of the [[Methodist Church]], [[John Wesley]], originated watch night services in 1740, sometimes calling them ''[[Wesley Covenant Prayer|Covenant Renewal Services]]''.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Methodist"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612| title = Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 28 December 2011|quote=Methodism founder John Wesley originated Watch Night services in the mid-18th century, sometimes calling them Covenant Renewal services. The original services were spontaneous prayer services designed to deepen the spiritual life of Methodists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The services provided Methodist Christians with a godly alternative to times of drunken revelry, such as [[Christmas Eve]] and [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt; Today, a Methodist watchnight service includes singing, spontaneous [[Christian prayer|prayers]] and [[Testimony#Religion|testimonials]], as well as scripture readings; the liturgy for this service is found in ''[[Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]]''.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOW"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612| title = Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 28 December 2011|quote=The service is loosely constructed with singing, spontaneous prayers and testimonials, and readings, including the Covenant Renewal service from The United Methodist Book of Worship (pp. 288-294).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presbyterianism==
In the [[Church of Scotland]], the Watchnight service is a popular ceremony marking the beginning of [[Christmas Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article766847.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Christmas Eve Christmas Day and Boxing Day Services | date=2005-12-17 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known as [[Midnight Mass]] elsewhere.

==African-American churches==
Watchnight service has added significance and history in the [[Black church|African-American community]] in the United States, since many slaves were said to have gathered in churches on New Year's Eve, in 1862, to await news and confirmation of the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, on January 1, 1863.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612| title = Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 28 December 2011|quote=Watch Night took on even more significance during the Civil War. When President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, it was to take effect Jan. 1, 1863. Slaves sat up the night before, waiting for their freedom to arrive at midnight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglicanism and Catholicism==
In [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] or [[Roman Catholic]] churches, this ceremony is often replicated in the form of a [[Midnight Mass]] or [[Eucharist]].

}}{{Politics of Zimbabwe}}

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Zimbabwe]] on 31 March 2005 to elect members to the Zimbabwe [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|House of Assembly]]. All of the 120 elected seats in the 150-seat House of Assembly were up for election. (In addition, there were 20 members appointed by the President and ten elected by the traditional chiefs, who mostly support the government. Electoral colleges for the election of 10 chiefs to the parliament were to be held on 8 April.)

The ruling [[Zimbabwe African National Union &amp;ndash; Patriotic Front]] party (ZANU-PF) of President [[Robert Mugabe]] won the elections with an increased majority against the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change (pre-2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC). ZANU-PF won 78 seats to the MDC's 41, with one independent. (In the [[Zimbabwe legislative election, 2000|2000 election]], the ZANU-PF won 62 seats to the MDC's 57). According to the [[Zimbabwe Election Commission]], ZANU-PF polled nearly 60% of the vote, an increase of 11% over the 2000 results. The MDC's vote fell 9 percent to 39 percent. As a result of the election, ZANU-PF had a two-thirds majority in the legislature, allowing the government to change the Constitution.

As the results became clear the MDC denounced what it called "the sham elections," which it said had been marked by massive electoral fraud. "The elections cannot be judged to be free and fair," an MDC statement said. "The distorted nature of the pre-election playing field and the failure to address core democratic deficits precluded a free and fair election." The MDC claimed it would have won 90 seats if the vote had been free and fair.

A detailed account of the MDC's allegations of electoral fraud can be seen at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050404221407/http://www.mdczimbabwe.org/Elections/reject.htm MDC website]. [[Sokwanele]], a Zimbabwean underground pro-democracy movement, also released a report entitled [https://web.archive.org/web/20051219224116/http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/whathappenedonthursnight_5april2005.html “What happened on Thursday night”]. Their report focuses specifically on the time after voting until results were announced.

Full constituency results of the elections can be seen at [http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/z/zimbabwe/ Adam Carr's Electoral Archive] and at [[Results of the Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005]].

==Results==
{{Zimbabwe parliamentary election, 2005}}
The results showed the same pattern as in 2000. The MDC won virtually all the seats in the main cities, [[Harare]] and [[Bulawayo]], where [[civil society]] organisations are relatively strong and able to prevent electoral manipulation. The MDC also won a majority of seats in the southern region of [[Matabeleland]], where the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] people, once supporters of [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African Peoples Union|ZAPU]], continue to oppose the [[Shona people|Shona]]-dominated ZANU-PF. But in rural [[Mashonaland]], in central and northern Zimbabwe, where the majority of the population lives, ZANU-PF won all but one seat.

In some notable local results, [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], speaker of the previous parliament, and tipped at one time to succeed Mugabe but recently fallen from grace, lost his seat Kwe-kwe to the MDC's Blessing Chebundo. [[Jonathan Moyo]], an independent, won the Tsholotsho constituency from the MDC. Another significant loss for the MDC was Chimanimani, contested by [[Roy Bennett (politician)|Roy Bennett]]'s wife Heather.

The Zimbabwe Election Support Network, which had some 6,000 observers in the 8,000 polling stations, says that some 10% of would-be voters were turned away, either because their names were not on the electoral roll, they did not have the right identity papers, or they were in the wrong constituency.

==Allegations of malpractice==

===Pre-election===
For the 22 weeks leading up to the elections, Sokwanele provides a weekly breakdown of the Zanu-PF government's non-compliance with the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) Protocol on Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, of which Zimbabwe is a signatory (see the Mauritius Watch articles on their archive page)[https://web.archive.org/web/20050705075622/http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/mwatch_archive.html].

The opposition MDC and [[Jonathan Moyo]] have alleged that voters have been threatened with starvation or violence if they fail to support Zanu-PF. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050311214359/http://www.theindependent.co.zw/news/2005/March/Friday11/1831.html] [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=qw111061602454B251]
No-go areas have been declared in Bindura. [http://www.daily-news.co.za/content_pull%5Cart_pull.asp?cat=bre&amp;link=..\articles\2005\03\13\loc_13032005_00113.asp]

Zanu-PF candidates have taken over control of grain stocks in Manicaland and Masvingo from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) and are vetting beneficiaries. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411020104/http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?articleid=199862]

Muchauraya said in Chipinge South, Enock Porusingazi was issuing badges inscribed "Election 2005" to supporters attending his rallies. The badges are then used as a ticket to buy maize.

On 8 March at Betura village, ward 16, more than 2 000 people were denied access to buy grain for allegedly failing to produce the badges. Only 200 people who had attended Zanu-PF rallies over the weekend had the badges and were allowed to buy maize.

===Vote-counting===
Zimbabwe's main opposition party said an investigation indicates massive electoral fraud in at least 30 seats won by the ruling Zanu-PF party. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411230410/http://www.mg.co.za:80/articlepage.aspx?area=/zim_elections/zim_news/&amp;articleid=200955]

The [[Movement for Democratic Change (pre-2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] said in 11 races the winning Zanu-PF candidate got more votes in the official returns than the government's own electoral commission said were cast in those races.

In each case, the MDC said its candidate had an unassailable lead, polling more than half the official total of votes cast. However, the official returns showed 183,000 more votes than the electoral commission said were cast.

MDC spokesperson Paul Themba Nyathi said the MDC limited its analysis to the 30 seats because the electoral commission refused to release figures for other races, a decision he said "indicates widespread irregularities" in those other areas.

==Observer mission statements==
''"It is the view of the mission that the 2005 parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe reflect the free will of the people of Zimbabwe"'' said South African Labour Minister Membathisi Mdladlana, who led the [[South African]] government observer mission for the elections.

Mdladlana said the elections on Thursday "by and large" conformed to election guidelines adopted by southern African leaders last year for holding a democratic vote.

''"Let me congratulate the people of Zimbabwe for holding a peaceful, credible and well-organised election which we feel reflects the will of the people"'' said [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]], the South African cabinet minister that led the 55-member, 11-country observer mission from the [[Southern African Development Community]].

Mlambo Ngcuka said the observer mission had asked the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to provide evidence to support their claims of discrepancies in 32 of the 120 constituencies.

''"We have received complaints and asked for information. We still don't have it. There is not much more we can do."'' she said.

==Timetable and voters roll==

The election date was set by President [[Robert Mugabe]] on 1 February. 31 March was a public holiday to enable easier voter participation. The parliament was dissolved on 30 March, one day before the elections. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718153744/http://www.zimbabweherald.com/index.php?id=40304&amp;pubdate=2005-02-02] The voters' roll was closed on 4 February. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051028181331/http://www.zimbabweherald.com/index.php?id=40322] Nomination courts sat on 18 February to receive names of those intending to contest in the polls ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050308173449/http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/elec/050225herald.asp?sector=ELEC results]).

The voters roll is the cornerstone of "one person – one vote." Attempts to verify this have been extremely difficult to carry out because of obstruction and non-co-operation from the Zimbabwe Registrar General. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307232958/http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/elec/050123fz.asp?sector=ELEC]

The Registrar General refused to release the roll in electronic form, supported by judgments from the Supreme Court, necessitating any analysis to work from a paper copy. Electoral Law is very specific in that the roll must be readily and freely available to any person, however it took two years to obtain such a copy.

In February, South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] conceded that Zimbabwe's voters roll was defective and needed to be looked at. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203718/http://www.allzimbabwe.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1246]

Only a single MDC constituency managed to complete the audit ahead of the deadline for objections to the voters' roll – a month before the poll. [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=vn20050320105304963C357153]

In that constituency, 64 percent of people in one densely populated block in Harare North, are not known at the addresses given on the voters' roll.

Tens of thousands of former workers on white-owned farms were deprived of their votes in the March election. [http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl?archive/ar/ar_ze_023_2_eng.txt] The workers were expelled from their homes on farms along with their employers. Thus they did not have the necessary wad of official documents required to register as voters. In addition, many could not afford to travel to their original farm constituencies to verify their details on voters' rolls. Recently enacted laws demand that potential voters provide proof of residence before they can register. Rural Zimbabweans either produce letters from their headman or chief or from their farm employer as proof of residence.

==Participating parties==

The main parties participating are:

* The [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]]. ZANU-PF forms the current government and is led by the Zimbabwean president, [[Robert Mugabe]]. Both it and the opposition party expect ZANU-PF to end up with the majority of seats in parliament.
* The main opposition party is the [[Movement for Democratic Change (pre-2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]], led by [[Morgan Tsvangirai]]
* [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Ndonga]] – spokesperson Reketai Semwayo
* [[Zimbabwe People's Democratic Party]]
* [[Zimbabwe Youth in Alliance]]

Zanu-PF is using claimed interference of [[Tony Blair]], the British prime minister, and United States president [[George W. Bush]] in Zimbabwean politics, as an election issue. ZANU-PF is also stressing the benefits obtained through its policy of [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform]].

The MDC sees the main issues as being jobs, food, peace, affordable AIDS drugs and honest, competent emphatic leadership. Their rallying cry is ''Change!'', and their symbol is an open hand.

==Background==

'''Voter education'''
In accordance with an Act of Parliament:

* The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) controls all voter education.
* They will supply materials for use in voter education.
* Non-Zimbabwean citizens are strictly banned from voter education.
* No foreign funding allowed for voter education, unless donated through ZEC.
* Anyone performing voter education (from approved materials only) must supply full contact details and address, as well as funding sources.
* Fines and imprisonment face transgressors.

'''Polling stations'''

High Court Judge George Chiweshe, who chairs the recently established Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, stated that 8227 polling stations will be set up in all of the country's 10 provinces – more than double the number used in previous elections. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050409083406/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_1675516,00.html]

Harare alone is expected to have 522 polling stations, up from 167 polling stations in the presidential elections.
For the first time since independence from white minority rule in 1980, Zimbabwe will be holding elections on one day as opposed to two. Ballot counting will also take place at individual polling stations and new, translucent ballot boxes will replace wooden ones used in previous elections.

Voting must take place at these polling stations: any Zimbabweans living overseas must therefore have registered to be in the electoral roll by 4 February, and must vote in Zimbabwe. Requirements such as these are not uncommon in democratic countries.

==Foreign observers==

Zimbabwe ratified new [[Southern African Development Community]] rules [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024185927/http://www.zimonline.co.za/documentfull.asp?ID=9192] in August 2004 governing principles and guidelines on elections; however, no reports on Zimbabwe's compliance have been issued by the body. One of the stipulations is that SADC monitors be invited 90 days before the poll.

By 4 February, an SADC team tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that Zimbabwe complies with the regional protocol had yet to receive permission to visit. [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20050204064042901C914208]

Non-government organisations (NGOs), among them [[Amnesty International]], 32 Nigerian NGOs and 17 from Zimbabwe, have expressed concern about the continued abuses of human rights in the country. [[African Union]] Chairman, President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], has been urged to prevail on Zimbabwe, to fully implement recommendations of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR), on improving human rights conditions. The Commission made a fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe in June 2002, and the Union's findings and recommendations were adopted in January 2005, at its summit in [[Abuja]].

''"The majority of human rights concerns documented by the fact-finding mission in 2002 remain serious problems today,"'' the NGOs said.

On 19 February 2005, 32 nations were invited by President Robert Mugabe to observe the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050409083425/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_1665002,00.html]

* Domestic poll observers require a 'registration fee' of US$ (in local currency) – approximately the monthly minimum wage.
* Approved Zimbabwean observers only announced two days before the elections [https://web.archive.org/web/20050325000703/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1].
* International observers (except South Africa) are required to pay US$300, while South African observers pay US$100. Of international observer teams, only South African ones have sufficient personnel and resources to cover rural areas.

Other organisations among those invited are the [[Zimbabwe Council of Churches]], [[Law Society of Zimbabwe]], [[Zimbabwe Election Support Network]], [[Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights]], Affirmative Action Group, Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, Centre for Peace Initiatives in Southern Africa and the Southern African Institute for Democracy and Good Governance.

[[Aziz Pahad]], deputy foreign minister for South Africa, said the country has been invited to observe the Zimbabwean poll in at least five different capacities.

It has been invited as a member of SADC, as chair of the organ on politics, defence and security, and as a neighbouring country. The ruling [[African National Congress]] has also been asked to send an observer team, while parliament has set up a multi-party delegation.

Five members of South Africa's governing African National Congress party arrived in Harare on 10 March headed by James Motlatsi, the first foreign observers.

The 20-member South African parliamentary observer mission led by ANC chief whip Mbulelo Goniwe left for Zimbabwe on 14 March, and will return to South Africa on 3 April. On 18 April, the [[Independent Democrats]] Member of Parliament and mission member Vincent Gore withdrew, saying that since their arrival in Harare, the mission had been plagued by inefficiency, bad planning "and wasted time".

There is also a South African government delegation, led by Labour Minister Membathisi Mdladlana, which arrived 15 March. [http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=283&amp;fArticleId=2448669]

The 50-member SADC observer mission including 10 South African delegates headed by Minerals and Energy Minister [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]] (later Deputy President), spokesperson South African foreign affairs official Nomfanelo Kota, left on 15 March.

The [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU)—a member of the South African ruling party [[African National Congress|alliance]]— sent a fact-finding mission in October 2004 to talk to the [[Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions]] (ZCTU) and research conditions for a fair poll. They were deported from Zimbabwe within hours after police broke up a meeting between them and ZCTU.

On 2 February 2005, a second mission led by [[Zwelinzima Vavi]], Secretary-General of COSATU, was turned back [https://web.archive.org/web/20050212192421/http://www.finance24.com:80/Finance/Companies/0,,1518-24_1656338,00.html] at [[Harare]] airport, charged under Section 18A of the Immigration Act which relates to prohibited immigrants. In response, [[George Bizos]], a respected human rights lawyer, said that all [[Southern African Development Community]] members are allowed to enter Zimbabwe without applying for a visa. [http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/southern_africa/0,2172,97066,00.html]

After a meeting the next day between the unions in South Africa Cosatu spokesperson Patrick Craven said ''"It is quite clear at the moment as things stand that there cannot be free and fair elections"''.

ZCTU requested that an independent electoral commission be established and international observers be allowed in the country, and the government also needed to scrap strict laws restricting the opposition's access to the media and barring it from holding public rallies and meetings without police permission.

Under the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), it is a requirement for organisers of public meetings to first notify the police of the intention to gather. It is an offence, under the same law, for more than five people to meet without notifying the police, who have the prerogative to permit or deny permission to hold public meetings. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050319045800/http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2005/March/March17/8035.shtml] ZTCU suggested that the date of the elections be postponed. ZCTU themselves have been barred from observing the election. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051124211159/http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2005/March/March17/8014.shtml]

[[Amnesty International]] has said that Zanu-PF has used threats and intimidation against opposition supporters ahead of the elections which now cannot be free and fair. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050316082118/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Shaik_trial/0,,2-7-1708_1676734,00.html]

==Candidates==

[[Roy Bennett (politician)|Roy Bennett]]'s wife Heather Bennett intended to stand for Chimanimani rural district after the nomination court refused papers filed on behalf of her jailed husband. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050418133503/http://africantears.netfirms.com/roy/] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050409083347/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_1664724,00.html]

However, on 15 March Zimbabwe's new Electoral Court ruled he could contest parliamentary elections. Nomination would be accepted on 4 April, while polling would take place on 30 April. An appeal by the government reversed this. The appeal was not contested by the MDC or the Bennetts. They considered that voters would be safer polling on the same day as the rest of the country, where a delay would allow Zanu-PF to concentrate efforts in that district. The MDC has never won a by-election.

Roy Bennett's application for release before the elections, on the basis of good behaviour and dissolution of the parliament that ordered the incarceration, failed. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050315002115/http://www.theindependent.co.zw/news/2005/March/Friday11/1822.html]
