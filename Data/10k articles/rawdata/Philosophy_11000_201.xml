      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">While the [[Africa]]n continent is vast and its peoples diverse, certain standards of beauty and correctness in artistic expression and physical appearance are held in common among various African societies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = M. | year = 1989 | title = African visual arts from an art historical perspective | url = | journal = African Studies Review | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 55–103 | doi=10.2307/523970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken collectively, these values and standards have been characterised as comprising a generally accepted '''African aesthetic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Welsh-Asante|first=Kariamu |title=The African Aesthetic:  Keeper of the Traditions (Contributions in Afro- and African-American Studies) |year=1993 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-26549-5 |page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cool==

In ''African Art in Motion'', African art scholar and [[Yale]] professor [[Robert Farris Thompson]] turns his attention to cool in both the African and [[African-American]] contexts:   
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mind of an elder within the body of the young is suggested by the striking African custom of dancing "hot" with a "cool" unsmiling face. This quality seems to have haunted [[Ten Rhyne]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] in 1673 and it struck the imagination of an early observer of strongly African-influenced dancing in [[Louisiana]] in the early nineteenth century, who noted "thumping ecstasy" and "intense solemnity of mien." The mask of the cool, or facial serenity, has been noted at many points in Afro-American history:  
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is interesting that what remains a spiritual principle in some parts of Africa and the rare African-influenced portions of the modern U.S.A., such as [[Tidelands|tidewater]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], becomes in the mainline [[African American|Afro-American]] urban culture an element of contemporary street behavior:
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Negro]] boys…have a 'cool' way of walking in which the upper trunk and pelvis rock fore and aft while the head remains stable with the eyes looking straight ahead. The…walk is quite slow, and the Negroes take it as a way of 'strutting' or 'showing off'....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
The cool style of male walking in the United States is called ''bopping'' ...  Mystical coolness in Africa has changed in urban African-American assertions of independent power. But the functions, to heal and gather strength, partially remain. And the name ''cool'' [''kule''], remains. And the body is still played in two patterns, one stable, the other active, part energy and part mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson|first=Robert Farris |authorlink=Robert Farris Thompson| title=African Art in Motion |year=1974 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-02703-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14859">{{Advaita}}
'''''Ajātivāda''''' is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosopher [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the [[Brahman|Absolute]] is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|unreal]], and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'',{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} applying the philosophical concept of "ajāta" to the inquiry of Brahman,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} showing that Brahman wholly transcends the conventional understanding of being and becoming. The concept is also found in Madhyamaka Buddhism, as the theory of nonorigination.{{sfn|King|1995|p=138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC |year=1981|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0310-7|pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Ajātivāda:
* "A" means "not", or "non" as in Ahimsa, non-harm
* "Jāti" means "creation" or "origination{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}
* "Vāda" means "doctrine"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Taken together "ajātivāda" means "the Doctrine of no-origination"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} or non-creation.

The concept of "ajāta" was borrowed by Gaudapada from Madhyamika Buddhism,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which uses the term [[Anutpada|"anutpāda"]]:{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}
* "An" also means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Gaudapada===
{{See also|Prajnaparamita}}

"Ajātivāda" is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal as it is transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada borrowed the concept of "ajāta" from Nagajurna's  Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also used in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is [[kenshō]], seeing into the true nature of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are [[Śūnyatā|without self-substance]]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}} Another well-known use is in [[Bankei Yōtaku|Bankei's]] "Unborn".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=316}}}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} In the ''Mandukya Karika'', Gaudapada's commentary on the ''Mandukya Upanishad'', Gaudapada sets forth his perspective. According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', "illusion",{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} apparently existing but ultimately not real.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}}

In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

===Ramana Maharshi===
{{Main|Ramana Maharshi}}

Ramana Maharshi gave a translation in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] of Gaudapada’s ''Mandukya Upanishad Karika'', chapter two, verse thirty-two:
{{quote|There is no creation, no destruction, no bondage, no longing to be freed from bondage, no striving to be free [from bondage], nor anyone who has attained [freedom from bondage]. Know that this is the ultimate truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/08/ajata.html David Godman, ''Ajata'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|David Godman: "This rendering appears as ‘Stray verse nine’ in Collected Works and as ‘Bhagavan 28’ in Guru Vachaka Kovai. Variations of this verse can also be found in the [[Amritabindu Upanishad]] (verse 10), Atma Upanishad (verse 30) and Vivekachudamani (verse 574)."&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata" /&gt;}}}}

According to David Godman, the ajata doctrine implies that since the world was never created, there are also no [[jiva]]s within it who are striving for or attaining liberation. Ramana Maharshi regarded this as "the ultimate truth."&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata" /&gt;

==Levels of truth==
{{See also|Two truths doctrine|Trikaya|Essence-Function}}

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} namely ''saṃvṛti-satya'', "the empirical truth",&lt;ref group=web name="EB-samvriti"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520880/samvrti-satya Encyclopædia Britannica, ''saṃvṛti-satya'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''paramārtha-satya'', "ultimate truth".&lt;ref group=web name="EB-samvriti" /&gt; According to Plott, 
{{quote|"Ajativada is nothing but [an] extreme and exhaustive application of an extreme version of the distinction between the paramartha satya and the samvrtti satya."{{sfn|Plott|1980|p=283}}}}

The distinction between the two truths (''satyadvayavibhāga'') was fully expressed by the [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka-school]]. In [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' it is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') with emptiness (''śūnyatā''):
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=296, 298, verse 24:8-10}}}}

Shankara uses [[Advaita Vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
# {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
# {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

It is at the level of the highest truth (''paramārtha'') that there is no origination.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} Gaudapada states that, from the absolute standpoint, not even "non-dual" exists.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

==Advaita Vedanta and Madhyamaka Buddhism==
Many scholars, states Richard King, designate Madhyamaka Buddhism as ''Ajativada''.{{sfn|King|1995|p=138}} The concept ''Ajati'', he adds, exists in both Vedanta and Buddhism, but they are different in the following way:
{{quote|1. [[Anutpada|"There is no birth."]] (Madhyamaka), and
2. "There is an [[Brahman|Unborn]]." (Advaita Vedānta.){{sfn|King|1995|p=138}}}}

Ajativada in Madhyamaka refers to its doctrine that things neither originate nor is there cessation.{{Sfn|Murti|2008|p=343}} This is also called the theory of non-origination of Madhyamaka.{{Sfn|Murti|2008|p=343}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC |year=1981|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0310-7|pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5174">In popular culture, the '''Bro Code''' is a friendship [[etiquette]] to be followed among men or, more specifically, among members of the [[Bro (subculture)|bro subculture]]. The term has been popularized by [[Barney Stinson]], a character from the television show ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''. Katherine Connor Martin, head of content creation at [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]], recognized Stinson as "the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |title=The rise of the portmanbro |last1=Martin |first1=Katherine Connor |date=October 9, 2013 |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oc7U2FBb?url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==The notion==

=== Early references ===
The notion of an unwritten set of rules that govern the relationship between male friends is present in popular culture at least since 1991. In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Stranded]]", which aired on November 27 that year, Jerry Seinfeld says the following monologue, in one of his stand-up bits:

{{Quote|text=All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  '''This is the male code'''.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are [...]|source="The Stranded"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheStranded.html|title=The Stranded|publisher=SeinfeldScripts|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;|character=Jerry Seinfeld|title=''Seinfeld''}}

=== "Bros before hoes" ===
"[[wikt:bros before hoes|Bros before hoes]]" (that is, "friends before women") is a well-known, vulgar slang expression about how men should not abandon their male friends in order to pursue or embark on relationships with women.

The "bros before hoes" expression is often regarded as the "golden rule" of male friendship, and it has been common slang at least since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/bros-before-hoes|title=What does bros before hoes mean? bros before hoes Definition. Meaning of bros before hoes. |publisher=OnlineSlangDictionary.com |access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] in "[[A Benihana Christmas]]", and was later popularized by Barney Stinson.

[[Image:Samurai.png|thumb|Japanese samurai in armor, 1860s. Photograph by [[Felice Beato]]]]

{{nihongo|'''''Bushidō'''''|[[wiktionary:武士道|武士道]]||"the way of warriors"}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] collective term for the many codes of honour and ideals that dictated the ''[[samurai]]'' way of life,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Religions|last=Matthews|first=Warren|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=9780495603856|location=Belmont, CA|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; loosely analogous to the concept of [[chivalry]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bushido, The Soul of Japan|last=Nitobe|first=Inazo|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2010|isbn=9784770050113|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The "way" originates from the ''samurai'' moral values, most commonly stressing some combination of sincerity, frugality, loyalty, [[martial arts]] mastery, and honour until death. Born from [[Edo Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] during times of peace in the [[Edo period]] (1600–1878) and following [[Confucius|Confucian]] texts, while also being influenced by [[Shinto]] and [[Zen Buddhism]], allowing the violent existence of the ''samurai'' to be tempered by wisdom, patience and serenity. ''Bushidō'' developed between the 16th and 20th centuries, debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century, although some scholars have noted that the term ''bushidō'' itself is "rarely attested in pre-modern literature".&lt;ref&gt;"The Zen of Japanese Nationalism", by Robert H. Shart, in ''Curators of the Buddha'', edited by Donald Lopez, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], some aspects of warrior values became formalized into Japanese feudal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuraimaster.com/tokugawa-shogunate/ "Tokugawa shogunate"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bushidō'' was first used in Japan during the 17th century in [[Kōyō Gunkan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Japanese Political Thought of Uchimura Kanzō (1861-1930): Synthesizing Bushidō, Christianity, Nationalism, and Liberalism |first=Hiroko |last=Willcock |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |year=2008 |isbn=077345151X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rfYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=koyo+gunkan+bushido&amp;dq=koyo+gunkan+bushido |quote=Koyo gunkan is the earliest comprehensive extant work that provides a notion of Bushido as a samurai ethos and the value system of the samurai tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikegami, Eiko, The Taming of the Samurai, Harvard University Press, 1995. p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=武士道 第一章 武士道という語の登場|trans-title=Bushido Chapter I Appearance of the word Bushido |first=Kazuhiko |last=Kasaya |publisher=NTT publishing |year=2014 |isbn=4757143222 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivQLopD7JJsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%E7%94%B2%E9%99%BD%E8%BB%8D%E9%91%91%E3%80%80%E6%AD%A6%E5%A3%AB%E9%81%93#v=onepage&amp;q=%E7%94%B2%E9%99%BD%E8%BB%8D%E9%91%91%E3%80%80%E6%AD%A6%E5%A3%AB%E9%81%93&amp;f=false |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not come into common usage until after the 1899 publication of [[Nitobe Inazō]]'s ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Friday, Karl F. "Bushidō or Bull? A Medieval Historian's Perspective on the Imperial Army and the Japanese Warrior Tradition". ''The History Teacher'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (May 1994), pp. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Bushido'' (1899), Nitobe wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bushidō, then, is the code of moral principles which the [[samurai]] were required or instructed to observe&amp;nbsp;... More frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten&amp;nbsp;... It was an organic growth of decades and centuries of military career. In order to become a samurai this code has to be mastered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bushidō: The soul of Japan|last=Nitobe|first=Inazō|publisher=|year=1899|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nitobe was the first to document Japanese chivalry in this way.  In ''Feudal and Modern Japan'' (1896), historian Arthur May Knapp wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The samurai of thirty years ago had behind him a thousand years of training in the law of honor, obedience, duty, and self-sacrifice&amp;nbsp;... It was not needed to create or establish them. As a child he had but to be instructed, as indeed he was from his earliest years, in the etiquette of [[self-immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/feudalmodernjapa01knapuoft |title=Feudal and Modern Japan |author=Arthur May Knapp |year=1896 |accessdate=2010-01-02 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Historical development ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}

===Early history to 16th century===

Many early literary works of Japan talk of warriors, but the term ''bushidō'' does not appear in text until the Edo period.&lt;ref&gt;"The Zen of Japanese Nationalism," by Robert H. Sharf, in ''Curators of the Buddha'', edited by Donald Lopez, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[literature]] of the 13th to 16th centuries, there exists an abundance of references to military ideals, although none of these should be viewed as early versions of ''bushidō'' per se.{{cn|date=February 2018}} [[Carl Steenstrup]] noted that 13th- and 14th-century writings (''[[gunki monogatari]]'') "portrayed the ''bushi'' in their natural element, war, eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion of master and man".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Compiled over the course of three centuries, beginning in the 1180s, the ''[[Heike Monogatari]]'' depicts a highly fictionalized and idealized story of a struggle between two warrior clans, the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] and the [[Taira clan|Taira]], at the end of the 12th century—a conflict known as the [[Genpei War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foreignpolicyi.org/onna-bugeisha-the-female-samurai/|title=Onna-Bugeisha – The Female Samurai|date=2018-05-24|work=Foreign policy|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly depicted throughout the epic is the ideal of the cultivated warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flashing Steel: Mastering Eishin-Ryu Swordsmanship, 2nd edition|last=Shimabukuro|first=Masayuki|last2=Pellman|first2=Leonard|publisher=Blue Snake Books|year=2007|isbn=9781583941973|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warriors in the ''Heike Monogatari'' served as role models for the educated warriors of later generations, although the ideals depicted by them were assumed to be beyond reach.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Nevertheless, during the early modern era, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms.{{cn|date=February 2018}} The influence of Shinto, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism in the Bushido's early development instilled among those who live by the code a religious respect for it. [[Yamaga Sokō|Yamaga-Soko]], the Japanese philosopher given credit for establishing Bushido, said that "the first and surest means to enter into communion with the Divine is by sincerity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The sayings of [[Sengoku period|Sengoku-period]] retainers and warlords such as Katō Kiyomasa and Nabeshima Naoshige were generally recorded or passed down to posterity around the turn of the 16th century when Japan had entered a period of relative peace. In a handbook addressed to "all ''samurai'', regardless of rank", Katō states:

:"If a man does not investigate into the matter of ''bushidō'' daily, it will be difficult for him to die a brave and manly death.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Thus, it is essential to engrave this business of the warrior into one's mind well."{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Katō was a ferocious warrior who banned even recitation of poetry, stating:

:"One should put forth great effort in matters of learning. One should read books concerning military matters, and direct his attention exclusively to the virtues of loyalty and filial piety....Having been born into the house of a warrior, one's intentions should be to grasp [[Daishō|the long and the short swords]] and to die."&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;William Scott Wilson, Ideals of the Samurai: Writings of Japanese Warriors ([[Kodansha]], 1982) {{ISBN|0-89750-081-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=does the word ''bushidō'' appear in the original Japanese text?|date=February 2018}}

Naoshige says similarly, that it is shameful for any man to die without having risked his life in battle, regardless of rank, and that "''bushidō'' is in being crazy to die. Fifty or more could not kill one such a man". However, Naoshige also suggests that "everyone should personally know exertion as it is known in the lower classes".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

===17th to 19th centuries===
[[Image:Miyamoto Musashi killing a giant nue.jpg|thumb|180px| [[Miyamoto Musashi]] killing a giant creature, from [[The Book of Five Rings]]]]

Japan enjoyed a period of relative peace from 1600 to the mid-19th century. During this period, the ''samurai'' class played a central role in the policing and administration of the country.{{cn|date=February 2018}} The [[bushidō literature|''bushidō'' literature]] of this time contains much thought relevant to a warrior class seeking more general application of martial principles and experience in peacetime, as well as reflection on the land's long history of war.{{cn|date=February 2018}} The literature of this time includes:

* ''Budo Shōshinshu'' (武道初心集) by Taira Shigesuke, [[Daidōji Yūzan]] (1639–1730)
*''[[Hagakure]]'' as related by [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]] to [[Tsuramoto Tashiro]].
* [[Bugei Juhappan]] (武芸十八般)
* [[A Book of Five Rings]] by [[Miyamoto Musashi]] 

The ''[[Hagakure]]'' contains many sayings attributed to [[Sengoku period|Sengoku-period]] retainer [[Nabeshima Naoshige]] (1537–1619) regarding ''bushidō'' related philosophy early in the 18th century by [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]] (1659–1719), a former [[retainer (medieval)|retainer]] to Naoshige's grandson, [[Nabeshima Mitsushige]]. The [[Hagakure]] was compiled in the early 18th century, but was kept as a kind of "secret teaching" of the [[Nabeshima clan]] until the end of the Tokugawa ''bakufu'' (1867).&lt;ref name="Samurai"&gt;"The Samurai Series: The Book of Five Rings, Hagakure -The Way of the Samurai &amp; Bushido - The Soul of Japan" ELPN Press (November, 2006) {{ISBN|1-934255-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His saying, "I have found the way of the warrior is death", was a summation of the focus on honour and reputation over all else that ''bushidō'' codified.&lt;ref&gt;Meirion and Susie Harries, ''Soldiers of the Sun:  The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army'' p 7 {{ISBN|0-394-56935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokugawa-era [[rōnin]], scholar and strategist [[Yamaga Sokō]] (1622–1685) wrote extensively on matters relating to ''bushidō'', ''bukyō'' (a "warrior's creed"), and a more general ''shidō'', a "way of gentlemen" intended for application to all stations of society. Sokō attempts to codify a kind of "universal ''bushidō''" with a special emphasis on "pure" [[Confucian]] values, (rejecting the mystical influences of Tao and Buddhism in Neo-Confucian orthodoxy), while at the same time calling for recognition of the singular and divine nature of Japan and Japanese culture. These radical concepts—including ultimate devotion to the Emperor, regardless of rank or clan—put him at odds with the reigning shogunate. He was exiled to the [[Akō Domain|Akō domain]], (the future setting of the [[Forty-seven rōnin|47 Rōnin incident]]), and his works were not widely read until the rise of nationalism in the early 20th century.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

The aging Yamamoto Tsunetomo's interpretation of ''bushidō'' is perhaps more illustrative of the philosophy refined by his unique station and experience, at once dutiful and defiant, ultimately incompatible with the laws of an emerging civil society. Of the 47 ''rōnin''—to this day, generally regarded as exemplars of ''bushidō''—Tsunetomo felt they were remiss in hatching such a wily, delayed plot for revenge, and had been over-concerned with the success of their undertaking. Instead, Tsunetomo felt true ''samurai'' should act without hesitation to fulfill their duties, without regard for success or failure.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

This romantic sentiment is of course expressed by warriors throughout history, though it may run counter to the art of war itself. This ambivalence is found in the heart of ''bushidō'', and perhaps all such "[[warrior]] codes". Some combination of traditional ''bushidō''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s organic contradictions and more "universal" or "progressive" formulations (like those of Yamaga Sokō) would inform Japan's disastrous military ambitions in the 20th century.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===19th to 21st centuries===
Recent scholarship in both Japan and abroad has focused on differences between the ''samurai'' caste and the ''bushidō'' theories that developed in modern Japan. ''Bushidō'' in the prewar period was often emperor-centered and placed much greater value on the virtues of loyalty and self-sacrifice than did many Tokugawa-era interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Eiko Ikegami. ''The Taming of the Samurai: Honorific Individualism and the Making of Modern Japan.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bushidō'' was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military, who doctored it to suit their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Friday. ''Bushidō or Bull? A Medieval Historian's Perspective on the Imperial Army and the Japanese Warrior Tradition.'' The History Teacher, Volume 27, Number 3, May 1994, pages 339-349.[http://ejmas.com/jalt/jaltart_friday_0301.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Japanese history agree that the ''bushidō'' that spread throughout modern Japan was not simply a continuation of earlier traditions.

More recently, it has been argued that modern ''bushidō'' discourse originated in the 1880s as a response to foreign stimuli, such as the English concept of "[[gentlemanship]]", by Japanese with considerable exposure to Western culture. Nitobe Inazo's ''bushidō'' interpretations followed a similar trajectory, although he was following earlier trends. This relatively pacifistic ''bushidō'' was then hijacked and adapted by militarists and the government from the early 1900s onward as nationalism increased around the time of the Russo-Japanese War.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Benesch. ''[https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Way-Samurai-Nationalism-Internationalism/dp/0198754256/ Inventing the Way of the Samurai: Nationalism, Internationalism, and Bushido in Modern Japan.]'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|0198706626}}, {{ISBN|9780198706625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[junshi]]'' suicide of General [[Nogi Maresuke]] and his wife on the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] occasioned both praise, as an example to the decaying morals of Japan, and criticism, explicitly declaring that the spirit of ''bushidō'' thus exemplified should not be revived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert P.

During pre-World War II and World War II [[Shōwa period|Shōwa Japan]], ''bushido'' was pressed into use for militarism,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/history.html No Surrender: Background History]"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese propaganda during World War II#Bushido|to present war as purifying, and death a duty]].&lt;ref&gt;David Powers, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/japan_no_surrender_01.shtml Japan: No Surrender in World War Two]"&lt;/ref&gt; This was presented as revitalizing traditional values and "transcending the modern".&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]], ''War Without Mercy:  Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'' p1 {{ISBN|0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bushidō'' would provide a spiritual shield to let soldiers fight to the end.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''Why the Allies Won'' p 6 {{ISBN|0-393-03925-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war turned, the spirit of ''bushidō'' was invoked to urge that all depended on the firm and united soul of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin P. Hoyt]], ''Japan's War'', p 334 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Battle of Attu]] was lost, attempts were made to make the more than two thousand Japanese deaths an inspirational epic for the fighting spirit of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945]]'' p 444 Random House New York 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguments that the plans for the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to serious danger if they failed, were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to "bloom as flowers of death".&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945'' p 539 Random House New York 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  The first proposals of organized suicide attacks met resistance because although ''bushidō'' called for a warrior to be always aware of death, they were not to view it as the sole end.  Nonetheless, the desperate straits brought about acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Edwin P. Hoyt, ''Japan's War'', p 356 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such attacks were acclaimed as the true spirit of ''bushidō''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin P. Hoyt, ''Japan's War'', p 360 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners of war denied being mistreated and declared that they were being well-treated by virtue of ''bushidō'' generosity.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin P. Hoyt, ''Japan's War'', p 256 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast interviews with prisoners were also described as being not propaganda but out of sympathy with the enemy, such sympathy as only ''bushidō'' could inspire.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin P. Hoyt, ''Japan's War'', p 257 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets==
''Bushidō'' expanded and formalized the earlier code of the ''samurai'', and stressed sincerity, frugality, loyalty, mastery of [[martial arts]], and [[honor|honour]] to the death. Under the ''bushidō'' ideal, if a ''samurai'' failed to uphold his honor he could only regain it by performing ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual [[suicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bushido|title=Bushido {{!}} Japanese history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an excerpt from his book ''Samurai: The World of the Warrior'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ospreysamurai.com/samurai_death02.htm|title=ospreysamurai.com|website=www.ospreysamurai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; historian [[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]] describes the role of seppuku in feudal Japan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai’s spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Bushidō'' varied dramatically over time, and across the geographic and socio-economic backgrounds of the ''samurai'', who represented somewhere between 5% and 10% of the Japanese population.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas ''Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook'' Shambhala (May 2008) {{ISBN|1-59030-572-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Meiji era|Meiji-era]] census at the end of the 19th century counted 1,282,000 members of the "high ''samurai''", allowed to ride a horse, and 492,000 members of the "low samurai", allowed to [[Daishō|wear two swords]] but not to ride a horse, in a country of about 25 million.&lt;ref&gt;Mikiso Hane ''Modern Japan: A Historical Survey, Third Edition'' Westview Press (January 2001) {{ISBN|0-8133-3756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some versions of ''bushidō'' include compassion for those of lower station, and for the preservation of one's name.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Early ''bushidō'' literature further enforces the requirement to conduct oneself with calmness, fairness, justice, and propriety.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; The relationship between learning and the way of the warrior is clearly articulated, one being a natural partner to the other.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

Other pundits pontificating on the warrior philosophy covered methods of raising children, appearance, and grooming, but all of this may be seen as part of one's constant preparation for death—to die a good death with one's honor intact, the ultimate aim in a life lived according to ''bushidō''. Indeed, a "good death" is its own reward, and by no means assurance of "future rewards" in the [[afterlife]]. Some ''samurai'', though certainly not all (e.g., [[Amakusa Shirō]]), have throughout history held such aims or beliefs in disdain, or expressed the awareness that their station—as it involves killing—precludes such reward, especially in [[Buddhism]]. Japanese beliefs surrounding the ''samurai'' and the afterlife are complex and often contradictory, while the soul of a noble warrior suffering in hell or as a lingering spirit occasionally appears in Japanese art and literature, so does the idea of a warrior being reborn upon a lotus throne in paradise&lt;ref&gt;Zeami Motokiyo "Atsumori"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eight virtues of Bushidō (as envisioned by [[Nitobe Inazō]])===
The ''bushidō'' code is typified by eight [[virtue]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Nihongo|[[Righteousness]]|[[wiktionary:義|義]]|gi}}
Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.
*{{Nihongo|[[Heroic]] [[Courage]]|[[wiktionary:勇気|勇]]|yū}}
Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.
*{{Nihongo|[[Charity (practice)|Benevolence]], [[Compassion]]|[[wiktionary:仁|仁]]|jin}}
Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.
*{{Nihongo|[[Respect]]|[[wiktionary:礼|礼]]|rei}}
True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.
*{{Nihongo|[[Honesty]]|[[wiktionary:誠|誠]]|makoto}}
When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.
*{{Nihongo|[[Honour]]|[[wiktionary:名誉|名誉]]|meiyo}}
Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of who they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.
*{{Nihongo|[[Duty]] and [[Loyalty]]|[[wiktionary:忠義|忠義]]|chūgi}}
Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.
*{{Nihongo|[[Self-control|Self-Control]]|[[wiktionary:自制|自制]]|jisei}}

=== Associated virtues ===
*{{Nihongo|[[Filial piety]]|[[wiktionary:孝|孝]]|kō}}
*{{Nihongo|[[Wisdom]]|[[wiktionary:智|智]]|chi}}
*{{Nihongo|[[Fraternity]]|[[wiktionary:悌|悌]]|tei}}

== Modern translations ==
Modern Western translation of documents related to ''bushidō'' began in the 1970s with [[Carl Steenstrup]], who performed research into the ethical codes of famous ''samurai'' including [[Hōjō Sōun]] and [[Imagawa Sadayo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/aboutMN.html|title=''Monumenta Nipponica''|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215193758/http://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/aboutMN.html|archivedate=2008-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary research into ''bushidō'' was later conducted by [[William Scott Wilson]] in his 1982 text ''Ideals of the Samurai: Writings of Japanese Warriors''. The writings span hundreds of years, family lineage, geography, social class and writing style—yet share a common set of values. Wilson's work also examined older Japanese writings unrelated to the warrior class: the [[Kojiki]], [[Shoku Nihongi]], the [[Kokin Wakashū]] and the [[Konjaku Monogatari]], as well as the Chinese Classics (the [[Analects]], the [[Great Learning]], the [[Doctrine of the Mean]], and the [[Mencius]]).

In May 2008, [[Thomas Cleary]] translated a collection of 22 writings on ''bushidō'' by warriors, scholars, political advisers, and educators, spanning 500 years from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Titled ''Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook,'' it gave an insider's view of the samurai world: "the moral and psychological development of the warrior, the ethical standards they were meant to uphold, their training in both martial arts and strategy, and the enormous role that the traditions of [[Shintoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Taoism]] had in influencing samurai ideals".

'''Catharine Trotter Cockburn''' (16 August 1679 – 11 May 1749) was a novelist, dramatist, and philosopher. She wrote on moral philosophy,  theological tracts, and had a voluminous correspondence.

Trotter's work addresses a range of issues including necessity, the infinitude of space, and the substance, but she focuses on moral issues. She thought that moral principles are not innate, but discoverable by each individual through the use of the faculty of reason endowed by God. In 1702, she published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock's [sic.] [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.  [[John Locke]] was so pleased with this defence that he made gifts of money and books to his young apologist acting through [[Elizabeth Burnet]] who had first made Locke aware of Trotter's "Defence".&lt;ref name=Waithe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waithe|first1=edited by Mary Ellen|title=A history of women philosophers.|date=1991|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0792309308|pages=104–105|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0792309308|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her work attracted the attention of [[William Warburton]], who prefaced her last philosophical work.  She also had a request from the biographer [[Thomas Birch]] to aid him in compiling a collection of her works.  She agreed to the project but died before the work could be printed.  Birch posthumously published a two-volume collection entitled ''The Works of Mrs. Catharine Cockburn, Theological, Moral, Dramatic, and Poetical'' in 1751. It is largely through this text that readers and history have come to know her.

==Early years==
Catharine Trotter was born in London, on 16 August, 1674 or 1679.{{efn|Catharine Trotter was most likely born in 1674 rather than the later date of 1679, which had been previously accepted. &lt;ref&gt;Recent research, detailed in Anne Kelley, ''Catharine Trotter: An early modern writer in the vanguard of feminism'' (Ashgate: Aldershot, 2002) supports this claim, which has been authenticated by the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Anne|title=Trotter , Catharine (1674?–1749)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5768|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} Both her parents were Scotch. Her father, Captain David Trotter, was a commodore in the Royal Navy, personally known to King Charles II, and the Duke of York, who admired his high qualities and appreciated his distinguished services. Captain Trotter assisted in the demolition of Tangier in 1683, and being subsequently sent to convoy the fleet of merchant ships belonging to the Turkey Company, died of the plague at Alexandretta (Iscanderoon), early in the year 1684. His property having fallen into dishonest hands, the two-fold affliction of bereavement and poverty fell at once upon his widow and children. Her mother was Sarah Bellenden, a near relation of Lord Bellenden, and of the Duke of Lauderdale, and the Earl of Perth.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=170}}

Trotter was raised [[Protestant]] but converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] at an early age.

During the short remainder of King Charles II.’s reign, Mrs. Trotter had a pension from the Admiralty, and Queen Anne made her an allowance of 20 £ a-year. It is to be supposed that the widow also received assistance from her husband’s brother, and from her own high-born and wealthy cousins, in bringing up her two fatherless children. Both were daughters. The elder married Dr. Inglis, a medical officer, who attended the Duke of Marlborough in his campaigns, and became physician-general to the army.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=170}}

Catharine, the youngest, was early remarkable for her sagacious intellect, for her facility in acquiring knowledge, her cleverness in teaching herself the art of penmanship, and her delight in making extemporary verse. Nothing is recorded of her education, but from her own allusion to it in her "Poem on the Busts", it may be inferred to have been slight and ordinary. Nothing, however, could repress her eager desire for information; and obstacles, as usual, proved incentives to effort. She read with avidity, and wrote with emulative zeal; works of imagination occupying, as in such cases they are wont, her childish attention; and these, as her reasoning powers matured, and her judgment became formed, giving place to [[tractate]]s and treatises on moral philosophy and religion. She taught herself the French language, and, with the assistance of a friend, acquired the Latin. Her ''Verses written at the age of fourteen, and sent to Mr. Beville Higgons, on his sickness and recovery from the small-pox'', though rather a bold avowal of sympathy with the “lovely youth,” and of admiration for his  matchless charms,” were evidently well-meant admonitions to resignation, and to the conscientious application of the high qualities and fine “parts” ascribed to him.
{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=171}}

==Early productions==
Her muse was always didactic, and although her ''Songs'', after the fashion of her time, were full of amatory context, they inculcated self-government and morality. The professional connections of her father, the aristocratic relationships of her mother, and the celebrity early won by her own extraordinary talents, gained her a large circle of acquaintance; and although straitened in the means of subsistence, and probably possessing little of her own but the earnings of her pen, Trotter moved in the best society, and was a frequent and welcome guest in the houses of the rich and great. Her beauty, and the unaffected sweetness of her manners, bore the charm of unasserted mental superiority.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=171}}

[[File:1696 Trotter Agnes de Castro.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of a 1696 edition of Trotter's ''Agnes de Castro''.]]
Trotter was a precocious and largely self-educated young woman, who had her first novel (''The Adventures of a Young Lady'', later retitled ''Olinda's Adventures'') published anonymously in 1693, when she was but 14 years old. Her first published play, ''Agnes de Castro'', was staged two years later, in the year 1695, at the Theatre Royal, and printed in the following year, with a dedication to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, from which it appears that his Lordship was one of her personal friends and advisers. This tragedy was not based upon historic fact, but upon [[Aphra Behn]]’s English translation of a French novel.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=172}}

In 1696, she was famously satirised alongside [[Delarivier Manley]] and [[Mary Pix]] in the anonymous play, ''The Female Wits''.  In it, Trotter was lampooned in the figure of "Calista, a lady who pretends to the learned languages and assumes to herself the name of critic." The following year, Trotter addressed to [[William Congreve]] a set of complimentary verses on his ''[[The Mourning Bride]]'', and thus either created or strengthened the interest which that poet took in her literary proceedings. His published letter to her shows that they had been previously acquainted.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=172}} 

In 1698, her second tragedy and arguably best-liked play, ''Fatal Friendship'', was performed at the then-new theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. It was afterwards printed with a dedication to the Princess of Wales, and not only established Trotter's reputation as a dramatic writer, and brought a shower of complimentary verses, but increased the number of her powerful, fashionable, and eminent friends. It may reasonably be supposed, produced great pecuniary profit.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=172}} 

Prefixed to her ''Fatal Friendship'' are many sets of eulogistic verses addressed to the authoress; one by P. Harman, who also wrote the prologue; one by an anonymous writer, probably Lady [[Sarah Piers]]; and yet another, written by the playwright, John Hughes, who hailed her as “the first of stage reformers.” The language is plain and unaffected, but occasionally deformed, after the colloquial fashion introduced at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], by the abbreviated words “ ’em” for them. The plot is commonplace, but well complicated, and it produces some good dramatic situations. The moral drawn at the conclusion is:— “None know their strength, let the most resolute Learn from this story to distrust themselves, Nor think by fear the victory less sure; Our greatest danger is when we’re most secure." This tragedy, having been deemed by contemporary critics of the time as the best of Trotter's dramatic compositions, left the reader little cause to join in Dr. Birch's regret that want of space enforced the omission of the four other plays from his edition of her works.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=182-83}}

In 1700, she was one of the presumptuous Englishwomen who, under the several names of the Nine Muses, bewailed in verse the death of [[John Dryden]]. She was consequently praised and addressed as a Muse by a troop of admiring rhymers.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=172}}

Early in the year 1701, her comedy of ''Love at a Loss, or Most Votes carry it'', was performed at the Theatre Royal, and published in the month of May of the same year, with a dedication to Lady Piers. “She had,” remarks Dr. Birch, “contracted a very early esteem for, and most intimate and unreserved friendship,” with Trotter. Later in the same year, her third tragedy, ''The Unhappy Penitent'', was performed at Drury Lane, and published in August, with a dedication to Lord Halifax, and a set of verses, by Lady Piers, prefixed, inscribed “To the excellent Mrs. Catherine Trotter”. Also in 1701, she wrote her ''Defence of Mr. Locke’s Essay of Human Understanding'', and it was published in May, 1702. This gained for her the personal friendship of Locke and of Lady Masham, and was, through them, the means of introducing her to many eminent persons, among them being Mr. Peter King, then a barrister and member of parliament, who was the maternal nephew of Locke.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=173}}

==Religious conversions==
===Roman Catholic Church===
Considering the position and connections of her parents, it is probable that Trotter had not been trained at an early age to piety, and consequently when a crisis of the soul occurred, she probably met with a Roman Catholic teacher, and, as a natural result, she zealously adopted his creed. In this she continued for many years, resting quiescently upon its first impressions. Meanwhile, her strict observance of the fast-days proved so injurious to her health, that in October, 1703, her friend and physician, Dr. Denton Nicholas, wrote her a letter of serious remonstrance upon the subject, and desired her “to abate of those rigours of abstinence, as insupportable to a constitution naturally infirm,” requesting that his opinion might be communicated to her friends and to her confessor.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=174}}

Her health, even at its best, was too delicate to allow her to walk more than a mile to church and back, on a summer's day, without fatigue which amounted to illness; and a weakness of sight always rendered it painful to her to write by candlelight. Yet this fragile woman possessed self-relying energy which enabled her not only to sustain the mental and manual labour of careful literary composition through continuous months and years, but also to transact with methodical exactness all the complicated business attendant upon the performance, printing, and publication of her works.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=175}}

From 1701, until her marriage in 1708, Catherine Trotter kept up a regular correspondence with her friend George Burnet, Esq., of Kemnay. During the greater part of the period he traveled in foreign lands, and more especially at the courts of Berlin and Hanover, where be spread the fame of “la nouvelle Sappho-Ecossoise,” and excited the curiosity of Leibnitz to become acquainted with her philosophical works. It may be inferred from many passages in his letters that he would gladly have raised for himself an amorous interest with this young friend; and from hers, that, with unaffected candour and cordial esteem, she repelled every approach towards a declaration of love. She had many admirers, but never was led by the persuasions of her friends, or the temptations of wealth and rank, to encourage the addresses of men for whom she felt no preference.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=175}}

In 1704, Trotter composed a poem on the Duke of Marlborough's gaining the battle of Blenheim, which, being highly approved of by the hero and his family, was put into print. About that period she had some hopes of obtaining, through the powerful interest of the Marlborough family, a pension from the crown, to which her father's long services and losses in the cause of his King and country gave a plausible claim. This, however, she failed to obtain, and received only a gratuity. After the battle of Ramilies, in 1706, she produced another poem in praise of the Duke of Marlborough, and on both occasions her verses were ranked among the best which recorded his fame. In the same year, her tragedy, called ''The Revolution of Sweden'', founded on Vertot's account of Gustavus Ericson, was performed at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket; and subsequently printed, with a dedication to Lady Harriet Godolphin, eldest daughter of the great Duke, and after his decease Duchess of Marlborough in her own right.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=176}}

Her sister, Mrs. Inglis, residing at [[Salisbury]], and her mother spending much of her time there, Catherine was induced to make long visits to that city, extending sometimes to the period of fifteen months. But her favourite abode was at “Mr. Finney’s, in Beaufort Buildings on the Strand,” where, in private lodgings, she could, without domestic restraint or the disturbance of young children, give herself up to literary occupations. Among the happy results of her sojournings at Salisbury was her acquaintance with Bishop [[Gilbert Burnet]], and with his third wife, [[Elizabeth Burnet|Elizabeth]], eldest daughter of Sir Richard Blake, and widow of Robert Berkeley, Esq, of [[Spetchley]]. Mrs. Burnet, who had a large, independent income, took an affectionate interest in Trotter until Mrs. Burnet died in 1709.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=176}}

===Return to the Church of England===
In Trotter's mind a sense of duty towards God, and a desire to reform and benefit the world, were ever predominant; but at different periods of her life she sought to effect this object by different means. In the year 1707, after a course of severe study, deep reflection, and earnest prayer, she abjured the Roman Catholic faith, and wrote and published her ''Two Letters concerning a Guide in Controversies'', to which a preface by Bishop Burnet was prefixed. The first letter was addressed to Mr. Bennet, a priest, and the second to Mr. Harman, as a rejoinder to an answer which she had received.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=177}} She made strong, clear and reasoned arguments for her change of faith.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=177}} No scruple ever again affected her staunch adherence to the orthodox faith of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=178}}

==Reverend Cockburn==
In the summer of 1707, while staying with Madame de Vere, an invalid who resided at [[Ockham, Surrey#Ockham mill|Ockham Mills]], near [[Ripley, Surrey]], she met with a young clergyman named Fenn, of whose preaching, conversation, and character, she thoroughly approved. Mr. Fenn fell deeply in love with her, made her an offer of marriage, and obtained for his suit the sanction and intercession of Lady Piers. Catherine Trotter accepted his friendship, and, but for the preference she already felt for another person, would have judged it right to marry him. The favoured rival was Rev. Patrick Cockburn, a scholar and a gentleman, distantly related to the Burnet family and to her own, with whom she had for some months held a friendly correspondence, in which they discussed those subjects of philosophical and practical religion which were of principal interest to both. The addresses of Mr. Fenn brought mutual conviction, and matters came to a climax.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=178}}

===Pause in writing===
Rev. Cockburn confessed his love, proposed, and was accepted. He took holy orders in the Church of England in 1708, married Trotter, received the “Donative” of [[Nayland]], near [[Colchester]], and, leaving his bride in London to arrange her affairs and to purchase furniture, he took possession of his pastoral charge in June, and welcomed her to their new home in the autumn of the same year.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=178}}

How long they resided there, neither Dr. Birch nor Trotters's writings suggest; but, in the course of time, Rev. Cockburn accepted the curacy of St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-street, and returned with his family to London, where they resided until the year 1714, when the death of Queen Anne took place. The oath of abjuration required on the accession of King George I. aroused scruples in the mind of Rev. Cockburn, and he refused to take it, although he conscientiously offered up the public prayers for the reigning sovereign and the royal family. He was consequently deprived of his employment in the church, and reduced to poverty. During the next twelve years, he maintained his family by teaching Latin to the students of the Academy in Chancery Lane, while his wife, ever anxious for self-improvement, took up household duties, industriously applied herself to needlework, and all sorts of manual occupations, and cheerfully devoted her faculties to the solace of her husband, and to the education of her children.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=178}}

===Return to writing===
From the year of her marriage, 1708, until 1724, Trotter had published nothing. In the latter year, she wrote her "Letter to Dr. Holdsworth", and having sent it to him, and received an elaborate controversial answer, she published her "Letter" in January, 1727. To this, Dr. [[Winch Holdsworth]] publicly replied, and Trotter wrote an able rejoinder; but the booksellers not being willing to undertake its responsibility, the "Vindication of Mr. Locke’s Christian Principles from the injurious imputations of Dr. Holdsworth", remained in manuscript until it was published among her collected works.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=180}}

The best of her productions in verse was "A Poem, occasioned by the Busts set up in the Queen’s Hermitage, designed to be presented with a book in vindication of Mr. Locke, which was to have been inscribed to Her Majesty". With considerable skill and persuasive sweetness she drew an argument from the honour done by Queen Caroline to the busts of Clarke, Locke, and Newton, and the patronage which Her Majesty had extended even to the rural bard, Nicholas Duck. Although much has been said and written about Locke by the ablest metaphysicians of his age, and of each succeeding generation, it may be questioned whether his own meaning in his own words has ever been more truly construed than by Trotter. What she wrote concerning his opinions during his life was approved by Locke himself; what she wrote of them after his decease was acknowledged to be correct by his most intimate associates, to whom he had frequently and familiarly expounded them.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=183-84}}

In 1726, Rev. Cockburn convinced himself of the propriety of taking the Oath of [[Abjuration]] upon the ascension of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], to which he had so long objected. He was appointed to St. Paul's Chapel in [[Aberdeen]] in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Yolton|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Stephens|editor3-first=John|title=The Dictionary of Eighteenth Century British Philosophers|date=1999|publisher=Thoemmes Press|isbn=1855061236|page=212|chapter=Cockburn, Catharine (1679?-1749)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thither he was accompanied by his family; and his wife bade, in that year, an everlasting farewell to London, the scene of her many triumphs and many trials.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=179}}

Soon after their removal, her friend, the Lord High Chancellor King, presented her husband to the living of Long Horseley, near [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], in the county of [[Northumberland]]; but they continued at Aberdeen until the year 1737, when the Bishop of Durham ordered him to take up his residence in his parish. The clerical residence stood so far from the church of Long Horseley, that when rough weather and feeble health disabled Trotter from riding on horseback to attend the Sunday services, she was constrained to stay at home, unless a still more distant neighbor, Mrs. Ogle, chanced to be in the country, and to give her a seat in her chaise and four, or her coach and six.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=179}}

In 1732, while living at Aberdeen, she wrote the "Verses occasioned by the Busts in the Queen’s Hermitage", which were printed in the ''Gentleman’s Magazine'' for May 1737. In August, 1743, her "Remarks upon some Writers in the Controversy concerning the Foundation of Moral Duty and Obligation" were published in a serial called "The History of the Works of the Learned". These ‘"Remarks" were well received, and excited great admiration, and Trotter's friend, Dr. Sharp, archdeacon of Northumberland, having read them in manuscript, engaged her in an epistolary discussion on the subject of which they treat. The correspondence began August 8, 1743, and was concluded October 2, 1747.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=180}}

Dr. Rutherford's "Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue" having appeared in 1744, her active mind was again aroused for public controversy, and in April 1747, her "Remarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr. Rutherford’s Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue, in Vindication of the contrary Principles and Beasonings enforced in the Writings of the late Dr. Samuel Clarke", were published with a preface by Bishop Warburton. The extraordinary reputation acquired by this able work, suggested to some friends, who submitted the scheme to Lady Isabella Finch, the thought of raising a subscription for the republication of all Trotter's works, which the author herself undertook to edit. This plan was zealously supported by Trotter's fashionable and eminent friends, but uncontrollable circumstances prevented its full execution.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=181}}

==Style and themes==
In some verses entitled "Calliope’s Directions how to Deserve and Distinguish the Muse’s Inspirations", the strong, clear sense of Trotter is conspicuously shown by her definition of the uses of tragic, comic, and satiric poetry. Of course, as Calliope, she presided only over heroic strains and general eloquence, and it would have been inappropriate to treat of any other kind of verse. The quotation of a few lines demonstrates the style:—{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=172}}

{{poemquote
|text=
“Let none presume the hallowed way to tread 
By other than the noblest motives led : 
If for a sordid gain, or glittering fame, 
To please without instructing be your aim, 
To lower means your grovelling thoughts confine, 
Unworthy of an art that’s all divine.”}}

Trotter's long suspension from writing -sixteen to eighteen years- was noted by the public, as was her resumption of writing. The commentators upon her works over-restrained her own words on the first part of this subject, and drawn from them an unwarranted inference. It should be understood that during those years, Trotter read few new books, yet she had undoubtedly possessed her Bible, the works of [[Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton|Milton]], of [[Lord Bacon]], [[Damaris Cudworth Masham|Cudworth]], and [[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Bishop Cumberland]]. She had lived so long in the propulsive centre of British activity that, when sunk into obscurity, the gathering in of her reflections enriched her more than continued opportunities of observation would have done; and her fine faculties were kept bright and keenly edged by constant use.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=186}} Extracts of her controversial writings show her style.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=184}}

In the preface to her "Letter to Dr. Holdsworth", Trotter said the following, with the person here alluded to probably being Lord King:—{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=184-855}}{{quote|text="The great zeal Mr. Locke showed for the conversion of deists, the serious veneration he expresses for the Divine Revelation, and (how little soever he was fond of particular systems) the care he took not to oppose any established articles of faith, make it a work worthy a sincere Christian to support his character against the injudiciousness of those who have reproached him as a Socinian heretic, an enemy, an underminer of religion. That there are no plain proofs from his writings to ground such a charge upon, is a sufficient foundation for this defence; but that he was certainly no Socinian, I am farther well assured by the authority of one who was intimate to his most private thoughts, and who is as eminent for his probity, as for the high station he at present possesses.”}}

In a letter to her niece, dated “Long Horseley, September 29, 1748,” Trotter said:—{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=185}}{{quote|text="I must own to you I am not myself satisfied, upon a review, of what Mr. Locke has said on moral relations. His plan led him to consider them only with reference to the present constitution of things; and, though he is very free from the charge of making the nature of morality uncertain, I fear he has given occasion to the interested scheme so much in fashion of late, but carried, I dare say, far beyond what he intended.”}}

It is interesting to know Trotter's opinion of the most illustrious of all her contemporaries, Bishop Butler. In letters to Mrs. Arbuthnot, written at Aberdeen, in 1738, she thus mentions him:—{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=185-86}}{{quote|text="He is a most judicious writer, has searched deeply into human nature, and is by some thought obscure; but he thinks with great cleamess, and there needs only a deep attention tounderstand him perfectly. Whilst our modern moralists have contended to establish moral virtue, some on the moral sense alone, some on the essential difference and relations of things, and some on the sole will of God, they have all been deficient; for neither of those principles are suflicient exclusive of others, but all three together make an immoveabl'e foundation for, and obligation to, moral practice; the moral sense, or conscience, and the essential difference of things discovering to us what the will of our Maker is. I have so great an opinion of the author of ‘ The Analogy,’ that I no sooner saw it advertised than I made it my business to inquire after it, and procured the reading it twice. I think the design finely executed, especially in the first part, and all the objections of the deists very well obviated. That valuable performance, and several others that have come out within these few years, are of great use to satisfy and confirm the humble believer in his pious and just opinion, that God best knows by what means it is fit for him, in the wisdom of his government, to be reconciled to mankind.”}}

In letters of subsequent date, Mrs. Cockburn repeatedly mentioned Bishop Butler with a still deeper sense of the value of his writings. Dating from “Long Horseley, October 2, 1747,” and again addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, she said the following, which was an all-sufficient exposition of Trotter's theological opinions:—{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=186}}{{quote|text="I assure you there is not a sentence of that author’s that I would not readily subscribe to, so perfectly I am satisfied with the whole tenor of his doctrine.”}} 

==Personal life==
Mr. and Mrs. Cockburn had three daughters, Mary, Catherine, and Grissel, and one son, John.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;{{cite web |last1=De Tommaso |first1=Emilio Maria |title=Catharine Trotter Cockburn (1679?—1749) |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/cockburn/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=University of Tennessee |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of advice to the former, written by his mother for his guidance in early manhood, is full of wisdom and piety. Religion, employment, and women, are the subjects of her discourse. Under the second she says :—“ Divinity is the profession you have been designed for from your birth; but let no views determine your choice to that sacred calling but a sincere desire of promoting the glory of God, and the salvation of men.”{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=181}}

In subsequent letters to her niece, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Trotter often alludes to her “good son” with all the satisfaction of a happy mother. In 1743, a daughter died; and in January, 1749, her husband did as well. Under this severe shock, her feeble health gave way. Trotter died at [[Longhorsley]] near Morpeth on 11 May 1749.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Anne|title=Trotter , Catharine (1674?–1749)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5768|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried beside her husband and her youngest daughter, at Longhorsley, and on their tomb was inscribed one sentence, altered from Proverbs xxxi. 31, “Let their own works praise them in the gates.”{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=181}}

==Legacy==
Despite her one-time renown, Trotter's reputation has steadily waned over the last three centuries and has only been rescued from near obscurity by the efforts of [[feminist]] critics, such as Anne Kelley&lt;ref&gt;See ''Catharine Trotter: an early modern writer in the vanguard of feminism'', Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;, in the last two decades.  Arguably, the predicament of her reputation is attributable to her having written a large amount of work very early in her life and less in her mature years.  In other words, her career was extremely front-loaded, and the literati of her period (especially the men) tended to focus on her youth and beauty at the expense of her work.  Some literary historians attribute her relative obscurity to a persistent emphasis being placed upon her philosophical work at the expense of her creative writing (especially by her biographer Thomas Birch, who included only one play in his two volume collection of her work and did not mention ''Olinda's Adventures'' at all).  Though skillful, her philosophical writings were sometimes dismissed as derivative, especially her defence of Locke's Essay—a judgment that could hardly help her reputation.

Much of the scholarly interest in Trotter's dramatic writing now centres on [[gender studies]].  Indeed, Trotter herself was cognisant of the limitations her gender placed upon her and often voiced her protest in writing.  In the dedication to ''Fatal Friendship'' (1698), for example, she remarks that "when a Woman appears in the World under any distinguishing Character, she must expect to be the mark of ill Nature," especially if she enters into "what the other Sex think their peculiar Prerogative." Both Trotter's literary works, in which women dominate the action, and her personal life provide rich subject matter for feminist criticism.

'''Christian Garve''' (7 January 1742 – 1 December 1798) was one of the best-known philosophers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] along with [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Moses Mendelssohn]].

==Life==
Christian Garve was born into a family of manual workers and died aged 56 in his parental home. He studied in [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] and [[Halle (Saale)]]. In 1766 he gained his master's degree in philosophy. From 1770 until 1772 he was [[extraordinary professor]] of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] in [[Leipzig]]. From 1772 he was in Breslau, where he was active as a bookseller. The greatest part of his life was however spent staying with his mother in Breslau. In this city he also became a member of the [[Masonic Lodge]] "Friedrich zum goldenen Zepter" ("Frederick of the Golden Scepter").

Garve became well-known particularly for his intensive activity as a translator (producing versions of, e.g., [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Officiis]]'' (1783) and [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''). His translation of Cicero's work was done at the request of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], who bestowed upon him a pension of 200 thalers. Garve eulogized Frederick in the ''Fragmente zur Schilderung des Geistes, Charakters and der Regierung Friedrichs II.'' (1798).

He composed psychological, moral and economic texts and reviews for the ''Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften und der freyen Künste'' ("New Library of the Beautiful Sciences and Free Arts"). He was strongly marked by the influence of the [[English Enlightenment|English]] and [[Scottish Enlightenment]] as well as [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ethics. He never formulated his essentially empirical philosophy in terms of a system, publishing his thought in the form of remarks and essays. As a result, he was reproached for being merely a shallow ''Popularphilosoph'' (popular philosopher), a reputation he has retained, and his writings did much toward the popularization of philosophy in Germany.

Of interest is his engagement with Immanuel Kant, which was initiated by a review of Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'' in the ''Göttinger Gelehrten Anzeigen'' ("Göttingen Learned Advertiser") which had been shortened by the Göttingen philosopher [[Johann Georg Heinrich Feder]]. Kant felt himself to have been misunderstood, and complained bitterly about the review in the Appendix to his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics that Will Henceforth Come Forward as a Science. When the original, longer review was published by Garve in the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek'' ("General German Library"), it still attracted Kant's censure. Kant consequently wrote his own ''Anti-Garve''. This program in time expanded into Kant's ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]''. The intellectual engagement between Kant and Garve extended up to Garve's death of cancer&lt;ref&gt;"In his letter to Kant, September 1798 [819], Garve movingly depicts his agonizing illness, a malignant tumor of the face, and expresses his astonishment that he is still living and thinking." (''Kant: Philosophical Correspondence 1759-99'', Edited and translated by Arnulf Zweig, University of Chicago Press, 1967, p. 250, note 2)&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1798.

[[File:Christopher P Cranch - cropped.jpg|thumb|Christopher Pearse Cranch]]
'''Christopher Pearse Cranch''' (March 8, 1813 – January 20, 1892) was an American writer and artist.

==Biography==
Cranch was born in the [[District of Columbia]]. His conservative father, [[William Cranch]], was Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Hazen C. "Emerson and Christopher Pearse Cranch" in ''The New England Quarterly''. Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 26.&lt;/ref&gt; while his brother [[John Cranch (American painter)|John]] was a painter.&lt;ref name="Dearinger(U.S.)2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bernard Dearinger|author2=National Academy of Design (U.S.)|title=Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design: 1826-1925|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHH45aYubp4C&amp;pg=PR20|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills|isbn=978-1-55595-029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from Columbian College (now [[George Washington University]]) in 1835 before attending [[Harvard Divinity School]] and becoming a licensed preacher.&lt;ref name=Carpenter19&gt;Carpenter, Hazen C. "Emerson and Christopher Pearse Cranch" in ''The New England Quarterly''. Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, preaching in Providence, Andover, Richmond, Bangor, Portland, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis.&lt;ref name=Carpenter19/&gt; Later, he pursued various occupations: a magazine editor, [[caricaturist]], children's [[fantasy writer]] (the ''Huggermugger'' books), poet (''The Bird and the Bell with Other Poems'' in 1875), translator, and [[landscape painter]]. He lived much of his life in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Though not one of its founding members, Cranch became associated with the [[Transcendental Club]];&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7–8. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he read [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'' by December 1836 and beginning in June 1837 served as a substitute editor of the ''Western Messenger'' in the absence of [[James Freeman Clarke]].&lt;ref name=Carpenter19/&gt; For that journal, Cranch reviewed Emerson's [[Phi Beta Kappa]] address at Harvard in August 1837 known as "[[The American Scholar]]". He referred to the speech as "so full of beauties, full of original thought and illustration" and its author as "the man of genius, the bold deep thinker, and the concise original writer".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Hazen C. "Emerson and Christopher Pearse Cranch" in ''The New England Quarterly''. Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cranch's connection with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] ultimately diminished his demand as a minister.

His poetry was published in ''[[The Phalanx|The Harbinger]]''&lt;ref&gt;Felton, R. Todd. ''A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England''. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 126. {{ISBN|0-9766706-4-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Dial]]''&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 119. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other publications. He sent "Enosis", which Hazen Carpenter noted as perhaps Cranch's most well-known poem, to Emerson for ''The Dial'' on March 2, 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Hazen C. "Emerson and Christopher Pearse Cranch" in ''The New England Quarterly''. Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houghton MS Am 1506 (2) - Cranch.jpg|thumb|''Illustrations of the New Philosophy'', ca. 1844]]
As an artist, Cranch painted landscapes similar to the work of [[Thomas Cole]], the [[Hudson River school]], and the [[Barbizon school]] in France. In one foray into historical painting, Cranch depicted the burning of P. T. [[Barnum's American Museum]] in New York City. Later in life, Cranch painted scenes from Venice and Italy. Cranch's caricatures of Emerson were later bound as ''Illustrations of the New Philosophy: Guide''. Perhaps his most well-remembered and recognized artwork is a hand-drawn caricature illustrating Emerson's concept of the "[[transparent eyeball]]".&lt;ref name=Robinson455&gt;Robinson, David. "The Career and Reputation of Christopher Pearse Cranch: An Essay in Biography and Bibliography" in ''Studies in the American Renaissance''. 1978: 455.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1864.

He died in 1892 and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Massachusetts.

A large proportion of living species on Earth live a [[parasitic]] way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(98)00153-2 |author=Windsor DA| year =1998| title = Most of the species on Earth are parasites| journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume =28 |issue=12 |pages =1939–1941 |pmid=9925276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parasites have traditionally been seen as targets of eradication efforts, and they have often been overlooked in conservation efforts. In the case of parasites living in the wild – and thus harmless to humans and domesticated animals – this view is changing.

==Endangered parasite species==

A note published in 1990 pointed out that the [[captive breeding]] and [[reintroduction]] program to save the [[black-footed ferret]] would cause the loss of its specific parasites and demanded ''"equal rights for parasites!"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1038/348104c0 |author=Windsor DA| year =1990| title = Heavenly hosts| journal = Nature | volume =348 |issue=6297 |pages =104 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper in 1992 warned that not only the loss of certain host species from the wild, but host [[population bottleneck]]s or the [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of host populations would predictably lead to the extinction of host-specific parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Rózsa L| year =1992| title = Endangered parasite species| journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume =22 |issue=3 |pages =265–266 |pmid=1639560 | url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/endangered%20parasite%20species.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(05)80002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also noted that parasites exert selective pressures upon their host populations that increase host genetic diversity. At first, this view met with open scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0020-7519(94)90199-6 |vauthors=Bush AO, Kennedy CR | year =1994| title = Host fragmentation and helminth parasites: Hedging your bets against extinction| journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume =24 |issue= 8 |pages =1333–1343 |pmid= 7729985}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it became clear that the co-extinction of hosts and their specific parasites is likely to increase the current estimates of extinction rates significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |doi= 10.1038/366307a0 |vauthors=Stork NE, Lyal CH | year =1993| title = Extinction or 'co-extinction' rates?| journal = Nature| volume = 366 |issue= 6453|pages =307–8 |pmid= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, a study focusing on highly host-specific groups such as [[fig wasp]]s, parasites, butterflies, and [[Myrmecophily|myrmecophil]] butterflies estimated the number of parasites put at risk by the endangered status of the host at about 6300.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Koh LP, Dunn RR, Sodhi NS, Colwell RK, Proctor HC, Smith VS | year =2004| title = Species Coextinctions and the Biodiversity Crisis| journal = Science| volume = 305 |issue= 5690|pages = 1632–1634 |pmid= 15361627 |doi= 10.1126/science.1101101 | url=http://www.unalmed.edu.co/~poboyca/documentos/documentos1/Biolog%EDa_Conservacion/03_2008/Polania/Set_03/Koh%20et%20al%202004%20extinction.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors argued that host-specific parasite faunae have an unexpected advantage for conservation scientists.

A recent study on parasites of [[coral reef]] [[fish]] suggested that extinction of a coral reef fish species would eventually result in the [[coextinction]] of at least ten species of parasites. Although this number might seem high, the study included only large parasites such as [[parasitic worms]] and [[crustacean]]s, but not microparasites such as [[Myxosporea]] and [[Microsporidia]].&lt;ref&gt;Justine, J.-L., Beveridge, I., Boxshall, G.

Additionally, ''[[Columbicola extinctus]]'' is a parasite of the extinct [[passenger pigeon]] (''Ectopistes migratorius''). However, recent taxonomic studies show that it is conspecific with the lice living on [[band-tailed pigeon]] (''Columba fasciata''), thus it is not extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Clayton | first =Dale H. |author2=Roger D.

==Deliberate extermination==

Naturally, medical and veterinary sciences have attempted to exterminate parasites and pathogens living in [[humans]] and in [[domesticated animal]]s. In the case of a few highly host-specific pathogens, this means the extinction of the entire pathogen species. Throughout human history, however, only one species, the [[smallpox]] virus, has been wholly eradicated. The last reported cases of smallpox occurred 1978. However, secure samples are known to still exist in the United States and Russia, purportedly for defensive purposes such as developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, as well as for diagnostic tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|title=How terrorism prevented smallpox being wiped off the face of the planet for ever|publisher=The Independent |date=2002-01-03|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-terrorism-prevented-smallpox-being-wiped-off-the-face-of-the-planet-for-ever-672121.html|accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |year=2007|volume=334|issue=7597|title=Should the US and Russia destroy their stocks of the smallpox virus?|last=Hammond|first=Edward |doi=10.1136/bmj.39155.695255.94 |pmc=1851992 |pmid=17431261 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/774 |pages=774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |year=2007|volume=334|issue=7597|title=Should the US and Russia destroy their stocks of smallpox virus? |last=Agwunobi|first=John O.|doi=10.1136/bmj.39156.490799.BE|pmc=1851995|pmid=17431262|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/775|pages=775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known, but is speculated that these countries may have shared their samples with some of their allies during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Rózsa L, Nixdorff K 2006. Biological weapons in non-Soviet Warsaw Pact countries. In: Wheelis M et al. (eds.) ''Deadly cultures: biological weapons since 1945.'' Cambridge, US: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second, potential candidate for deliberate extermination is ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'', the guinea worm. Once widespread across some 20 nations of Africa and Asia, the parasite today survives only in four of the countries of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with only a few hundred known cases of infection in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/mini_site/index.html | title=The Carter Center Guinea Worm Disease Eradication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalent [[civil wars]] in the region, such as the [[War in Darfur]], by preventing safe access to medical aid, have resulted in the survival of this species up to the present.

[[File:Daegu hyanggyo myeongnyundang context.jpg|thumb|Myeongnyundang lecture hall at the Daegu Hyanggyo]]

The '''Daegu Hyanggyo''' (a [[hyanggyo]] is a state-sponsored academy where students studied [[Confucianism]] and prepared for the [[gwageo]], civil service examinations during the Goryeo Dynasty ,918-1392, and Joseon Dynasty, 1392 - 1910) was founded in 1398 during the reign [[Joseon]] Dynasty King [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]]. During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Second Japanese Invasion in 1592]] it was completely burned down. In 1599 the [[Daegu]] Hyanggyo was rebuilt near Dalseong Park but was relocated to the original 1398 site of Dalseong Park in 1605&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/south-korea/daegu/sightseeing-in-daegu/daegu-hyanggyo-confucian-academy-daegu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220054927/http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/south-korea/daegu/sightseeing-in-daegu/daegu-hyanggyo-confucian-academy-daegu.html |archivedate=2009-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then back to the Gyodong area again. 1932 saw the hyanggyo again relocated to its present location in Namsandong, just south of downtown Daegu.&lt;ref name="english.daegu.go.kr"&gt;http://english.daegu.go.kr/Tourism/Tour/view.asp?table=dg_Tour&amp;item_no=175&amp;tour_cat_id=1&amp;tour_subcat_id=6&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973 Hyanggyo at Daegu underwent a full restoration.&lt;ref name="AHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/koreasouth/daegu/daeguhyanggyo.php|title=Asian Historical Architecture: A Photographic Survey|first=|last=orientalarchitecture.com|website=www.orientalarchitecture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main buildings in the hyanggyo, Myeongyundang, the lecture hall and Daeseongjeon, the Confucian shrine hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.knutimes.com/news/article.html?no=675 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229030741/http://www.knutimes.com/news/article.html?no=675 |archive-date=2012-02-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original traditional layout of a hyanggyo has the Daeseongjeon located in front of Myeongnyundang as it was when first built. Today the layout finds the Daeseongjeon centered in the north, facing the wide courtyard, with the Myeongnyundang found to the right of Daeseongjeon when entering.

Daeseongjeon houses memorial tablets where every year in the 2nd and 8th [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] month a ritual called [[Seokjeon-daejae]] is conducted honoring [[Confucius]] and famous Confucian scholars of Daegu. Myeongnyundang now serves as a classroom where lectures and lesson on old Chinese characters and traditional Korean etiquette is taught. On weekends and holidays traditional Korean weddings are held at garden on the complex grounds.&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;

Daeseongjeon is designated as City of Daegu Local Cultural Material #1.&lt;ref name="english.daegu.go.kr"/&gt;

'''Sir David Roxbee Cox''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FBA|FRSE}} (born 15 July 1924) is a prominent British statistician.

== Early life and education ==
Cox was born in [[Birmingham]]. His father was a [[die (manufacturing)|die]] sinker and part-owner of a jewellery shop, and they lived near the [[Jewellery Quarter]]. He attended [[Handsworth Grammar School]].&lt;ref name="ukdata"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneer detail: David Cox|url=https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/teaching-resources/pioneers/pioneer-detail?id=pioneer_people_cox|website=[[UK Data Service]]|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cox studied mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and obtained his [[Ph.D.|PhD]] from the [[University of Leeds]] in 1949, advised by [[Henry Daniels]] and [[Bernard Welch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=70804 entry] at [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
He was employed from 1944 to 1946 at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], from 1946 to 1950 at the [[Wool Industries Research Association]] in Leeds,&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; and from 1950 to 1956 worked at the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. From 1956 to 1966 he was Reader and then Professor of Statistics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, London]]. In 1966, he took up the Chair position in Statistics at [[Imperial College London]] where he later became head of the mathematics department. In 1988 he became Warden of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] and a member of the Department of Statistics at Oxford University. He formally retired from these positions in 1994.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Cox has received numerous [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]], including from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been awarded the [[Guy Medal]]s in Silver (1961) and Gold (1973) of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. He was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1973, was [[Knight bachelor|knighted]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=50221 |date=6 August 1985 |page=10815}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an Honorary Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2000. He is a Foreign Associate of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]]. In 1990, he won the [[Kettering Prize]] and Gold Medal for Cancer Research for "the development of the Proportional Hazard Regression Model." In 2010 he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society "for his seminal contributions to the theory and applications of statistics."&lt;ref name=royalsociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/people/david-cox-11275/ |title=David Cox| publisher=[[The Royal Society]]| access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the first ever recipient of the [[International Prize in Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Talley |first=Jill |date=19 October 2016 |title=International Prize in Statistics Awarded to Sir David Cox for Survival Analysis Model Applied in Medicine, Science, and Engineering |url=http://statprize.org/pdfs/Press-Release-International-Prize-Winner.pdf |location= |publisher=American Statistical Association |agency= |access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Cox was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rse.org.uk/fellow/david-cox/|title=Sir David Cox FRS, HonFBA, HonFRSE - The Royal Society of Edinburgh|work=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has supervised, collaborated with, and encouraged many younger researchers now prominent in statistics. He has served as President of the [[Bernoulli Society]], of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], and of the [[International Statistical Institute]]. He is an Honorary Fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and is a member of the Department of Statistics at the [[University of Oxford]].

He has made pioneering and important contributions to numerous areas of statistics and applied probability, of which the best known are:
* [[Logistic Regression]], which is employed when the variable to be predicted is  [[categorical variable|categorical]] (i.e., can take a limited number of values, e.g., gender, US census race),  binary (a special case of categorical with only two values - e.g., success/failure, disease/no disease), or [[ordinal variable|ordinal]], where the categories can be ranked (e.g., pain intensity can be absent, mild, moderate, severe, unbearable). Cox's 1958 paper &lt;ref name=cox58reg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=DR|title=The regression analysis of binary sequences (with discussion)|journal=J Roy Stat Soc B|date=1958|volume=20|pages=215–242|jstor=2983890}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the case of binary logistic regression.
* The [[proportional hazards model]], which is widely used in the analysis of survival data.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Cox-British-statistician| title=Sir David Cox, British statistician| access-date=11 October 2016|date=13 February 2015| first=Erik |last=Gregersen| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is survival times in medical research that can be related to information about the patients such as age, diet or exposure to certain chemical substances. 
* The [[Cox process]] was named after him.

He has won the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the Basic Sciences category jointly with [[Bradley Efron]], for the development of “pioneering and hugely influential” statistical methods that have proved indispensable for obtaining reliable results in a vast spectrum of disciplines from medicine to astrophysics, genomics or particle physics.

== Personal life ==
In 1948, Cox married Joyce Drummond.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} They have four children and two grandchildren.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19194">[[Image:Nanzenji.jpg|thumb|275 px|right|Kyoto's Nanzen-ji was the supervisor of the whole Five Mountain System in Japan]]
{{ZenBuddhism}}
The {{nihongo|'''Five Mountains and Ten Monasteries System'''|五山十刹制度|Chinese: ''Wushan Shicha'', Japanese: ''Gozan Jissetsu Seido''}} system, more commonly called simply ''Five Mountain System'', was a network of state-sponsored [[Chan Buddhism|Chan (Zen)]] Buddhist temples created in China during the [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279). The term "mountain" in this context means "temple" or "monastery", and was adopted because many monasteries were built on isolated mountains. The system originated in India and was later adopted also in [[Japan]] during the late [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333).&lt;ref name="inj"/&gt;  

In Japan, the ten existing "Five Mountain" temples (five in [[Kyoto]] and five in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]]) were both protected and controlled by the shogunate.&lt;ref name="inj"&gt;Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten, ''Gozan''.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, they became a sort of governmental bureaucracy that helped the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] stabilize the country during the turbulent [[Nanboku-chō period]]. Below the ten ''Gozan'' temples there were ten so-called {{nihongo|''Jissetsu''|十刹}} temples, followed by another network called {{nihongo|''Shozan''|諸山|lit. many temples}}.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; The terms ''Gozan'' and Five Mountain System are used both for the ten temples at the top and for the Five Mountain System network in general, including the ''Jissetsu'' and the ''Shozan''.

There used to be in Kamakura a parallel "Five Mountain System" of nunneries called {{nihongo|''Amagozan''|尼五山}}, of which the famous [[Tōkei-ji]] is the only survivor.&lt;ref name="Harada41"/&gt;

== The system in China ==
At the time of the Song dynasty, Chan (Japanese ''Zen'') was the dominant form of monasticism and had considerable imperial support.&lt;ref name="John271"&gt;Johnston (2000:271)&lt;/ref&gt; This forced it to assume certain features and develop a network of monastic offices and rituals wanted by the state.&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; Around the 12th century, this tendency to monastic wealth and imperial patronage became even more pronounced with the creation by direct imperial order in [[South China]] of the Five Mountain and Ten Monasteries System during the late Southern Song (1127–1279).&lt;ref name="Harada41"&gt;Harada (2007:41)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; It was a system of state-sponsored temples and monasteries built to pray to the gods for the dynasty and the state, which was threatened by enemies from Northern China.&lt;ref name="Harada41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; The system had at its top five famous temples and ten lesser ones immediately below.&lt;ref name="Harada41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; Officials chose both the five temples of the top tier, and the chief priest that ruled over them.&lt;ref name="Harada41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; 

The system was devised specifically to bureaucratize and control the power of the Chan temples, a power which had been growing with the years and worried the central government.&lt;ref name="Harada41"/&gt; The consequent submission of the Chan network to imperial power and its goals is evident in later codes, particularly in the ''Baizhang qinggui'' compiled in 1336.&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; Because the conquering [[Mongols]] financially supported Chan, the code emphasizes prayers for the emperor and the monastic ancestors&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; The emperor is even described as a [[nirmanakaya]], or incarnate Buddha.&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; The complex monastic bureaucracy described by the code clearly reflects the imperial administration with its eastern and western ranks.&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt; The code has been in continuous use ever since, and not only within Chan Buddhism.&lt;ref name="John271"/&gt;

== The system in Japan ==
Introduced to Japan by the [[Shikken|Hōjō regency]], after an initial hostility from older and established Buddhist sects, it prospered thanks to the support of the country's military rulers in Kamakura first and Kyoto later.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; In the final version of the system, Kamakura's Five Mountains were, from the first-ranked to the last, [[Kenchō-ji]], [[Engaku-ji]],  [[Jufuku-ji]], [[Jōchi-ji]] and [[Jōmyō-ji (Kamakura)|Jōmyō-ji]]. Kyoto's Five Mountains, created later by the Ashikaga shogunate after the collapse of the [[Kamakura shogunate|Kamakura regime]], were [[Tenryū-ji]], [[Shōkoku-ji]], [[Kennin-ji]], [[Tōfuku-ji]] and  [[Manju-ji]]. Above them all was the huge [[Nanzen-ji]] temple. Below the top tier there was a nationwide capillary network of smaller temples that allowed its influence to be felt everywhere.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;Dunn (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
The system was adopted to promote Zen in Japan however, in Japan as it had already happened in China, it was controlled and used by the country's ruling class for its own administrative and political ends.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; The ''Gozan'' system allowed the temples at the top to function as ''de facto'' ministries, using their nationwide network of temples for the distribution of government laws and norms, and for the monitoring of local conditions for their military superiors.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; The Hōjō first, and the Ashikaga later were therefore able to disguise their power under a religious mask, while monks and priests worked for the government as translators, diplomats and advisers.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; To the Rinzai sect, the collaboration with the shogunate brought wealth, influence and political clout.

=== History ===
The system had come to Japan at a time when Kamakura's five great Zen temples were already known as the Five Mountains, and it unified in one organization all the great temples of the dominant Zen schools of the time.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"&gt;Dumoulin (2005:151-165&lt;/ref&gt; It thus institutionalized a large and very important part of the [[Rinzai]] school, bringing to it the protection, but also the control of the state.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; The whole network of temples was supervised by a state bureaucracy created specifically for the task.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;

The system in its final form had three tiers, with at the top Kyoto's Five Mountains (the {{nihongo|''Kyoto Gozan''|京都五山}}, known in English also as Kyoto's ''Five Zen Temples'') and Kamakura's Five Mountains (the {{nihongo|''Kamakura Gozan''|鎌倉五山}}, in a subordinate position).&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; Below them were the so-called Ten Temples, or ''Jissetsu'', with at the bottom other temples collectively known as ''Shozan''.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;

The ''Gozan'' temples were dominated mainly by the [[Rinzai]] Zen schools. The {{nihongo|Kōchi-ha|宏智派}} branch of the [[Sōtō]] Zen school however belonged to the ''Gozan'' system too.  

Under their masters' patronage, the Five Mountain temples gradually became centers of learning and developed a characteristic literature called the [[Japanese Literature of the Five Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; During the Japanese [[Middle Ages]], its scholars exerted a far-reaching influence on the internal political affairs of the country. The system put great value in a strong orientation towards Chinese Zen, Chinese philosophy and Chinese literature. The organization's scholars had a close relationship with the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] imperial dynasty, had a pervasive influence in many cultural fields and played an important role in importing [[Neo-Confucianism]] (particularly as far as the ''[[shushigaku]]'' (朱子学) is concerned) from China to Japan.

==== Birth of the ''Gozan'' ====
At the end of the [[Kamakura period]] (1333) the four temples of [[Kennin-ji]], [[Kenchō-ji]], [[Engaku-ji]] and [[Jufuku-ji]], were already known as the ''Gozan'', but not much is otherwise known about the system, its structure and the hierarchical order.&lt;ref name="inj"/&gt; 

The first official recognition of the system came from Emperor [[Go-Daigo]] during the brief [[Kenmu Restoration]] (1333–1336). Go-Daigo added the ''Kyoto Gozan'' to the existing temples in Kamakura with [[Daitoku-ji]] and [[Nanzen-ji]] together at the top as number 1, followed by [[Kennin-ji]] and [[Tōfuku-ji]]. At this point in time, in spite of their name, the ''Gozan'' were not five but four in both cities.&lt;ref name="inj"/&gt; At the beginning of [[Muromachi period]], they became five in Kyoto later, when [[Ashikaga Takauji]] built [[Tenryū-ji]] in memory of Go-Daigo.

==== The early ranking system ====
The first explicit formulation of a clear ''Gozan'' ranking system dates to the year 1341.

|[[Jōchi-ji]], Kamakura
|-
|}

The system was modified again many times according to the preferences of the government and of the Imperial Household.

==== The ''Ankoku-ji'' system ====
[[File:Tenryuji Kyoto01n4500.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Japanese garden|zen garden]]'' that Musō Soseki built  at [[Tenryū-ji]], head of the Kyoto ''Gozan'']]
From their base cities of Kamakura and Kyoto, the twin Five Mountains Systems had great influence over the entire country.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; Following the advice of [[Musō Soseki]], shōgun [[Ashikaga Takauji]] and his brother [[Ashikaga Tadayoshi]] decided to strengthen the system through the building in every province of an {{nihongo|''Ankoku-ji''|安国寺|Temple for National Pacification}} and a {{nihongo|''[[Rishō-tō]]''|利生塔|[[Pagoda]] for the welfare of sentient beings}}.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;

These were dedicated to the memory of the dead of the [[Genkō War]] of 1331-3, war in which Emperor Go-Daigo broke the power of the [[Hōjō clan|Hōjō]] clan. [[Emperor Kōgon]] promulgated in 1345 an edict for the deployment of the new system, and from 1362 to 1367 the temples and the pagodas were built in 66 provinces.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;

The ''Ankoku-ji'' network was tightly controlled by Ashikaga [[shugo]] (Governors) and was associated with the ''Gozan'' system.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;  The ''Rishō-tō'' were direct property of the ''Gozan'', with the exception of those associated with the Ashikaga, which were connected to powerful temples of non-Rinzai schools, mainly of the [[Shingon]], [[Tendai]] and [[Risshū]] sects.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;

Both brothers died early (Tadayoshi in 1352, according to the [[Taiheiki]] of poisoning, and Takauji in 1358 of cancer), so they couldn't couldn't oversee the system's creation until its end.

The system was completed under [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] when he was 10 years old. During his father [[Ashikaga Yoshiakira]]'s regency, who was until his death busy with the war with the [[Southern Court]], the Ashikaga governors had become however strong and independent warlords. Even though as a consequence the provinces didn't accept any more the oversight of the ''Gozan'' and of the [[shogunate]], the ''Gozan/Ankoku-ji'' system remained a valuable instrument to control the various Zen sects.

==== The final form of the ''Gozan'' system ====
[[Image:Kenchoji Main Complex.jpg|thumb|200 px|The ''[[garan]]'' at [[Kenchō-ji]], head of the Kamakura ''Gozan'']]
After the completion of [[Shōkoku-ji]] by Yoshimitsu in 1386 a new ranking system was created with [[Nanzen-ji]] at the top and in a class of its own.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; Nanzen-ji had the title of "First Temple of The Land" and played a supervising role.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; 

{| class="wikitable" 
| colspan="3" align="center" | [[Nanzen-ji]]
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
!&lt;small&gt;Kyoto&lt;/small&gt;
!&lt;small&gt;Kamakura&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|First Rank
|[[Tenryū-ji]]
|[[Kenchō-ji]]
|-
|Second Rank 
|[[Shōkoku-ji]]
|[[Engaku-ji]]
|-
|Third Rank
|[[Kennin-ji]]
|[[Jufuku-ji]]
|-
|Fourth Rank
|[[Tōfuku-ji]]
|[[Jōchi-ji]]
|-
|Fifth Rank
|[[Manju-ji]]
|[[Jōmyō-ji (Kamakura)|Jōmyō-ji]]
|-
|}

This structure then remained more or less unchanged for the rest of the system's history.&lt;ref name="inj"/&gt;

==== The ''Jissetsu'' ====
The ''Jissetsu'', second tier of the Five Mountain system, was created to be hierarchically under the ''Gozan'', but developed slowly towards an independent system.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; The temples of this rank were in general powerful institutions of great prestige and had to help the military government financially and in other ways.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; 

During the Kenmu restoration temples like [[Jōmyō-ji (Kamakura)|Jōmyō-ji]] in [[Sagami Province]] and {{nihongo|Manju-ji|万寿寺}} in [[Bungo Province]] were already part of the system, which is therefore assumed to have been born during the late Kamakura period.&lt;ref name="inj2"&gt;Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten, ''Jissetsu''&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing else is known however about the character and structure of the system at the time. In 1341 the system included Jōmyō-ji, {{nihongo|Zenkō-ji|禅興寺}}, [[Tōshō-ji]] and Manju-ji in Sagami province, Manju-ji, {{nihongo|Shinnyō-ji|真如寺}}, and {{nihongo|[[Ankoku-ji]]|安国寺}} in [[Yamashiro Province]], {{nihongo|Chōraku-ji|長楽寺}} in [[Kōzuke Province]], {{nihongo|Shōfuku-ji|聖福寺}} in [[Chikuzen Province]] and Manju-ji in Bungo.&lt;ref name="inj2"/&gt; 

After many changes, in 1386 the system was divided in half between the ''Kantō Jissetsu'', that is the temples under the ''Kamakura Gozan'', and the ''Kyoto Jissetsu'', that is the temples under the ''Kyoto Gozan''.&lt;ref name="inj2"/&gt; 

The Kyoto ''Jissetsu'' were then {{nihongo|[[Tōji-in]]|等持院}}, {{nihongo|Rinsen-ji|臨川寺}}, {{nihongo|Shinnyō-ji|真如寺}}, {{nihongo|[[Ankoku-ji]]|安国寺}}, {{nihongo|Hōdō-ji|宝幢寺}}, {{nihongo|Fumon-ji|普門寺}}, {{nihongo|Kōkaku-ji|広覚寺}}, {{nihongo|Myōkō-ji|妙光寺}}, {{nihongo|[[Daitoku-ji]]|大徳寺}} and {{nihongo|Ryūshō-ji|竜翔寺}}.&lt;ref name="inj2"/&gt;
 
The ''Kantō Jissetsu'' were {{nihongo|Zenkō-ji|禅興寺}}, {{nihongo|[[Zuisen-ji]]|瑞泉寺}}, {{nihongo|[[Tōshō-ji]]|東勝寺}}, {{nihongo|Manju-ji|万寿寺}}, {{nihongo|Taikei-ji|大慶寺}},   {{nihongo|Zenpuku-ji|善福寺}}, and {{nihongo|Hōsen-ji|法泉寺}} in Sagami, plus {{nihongo|Kōsei-ji|興聖寺}} in [[Mutsu Province]], {{nihongo|Tōzen-ji|東漸寺}} in [[Musashi Province]] and {{nihongo|Chōraku-ji|長楽寺}} in Kōzuke.&lt;ref name="inj2"/&gt;

Later, the term ''Jissetsu'' lost its original meaning and became just a rank. Consequently, at the end of the Middle Ages it included over 60 temples.&lt;ref name="inj2"/&gt;

====The ''Shozan''====
The third and lowest tier was that of the so-called ''Shozan'', sometimes also called {{nihongo|''kassatsu'', ''kōsatsu'' or ''kassetsu''|甲刹}} as the corresponding tier of the Chinese state-sponsored temple system.&lt;ref name="sho"/&gt; These last terms are however normally used only in writing for elegance.&lt;ref name="ka2"&gt;Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten, ''Kassatsu''&lt;/ref&gt; The term in China meant "first in rank" in a certain province, but in Japan this meaning was lost.&lt;ref name="ka2"/&gt; 

We know that in 1321 Sagami province's {{nihongo|Sūju-ji|崇寿寺}} and in 1230 [[Higo Province]]'s {{nihongo|Jushō-ji|寿勝寺}} were part of the system, which therefore must be older.&lt;ref name="sho"&gt;Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten, ''Shozan''&lt;/ref&gt; More temples from all parts of the country were added later during the Kemmu restoration. Unlike the ''Gozan'' and the ''Jissetsu'', the ''Shozan'' were not ordered hierarchically and there were no limits to their number, which consequently grew until more than 230 temples belonged to the system.&lt;ref name="sho"/&gt; A Zen chief priest (a {{nihongo|''jūji''|住持}}) in his career would usually rise from the ''Shozan'' to the ''Jissetsu'' and finally to the ''Gozan''.&lt;ref name="sho"/&gt;

==The ''Rinka''==
Apart from the ''Gozan'' temples, there were also many others in the provinces called {{nihongo|''Rinka''|林下|the forest below}}, among them [[Sōtō]]'s [[Eihei-ji]] founded by [[Dōgen]], and Rinzai's [[Daitoku-ji]], [[Myōshin-ji]] and [[Kōgen-ji]], which were not under the direct control of the state. During Japan's Middle Ages, the ''Rinka'' monasteries were Zen's other main branch.&lt;ref name="Keene"&gt;William Theodore De Bary, [[Donald Keene]], George Tanabe, Paul Varley (2005:310 – 311)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Five Mountain temples, they placed little emphasis on Chinese culture, were run by less well-educated monks who preferred ''[[zazen]]'' and ''[[kōan]]'' to poetry.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt; Rinka Zen prospered among the lower layers of the warrior, merchant and peasant castes, who saw religion as a means to achieve simple worldly goals such as profits and exorcisms.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;

The very lack of political connection which had hampered them at the beginning of their history was however the reason why they prospered later. During the slow decline of Ashikaga authority, and particularly after the catastrophic [[Ōnin war]], in the latter half of the [[Muromachi period]], because the ''Rinka'' had a close relationship with local [[warlord]]s, they became progressively more important and influential than the ''Gozan'', which followed their Ashikaga masters in their decline.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keene"/&gt; A measure of the success of the ''Rinka'' is given by the fact that today's ''Sōtō'' and ''Rinzai'' sects emerged from ''Rinka'' Zen.&lt;ref name="Keene"/&gt;

[[File:Göttingen-SUB-Encyclopedia.Americana.JPG|thumb|An [[encyclopedia]] is a repository of general knowledge]]

'''General knowledge''' has been defined in [[differential psychology]] as "culturally valued [[knowledge]] communicated by a range of non-specialist media" and encompassing a wide subject range.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Richard |author2=Irwing, P. |author3=Cammock, T.|title=Sex differences in general knowledge|journal=Intelligence|year=2002|volume=30|pages=27–39|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289601000642|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition excludes highly specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium. General knowledge is an important component of [[crystallized intelligence]] and is strongly associated with [[G factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]], and with [[openness to experience]].&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Bates and A. Shieles. (2003). Crystallized Intelligence as a product of Speed and Drive for Experience: The Relationship of Inspection Time and Openness to g and Gc. ''Intelligence'', '''31''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00176-9 275-287]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=semantic_memory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwing |first=Paul |author2=Cammock, Tommy |author3=Lynn, Richard |title=Some evidence for the existence of a general factor of semantic memory and its components |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |year=2001 |volume=30 |pages=857–871 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/some-evidence-for-the-existence-of-a-general-factor-of-semantic-memory-and-its-components/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128130248/http://www.mendeley.com/research/some-evidence-for-the-existence-of-a-general-factor-of-semantic-memory-and-its-components/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-28 |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00078-7 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rolfhus&amp;ackerman" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ackerman2001 /&gt; General knowledge is thought to be supported by long-term [[semantic memory]] ability.&lt;ref name=semantic_memory /&gt;


==Scope==
Differential psychology researchers define general knowledge as "culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media."&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt; The scope of this definition includes all areas of knowledge available to laypersons without requiring extensive training. The definition excludes "ephemera", or information confined to a single medium, such as television sitcoms. Researchers have identified 20 domains of knowledge that meet the above criteria:&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Popular music" and "jazz and blues" had originally been a single element, but factor analysis suggested that they were better considered as distinct domains.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-begin}}


*[[Art]]
*[[Biology]]
*[[Classical music]]
*[[Cooking|Cookery]]
*Discovery and exploration
*[[Fashion]]
*[[Film]]
*[[Finance]]

*[[Music]]
*[[Politics]]

*[[Sport]]
*[[Technology]]
*[[Television]]
{{col-end}}
Researchers have acknowledged that other domains of general knowledge may exist. Factor analysis suggested that the 20 domains could be categorised into six factors: current affairs, fashion, family, physical health and recreation, arts, and science. All six of these factors were highly intercorrelated (i.e. people who scored high in a particular domain tended to score highly in most other domains) and were all related to a single higher-order general knowledge factor. The existence of a single general factor suggests that individual differences across a range of knowledge domains may have both common causes and specific influences; interest in a particular area and educational course content appear to be important contributors.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rolfhus&amp;ackerman" /&gt;

==Individual differences==

===Intelligence===
High scorers on tests of general knowledge tend to also score highly on intelligence tests. [[IQ]] has been found to robustly predict general knowledge scores even after accounting for differences in age, sex, and [[five factor model]] personality traits.&lt;ref name=Furnham2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chamorro /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnham2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham|first=Adrian |author2=Swami, Viren |author3=Arteche, Adriane |author4=[[Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic|Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas]]|title=Cognitive ability, learning approaches and personality correlates of general knowledge|journal=Educational Psychology|year=2008|volume=28|pages=427–437|doi=10.1080/01443410701727376|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] of intelligence, general knowledge is considered a component of crystallized intelligence. Standardized IQ tests may therefore include measures of general knowledge, such as in the information subtest of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]].&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt;

General knowledge is also moderately associated with verbal ability, though only weakly or not at all with numerical and spatial ability.&lt;ref name="rolfhus&amp;ackerman" /&gt; As with crystallized intelligence, general knowledge has been found to increase with age.&lt;ref name=Furnham2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham|first=Adrian|last2=Christopher|first2=Andrew N.|last3=Garwood|first3=Jeanette|last4=Martin|first4=G. Neil|title=Approaches to learning and the acquisition of general knowledge|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=43|pages=1563–1571|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886907001638|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.04.013|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term semantic memory===
Research has found positive relationships between different domains of knowledge, suggesting that individuals who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain usually have a good [[long-term memory]] for factual information in general.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rolfhus&amp;ackerman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolfhus|first=Eric L.|author2=Ackerman, Phillip L.|title=Assessing individual differences in knowledge: Knowledge, intelligence, and related traits|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1999|volume=91|pages=511–526|url=http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~broberts/Rolfhus%20&amp;%20Ackerman,%201999.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.3.511|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the positive intercorrelations between knowledge domains, individual differences in general knowledge may reflect differences in ability to retrieve information from long-term [[semantic memory]].&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt; A general factor of long-term semantic memory could be explained by the existence of an underlying [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] process responsible for retaining information in long-term memory. Individual differences in the efficiency of such processes might explain why all domains of semantic memory appear to be intercorrelated.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt;

===Personality===
People high in general knowledge tend to be highly [[openness to experience|open to new experiences]]&lt;ref name=Furnham2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham|first=Adrian|author2=Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas |authorlink2=Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic |title=Personality, intelligence, and general knowledge|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2006|volume=16|pages=79–90|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/personality-intelligence-general-knowledge/|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2005.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chamorro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Furnham, Adrian|author3=Ackerman, Phillip L.|title=Ability and personality correlates of general knowledge|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2006|volume=41|pages=419–429|url=http://jupiter.gold.ac.uk/media/ChamorroPremuzicFunrhamAckerman2006PAID.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.036|issue=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426065554/http://jupiter.gold.ac.uk/media/ChamorroPremuzicFunrhamAckerman2006PAID.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnham2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnham2007 /&gt; and in [[typical intellectual engagement]].&lt;ref name=chamorro /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnham2008 /&gt; The relationship between openness to experience and general knowledge remains robust even when IQ is taken into account.&lt;ref name=Furnham2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnham2008 /&gt; People high in openness may be more motivated to engage in intellectual pursuits that increase their knowledge.&lt;ref name=Furnham2008 /&gt; Relationships between general knowledge and other [[five factor model]] traits tend to be weak and inconsistent. Though one study found that [[extraversion]] and [[neuroticism]] were negatively [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with general knowledge,&lt;ref name=chamorro /&gt; others found that they were unrelated.&lt;ref name=Furnham2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnham2007 /&gt; Inconsistent results have also been found for [[conscientiousness]].{{refn|[[Adrian Furnham|Furnham]] et al.&lt;ref name=Furnham2006 /&gt; found positive correlations with general knowledge in his first and third studies, but no significant relationship in his second.

=== Differences===
Research has found that on average males tend to score higher than females on tests of overall general knowledge and in most domains of knowledge tested.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ackerman2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=Phillip L.|last2=Bowen|first2=Kristy R.|last3=Beier|first3=Margaret E.|last4=Kanfer|first4=Ruth|title=Determinants of individual differences and gender differences in knowledge|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2001|volume=93|pages=797–825|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/determinants-individual-differences-gender-differences-knowledge-5/|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.93.4.797|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynn2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Richard|author2=Irwing, Paul|title=Sex differences in general knowledge, semantic memory and reasoning ability|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=2002|volume=93|pages=545–556|url=http://faki.fizteh.ru/study/3course/f_3lyiq3/f_3jnlol/f_btts|doi=10.1348/000712602761381394|pmid=12519533|issue=Pt 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=German/&gt; Males also score higher than females on the information subtest of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]]&lt;ref name="Lynn2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Sluis|first=Sophie|last2=Posthuma|first2=Danielle|last3=Dolan|first3=Conor V.|last4=de Geus|first4=Eco J.

In a comparison between male and female university students in 19 domains of [[academic]] knowledge, males had greater knowledge in 14 domains, especially in [[physical science]] and [[technology]], but also in [[humanities]] and [[civics]].&lt;ref name=ackerman2001 /&gt; A general knowledge composite across all 19 tests showed a male advantage of medium effect size. A study of university students in [[Northern Ireland]] found that males scored higher in general knowledge than females, as well as in 12 of 19 specific knowledge domains. Females scored moderately higher than males in medicine and cookery. The authors of this study suggested that this male advantage most likely reflects differences in interests rather than differences in verbal or memory ability.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001" /&gt; Similar results were found in a study of [[Germany|German]] high school students.&lt;ref name=German&gt;

Male advantages in general knowledge are not attributable to differences between males and females in reasoning ability (i.e. [[fluid intelligence]]), [[socio-economic status]], or exposure to school course content.&lt;ref name=Lynn2002 /&gt; Although males appear to have greater general knowledge, there is some evidence that females tend to have an advantage in "autobiographical" knowledge, or memory of personal experiences.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001"/&gt; While general knowledge is supported by semantic memory, autobiographical knowledge is supported by [[episodic memory]], which is not tested in intelligence tests&lt;ref name="Lynn2001"/&gt; and tends to be difficult to measure because of the uniquely personal nature of such memories.&lt;ref name=semantic_memory/&gt;

==Predictor of achievement==
A number of studies have assessed whether performance on a general knowledge test can predict achievement in particular areas, namely in academics,&lt;ref name=Furnham2009&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic achievement===
General knowledge has been found to predict exam results in a study of British schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=Furnham2009 /&gt; The study examined cognitive ability and personality predictors of exam performance and found that general knowledge was positively correlated with [[GCSE]] English, mathematics, and overall exam results. General knowledge test scores predicted exam results, even after controlling for IQ, five factor model personality traits, and learning styles.

===Proofreading===
General knowledge has been found to robustly predict proofreading skills in university students.&lt;ref name=proofreading/&gt; A study found that proofreading had a larger correlation with general knowledge than with general intelligence, verbal reasoning, or openness to experience. In a [[multiple regression|multiple regression analysis]] using general knowledge, general intelligence, verbal reasoning, five factor personality traits, and learning styles as predictors, only general knowledge was a significant predictor.

===Creativity===
General knowledge has been found to have weak associations with measures of creativity.&lt;ref name=creativity/&gt; In a study examining contributions of personality and intelligence to creativity, general knowledge was positively correlated with tests of [[divergent thinking]], but was unrelated to a biographical measure of creative achievement, self-rated creativity, or a composite measure of creativity. The relationship between general knowledge and divergent thinking became non-significant when controlling for fluid intelligence.

==Game shows and quizzes==
Many [[game shows]] use general knowledge questions. Game shows such as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' and ''[[Fifteen to One]]'' centre their questions on general knowledge, while others shows focus questions more on specific subjects. Some shows ask questions both on specific subjects and on general knowledge, including ''[[Eggheads (TV series)|Eggheads]]'' and ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|''Mastermind'']]''. In ''Mastermind'', contestants choose their own "specialist subject" before answering general knowledge questions, whereas in ''Eggheads'' the subjects are chosen at random.

'''Homo duplex''' is a  view promulgated by [[Émile Durkheim]], a macro-sociologist of the 19th century, saying that a man on the one hand is a biological organism, driven by instincts, with desire and appetite  and on the other hand is being led by morality and other elements generated by society. What allows a person to go beyond the "animal" nature is the most common religion that imposes specific normative system and is a way to regulate behaviour.

Left unchecked the individualism leads to a lifetime of seeking to slake selfish desires which leads to unhappiness and despair. On the other hand collective conscience serves as a check on the will. This is created by socialisation. Highly anomic societies are characterized by weak primary group ties—family, church, community, and other such groups.

==Quotes==
;Émile Durkheim
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Far from being simple, our inner life has something like a double centre of gravity. On the one hand is our individuality ... On the other is everything in us that expresses something other than ourselves. Not only are these two groups of states of consciousness different in their origins and their properties, but there is a true antagonism between them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;[[David Foster Wallace]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But the young educated adults of the 90s got to watch all this brave new individualism and self-expression and sexual freedom deteriorate into the joyless and anomic self-indulgence of the Me Generation. Today's sub-40s have different horrors, prominent among which are anomie and solipsism and a peculiarly American loneliness: the prospect of dying without once having loved something more than yourself.&lt;ref&gt;David Foster Wallace, Consider the Lobster and Other Essays&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] used these ideas in his essay ''Civilisation and its Discontents'', he wrote civilisation is created through restraint - is "built up upon a renunciation of instinct"&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/CivilizationAndItsDiscontents/freud_civilization_and_its_discontents_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10622">'''Irrealism''' is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality.  While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]], in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements.  If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word’s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of ''irreal'' gives it the same meaning as ''unreal'', ''irreal'' is very rarely used in comparison with ''unreal''.  Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the "not real," but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.

==Irrealism in Literature==

In literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist "new fiction" of writers such as [[Donald Barthelme]] or [[John Barth]].  More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only "offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it," and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end.  [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], in ''The Art of Fiction'', cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its "seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing."&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;   Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, "irrealism—not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism—is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s," &lt;ref&gt;(Bellamy 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; this did not prove to be the case.  Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.

In recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the magical realism of [[Gabriel García Márquez]]) and what the significance of this difference is.  This can be seen in Dean Swinford's essay ''Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility''.[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review1a.htm]  Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a "peculiar mode of postmodern allegory" that has resulted from modernity’s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory.  Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way.  Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings.  According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that "science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to [[epistemological]] and allegorical attempts to understand it."  Thus irreal works such as [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''Cosmicomics'' and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Ficciones'' can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity.  "The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system," writes Swinford, "and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration."

The online journal ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'' [http://www.cafeirreal.com/], on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G.S. and Alice Whittenburg, "After Kafka: Kafka Criticism and Scholarship as a Resource in an Attempt to Promulgate a New Literary Genre," ''Journal of the Kafka Society of America'', 31/32(1+2):18-26.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be [[Franz Kafka]]'s story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', in which the salesman [[Gregor Samsa]]'s plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect.  Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities.  Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality ("that which is beyond the real") that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject.  Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn't conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, "by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/what_is_irr.htm]  If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is "so many pointers to an unknown meaning," in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.

==Irrealism in Art==

Various writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art.  Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman's ''Languages of Art''.  Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled ''Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death''.

Garret [[Rowlan]], writing in ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'', writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]], "which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico's paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight's uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism's shimmering surface." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review4a.htm]

The writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section "Irrealism in Literature", wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting ''The Juggler'', "creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system."

Artist Tristan Tondino has made a number of claims about Irrealism.  Most of his claims are found in his paintings, many of which are [[Lettrist]] Abstractions. "There is no specific style to Irrealist Art.  It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor." &lt;ref&gt;Tondino 2003, ''Zot - Giving a Painter Crap...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the art journal ''the art life'' has recently detected the presence of a "New Irrealism" among the painters of that country, which is described as being an "approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes." What exactly constituted the "old" irrealism, they do not say.

== Irrealist Art, Film and Music Edition ==

Irrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist [[Frédéric Iriarte]]. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic [[Ilmar Laaban]], they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, "Irréalisation".

==Biography==
Heal is daughter of a pair of notable Oxford philosophers [[William Calvert Kneale]] and [[Martha Kneale|Martha Kneale (née Hurst)]]. She was educated at [[Oxford High School for Girls]] and [[New Hall, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Heal|year=2002|work=[[Contemporary Authors]]|publisher=Gale Group|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she read first History before changing to Philosophy (Moral Sciences) after two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Heal |url=http://www2.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/heal/heal_index.html |publisher=Faculty of Philosophy |accessdate=13 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213052612/http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/heal/heal_index.html |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took her PhD at Cambridge, working on problems in the philosophy of language. After two years of post-doctoral study in the US, at Princeton and Berkeley, she was appointed to a Lectureship at [[Newcastle University]].

After ten years at Newcastle, she returned to the [[University of Cambridge]] as a lecturer in 1986. She was awarded her personal professorship in 1999. In the same year she became the first female President of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref name="Cambridge first – News in brief"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/0F9298A14C9AF3BD/0DF73E411D70C6CA|title=Cambridge first – News in brief|date=June 5, 1999|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=26 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64yAQ29rQ?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action%3Ddoc%26p_theme%3Daggdocs%26p_topdoc%3D1%26p_docnum%3D1%26p_sort%3DYMD_date:D%26p_product%3DAWNB%26p_docid%3D0F9298A14C9AF3BD%26p_text_direct-0%3Ddocument_id%3D%28%200F9298A14C9AF3BD%20%29%26s_lang%3Den-US%26p_nbid%3DA5AL42LAMTMyNzU0NDY0NS41MzYyN|archivedate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving between 1 October 1999 and 2003.&lt;ref name="University news"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/0F92988A0159B637/0DF73E411D70C6CA|title=University news|date=May 18, 1999|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=26 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64yAXIK4Y?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action%3Ddoc%26p_theme%3Daggdocs%26p_topdoc%3D1%26p_docnum%3D1%26p_sort%3DYMD_date:D%26p_product%3DAWNB%26p_docid%3D0F92988A0159B637%26p_text_direct-0%3Ddocument_id%3D%28%200F92988A0159B637%20%29%26s_lang%3Den-US%26p_nbid%3DU67E4FXNMTMyNzU0NDc1Ny40MDc3M|archivedate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows of the British Academy|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 2001 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Cambridge first – News in brief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University news"/&gt;

Heal has written extensively on the philosophy of mind and language. Her work in the philosophy of mind came to be known as 'simulation' or 'co-cognition'- that our understanding of other people is achieved by, so far as we are able, placing ourselves inwardly in their situation and then allowing our thoughts and emotions to run forwards in a kind of imaginative experiment.

As an educator and theologian, he led schools and advised governments across Protestant Europe through the middle of the seventeenth century. 

Comenius was the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization, presented and supported the idea of [[equal opportunity]] for impoverished children, opened doors to education for women, and made instruction universal and practical. Besides his native [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]], he lived and worked in other regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and other countries: [[Sweden]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Transylvania]], [[England]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Royal Hungary|Hungary]].

==Life and work==
John Amos Comenius originated from [[Margraviate of Moravia]] in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]]&lt;ref name="Moravia p.69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uni-mannheim.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Unum necessarium" Komensky subscribed as "J.A.

John Comenius was the youngest child and only son of Martin Komenský (died 1602–4) and his wife Anna Chmelová. His grandfather, whose name was Jan Szeges, was of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] origin.  He started to use the surname Komenský after leaving Komňa to live in Uherský Brod.&lt;ref&gt;Vyskočil, František: JAN AMOS KOMENSKÝ. Kapitoly o jeho předcich, rodičích, přibuzných a místě 	narození. Brno 1990. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The name Komenský translates to "the man from Komňa". Martin and Anna Komenský belonged to the [[Moravian Brethren]], a pre-Reformation Protestant denomination, and Comenius later became one of its leaders.&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Comenius, Johann Amos|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents and two of his four sisters died in 1604 and young John went to live with his aunt in [[Strážnice]].

[[File:Oldest manuscript of Comenius.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Oldest surviving manuscript by Comenius from 1611; written in Latin and Czech]]
Owing to his impoverished circumstances he was unable to begin his formal education until later in life.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; He was 16 when he entered the [[Latin school]] in [[Přerov]] (he later returned to this school as a teacher 1614–1618). He continued his studies in the [[Herborn Academy]] (1611–1613) and the [[University of Heidelberg]] (1613–1614). In 1612 he read [[Fama Fraternitatis]]. Comenius was greatly influenced by the Irish Jesuit [[William Bathe]] as well as his teachers [[Johann Piscator]], [[:de:Heinrich Gutberleth|Heinrich Gutberleth]], and particularly [[Heinrich Alsted]]. The Herborn school held the principle that every theory has to be functional in practical use, therefore it has to be didactic (i.e. morally instructive). In the course of his study he also became acquainted with the educational reforms of [[Wolfgang Ratke|Ratichius]] and with the report of these reforms issued by the universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] and [[University of Giessen|Giessen]].&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; Comenius' book [[Janua linguarum reserata]] (''The Gate of Languages Unlocked'', 1631) brought him widespread prominence and fame. However, he and the Unity became special targets of the [[Counter Reformation]] movement and were forced into exile even as his fame grew across Europe.

Comenius became rector of a school in [[Přerov]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Comenius, Johann Amos}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616 he was ordained into the ministry of the Moravian Brethren and four years later became pastor and rector at [[Fulnek]], one of its most flourishing churches. Throughout his life this pastoral activity was his most immediate concern. In consequence of the [[Thirty Years' War|religious wars]], he lost all his property and his writings in 1621; six years later he led the Brethren into exile when the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Counter-Reformation]] persecuted the [[Protestants]] in Bohemia.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Comenius, Johann Amos|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comenius took refuge in [[Leszno]] in Poland, where he led the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and, furthermore, was given charge of the Bohemian and Moravian churches. In 1628 he corresponded with [[Johann Valentin Andreae]]. In 1638 Comenius responded to a request by the government of Sweden and traveled there to draw up a scheme for the management of the schools of that country,&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; and in 1641, he responded to a request by the [[Long Parliament|English parliament]] and joined a commission there charged with the reform of the system of public education. The [[English Civil War]] interfered with the latter project,&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; and so in 1642 he returned to Sweden to work with Queen [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]] (reigned 1632–1654) and the chancellor [[Axel Oxenstierna]] (in office 1612–1654) on the task of reorganizing the Swedish schools. The same year he moved to [[Elbląg]] (Elbing) in Poland  and in 1648 went to England with the aid of [[Samuel Hartlib]], who came originally from Elbląg. In 1650 [[Zsuzsanna Lorántffy]], widow of [[George I Rákóczi]] prince of [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]] invited him to [[Sárospatak]]. Comenius remained there until 1654 as a professor at the first Hungarian Protestant College; he wrote some of his most important works there.

[[File:Portrait of an Old Man, Rembrandt.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Portrait of an Old Man'' by [[Rembrandt]], possibly a depiction of Comenius]]
Comenius returned to Leszno. During the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] in 1655, he declared his support for the Protestant Swedish side, for which Polish Catholic partisans burned his house, [[book burning|his manuscripts]], and the school's printing press in 1656. From Leszno he took refuge in [[Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands, where he died in 1670. For unclear reasons he was buried in [[Naarden]], where visitors can see his grave in the mausoleum devoted to him.

After his religious duties, Comenius's second great interest was in furthering the [[Baconian method|Baconian]] attempt at the organization of all human knowledge. He became one of the leaders in the encyclopædic or [[Pansophism|pansophic]] movement of the seventeenth century, and, in fact, was inclined to sacrifice his more practical educational interests and opportunities for these more imposing but somewhat visionary projects. In 1639, Comenius published his ''Pansophiæ Prodromus'', and in the following year his English friend Hartlib published, without his consent, the plan of the pansophic work as outlined by Comenius. The manuscript of ''Pansophia'' was [[book burning|destroyed in the burning of his home in Leszno]] in 1657. The pansophic ideas find partial expression in the series of textbooks he produced from time to time. In these, he attempts to organize the entire field of human knowledge so as to bring it, in outline, within the grasp of every child.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;

According to [[Cotton Mather]], Comenius was asked by Winthrop to be the President of [[Harvard University]], this being more plausibly [[John Winthrop the Younger]] than his father since the junior Winthrop was in England; but Comenius moved to Sweden instead.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Amos Comenius, Charles William Bardeen, and [[Charles Hoole]], ''The orbis pictus of John Amos Comenius''. {{ISBN|1-4372-9752-8}}, page ii, quoting Cotton Mather, ''[[Magnalia]]'', vol. II, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Murphy, ''Comenius: A Critical Reassessment of his Life and Works'' (1995), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Comenius also attempted to design a language in which false statements were inexpressible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Douglas|last = Hofstadter|title = [[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]|isbn =0-14-028920-8| page= 635|date = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comenius produced a new edition of the 1618 Bohemian Brethren hymnal, ''Kancionál, to jest kniha žalmů a písní duchovních'' (Amsterdam, 1659), containing 606 texts and 406 tunes. In addition to revising the psalms and hymns, his revision greatly expanded the number of hymns and added a new introduction. This edition was reissued several times, into the nineteenth century. His texts in Czech were notable poetic compositions, but he used tunes from other sources. He also edited the German hymnal ''Kirchen-, Haus- und Hertzens-Musica'' (Amsterdam, 1661), which had been published under the title ''Kirchengesänge'' since 1566. In other writings, Comenius addresses both instrumental and vocal music in many places, although he dedicated no treatise to the topic. Sometimes he follows the medieval mathematical conception of music, but in other places he links music with grammar, rhetoric, and politics. Musical practice, both instrumental and vocal, played an important role in his system of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Komenský, Jan Amos|author=Jan Kouba|access-date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational influence==
[[File:Comenius-Schule.jpg|thumbnail|Latin class from ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'']]
The most permanent influence exerted by Comenius was in practical educational work. Few men since his days have had a greater influence though, for the greater part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth, there was little recognition of his relationship to the current advance in educational thought and practice. The practical educational influence of Comenius was threefold. He was first a teacher and an organizer of schools, not only among his own people, but later in Sweden, and to a slight extent in Holland. In his ''Didactica Magna'' (Great Didactic), he outlined a system of schools that is the exact counterpart of the existing American system of kindergarten, elementary school, secondary school, college, and university.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;

In the second place, the influence of Comenius was in formulating the general theory of education. In this respect, he is the forerunner of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], etc., and is the first to formulate that idea of "education according to nature" so influential during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. The influence of Comenius on educational thought is comparable with that of his contemporaries, [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]], on science and philosophy. In fact, he was largely influenced by the thought of these two; and his importance is largely due to the fact that he first applied or attempted to apply in a systematic manner the principles of thought and of investigation, newly formulated by those philosophers, to the organization of education in all its aspects. The summary of this attempt is given in the ''Didactica Magna'', completed about 1631, though not published until several years later.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;

The third aspect of his educational influence was that on the subject matter and method of education, exerted through a series of textbooks of an entirely new nature. The first-published of these was the ''Janua Linguarum Reserata'' (The Gate of Tongues Unlocked), issued in 1631. This was followed later by a more elementary text, the ''Vestibulum'', and a more advanced one, the ''Atrium'', and other texts. In 1658 the ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' was published, probably the most renowned and most widely circulated of school textbooks. It was also the first successful application of illustrations to the work of teaching, though not, as often stated, the first illustrated book for children.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;
[[File:Relief Komensky.jpg|thumb|Relief of Komensky in Dolany, Czech Republic]]

These texts were all based on the same fundamental ideas: (1) learning foreign languages through the vernacular; (2) obtaining ideas through objects rather than words; (3) starting with objects most familiar to the child to introduce him to both the new language and the more remote world of objects; (4) giving the child a comprehensive knowledge of his environment, physical and social, as well as instruction in religious, moral, and classical subjects; (5) making this acquisition of a compendium of knowledge a pleasure rather than a task; and (6) making instruction universal. The importance of the Comenian influence in education has been recognized since the middle of the nineteenth century. The educational writings of Comenius comprise more than forty titles. In 1892 the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius was very generally celebrated by educators, and at that time the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;

==Theology==
[[File:Labyrint světa.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart]]'']]
John Amos Comenius was a bishop of the [[Unity of the Brethren]] church that had its roots in the teaching of Czech reformer [[Jan Hus]]. One of his most famous theological work is the [[Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart]]. The book represents his thinking about the world being full of various useless things and complex labyrinths. The true peace of mind and soul can be found only in the one's heart where Christ the saver should dwell and rule. This teaching is also repeated in one of his last works Unum Necessarium (Only One is Needed) where he shows various labyrinths and problems in the world and provide simple solutions to various situation. In this book he also admits that his former believing in prophecies and revelations of those days &lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; was his personal labyrinth where he got lost manytimes. He was greatly influenced by [[Jakob Böhme|Boehme]]. In his ''Synopsis physicae ad lumen divinum reformatae'', Comenius gives a physical theory of his own, said to be taken from the [[book of Genesis]]. He was also famous for his prophecies and the support he gave to visionaries. In his ''Lux in tenebris'' he published the visions of [[Christopher Kotterus]], [[Mikuláš Drabík]] (lat. ''Nicolaus Drabicius'') and [[Christina Poniatowska]]. Attempting to interpret the [[book of Revelation]], he promised the millennium in 1672, and guaranteed miraculous assistance to those who would undertake the destruction of the Pope and the house of Austria, even venturing to prophesy that [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Gustavus Adolphus]], and [[George I Rákóczi]], [[prince of Transylvania]], would perform the task. He also wrote to [[Louis XIV of France]], informing him that the empire of the world should be his reward if he would overthrow the enemies of God.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==Family==
One of his daughters, Elisabeth, married [[Peter Figulus]] from [[Jablonné nad Orlicí]]. Their son, [[Daniel Ernst Jablonski]] (1660–1741), Comenius's grandson, later went to [[Berlin]] in 1693; there he became the highest official pastor at the court of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] (reigned 1701–1713). There he became acquainted with Count [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf]] (1700–1760). Zinzendorf was among the foremost successors to Comenius as a bishop (1737–1760) in the renewed [[Moravian Brethren]]'s Church.

==Legacy==
The Comenius Medal, a [[UNESCO]] award honouring outstanding achievements in the fields of education research and innovation, commemorates Comenius. [[Peter Drucker]] hailed Comenius as the inventor of [[textbook]]s and [[Primer (textbook)|primer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
[[File:200CZK obverse.jpg|thumb|[[Czech koruna]] banknote depicting Comenius]]
During the 19th century [[Czech National Revival]], Czechs idealised Comenius as a symbol of the [[Czech people|Czech nation]]. This image persists to the present day. 

The Czech Republic celebrates 28 March, the birthday of Comenius, as [[Teachers' Day]]. The University of Jan Amos Komensky was founded in Prague in 2001, offering bachelor's, master's and graduate degree programmes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ujak.cz&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gate to Languages (educational project)|Gate to Languages]], a project of [[lifelong education]], taking place in the Czech Republic from October 2005 to June 2007 and aimed at language education of teachers, was named after his book ''Janua linguarum reserata'' (Gate to Languages Unlocked). Comenius is pictured on the 200 [[Czech koruna]] [[Banknotes of the Czech koruna|banknote]].

Asteroid [[1861 Komenský]]. discovered by [[Luboš Kohoutek]], is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_1862|title=(1861) Komenský.

===Elsewhere in Europe===
[[File:John Amos Comenius portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Comenius by the Slovak painter Karol Miloslav Lehotský]]
In [[Sárospatak]], [[Hungary]], a teacher's college is named after him, which belongs to the [[University of Miskolc]]. Comenius' name has been given to primary schools in several [[Germany|German]] cities, including [[Bonn]], [[Grafing]], and [[Deggendorf]]. In [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government built a school after a catastrophic 1963 [[1963 Skopje earthquake|earthquake]] and named it after Comenius (Jan Amos Komenski in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]). In Poland, the [[Comenius Foundation for Child Development|Comenius Foundation]] is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to the provision of equal opportunities to children under 10 years of age. In 1919 [[Comenius University]] was founded by an act of parliament in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]], now in [[Slovakia]]. It was the first university with courses in the [[Slovak language]]. 

The Italian film director [[Roberto Rossellini]] took Comenius, and especially his theory of "direct vision", as his model in the development of his [[didactic method|didactic theories]], which Rossellini hoped would usher the world into a [[utopia]]n future.&lt;ref&gt;Rossellini, Roberto. ''Utopia autopsia 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;''. Rome: Armando, 1974. 195-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comenius is a [[European Union]] school partnership program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Lachman|Lachman, G.]], ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen'' ([[Wheaton, IL]]: [[Theosophical Society in America]], 2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YE5bBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 19].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham|Needham, J.]], ed., [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/education/education-history-theory/teacher-nations-addresses-and-essays-commemoration-visit-england-great-czech-educationalist-jan-amos-komensky-comenius?format=PB ''The Teacher of Nations''] ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[University of Sheffield]]'s Western Bank Library holds the largest collection of Comenius manuscripts outside of the Czech Republic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===United States===
In 1892 Comenius Hall, the principal classroom and faculty office building on [[Moravian College]]'s campus in Pennsylvania, was built. In 1892 educators in many places celebrated the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius, and at that time the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The education department at [[Salem College]] in North Carolina has an annual ''Comenius Symposium'' dedicated in his honor; the subjects usually deal with modern issues in education.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The [[Comenius Foundation (US)|Comenius Foundation]] in the US, a non-profit 501(c)(3) charity, uses film and documentary production to further faith, learning, and love.&lt;ref&gt;http://comeniusfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">The idea that '''knowledge has value''' is ancient. In the 1st century AD, [[Juvenal]] (55-130)&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]] (Decimus Juvenalis) (55-130) Satires 7.118&lt;/ref&gt; stated “All wish to know but none wish to pay the [[price]]". In 1775, [[Samuel Johnson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Johnson|Johnson, Samuel]] (1775) in: Boswell’s “Life of Samuel Johnson, (April 14, 1775)&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: “All [[knowledge]] is of itself of some [[Value theory|value]].”

In the 19th century, [[Samuel T. Coleridge|Coleridge]] (1825)&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel T. 1825. Aids to Reflection.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that : “The worth and value of knowledge is in proportion to the worth and value of its object.” Auerbach (1865)&lt;ref&gt;[[Berthold Auerbach|Auerbach, Berthold]]. 1865. Auf der Höhe&lt;/ref&gt; asked: “What is all our knowledge worth?" although he proposed no answer. Largely the same ideas are already expressed in the term ''[[intellectual capital]]'' or the more ancient ''[[knowledge is power]]'' - given that power is a value in its own right.

Only towards of the end of the 20th century, however, was the value of knowledge in a business context generally recognized. The idea has since become something of a [[management fad]], although many authors indicate that the underlying principles will become standard business practice. It is now understood that knowledge about how to produce products and provide services as well as their embedded knowledge is often more valuable than the products and services themselves or the materials they contain. Although measuring the value of knowledge remains elusive, describing its flow through value chains is a step in the right direction.

Firestone&lt;ref&gt;[[Harvey Firestone|Firestone, Harvey]] (1868-1938). In: Thoughts on Wisdom. Forbes (1997) p108&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to relate knowledge to business when he noted that “Thought, not [[money]] is the real [[business capital]].” Alvin Toffler (1990)&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Toffler|Toffler, Alvin]]. 1990. Powershift. Bantam Books. 585 p.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that knowledge is a wealth and force multiplier, in that it augments what is available or reduces the amount needed to achieve a given purpose.

In comparing knowledge and product value, Amidon (1997)&lt;ref name=amidon1997&gt;Amidon, Debra M. 1997. [[Innovation]] Strategy for the [[Knowledge Economy]]. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA. p7, 82
&lt;/ref&gt; observes that knowledge about how to produce products may be more valuable than the products themselves. Leonard&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Dorothy. 1995. Wellsprings of Knowledge. Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA. p xiii&lt;/ref&gt; similarly points out that products are physical manifestations of knowledge and that their worth depends largely on the value of the embedded knowledge.

Davis (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Stanley M., 1999. Building Knowledge into Products, In: The Knowledge Advantage (Ruggles, 1999) p168&lt;/ref&gt; further notes that the computer chips in a high-end automobile are worth more than the steel, plastics, glass, or rubber. However, Davis and Botin (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Stanley M. and Jim W. Botkin. 1994. The Coming of Knowledge-Based Business. In: Harvard Business Review (Sept. 1994)
&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that awareness of the value of knowledge exceeds the ability of many businesses to extract it from the goods and services in which it is embedded.

Measuring the value of knowledge has not progressed much beyond an awareness that traditional accounting practices are misleading and can lead to wrong business decisions (Martin, 1996). Amidon (1997)&lt;ref name=amidon1997/&gt; points out that the shift from tangible to [[intangible asset]]s will revolutionize the way that enterprises are measured and that there is an entirely new way to value economic wealth.

Simard et al. (2007) developed a content value chain describing the flow of content through a sequence of stages in which its form is changed and its value or utility to users are notably increased at each stage: objects, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. They also developed a knowledge services value chain, which describes the flow of knowledge services through a sequence of stages, in which value is embedded, advanced, or extracted.

The stages are: generate, transform, manage, use internally, transfer, add value, use professionally, use personally, and evaluate.

'''Leon Birnbaum''' (1918&amp;ndash;2010) was a Romanian mathematician and philosopher.

He was born in [[Chernovtsy]] (now Ukraine) on June 18, 1918 to a family with an intellectual tradition. He studied at the Orthodox High School, then at the Faculty of Mathematics. In 1941 the war reached Chernovtsy and he was deported to [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Magilev-Podolsk]] in [[Transnistria]] until 1944.

In 1946 he became a Mathematics teacher in [[Strehaia]], Romania, then at [[Turnu Severin]] and [[Dej]]. Meanwhile, he obtained a degree in Russian Language and Literature, then an engineering license in Machine Technology. Encouraged by friends, Birnbaum began to publish Mathematical articles in the journals "Mathematical Studies and Research" of Bucharest, "Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logics" in the USA and many others.

He was a member of the "Association Internationale de Cybernetique" in [[Namur, Belgium]] and a member of the Editorial Board of the magazine "Informatica", in [[Ljubljana]]. He was also a member of [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]].

'''Luciferianism''' is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to [[Lucifer]]. The tradition, influenced by [[Gnosticism]], usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices |author=[[Michelle Belanger]] |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |date=2007 |page=175 |isbn=0-7387-1220-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even the true god as opposed to [[Jehovah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Occultism |author=Spence, L. |publisher=Carol Publishing |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis, Charles Short, "A Latin Dictionary" |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Christian tradition]] came to use the Latin word for "morning star", ''lucifer'', as a proper name ("Lucifer") for the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]]; as he was before his fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/350594/Lucifer | title=Lucifer | publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' | accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "'Lucifer' has become a by-word for Satan or the Devil in the church and in popular literature",&lt;ref name=Kohler1923/&gt; as in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Joost van den Vondel]]'s ''Lucifer'' and [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref name="Adelman"/&gt; However, the Latin word never came to be used almost exclusively, as in English, in this way, and was applied to others also, including [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Latin word ''lucifer''|Latin word ''lucifer'']] below.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a morning star fallen from the sky is generally believed among [[bible scholar|scholars]] to have [[Attar (god)|a parallel]] in [[Canaanite mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Mythology behind Isaiah 14:12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to both Christian&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/14-12.htm Examples of Christian literal exegesis of Isaiah 14:12]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jewish exegesis]], in Chapter 14 of the [[Book of Isaiah]], the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|King of Babylon]] ([[Nebuchadnezzar II#Helel.2C Son of dawn|Nebuchadnezzar II]]), conqueror of Jerusalem, is condemned in a [[Prophecy|prophetic vision]] by the prophet Isaiah and is called the "Morning Star" (planet Venus).&lt;ref&gt;''Helel ben Shaḥar'' "day-star, son of Dawn"; planet Venus is one of the brightest celestial bodies at night, which can be seen in the early morning when no other star can be seen any more, but vanishes when the sun, the real light, rises.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.jewishencyclopedia.com 2052-astronomy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTRONOMY - Helel Son of Dawn|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2052-astronomy|work=The unedited full-text of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this chapter the [[Hebrew]] text says {{lang|he|הֵילֵל&amp;nbsp;בֶּן-שָׁחַר (Helel ben [[Shahar (god)|Shachar]], "shining one, son of dawn")}}.&lt;ref name="www.jewishencyclopedia.com 2052-astronomy"/&gt; ''Helel ben Shahar'' may refer to the [[Venus|Morning Star]], but the text in Isaiah 14 gives no indication that Helel was a star or planet.&lt;ref&gt;Gunkel, "Schöpfung und Chaos," pp. 132 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MM-Isa14&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaiah Chapter 14|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1014.htm|website=mechon-mamre.org|publisher=The Mamre Institute|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General beliefs==
Sometimes mistakenly associated with [[Satanism]] due to the [[Christianity|Christian]] interpretation of the [[fallen angel]], Luciferianism is a wholly different belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]]. Rather, [[Lucifer]] in this context is seen as one of many morning stars, a symbol of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/mythologicalfigures/a/Lucifer.htm|title=Lucifer (Who Is He?) - Lucifer versus Satan|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; independence, and human progression, and is often used interchangeably with similar figures from a range of ancient beliefs, such as the Greek titan [[Prometheus]] or the Jewish [[Talmudic]] figure [[Lilith]].

Luciferians generally support the protection of the natural world. Both the arts and sciences are crucial to human development and thus both are cherished. Luciferians think that humans should be focused on this life and how to make the most of it every single day. The ability to recognize both good and evil, to accept that all actions have both positive and negative consequences, and to actively influence one's environment is a key factor.

The Luciferian philosophy in recent years has been defined in a collective foundation, known as the "11 Luciferian Points of Power",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bible of the Adversary - Adversarial Flame 10th Anniversary Edition, 2007-2017|last=Ford|first=Michael|publisher=Succubus Productions Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781979202596|location=Houston, Texas|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by Michael W. Ford. The basis of Luciferian philosophy cultivates and encourages individuality, self-determined choices based on strategic application and continually seeking to enhance the Will via overcoming challenges. Luciferianism is philosophically practiced with the continual cycle and process known as Liberation, Illumination and Apotheosis.

For Luciferians, enlightenment is the ultimate goal. The basic Luciferian principles highlight truth and freedom of will, worshipping the inner self and one's ultimate potential. Traditional dogma is shunned as a basis for morality on the grounds that humans should not need deities or fear of eternal punishment to distinguish right from wrong and to do good. All ideas should be tested before being accepted, and even then one should remain skeptical because knowledge and understanding are fluid. Regardless of whether Lucifer is conceived of as a deity or as a mere archetype, he is a representation of ultimate knowledge and exploration, as well as humanity's savior and a champion for continuing personal growth.

==Theistic Luciferianism==
Some Luciferians believe in Lucifer as an actual deity, not to be worshipped as the Judeo-Christian God but to be revered and followed as a teacher and friend, as a rescuer or guiding spirit, or even the one true god as opposed to the traditional [[creator deity]] in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Occultism |author=Spence, L. |publisher=Carol Publishing |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic Luciferians are followers of the [[Left-Hand Path]] and may adhere to different dogmata put forth by organizations such as the [[Neo-Luciferian Church]] or other congregations which are heavily focused on [[ceremonial magic]], the [[occult]], and literal interpretations of spiritual stories and figures.

==History==

[[File:Lucifer, The Light-Bearer.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' was an [[individualist anarchist]] publication in the United States edited by [[Moses Harman]]]]
''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' was an [[individualist anarchist]] journal published in the United States by [[Moses Harman]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been reported that "[t]he title was selected, stated Harman, because it expressed the paper's mission. Lucifer, the name given to the morning star by the people of the ancient world, served as the symbol of the publication and represented the ushering in of a new day. He declared that freethinkers had sought to redeem and glorify the name Lucifer while theologians cursed him as the prince of the fallen angels. Harman suggested that Lucifer would take on the role of an educator. 'The god of the Bible doomed mankind to perpetual ignorance,' wrote Harman, 'and [people] would never have known Good from Evil if Lucifer had not told them how to become as wise as the gods themselves.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-the-moses-harman-story/13209 "The Moses Harman Story" by William Lemore West at Kansas Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' was a publication edited by the influential occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]]. The journal was first published by Blavatsky. From 1889 until Blavatsky's death in May 1891, [[Annie Besant]] was a co-editor. [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s writings, which formed the basis for [[anthroposophy]], characterised Lucifer as a spiritual opposite to [[Ahriman]], with [[Christ]] between the two forces, mediating a balanced path for humanity. Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious and philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome, and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.

[[Léo Taxil]] (1854–1907) claimed that [[Freemasonry]] is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the [[Taxil hoax]], he alleged that leading Freemason [[Albert Pike]] had addressed "[t]he 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god [[Adonai]]. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the "Luciferian path" or the "energies of Lucifer", they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer,&lt;ref&gt;"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it ''he'' who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!" (Albert Pike, ''Morals and Dogma'', p. 321). Much has been made of this quote ([http://www.masonicinfo.com/lucifer.htm Masonic information: Lucifer]).&lt;/ref&gt; the search for light; the very antithesis of dark, Satanic evil. Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confessed.html |title=Leo Taxil's confession |publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2 April 2001 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the [[Palladists|Palladium]], which controlled the organization and had a Satanic agenda. As described by ''Freemasonry Disclosed'' in 1897:
{{quote|With frightening cynicism, the miserable person we shall not name here [Taxil] declared before an assembly especially convened for him that for twelve years he had prepared and carried out to the end the most sacrilegious of hoaxes. We have always been careful to publish special articles concerning Palladism and Diana Vaughan. We are now giving in this issue a complete list of these articles, which can now be considered as not having existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Freemasonry Disclosed'' April 1897&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Taxil's work and Pike's address continue to be quoted by anti-Masonic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/taxil.htm |title=Leo Taxil: The tale of the Pope and the Pornographer |accessdate=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Devil-Worship in France'', [[Arthur Edward Waite]] compared Taxil's work to what today we would call a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] story, replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an [[English people|English]] [[astrology|astrologer]] and [[witch]]. She co-founded the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] organisation known as the Order of the Morning Star (OMS), through which she propagated her own form of Luciferianism. In 1952, she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. An [[engraver]], photographer, and former journalist for the ''[[Brighton Argus]]'', he shared her interest in the occult and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity [[Lucifer]], or Lumiel, whom they considered to be a benevolent [[angel]]ic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or ''Ordo Stella Matutina'' (OSM), propagating it through a [[correspondence course]].{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=81–82}} The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained ''The Book of Lumiel'', a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=95–97}} The couple initially lived together in [[Torrington Place]], [[London]], from where they ran the course; but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of [[Southsea]] in [[Hampshire]], where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=81}}

In ''[[Rules for Radicals]]'' (his final work, published in 1971 one year before his death), the prominent American community organizer and writer [[Saul Alinsky]] wrote at the end of his personal acknowledgements:

{{quote|Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom – Lucifer.&lt;ref name="RULES"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rules for Radicals  |first=Saul |last=Alinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', Lucifer is one of the [[The Book of Abramelin|four crown princes of hell]], particularly that of the East, the "lord of the [[Air (classical element)|air]]", and is described as the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment.&lt;ref name=LaVey&gt;{{cite book|last=LaVey|first=Anton Szandor|title=The Satanic Bible|date=1969|publisher=Avon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-380-01539-9|chapter=The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title "lord of the air" is based upon [[Ephesians]] 2:2, which uses the phrase "prince of the power of the air'" to refer to the [[Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Greek]] god [[Zeus]], but that phrase later became conflated with Satan.

Author Michael W. Ford has written on Lucifer as a "mask" of the adversary, a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bible of the Adversary|date=2007|publisher=Succubus Productions|page=8|chapter=Adversarial Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

===Greater Church of Lucifer===
In 2014, Luciferians founded a worldwide organization for Luciferians from [[Houston]], [[Texas]], known as the [[Greater Church of Lucifer]] (GCoL) under the leadership of church founder Jacob Mckelvy, co-presidents Michael W. Ford and Jeremy Crow, founder of the Luciferian Research Society. In January 2015, the founders of GCoL filed paperwork in the [[Austin County, Texas|Austin County]] Courthouse in order to do business under the GCoL name. The GCoL focuses more on teachings based on the practical world. Family and personal progression are among its key tenets.

In 2015, the GCoL opened a parish in [[Old Town Spring]], Texas, with several dozen members. Over a hundred local residents, mainly Catholic, protested the opening of the church.&lt;ref name="oldspring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.click2houston.com/news/greater-church-of-lucifer-opens-despite-protests-in-old-town-spring/36165394|title=Greater Church of Lucifer opens doors despite protests in Old Town Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Luciferian Church===
The [[Neo-Luciferian Church]] (NLC) is a [[Gnostic]] and Luciferian organisation with roots in [[Western esotericism]], [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]], Luciferianism, [[Thelema]], and magic.

=== Fraternitas Saturni ===
[[Stephen Flowers]], in his book on the German magical order [[Fraternitas Saturni]], (FS) says that "the FS is (or was) the most unabashedly Luciferian organization in the modern Western occult revival".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Flowers. ''Fire &amp; Ice: The history, structure and rituals of Germany's modern magical order. The brotherhood of Saturn.'' Llewellyn. pg. xv1994&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported that the Fraternitas Saturni holds the view that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Also the A Logos was necessary in order for the light to dawn; and this [[Logos]] was Lucifer, the Light-Bringer. Lucifer is the [[demiurge]], who created our visible world by breaking the static cosmic order. The result was [[War in Heaven]], by which death entered the world. Lucifer is regarded as the "higher [[octave]]" of Saturn (Satan representing its "lower octave"), the outermost planet and polar opposite of the Sun in ancient cosmology. Because of this ongoing opposition Lucifer is still fighting the Solar Logos. The principal battlefield is our earth, which contains a negative-astral and a positive-mental sphere apart from its physical form. Saturn is seen as the great judge with scales and sword, entrusted with weight, measure and number. He is the Guardian of the Threshold, or the gateway to transcendence. Because he betrayed divine mysteries to mankind, he has been punished. His heavy, dark, leaden qualities must be transformed into gold by the magician, in an [[alchemical]] process involving the "repolarisation of lights".&lt;ref&gt;"Fraternitas Saturni" by Hans Thomas Hakl. In: [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] (ed). ''Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism''.  p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Maafa''' (or '''African Holocaust''', '''Holocaust of Enslavement''', or '''Black Holocaust''')&lt;ref&gt;William Wright points to the differences between ''black'' history, and ''African'' history, and argues that the African Holocaust is a major reason why these two histories are not synonymous: William D.

==History and terminology==
Usage of the Swahili term ''Maafa'' ("Great Disaster") in English was introduced by [[Marimba Ani]]'s 1998 book ''Let the Circle Be Unbroken: The Implications of African Spirituality in the Diaspora''.&lt;ref&gt;Dove, Nah. ''Afrikan Mothers: Bearers of Culture, Makers of Social Change''. 1998, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;Gunn Morris, Vivian and Morris, Curtis L. ''The Price They Paid: Desegregation in an African American Community''. 2002, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived  from a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for "[[disaster]], terrible occurrence or great [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]]".&lt;ref name=oj&gt;Harp, O.J. ''Across Time: Mystery of the Great Sphinx''. 2007, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheeves |first=Denise Nicole |title=Legacy |year=2004 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=African American History Reconsidered |author=Pero Gaglo Dagbovie |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |year=2010|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''African Holocaust'' is preferred by some academics, such as [[Maulana Karenga]], because it implies intention.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} One problem noted by Karenga is that the word ''Maafa'' can also translate to "accident", and in the view of some scholars the holocaust of enslavement was not accidental. [[Ali Mazrui]] notes that the word "holocaust" is a "dual plagiarism" since the term is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] and thus, despite being associated with the [[The Holocaust|genocide of the Jews]], no one can have a monopoly over the term. Mazrui states: "This borrowing from borrowers without attribution is what I call 'the dual plagiarism.' But this plagiarism is defensible because the vocabulary of horrors like genocide and enslavement should not be subject to copyright-restrictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igcs.binghamton.edu/igcs_site/mltrs/Newsletter17.pdf |title=Ancestry, Descent And Identity |publisher=Igcs.binghamton.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313035549/http://igcs.binghamton.edu/igcs_site/mltrs/Newsletter17.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Afrocentric]] scholars prefer the term ''Maafa'' to ''African Holocaust'',&lt;ref&gt;Tarpley, Natasha. ''Testimony: Young African-Americans on Self-Discovery and Black Identity''. 1995, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; because they believe that indigenous African terminology more truly conveys the events.&lt;ref name=morris /&gt; The term ''Maafa'' may serve "much the same cultural psychological purpose for Africans as the idea of the ''Holocaust'' serves to name the culturally distinct Jewish experience of genocide under German Nazism."&lt;ref name=outof&gt;Aldridge, Delores P. and Young, Carlene. ''Out of the Revolution: The Development of Africana Studies''. 2000, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments in favor of ''Maafa'' rather than ''African Holocaust'' emphasize that the denial of the validity of the African people's humanity is an unparalleled centuries-long phenomenon: "The Maafa is a continual, constant, complete, and total system of human negation and nullification."&lt;ref name=joneswest /&gt;

The terms "[[Transatlantic Slave Trade]]", "Atlantic Slave Trade" and "Slave Trade" have also been said by some{{who|date=January 2016}} to be deeply problematic, because they serve as euphemisms for intense violence and mass murder.  Referred to as a "trade", this prolonged period of persecution and suffering is rendered as a commercial dilemma, rather than as a moral atrocity.&lt;ref name=diouf&gt;[[Sylviane Diouf|Diouf, Sylviane Anna]]. ''Fighting the Slave Trade: West African Strategies''. 2003, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  With trade as the primary focus, the broader tragedy becomes consigned to a secondary point, as mere "[[collateral damage]]" of a commercial venture.  Others,{{Who|date=January 2016}} however, feel that avoidance of the term ''trade'' is an apologetic act on behalf of capitalism, absolving capitalist structures of involvement in human catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epps|first1=Henry|title=A Concise Chronicle History of the African-American People Experience in America|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781300161431|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUTrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=slave+trade+apologetic+act+capitalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5EYFdDN212&amp;sig=aVXEfExobOXSsBF4Cli2N_uFGyI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HbbsVMyjJ4q4ggSj-oGIDg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=slave%20trade%20apologetic%20act%20capitalism&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of [[mental representation]] are those that rest the [[cognitive abilities]] of the mind on the processing of content-laden vehicles, called representations.  Naturalizing these theories involves an account of how a representation, initially posited as a theoretical construct, can be realized in a physical system.  A central aspect of any account of representation is how they derive and designate semantic content.  The possession of meaningful content is the most characteristic property of representations and arguably integral to their functionality.&lt;ref name=Ramsey2007/&gt; The project of the naturalistic philosopher is to provide an account of the representation relationship between a representation ''A'' and its object of intentional content ''a'', such that having content ''A'' is entailed by standing in a particular relation with ''a''.&lt;ref name=Morgan2014/&gt;

One naturalistic account of the representation relationship is the teleofunctionalist semantics of [[Fred Dretske]].  In his book ''Explaining Behavior'', Dretske outlines a theory for how a component of a physical system can come to possess semantic content.  This theory characterizes a relationship as representational when: one entity is a natural sign of another, and the natural sign is integrated into the function of a larger system as a consequence of being an indicator.

Natural signs are those entities whose existence is dependent on preceding conditions.  Therefore, the existence of a natural sign is an indication that its preceding conditions are or were actually instantiated.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; For example, footprints in the snow are dependent on the animal that creates them, thus footprints are natural signs.  Exactly what the footprints in the snow indicate, or are natural signs of, is potentially limitless.  A man’s footprint could indicate his size, approximate weight, fashion preferences, even infirmities if there are characteristics of a limp.  Conversely, a representation’s content is not as broad, nor as unspecified.  As a result, an indication relationship could be necessary for a representation relationship, but not sufficient.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; Furthermore, natural signs are dependent on the actual existence of their instantiating conditions while representations bear no such dependency relationships.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; This is the critical feature that allows representations to misrepresent something as the case when it is indeed not.

For a natural sign to become a representation requires additional constraining criteria that designate specific content from among many conditions indicated and free the indicator from absolute dependency on the existence of its instantiating conditions.  The teleological characteristics of Dretske’s theory are intended to accomplish the necessary constraints.  Specifically, to be a representation, a natural sign must be employed in the function of a larger system as a result of its holding in an indication relationship.  Since a natural sign may hold in many indication relationships, that relationship for which it is employed by the larger system is taken to be its content-specifying relationship.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt;

By being integrated into the function of a larger system, natural signs also become free of an absolute dependency on the existence of their instantiating conditions.  By contributing its properties of indication to a larger system, a natural sign gains the function of determining what the system takes to be the case.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; Once this role has been given, changes in what the natural sign indicate are not necessarily reflected in what the system takes the case to be.  Thus, when appropriately integrated, natural signs become representations by identifying specific content and gaining freedom from absolute dependency on their instantiating conditions.

A major criticism of applying naturalistic theories of semantics to mental representation is that they fail to account for all the characteristics of mental states.  Mental states have characteristic phenomenal properties and these properties are not necessitated by naturalistic theories of semantics.  That is to say, these theories identify representations, with equal weight, in both conscious and unconscious systems.&lt;ref name=Morgan2014/&gt;  If an explanation is consistent with the absence of phenomenal properties, then it cannot be a full account of mental states.  While this objection does nothing to undermine the progress of naturalistic theories of semantics, it demands that there are further constraining criteria before representation in mental states can be accounted for.

:''This article is about the philosophical argument; for normal conditions in the sense of standards see the corresponding articles, e.g. [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]].''

'''Normal conditions''' are a restriction on [[Philosophy|philosophical]] arguments, especially in [[epistemology]], in order to avoid objections perceived as digressive. As a reply to objections to an explanation of a [[phenomenon]], e.g. a [[hypothesis]] or a [[theory]], it is said, argument X holds [only] under normal conditions. In some cases, the concept of normal conditions tends to be rather blurred and the reply '''under normal conditions''' can tend to extend to everything that contradicts an argument. In cases, when the argument of normal conditions comes too often, according to the principle of [[Occam's Razor]] another explanation X' has to be found.

A '''philanthropreneur''' is an [[entrepreneur]]ial [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. The term is claimed to be coined by Internet entrepreneur Mark Desvaux in 2004;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magicmo.com/articles/philanthropreneur.html Magic Moments: Become a Philanthropreneur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002509/http://www.magicmo.com/articles/philanthropreneur.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' used the term in a 1999 article,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-phi2.htm World Wide Words - Philanthropeneur]&lt;/ref&gt; and a publication entitled ''The Philanthropreneur Newsletter'' existed as far back as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/philanthropreneur.asp Word Spy - Philanthropreneur]&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropreneurship is often considered the start of a new era in [[philanthropy]], characterized by the development of the philanthropist’s role and the integration of business practices.

The core objective of philanthropreneurship is to increase the philanthropic impact of [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]]. Traditionally [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] solely depended on donations, grants, or other forms of charitable-giving. However, this new generation of [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] prefers to invest rather than donate. Philanthropreneurs are active donors whose role surpasses that of check writers. They leverage their resources to achieve social change that is both scalable and sustainable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/author/amr-al-dabbagh/|title=How to run your non-profit like a startup|last=Al-Dabbagh|first=Amr|date=2 February 2015|website=Fortune|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their contribution is meant to go beyond providing temporary "band-aid" solutions. Instead of directing efforts toward the purchase of medicine for the sick and the supply of food for the hungry, philanthropreneurs seek to eradicate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foundrmag.com/rise-of-the-philanthropreneur/|title=Rise of the Philanthropreneur: How Founders Are Finding Success While Doing Good|last=Coppola|first=Marc|date=1 June 2016|website=Foundr Magazine|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Philanthropreneurs are people who bring a creative or entrepreneurial approach to philanthropy. They are interested in effecting positive changes in the world and alleviating suffering, and do so in new and creative ways. Philanthropreneurs are often "driven to do good and have their profit, too", as [[Stephanie Strom]] wrote in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/13/us/13strom.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=7b1664f51e15449f&amp;ex=1321074000&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss What’s Wrong With Profit? - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical framework of philanthropreneurship ==
As an emerging field there is no defined operating model or strategic approach. Still, philanthropreneurship marks the transitions from a grant-distributing model to a business-based model with predefined objectives and constant focus on quantifiable results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Entrepreneurial Philanthropy: An Exploratory Review|journal=Journal of Wealth Management|volume=17,3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of “commercial giving” demands measurable return, which is why opportunities are assessed and evaluated according to different criteria. Factors such as profitability and quantifiable performance are fixed requirements for granting support. The shift in professional management has also resulted in a greater focus on long-term goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The application of entrepreneurial practices in philanthropy drives the impact of connected [[non-profit organization]]s through strategic funding. Traditional philanthropy encouraged the promotion of [[social welfare]] exclusively through [[charitable]] giving.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, many well-intentioned projects fell through because of their disregard to set up revenue-generating strategies. In philanthropreneurship, prosperous ventures require the establishment of recurring income as a means of avoiding depletion of funds and ultimately preventing the social mission's dissolution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Philanthropic Social Ventures: A Framework and Profile of the Emerging Field.|url=https://works.bepress.com/holona_ochs/9/.|journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy|volume=18, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philanthropic buying has a limited reach, which is why philanthropreneurs do not simply dispose of surplus funds, but strategically tailor investments by actively leveraging their resources (i.e. [[wealth]], time, business expertise, networks, reputation, and [[Reputation|prestige]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, Pierre Omidyar, chairman of eBay, started Omidyar Network because of his dissatisfaction with the level of impact his donations had through conventional charities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Omidyar is an exemplar of how today’s philanthropists have taken on a greater role than their charitable predecessors. Apart from bringing their checkbook, affluent philanthropists are also expected to bring in their entrepreneurial know-how.

Philanthropreneurship has been described as the emerging practice of driving [[social change]] in new and creative ways.  The term has been in use since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/08/new-age-of-philanthropy-philanthropreneurship  The Guardian on philanthropreneurship]&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners — also known as philanthropreneurs or micro-preneurs — are [[entrepreneur]]ial philanthropists. Philanthropreneurship is measured in impact, sustainability and scalability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/ideas  Philanthropreneurship Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practitioners — like [[Amr Al-Dabbagh]] in the ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article "How to Run Your Non-Profit Like a Startup"&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/author/amr-al-dabbagh/  Fortune on How to Run Your Non-Profit Like a Startup]&lt;/ref&gt; — are deploying entrepreneurial business practices to help drive maximum impact, sustainability and scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/ideas  Philanthropreneurship Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples of practitioners — featured in ''[[The Guardian]]'' article by Rajesh Chandy ("Welcome to the New Age of Philanthropy: PHILANTHROPRENEURSHIP")&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/08/new-age-of-philanthropy-philanthropreneurs  The Guardian on Welcome to the New Age of Philanthropy: PHILANTHROPRENEURSHIP]&lt;/ref&gt;—include Bill and Melinda Gates, Steve Case, Pierre Omidyar and Bill Clinton. [[Stephanie Strom]] featured these practitioners and more in her ''[[New York Times]]'' article "What's Wrong With Profit?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/13/us/13strom.html?pagewanted=all  New York Times on What's Wrong With Profit?]&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropreneurship is now supported by emerging new business models and legislation including [[Low-profit limited liability company|low-profit limited liability companies]] (L3Cs), pioneered by tax attorney and entrepreneurial finance expert [[Marc J. Lane]].

==Controversies==
[[Nonprofit organization|Non-profit organizations]] have historically found it challenging to trust and accept the concept of "philanthro-[[capitalism]]". Critics note that many metrics of the commercial sectors, such as [[return on investment]] and other ratios, lack applicability to non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Moreover, the inclusion of commercial and enterprise strategies has generated concerns in maintaining the institution's culture and ideology. A particular concern is the risk that the organization's focus will shift away from the social mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246453|title=A 5-Step Process for Success as a 'Philanthropreneur'|last=Constatino|first=Tor|date=21 May 2015|website=Entrepreneur|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, its success has piqued the interest of an increasing number of non-profit organizations, but the performance assessment of philanthropreneurial ventures remains an area of concern for many, as there is no precise measurement for [[social impact assessment|social impact]]. For example, in "impact investing", a core practice of philanthropreneurship, project selection for funding is based on estimated social impact and financial return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philanthropreneurshipforum.com/does-philanthropreneurship-signal-the-end-of-philanthropy-as-we-know-it/|title=Does Philanthropreneurship Signal The End of Philanthropy as We Know it?|last=Brest|first=Paul|date=14 January 2016|website=Philanthropreneurship|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ethical context, many critics argue that the incorporation of a business model [[commercialize]]s the nonprofit sector and further increases the risk of distorting the organization's mission and principles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Conversely, many supporters point out that traditional philanthropy alone cannot sustain social initiatives because of the shortage in sources of funding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In philanthropreneurship, a dependency in traditional fundraising is a strong predictor of failure, which is why historically the implementation of business practices enables philanthropreneurship to outperform age-old practices of philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/08/new-age-of-philanthropy-philanthropreneurship|title=Welcome to the new age of philanthropy – philanthropreneurship.|last=Chandy|first=Rajesh|date=8 December 2014|website=The Guardian|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st-century efforts==

[[Roundabout PlayPump|Playpumps International]] is a [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organization]] (NGO) founded by Trevor Field. Today the Playpump-initiative is made up of two for-profit entities and one nonprofit. Playpump International is a nonprofit in the U.S. that is partnered with Roundabout Water Solutions, a manufacturing company in [[South Africa]].

The organization's mission is to promote public health in South Africa by providing easy access to clean, potable water in rural communities. Field designed a self-sustainable system that enabled water to be pumped into a storage tower. This model resulted in a mechanical water extraction process designed after a playground [[Carousel|merry-go-round]], which is attached to a water pump. [[Rotational energy]] generated by children playing is then used to fill the water storage tower. The system enhances living conditions and offers playing equipment for the young population. Since its invention, hundreds of water pump systems have been installed, particularly through the aid of monetary donations and governmental approvals.

Before Playpumps attained global recognition, the organization had to be self-financed in order to ensure its continuity. Because of the infrequent number of charitable donations received and lack of fundraising sources, Field sought to generate an alternative flow of income. Income was generated by marketing contracts. Four-paneled billboards concealed the Playpump water storage towers and were used to display printed ads. The purpose of generating revenue was to recapitalize on the cost of the equipment (i.e. manufacturing and installation costs). With time, monetary donations increased significantly, and thus allowed for half of each tower's panels to be dedicated to promoting social messages, specifically [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV and AIDS awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Making of a "Philanthropreneur" (Interview with Trevor Field and Mark Melman, Playpumps International).|url=http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=jvbl|journal=Journal of Values-Based Leadership|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy Sharing Foundation''', or PSF, is a non-profit organisation founded in [[Malta]] in 2012. Its mission is to bring together philosophy enthusiasts; to inspire, strengthen and promote philosophical activity in the Maltese Islands; and to contribute towards society through Philosophy. The foundation does not adhere to, or profess, any single creed or ideology. Its official languages are Maltese and English. 

==Establishment==

The original idea to create a society in order to provide meeting opportunities, and perhaps study prospects, for members of the general public who were interested in philosophy came from [[Peter Serracino Inglott]]. Though he intended to give the initiative a go, he was impeded by his untimely death in March 2012. Subsequently, however, just a few weeks after his death a group of academics, intellectuals and other members of the community came together to bring the idea to fruition. The foundation was established on 21 May, 2012, by public act. It started its public operations on the following 22 June.

PSF is registered with the Commission for Voluntary Organisation (VO-0679) and, for the purposes of Maltese law, it is to be considered as a Legal Person (LPF-85).

==Objectives==

The objectives of PSF are:

* to bring together Maltese philosophers, facilitate discussion of their ideas, and encourage their work;
* to promote philosophical investigation;
* to share philosophical ideas with the Maltese public;
* to assist the documentation, compilation, safe-keeping, and accessibility of the works of Maltese philosophers;
* to disseminate information on Maltese philosophers, their work and their ideas;
* to foster the participation of Maltese philosophers in public debates; and
* to further philosophical understanding and knowledge in general.

==Activities==

The activities of PSF include:

* organising encounters for Maltese philosophers;
* encouraging and facilitating the writing, publication and distribution of works by Maltese philosophers;
* furthering research on past and present Maltese philosophers;
* establishing a central archive with the works of Maltese philosophers;
* coordinating courses, meetings, seminars, conferences and such like gatherings; and
* collaborating with entities which can aid the foundation in its objectives and activities.

==Long-term objectives==

The long-term objectives of PSF include:

* publishing a periodical for the sharing of ideas; 
* setting up an outlet for the sale of material related to philosophy; 
* starting an editorial house for the publishing of books on philosophy and other related subjects; and
* affiliating the foundation to an established local or foreign institution of higher education for the conferment of academic recognition in philosophy.

==Membership and management==

PSF grants membership to who, graduate in philosophy or not, agrees with the mission and objectives of the foundation.	Members pay a nominal annual fee.

The foundation is governed by a number of members forming a steering committee, two of which are philosophy graduates. The chairperson of the committee is elected by the members of the foundation from among themselves every two years. The committee meets on a monthly basis. 

The foundation convenes a general assembly each year. The assembly appoints members of the steering committee for the next year of activity, reviews the work done during the preceding year of activity, discusses and adopts amendments to PSF’s Foundation Deed, and approves the audited accounts of the foundation and cause them to be published.

==Main organ==

[[File:Masthead of SHARE magazine.jpg|right|300px]]PSF's main organ — called SHARE — is published on a triennial basis. The mission of SHARE is to serve as the official platform of the Philosophy Sharing Foundation, and to disseminate articles and information which contribute to philosophical discussion and debate. The magazine includes articles of a philosophical nature, reviews of books published by Maltese philosophers, snippets from the history of philosophy in Malta, the foundation's news and activities, other Philosophy news from the Maltese Islands, and some philosophical fun items. The magazine's present Editor is Meinrad Calleja.

==Appreciation==

By its establishment, PSF introduced a new experience in [[Malta]]. Formerly, philosophical activities were restricted to academics somehow connected to the [[University of Malta]]. The foundation gave philosophy a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-09-23/news/marie-benoits-diary-316354/&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the general public in philosophical discussions, and also offers evening courses to adult students.&lt;ref&gt;http://markmontebello.blogspot.com/2014/01/il-filosofija-fmalta.html&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation is a member of the International Federation of Philosophy Societies (FISP)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fisp.org/members.html&lt;/ref&gt;, and also of the Malta-EU Steering &amp; Action Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meusac.gov.mt/ttemembers &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process psychology''' is a branch of [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] psychology which was derived from [[process philosophy]] as developed by [[Alfred North Whitehead]].  Process psychology got its start at a conference sponsored by the Center for Process Studies in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Association for Process Psychology http://www.processpsychology.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chromatika.org/spip/spip.php?rubrique37&lt;/ref&gt; an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Find [https://www.academia.edu/6899917/_The_Whitehead_Psychology_Nexus_Retrospect_and_Prospect_2003_ here] a brief history. Some publications followed, such as Michel Weber and Anderson Weekes (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies II)]'', Albany, New York, State University of New York Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ray Griffin]], a retired professor, has also been instrumental in encouraging the development of Process Psychology. Process Psychology is closely aligned with [[process theology]] and its practitioners frequently refer to [[Spiritual crisis|spiritual concerns]].
John Buchanan described Process Psychology as a transpersonal psychology providing an empirical basis for what has been called mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Openness: Spirituality in a Process Psychology, A Paper by John Buchanan for the Wuhan Conference on Science and Spirituality (October 2005)
http://www.ctr4process.org/publications/SeminarPapers/29_3%20Buchanan1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet other theorists reference [[systems thinking]] and the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] whose concept of a "system" is compared to Whitehead's idea of the "organism".&lt;ref&gt;Franz Riffert, Towards a Process Psychology, http://www.sbg.ac.at/erz/salzburger_beitraege/fruehling99/fr_1999_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of [[Carl G. Jung]] is also referenced and he is considered to be among the discipline's founding fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chae-Young. "A Comparison of Alfred North Whitehead's and Carl Gustav Jung's Idea of Religion." Journal of Dharma 27, no. 3 (2002): 417-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Mills (psychologist)]] has proposed a process psychology known as "dialectical psychoanalysis" (which is based, in part, on [[Hegelianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mills|first1=Jon|title="Dialecitcal Psychoanalysis: Toward Process Psychology"|url=http://www.processpsychology.com/new-articles/Process-Psychology.htm|website=ProcessPsychology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raphael von Koeber''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Рафаэль Густавович фон Кёбер}}, January 15, 1848 in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] - June 14, 1923 in [[Yokohama]]) was a notable [[Russia]]n-[[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|German]] teacher of [[philosophy]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in [[Japan]].

==Early life==
Raphael von Koeber was born in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Russia]], his father (a doctor) was [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|ethnic German]], his mother was [[Russians|ethnic Russian]], she died when he was one year old, and he was raised by his grandmother, a daughter of a priest and tutor to [[Tsar Alexander II]]’s wife. She taught young Raphael the [[piano]] at the age of 6, and greatly influenced him in his habits and studies. As an ethnic German, he was uncomfortable at school, which he therefore attended only irregularly. At the age of 19, he entered a music school in [[Moscow]] over the opposition of his father, where he was befriended by [[Tchaikovsky]] and [[Nikolai Rubinstein|Rubinstein]]. He graduated at age 24, but decided not to pursue a career as a musician due to his shyness, and instead went to [[Jena]] in [[Germany]], where he studied [[natural history]], and later [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Jena]] with [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]]. After receiving his doctorate at the age of 30, he held teaching posts in [[University of Berlin]], [[University of Heidelberg]] and [[University of Munich]], mostly teaching music history and music aesthetics.

==Life in Japan==
Koeber came to teach in Japan in June 1893, based on the recommendations of his friend [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], who overcame his worries about the long sea voyage, earthquakes and having enough [[English language]] ability to lecture. He was 45 years old.  He studied and worked for 21 years at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] from 1893 to 1914 teaching philosophy, in particular, [[Greek philosophy]], [[Medieval philosophy]] and [[Aesthetics]].

Koeber was known to be somewhat eccentric, and had fixed habits of reading, lecturing and playing the piano per a strict schedule. He rarely visited anywhere in Japan outside of Tokyo; he traveled to nearby [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and once to [[Enoshima]]. He was indifferent about money and clothes, and wore the same winter clothes for 17 years.

He had many students, among them were the famous writer [[Natsume Sōseki]] and the philosophers [[Nishida Kitaro]] and [[Watsuji Tetsuro]]. Koeber also taught piano at the Tokyo National Music School, which has now become a part of [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]. In 1901, he wrote the music for the opening of [[Japan Women's University]]. In 1903, Raphael also provided piano accompaniment for the first [[opera]] performed in Japan.

When the [[Russo-Japanese War]] broke out in 1904, Koeber refused to return to his country and the Japanese government did not make a political issue about his desire to remain in Japan.  In 1912, Koeber's domestic servant from Munich committed suicide and Koeber was shocked by the incident. In the summer of that year, Natsume Sōseki called on Koeber, and later wrote about Koeber "a professor of noblest character" in his book ''Teacher Koeber'' (In Japanese: ''Koeber Sensei'').  He retired from his teaching position in 1914 and decided to return to Munich. However, immediately before getting aboard the ship at [[Yokohama]], [[World War I]] began. Unable to travel and with no place to stay, he lived out of a room at the Russian Consulate in Yokohama for nine years until his death in 1923. His grave is at the [[Zōshigaya cemetery]] in Tokyo.

His collection of books, numbering 1,999 volumes and mainly consisting of Greek and Latin classics, and works on philosophy and literature is now at the [[Tohoku University]] Library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11213">'''Rational mysticism''', which encompasses both [[rationalism]] and [[mysticism]], is a term used by [[Academia|scholars]], [[Scientific method|researchers]], and other [[intellectual]]s, some of whom engage in studies of how [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] or [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Colloquial usage|transcendence]] such as [[trance]], [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], and [[prayer]] occur. Lines of investigation include [[History|historical]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[inquiry]] as well as [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] within such fields as [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychology]].

==Overview==
The term "rational mysticism" was in use at least as early as 1911 when it was the subject of an article by Henry W. Clark in the ''[[Harvard Theological Review]].''&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;  In a 1924 book, ''Rational Mysticism,''  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] William Kingsland correlated rational mysticism with scientific [[idealism]].&lt;ref name="KingslandBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingslandTheosophy"/&gt;  South African philosopher [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] frequently used the term, developing the theme in ''Ascent to the Absolute'' and other works in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="WilberBook"/&gt;

Columbia University [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Herman Randall, Jr.]] characterized both [[Plotinus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] as “rationalists with overtones of rational mysticism” in his 1970 book ''Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of Christian Synthesis.''&lt;ref name="RandallPlotinos"/&gt;  
Rice University professor of [[religious studies]] [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]], in his 2001 book ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom,'' defined rational mysticism as “not a contradiction in terms” but “a mysticism whose limits are set by reason.”&lt;ref name="KripalBook"/&gt;

In response to criticism of his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] used the term rational mysticism for the title of his rebuttal.&lt;ref name="HarrisEssay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NandaWheels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroNYPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroABC"/&gt;  University of Pennsylvania [[Neurotheology|neurotheologist]] [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]] has been using [[nuclear medicine]] [[brain imaging]] in similar research since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="NewbergCNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewbergForum"/&gt;

Executive editor of ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine Corey S. Powell, in his 2002 book, ''God in the Equation,''   attributed the term to [[Albert Einstein]]: “In creating his radical cosmology, Einstein stitched together a rational mysticism, drawing on—but distinct from—the views that came before.”&lt;ref name="PowellBook"/&gt;

Science writer [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] interviewed and profiled [[James H. Austin|James Austin]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Christian Rätsch]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Ken Wilber]] and others for ''Rational Mysticism: Dispatches from the Border Between Science and Spirituality,''&lt;ref name="TeresiReview"/&gt;  his 2003 study of “the scientific quest to explain the transcendent.”&lt;ref name="McCauleyBook"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Reinhold Walter Zippelius was born in [[Ansbach]] (west of [[Nuremberg]]), the son of  Hans Zippelius and Marie (Stoessel) Zippelius.{{cn|date=January 2017}} He embarked on his study of jurisprudence in 1947 at [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and then at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]]. In 1949 he switched to the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] where between 1949 and 1961 he was supported by a scholarship-bursary. He received his doctorate in 1953. His [[habilitation]] (higher academic qualification), also from  [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], and supervised by [[Karl Engisch]], would follow in 1961.&lt;ref name=RZlautUniErlNue/&gt;

After passing his public law exams (1956 and 1963) Zippelius worked in [[Politics of Bavaria|government service]] in [[Bavaria]], in the end promoted to the level of Oberregierungsrat (senior government legal advisor) at the [[Bavarian Ministry of the Interior|Interior Ministry]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}  His habilitation in 1961 opened the way for an academic career, and in 1963 he accepted a teaching chair at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] that covered a range of law related disciplines including [[Philosophy of law]], [[:de:Staatsrecht (Deutschland)|Public law]], [[:de:Verwaltungsrecht (Deutschland)|Administrative/Civil Law]] and [[Religious law|Church law]].&lt;ref name=RZlautUniErlNue/&gt;   Despite attempts by [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] and other [[German University of Administrative Sciences, Speyer|university]] [[University of Cologne|level]] [[University of Göttingen|institutions]] outside Bavaria to lure him away, he remained at Erlangen for more than fifty years.   Reinhold Zippelius retired from his professorship at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=RZlautUniErlNue/&gt;

Zippelius is a full member of the [[Mainz]] based [[Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur|Academy of Sciences and Literature (''"Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur"'')]].&lt;ref name=RZlautAWL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adwmainz.de/mitglieder/profil/prof-dr-jur-dr-hc-reinhold-zippelius.html| publisher=Die Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur| work=Die Mitglieder der Akademie und der Jungen Akademie|title= Prof. Dr. jur. Dr. h.c. Reinhold Zippelius |accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2002 The Faculty of Scientific Theory and History at [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate (''"doctor honoris causa"'').&lt;ref name=RZlautUniErlNue/&gt;

==Focus==
His academic research is centred on constitutional law, theory of the state, along with legal philosophy and method.&lt;ref name=RZlautUniErlNue/&gt;

The [[Jurisprudence#Critical rationalism|"critical rationalism"]] provides the theoretical base for Zippelius' concept of law.

According to Zippelius law does not consist of "abstract" norms which are loosened from life, but it is "law in action", which is procreated by human action and thereby transformed into the reality of the contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6th ed., § 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of legal theory, his themes include, to solve legal problems with the assistence of key concepts, comparison of cases and the question of what counts as "right", especially as regards the validity of unfair laws.

In terms of theory of the state, his themes include the legitimation and cultivation of democracy, especially regarding the [[rule of law]], and the oligarchic components of pluralistic democracy, furthermore the [[federalism]] (the limitation of authorities, the functioning and the democratic ambiguity of federalism) and the problems of the [[bureaucracy]].

A '''remnant natural area''', also known as '''remnant habitat''', is an ecological [[community (ecology)|community]] containing [[native species|native]] flora and fauna that has not been significantly [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbed]] by destructive activities such as [[agriculture]], [[logging]], [[pollution]], [[land development|development]], [[Fire_ecology#Some_examples_of_fire_in_different_ecosystems|fire]] suppression, or [[invasive species|non-native species invasion]].&lt;ref name="wiscarb"&gt;{{cite web |title=Remants and Restorations |url=https://arboretum.wisc.edu/explore/remnants/ |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more disturbed an area has been, the less characteristic it becomes of remnant habitat. Remnant areas are also described as "[[biological integrity|biologically intact]]" or "ecologically intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defining wilderness |url=https://www.wild.org/how-we-work/policy-mgmt/defining-wilderness/ |website=wild.org |publisher=WILD Foundation |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remnant natural areas are often used as [[reference ecosystem]]s in [[ecological restoration]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=McDonald |first1=T. |last2=Gann |first2=G. D. |last3=Jonson |first3=J. |last4=Dixon |first4=K.

==Ecology==
A remnant natural area can be described in terms of its natural quality or [[biological integrity]], which is the extent to which it has the internal [[biodiversity]] and [[abiotic]] elements to replicate itself over time.&lt;ref name=fotcr17&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |authorlink1=Gerould Wilhelm |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |authorlink2=Laura Rericha |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis |publisher=Indiana Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of biological integrity is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref name="karr1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=J.

R. |title=Ecological perspectives on water quality goals |journal=Environmental Management |date=1981 |volume=5 |pages=55-68 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x96t510nu2418348/fulltext.pdf |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abiotic elements determining the quality of a natural area may include factors such as hydrologic connectivity or fire. In areas that have been [[dredging|dredged]], [[drainage|drained]], or [[dam|dammed]], the altered hydrology can [[habitat destruction|destroy]] a remnant natural area. Similarly, too much or too little [[fire ecology|fire]] can degrade or destroy a remnant natural area.&lt;ref name="fotcr17"/&gt;

Remnant natural areas are characterized by the presence of "[[Floristic_Quality_Assessment#Coefficient_of_Conservatism|conservative]]" plants and animals—organisms that are restricted to or highly characteristic of areas that have not been disturbed by humans.&lt;ref name=swink1994&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swink |first1=Floyd |authorlink1=Floyd Swink |last2=Wilhelm |first2=Gerould  |date=1994 |title=Plants of the Chicago Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools to measure aspects of natural areas quality in remnant areas include [[Floristic Quality Assessment]] and the [[Macroinvertebrate Community Index]].

[[File:Silence and Respect.jpg|thumb|right|A sign entreating "silence and respect" at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]]]
'''Respect''' is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important, or held in high esteem or regard; it conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities; and it is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/respect|title=Definition of RESPECT|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate = December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/respect|title=Definition of "respect"|work=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate = December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect include simple words and phrases like "thank you" in the West, simple physical [[gesture]]s like a slight bow in the East, a smile, or direct eye contact, or a simple handshake.

== Signs and other ways of knowing respect ==

=== Language ===

Respect is shown in many different languages by following certain grammatical conventions, especially in referring to individuals.

An [[honorific]] is a word or expression (often a [[pronoun]]) that shows respect when used in addressing or referring to a person or animal.

Typically honorifics are used for second and third persons; use for first person is less common. Some languages have anti-honorific first person forms (like "your most humble servant" or "this unworthy person") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded a second or third person.

For instance, it is disrespectful to not use polite language and honorifics when speaking in Japanese with someone having a higher social status. The Japanese honorific "san" can be used when speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/features.html|title=Top Experiences in Tokyo - Fodor's Travel|website=www.fodors.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China it is rude to call someone by their first name unless you have known them for a long period of time. In work-related situations, people address each other by their title. At home people often refer to each other by nicknames or terms of kinship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;
[http://www.protocolprofessionals.com/articles_china.htm Protocol Professionals, Inc. | Chinese Etiquette &amp; Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Chinese culture, individuals often address their friends as juniors and seniors even if they are just a few months younger or older. When a Chinese person asks someone their age they often do this so they know how to address the person.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Physical gestures ===
{{See also|Category:Gestures of respect}}

[[File: Westindischer Maler um 1530 001.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A wife touching the feet of her husband.]]

In Islamic cultures around the world, there are many ways to show respect to people. For example, it is recommended to kiss the hands of parents, grandparents and teachers. Also, it is narrated in the sayings of Muhammad that if a person looks at the faces of parents and teachers with a smile, he will definitely be rewarded by Allah with success and happiness.

In [[India]], it is customary that, out of respect, when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (considered to be a manifestations of [[Saraswati]], the goddess of knowledge) or another person's leg, it will be followed by an apology in the form of a single hand gesture ([[Pranāma]]) with the right hand, where the offending person first touches the object with the finger tips and then the forehead and/or chest. This also counts for money, which is considered to be a manifestation of the goddess of wealth [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;DeBruyn, Pippa; Bain, Keith; Venkatraman, Niloufer (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qG-9cwHOcCIC Frommer's India]''. pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Pranāma, or the touching of feet in Indian culture is a sign of respect. For instance, when a child is greeting his or her grandparent, they typically will touch their hands to their grandparents' feet. In Indian culture, it is believed that the feet are a source of power and love.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, Gautam (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ0XQHEkuIcC Sacred Hindu Symbols]''. pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many African/West Indian descent communities and some non-African//West Indian descent communities, respect can be signified by the touching of fists.

Many gestures or physical acts that are common in the West can be considered disrespectful in Japan. For instance, one should not point directly at someone.&lt;ref name="fodors.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/feature_30007.html|title=Lodging Options - Experience Tokyo|date=31 October 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031054529/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/feature_30007.html|archivedate=31 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When greeting someone or thanking them, it may be insulting if the person of lower status does not bow lower than the person with higher status. The duration and level of the bow depends on many factors such as age and status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westsidetoastmasters.com/resources/book_of_body_language/chap5.html|title=Cultural Variations In Body Language|website=westsidetoastmasters.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some signs of physical respect apply to women only. If a woman does not wear cosmetics or a brassiere, it is possible that she will be considered unprofessional or others may think she does not care about the situation.&lt;ref name="fodors.com"/&gt;

==== Chinese culture ====
{{See also|Category:Chinese honorifics}}

Unlike Japanese culture, it is not necessary in Chinese culture to bow to one another as a greeting or parting gesture. Bowing is generally reserved as a sign of respect for elders and ancestors. When bowing, they place the fist of the right hand in the palm of their left at stomach level. The deeper the bow, the more respect they are showing.

In Chinese culture, there is not much participation in physical contact, especially when doing business because this can be seen as too casual, thus disrespectful. It is considered rude to slap, pat, or put one's arm around the shoulders of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commisceo-global.com/country-guides/china-guide|title=China - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette|website=www.commisceo-global.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[affection]] in same-sex [[friendships]] in East Asia is much more pronounced than in the West. Same-sex friends will often be seen with their arms around one another, holding hands, and other signs of physical affection.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, et al. "Communicating love: Comparisons between American and East Asian university students." ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations''. no. 32 (2008): 200-2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncommon to see very many hand gestures being used in Chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Chinese sometimes do not smile or exchange greetings with strangers. Smiling or being friendly to someone you do not know well can be considered rude and too familiar. It is also common to see Chinese women covering their mouths when they laugh. Traditionally, a woman who laughed too loudly was considered to be uncouth and ill-bred.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Traditionally, there was not much hand-shaking in Chinese culture. However, this gesture is now widely practiced among men, especially when greeting Westerners or other foreigners. Many Westerners may find Chinese handshakes to be too long or too weak, but this is because a weaker handshake is a gesture of humility and respect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Kowtowing]], or kneeling and bowing so deeply that one's forehead is touching the floor, is practiced during worship at temples. Kowtowing is a powerful gesture reserved mainly for honoring the dead or offering deep respect at a temple.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Many codes of behavior revolve around young people showing respect to older people. Like in many cultures, younger Chinese individuals are expected to defer to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them. Sometimes when an older person enters a room, everyone stands. People are often introduced from oldest to youngest. Often time, younger people will go out of their way to open doors for their elders and not cross their legs in front of them. The older you are the more respect you are expected to be treated with.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Respect as a cultural value==
[[File:Respeitoplaca.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Sign]] in [[São João da Barra]] saying ''"respect if you want to be respected"''.]]

=== Indigenous American culture ===
In many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American societies]] the perspective on respect differs slightly because it serves as an important concept valued in their culture's context. Aside from meaning positive feelings of esteem or deference is also viewed as a moral value that teaches indigenous individuals about their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=David-Lorente|title=Ser respetuoso es ser persona. El niño y la pedagogía moral de Los Nahuas del Centro de México|journal=Revista de Dialectología y Tradiciones Populares|date=2012|volume=67|issue=2|pages=431|doi=10.3989/rdtp.2012.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this moral value is treated as a process that influences certain participation in the community and also helps the individual develop and become integrated into their culture's community. During childhood is when this value of respect is taught because indigenous children participating in and learning about their community is an important aspect of the culture.

Respect as a form of behavior and participation is especially important in childhood as it serves as a basis of how the child must conduct themselves in their community. Children engage in mature activities such as cooking for the family, cleaning and sweeping the house, caring for infant peers, and crop work. Indigenous children learn to view their participation in these activities are a representation of respect. Through his manner of participation of activities of respect is how children not only learn about culture but also practice it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.gov|title=Official Guide to Government Information and Services  - USAGov|website=usa.gov|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respect for Authority (Christianity) ===

The Christian faith specifically recognizes respect for Authority throughout the Bible, including parental authority ([[Ten Commandments|Ten Commandments]]), civil authority and divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthmagazine.com/archives/volume33/GOT033159.html|title=Respect for Authority|website=truthmagazine.com|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zfhf9j6/revision/1 |title=Sources of Authority |newspaper=[[BBC]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

= &lt;small&gt;1 Timothy 2:1-4 New American Standard Bible (NASB)&lt;/small&gt; =
First of all, then, I urge that entreaties ''and'' prayers, petitions ''and'' thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in &lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt;authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and &lt;sup&gt;[b]&lt;/sup&gt;dignity. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the &lt;sup&gt;[c]&lt;/sup&gt;knowledge of the truth.

'''Reza Negarestani''' is an [[Iran]]ian philosopher and writer, known for "pioneering the genre of 'theory-fiction' with his book" ''Cyclonopedia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://re-press.org/books/cyclonopedia-complicity-with-anonymous-materials/ |title=Cyclonopedia: Complicity with Anonymous Materials &amp;#124; |publisher=Re-press.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in 2008. it was listed in [[Artforum]] as one of the best books of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://re-press.org/cyclonopedia-artforum-international-best-of-2009/ |title=Cyclonopedia – Artforum International: Best of 2009 &amp;#124; |publisher=Re-press.org |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Philosophical work==
Negarestani has been a regular contributor to ''[[Collapse (journal)|Collapse]]'', as well as other print and web publications such as [[Ctheory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=396 |title=CTheory.net |publisher=CTheory.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2011, faculty from [[Brooklyn College]] and [[The New School]] organized a symposium to discuss Cyclonopedia titled Leper Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/LeperCreativityCyclonopediaSymposium4thPanel |title=Leper Creativity: Cyclonopedia Symposium : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the year, [[Punctum books]] published a book with the same title that included essays, articles, artworks, and documents from or related to the symposium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punctumbooks.com/titles/leper-creativity-cyclonopedia-symposium/ |title=Leper Creativity: Cyclonopedia Symposium |publisher=punctum books |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, he co-edited Collapse's issue VII with Robin Mackay titled Culinary Materialism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanomic.com/pub_collapse7.php |title=Collapse Vol. VII: Culinary Materialism |publisher=Urbanomic |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Negarestani collaborated with Florian Hecker on an artwork titled "Chimerization" that was included in the [[dOCUMENTA (13)]] exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;http://d13.documenta.de/#/programs/the-kassel-programs/some-artworks-and-programs-initiated-by-documenta-13-participants/chimerizations-and-speculative-solutions/&lt;/ref&gt; He has since written librettos for a series of full-length albums based on Hecker's concept of 'chimerization'.

After being associated with the philosophical movement of [[speculative realism]] for several years, Negarestani is currently lecturing and writing about [[Rationalism|rationalist]] universalism beginning with the evolution of the modern system of knowledge and advancing toward contemporary philosophies of rationalism, their procedures as well as their demands for special forms of human conduct.

Since his relocation to the [[United States of America]], Negarestani has given several lectures, a list of which includes:

[[image:Pilot-Mountain-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|right|In this book, Dōgen equates mountains and waters with the Buddha's body and speech]] 
'''''Sansui kyō''''' ({{CJKV|j=山水經}}), rendered in English as '''''Mountains and Waters Sutra''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful of all of the 95 books of the Shōbōgenzō according to [[Stanford University]] professor Carl Bielefeldt. The text was written in the fall of 1240 at Dōgen's monastery [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], and the manuscript from that time in Dōgen's own hand survives. This year saw a marked increase in the output of his essays for the Shōbōgenzō, including the closely related work [[Keisei sanshoku (Shōbōgenzō)|Keisei sanshoku]] written a few months before and covering essentially the same theme, namely the mountains and rivers as equivalent to the body and speech of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name=bielefeldt&gt;{{citation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|title=Shōbōgenzō sansui kyō: Introduction|year=2001|publisher=Sotoshu Shumucho|url=http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/sansuikyo/sansuikyo.intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book appears as the 29th in the 75 fascicle versions of the [[Shōbōgenzō]], and it is ordered 14th in the later chronological 95 fascicle ''Honzan'' edition. It was also included as the 14th book of the 28 fascicle "Eiheiji manuscript" Shōbōgenzō.&lt;ref name=textual&gt;{{citation|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Dōgen: Textual and Historical Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|page=39|isbn=978-0-19-975447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gudō Wafu Nishijima|Gudō Nishijima]], a modern Zen priest, sums up the essay as follows: "Buddhism is basically a religion of belief in the universe, and nature is the universe showing its real form. So to look at nature is to look at the Buddhist truth itself. For this reason, Master Dōgen believed that nature is just Buddhist sutras."&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=1|pages=217|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=1-4196-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43645">'''Self-compassion''' is extending [[compassion]] to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general [[suffering]]. [[Kristin Neff]] has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main components – self-kindness, common humanity, and [[mindfulness]].&lt;ref name="neff-a"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15298860309027 | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003a | title = The development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 223–250 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.5757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Self-kindness: Self-compassion [[logical consequence|entails]] being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism.
*Common humanity: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience.
*[[Mindfulness]]: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated.  Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.822 | last1 = Brown | first1 = K. W. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R. M. | year = 2003 | title = The benefits of being present: Mindfulness and its role in psychological well-being | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 4| pages = 822–848 | pmid = 12703651 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.331.8033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, mindfulness requires that one not be "over-identified" with mental or emotional phenomena, so that one suffers aversive reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bishop | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Lau | first2 = M. | last3 = Shapiro | first3 = S. | last4 = Carlson | first4 = L. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = N. D. | last6 = Carmody | first6 = J. | last7 = Segal | first7 = Z. V. Abbey | last8 = Speca | first8 = M. | last9 = Velting | first9 = D. Devins| year = 2004 | title = Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology Science and Practice | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 191–206  |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This latter type of response involves narrowly focusing and ruminating on one's negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.100.4.569 | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | year = 1991 | title = Responses to depression and their effects on the duration of depressive episodes | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 569–582 | pmid = 1757671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-compassion has been considered to resemble [[Carl Rogers]]' notion of "[[unconditional positive regard]]" applied both towards clients and oneself; [[Albert Ellis]]' "unconditional self-acceptance"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an "internal empathizer" that explored one's own experience with "curiosity and compassion"; [[Ann Weiser Cornell]]'s notion of a [[Inner Relationship Focusing#Description|gentle, allowing relationship]] with all parts of one's being; and [[Judith V. Jordan|Judith Jordan]]'s concept of ''self-empathy'', which implies acceptance, care and [[empathy]] towards the self.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Buck, David Lukoff: [http://www.spiritualcompetency.com/scrcQuiz.aspx?courseID=65 Self-Compassion i: Spiritual and Psychological Roots] (course description), SCRC&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-compassion is different from [[self-pity]], a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with an adverse situation.

Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater [[psychological health]] than those who lack self-compassion.  For example, self-compassion is positively associated with [[life satisfaction]], [[wisdom]], [[happiness]], [[optimism]], [[curiosity]], learning goals, [[social connectedness]], personal responsibility, and [[emotional resilience]].  At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for [[self-criticism]], depression, [[anxiety]], [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]], [[thought suppression]], [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], and disordered eating attitudes.&lt;ref name="neff-a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. E., &amp; Leary, M. R. (in press). Promoting Self-compassionate Attitudes toward Eating Among Restrictive and Guilty Eaters. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, &amp; Irons, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leary"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.92.5.887 | last1 = Leary | first1 = M.

Self-compassion has different effects than [[self-esteem]], a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.392 | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = L.

D &amp; Vonk, R. (submitted). ''Self-compassion versus self-esteem:  Two different ways of relating to oneself.''  Manuscript submitted for publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scales ==
Much of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by [[Kristin Neff]], which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]], and [[mindfulness]] versus over-identification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages. Some of these include a Czech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benda | first1 = J. | last2 = Reichová | first2 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Psychometric characteristics of the Czech version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS- CZ) | journal = Československá Psychologie | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 120–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arimitsu | first1 = K | year = 2014 | title = Development and validation of the japanese version of the self-compassion scale | url = | journal = Japanese Journal of Psychology | volume = 85 | issue = 1| pages = 50–59 | doi=10.4992/jjpsy.85.50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J. | last2 = Yan | first2 = L. | last3 = Zhou | first3 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Reliability and validity of chinese version of self-compassion scale | url = | journal = Chinese Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 734–736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deniz | first1 = M.

=== Development ===
The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003a | title = The development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 223–250 | doi=10.1080/15298860309027| citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.5757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next stage of development involved testing the [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of the scale among a larger group of participants. During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The self-compassion scales have good reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Dam | first1 = N. T. | last2 = Sheppard | first2 = S.C. | last3 = Forsyth | first3 = J.P. | last4 = Earleywine | first4 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression | doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.08.011 | pmid = 20832990 | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 123–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between [[self-esteem]] and self-compassion. This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in [[questionnaire]] form. They were as follows: The 26-item Self-compassion Scale, the 10-item [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale]], the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the findings, Neff reports "that self-compassion and [[self-esteem]] were measuring two different psychological phenomena."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A third study was conducted to examine the [[construct validity]]. By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion. Forty-three [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practitioners completed the Self-compassion Scale as well as a [[self-esteem]] scale.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group. As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Self-compassion scale  ===
The long version of the Self-compassion scale (SCS) consists of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales – self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, [[isolation (psychology)|isolation]], [[mindfulness]], and over-identification. Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Presented on a [[Likert scale]], ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self-compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"/&gt;

A shorter, Dutch version of the SCS scale has been developed that uses 24 items.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"/&gt;

=== Short form  ===
The short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raes | first1 = F. | last2 = Pommier | first2 = E. | last3 = Neff | first3 = K.

=== Six-factor model ===
Neff's scale proposes three interacting components of self-compassion, which are each composed of two opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that they are part of a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://self-compassion.org/the-three-elements-of-self-compassion-2/|title = Self-Compassion|date = 2015|accessdate = 3 August 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Neff|first = Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Self-Compassion: An Alternative Conceptualization of a Healthy Attitude Toward Oneself|last = Neff|first = Kristin|date = 2003|journal = Psychology Press|doi = 10.1080/15298860309032|pmid = |volume=2|issue = 2|pages=85–101|citeseerx = 10.1.1.616.6302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms of Neff's scale ===
Currently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the only self-report instrument used to measure self-compassion. Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, recent research has posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Reconsideration of the Self-Compassion Scale's Total Score: Self-Compassion versus Self-Criticism|last = Lopez|first = Angelica|date = 20 July 2015|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0132940|pmid = 26193654|volume=10|issue = 7|pages=e0132940|pmc=4508060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Generalizability ====
The generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale can be questioned; although the scale is used to measure self-compassion in the general population and has been translated into many languages, the scale itself has mostly been tested on college students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Six-factor model ====
A recent study performed by Angélica López et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of Neff's Self-compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population. The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately. Lopez's study also suggests it is important to view self-compassion and self-criticism as being distinct from one another, traits that Neff's Self-compassion Scale assumes are opposites. Lopez's study makes it clear that there is room for further research into the validity of the six-factor structure used by Neff's Self-compassion Scale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Exercises ==
Self-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity. Self-compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self-compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meeting Suffering With Kindness: Effects of a Brief Self-Compassion Intervention for Female College Students|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2014-01-01|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/jclp.22076|pmid = 24691680|first = Elke|last = Smeets|first2 = Kristin|last2 = Neff|first3 = Hugo|last3 = Alberts|first4 = Madelon|last4 = Peters|pages=794–807}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The benefits of self-compassion and optimism exercises for individuals vulnerable to depression|journal = The Journal of Positive Psychology|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1743-9760|pages = 377–389|volume = 5|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/17439760.2010.516763|first = Leah B.|last = Shapira|first2 = Myriam|last2 = Mongrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How would you treat a friend? ===
This exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation. The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-1-treat-friend/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-compassion break ===
This exercise is to be used during times of acute distress. The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation. Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: [[mindfulness]], [[common humanity]], and self-kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-2-self-compassion-break/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploring through writing ===
In this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate. Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend. The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 3: Exploring self-compassion through writing|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-3-exploring-self-compassion-writing/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticizer, criticized, and compassionate observer ===
This exercise asks the user to occupy several "chairs" during the course of the practice. Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of [[self-criticism]]. They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 4: The criticizer, the criticized, and the compassionate observer|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-4-criticizer-criticized-compassionate-observer/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing your critical self-talk ===
This exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism. Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self-critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 5: Changing your critical self-talk|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-5-changing-critical-self-talk/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journal ===
This exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors. The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 6: Self-Compassion Journal|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-6-self-compassion-journal/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identifying what we really want ===
In this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself. Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 7: Identifying what we really want|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-7-identifying-really-want/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taking care of the caregiver ===
This exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 8: Taking care of the caregiver|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-8-taking-care-caregiver/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-forgiveness as an element ==
Self-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings. Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Self-Forgiveness versus Excusing: The Roles of Remorse, Effort, and Acceptance of Responsibility|last = Fisher|first = Mickie|date = 2006|journal = Psychology Press|doi = 10.1080/15298860600586123|pmid = |volume=5|issue = 2|pages=127–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-social behavior ===
When self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action. In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Self-acceptance as an element ==
Self-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are. Self-acceptance differs from [[self-esteem]] in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth. Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unconditional Self-Acceptance and Psychological Health|last = Chamberlain|first = John|date = 2001|journal = Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindfulness ==

===History ===
The concept of [[mindfulness]] and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy and Buddhist meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cigolla | first1 = F. | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = A way of being: Bringing mindfulness into individual therapy | url = | journal = Psychotherapy Research | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 709–721 | doi = 10.1080/10503307.2011.613076 | pmid = 21943184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Pilot Study and Randomized Controlled Trial of the Mindful Self-Compassion Program|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2012-01-01|volume = 69|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/jclp.21923|pmid = 23070875|first = Kristin D.|last = Neff|first2 = Christopher K.|last2 = Germer|pages=28–44|citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.7685}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way.&lt;ref&gt;Nehra, D.

Delhi: Global Vision Publishing House''. from http://globalvisionpub.com/globaljournalmanager/pdf/1389680520.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compassion]] (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Loving-kindness and compassion meditation: Potential for psychological interventions|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735811001115|journal = Clinical Psychology Review|date = 2011-01-01|pmc = 3176989|pmid = 21840289|volume = 31|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.07.003|first = Stefan G.|last = Hofmann|first2 = Paul|last2 = Grossman|first3 = Devon E.|last3 = Hinton|pages=1126–1132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a  grounded way in order to avoid "over-identification".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness verses self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Mindfulness-based stress reduction ===
[[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]] ([[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|MBSR]]), developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] is a structured group program that uses [[mindfulness meditation]] to relieve suffering associated with physical, [[Psychosomatic Illness|psychosomatic]] and [[psychiatric disorders]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teaching self-care to caregivers: Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on the mental health of therapists in training|journal = Training and Education in Professional Psychology|date = 2007-01-01|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1931-3918.1.2.105|first = Shauna L.|last = Shapiro|first2 = Kirk Warren|last2 = Brown|first3 = Gina M.|last3 = Biegel|pages=105–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and [[spirituality|spiritual]] health.&lt;ref&gt;Mindfullivingprograms.com,.

(2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group. It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ===
[[Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho-education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Z., Williams, J., &amp; Teasdale, J. (2009). ''Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression'' (pp. 307-312). New York, 	NY: Guilford Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations. Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treatment-resistant Depressed Patients Show a Good Response to Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy|journal = FOCUS|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1541-4094|pages = 120–126|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1176/foc.8.1.foc120|pmid = 16797486|pmc = 2808477|first = M.a.|last = Kenny|first2 = J.m.g.|last2 = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may causes a relapse. Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How does mindfulness-based cognitive therapy work?|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796710001774|journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 48|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2010.08.003|pmid = 20810101|first = Willem|last = Kuyken|first2 = Ed|last2 = Watkins|first3 = Emily|last3 = Holden|first4 = Kat|last4 = White|first5 = Rod S.|last5 = Taylor|first6 = Sarah|last6 = Byford|first7 = Alison|last7 = Evans|first8 = Sholto|last8 = Radford|first9 = John D.|last9 = Teasdale|pages=1105–1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced. They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mindful self-compassion therapy ===
Mindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self-compassion and mindfulness practices.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices. In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Compassion focused therapy ===
Paul Gilbert (2009) developed [[compassion focused therapy]] (CFT) that teaches clients that, due to how our brains have evolved, anxiety, anger and depression are natural experiences that are occur through no fault of our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Common language for psychotherapy procedures: the first 80|doi = 10.13140/2.1.2348.1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introducing compassion-focused therapy|url = http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/15/3/199|journal = Advances in Psychiatric Treatment|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 2056-4678|pages = 199–208|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1192/apt.bp.107.005264|first = Paul|last = Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are trained to change maladaptive thought patterns such as "I'm unlovable" and provide alternative self-statements, such as "know for sure that some people love me".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The goal of CFT is to help patients develop a sense of warmth and emotional responsiveness to oneself.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This is achieved through a variety of exercises including visualization, cultivating self-kindest through language by engaging in self-compassionate behaviors and habits.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In CFT self-compassion is utilized through thoughts, images, and attention which is needed to stimulate and develop the contentment, sooth and safeness system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Mindfulness skills in dialectical behavior therapy ===
[[Dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), is a derivative of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavior therapy]] that incorporates Eastern meditative practice.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of change in dialectical behavior therapy: Theoretical and empirical observations|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2006-01-01|volume = 62|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/jclp.20243|pmid = 16470714|first = Thomas R.|last = Lynch|first2 = Alexander L.|last2 = Chapman|first3 = M.

We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Baer, R. (2006). ''Mindfulness-based treatment approaches''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core [[mindfulness]], interpersonal effectiveness, [[Emotional self-regulation|emotion regulation]], and [[distress tolerance]] skills.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion. The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does Self-Compassion Mitigate the Association Between Childhood Maltreatment and Later Emotion Regulation Difficulties?

===Mindfulness and related skills in acceptance and commitment therapy ===
[[Acceptance and commitment therapy]] utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process. ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, [[problem solving]] skills and [[psychological flexibility]]. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises skills facilitates the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly the ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Using acceptance and commitment therapy to increase self-compassion: A randomized controlled trial|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212144714000763|journal = Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4260406|pmid = 25506545|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.09.002|first = James E.|last = Yadavaia|first2 = Steven C.|last2 = Hayes|first3 = Roger|last3 = Vilardaga|pages=248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ACT perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind with believing, proving them wrong or engaging stance to make these thoughts workable.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes &amp; Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The '''Severians''' were a sect of gnostic [[Encratites]]. [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] supposes their leader [[Severus (Encratite)|Severus]] to have preceded [[Tatian]] (founder of Encratites) but [[Eusebius]], [[Theodoret]], and [[Jerome]] make him Tatian's successor. These latter authorities are followed by most ecclesiastical historians, and the silence of [[Irenaeus]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] regarding Severus renders the later date most probable. 

Ephiphanius ascribes to the Severians a belief in the well known Gnostic power [[Demiurge|Ialdaboth]] (Yaldabaoth) who appears in the [[Ophites|Ophite]] system as the first offspring of [[Bythus]] and [[Ennoia]]. The Severians held that Ialdaboth was a great ruler of the powers, that from him sprung the [[Devil]]: that the Devil being cast down to the earth in the form of the serpent produced the vine, whose snake-like tendrils indicate its origin: that the Devil also created woman and the lower half of man.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, Ecclesiastical Parties, [[John Henry Blunt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simonians''' were a [[Gnostic]] sect of the 2nd century which regarded [[Simon Magus]] as its founder and traced its doctrines, known as '''Simonianism''', back to him. The sect flourished in Syria, in various districts of [[Asia Minor]] and at [[Rome]]. In the 3rd century remnants of it still existed, which survived until the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', I, 57; VI, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=|editor=Alan David Crown|title=The Samaritans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzo6KAH3FmUC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1989|publisher=[[Mohr Siebeck]]|isbn=978-3-16-145237-6|pages=43–50|chapter=Simonianism and Samaritanism in the Second and Third Centuries A.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mention of the Simonians===
[[Justin Martyr]] wrote in his ''Apology'' (152 AD) that the sect of the Simonians appeared to have been formidable, as he speaks four times of their founder, Simon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Simon%20Magus Dictionary of Christian Biography, Vol. 4, p. 682].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofapos02hast Hastings' Dictionary of the Apostolic Church, Vol 2, p. 496].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simonians are mentioned by [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pamphilus |first1=Eusebius |authorlink=Eusebius of Caesarea |translator-last=Cruse |translator-first=Christian Frederick |url=https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiastica00euse#page/157/mode/1up |title=The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea, in Palestine |volume=IV, xxii. |location=New York, New York |publisher=Thomas N. Standford |year=1856 |pages=157-158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their doctrines are quoted and opposed in connection with Simon Magus by [[Irenaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'', I, xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; by the ''[[Philosophumena]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Philosophumena]]'', VI, ix-xx; X, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Haer.", xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]] also mentions that some of the sect were called Heleniani.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |last=Stock |first=St. George William Joseph  |wstitle=Simon Magus |volume=25 |pages=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'',  v. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and development - Samaritan Baptist sect===
According to [[John D. Turner]], the Simonians originated as a local Jewish cult in the first century CE, which centered on a [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] holy man. This early cult was syncretistic, but not Gnostic. In the second century, under influence of Christianity, Simon was transformed into a Gnostic saviour. The influence of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] resulted in a Gnostic "monistic theogony."{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=260-261}}

According to Aldo Magris, Samaritan Baptist sects were an offshoot of [[John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}} One offshoot was in turn headed by [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheus]], [[Simon Magus]], and [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]].{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}}&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIII.|Irenaeus, ''Adversus haereses'', I, xxiii.]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this milieu that the idea emerged that the world was created by ignorant angels. Their baptismal ritual removed the consequences of sin, and lead to a regeneration by which natural death, which was caused by these angels, was overcome.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}} The Samaritan leaders were viewed as "the embodiment of God's power, spirit, or wisdom, and as the redeemer and revealer of 'true knowledge'."{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}}

[[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheus]], a Samaritan who died from starvation,&lt;ref&gt;"Pseudo-Clemen. Recognitions," I, 57, 72; II, 11; [[Origen]], "Contra Cels.", I, 57; VI, 11; "De principiis", IV, 17; "In Matth. Comm.", XXXII, P.L., XIII, 1643; "In Luc. Hom.", XXV, ibid., 1866; Epiphanius, "Haer.", XX.&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have originally been the "Standing One," or leader, of [[John the Baptist]]'s sect, but stepped aside in favor of Simon Magus. [[Origen]], who was ordained priest in AD 231,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pamphilus |first1=Eusebius |authorlink=Eusebius of Caesarea |translator-last=Cruse |translator-first=Christian Frederick |url=https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiastica00euse#page/243/mode/1up |title=The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea, in Palestine |volume=VI, xxiii. |location=New York, New York |publisher=Thomas N. Standford |year=1856 |page=243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of Dositheus, and also mentions Simon Magus.{{refn|group=note|Origen: "Also Simon the Samaritan, a magician, wished to filch away some by his magic. And at the time indeed he succeeded in his deception, but now I suppose it is not possible to find 30 Simonians altogether in the world; and perhaps I have put the number higher than it really is. But in Palestine there are very few, and in the rest of the world, in which he wished to spread his own glory, his name is nowhere mentioned. If it is, this is due to the Acts of the Apostles. It is the Christians who say what is said about him, and it has become plain as daylight that Simon was nothing divine."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', i. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;}} As late as the beginning of the 7th century, [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] opposed Dositheans, who regarded Dositheus as the great prophet foretold by Moses.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], "Bibliotheca cod.", 230.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like Simon, [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]], who was a pupil and, after Simon's death, his most important successor, also proclaimed himself to be the one sent of God, the [[Messias]]. In the same way he taught the creation of the world by angels who were sent by the ''Ennoia''. He asserted that men received immortality and the resurrection by his baptism and practiced magical arts. The sect named after him, the Menandrians, continued to exist for a considerable length of time. 

Simonian influences continued through Menander's own followers who included Saturninus of Antioch and [[Basilides]], the latter identified by Ireneus with the further development of his predecessors ideas.&lt;ref name="Groningen1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard van Groningen|title=First Century Gnosticism: Its Origin and Motifs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|year=1967|publisher=Brill Archive|page=144|chapter=The Successor of Simon Magus |id=GGKEY:U5J7K6Y11UY}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpocrates]] practised in the tradition of Basildes, and his own follower, [[Marcellina (gnostic)|Marcellina]], became one of the few female leaders of early Christianity in 2nd century Rome.&lt;ref name="Groningen1967"/&gt;

==''The Great Declaration''==
In the ''Philosophumena'' of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], Simon's doctrine is recorded according to his reputed work, ''The Great Declaration'', as it existed in the 2nd century. As Hippolytus himself in more than one place&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Philosophumena]]'', iv. 51, vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; points out, it is an earlier form of the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian doctrine]], but there are things reminiscent of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] physics.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Outline===
The whole book is a mixture of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] and [[Hebraism]], in which the same method of allegory is applied to [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] as to [[Moses]]. Starting from the assertion of Moses that God is "a devouring fire" (Deuteronomy 4:24), Simon combined therewith the philosophy of [[Heraclitus]] which made fire the first principle of all things. This first principle he denominated a "Boundless Power," and he declared it to dwell in the sons of men, beings born of flesh and blood. But fire was not the simple thing that the many imagined, and Simon distinguished between its hidden and its manifest qualities, maintaining that the former were the cause of the latter. Like the Stoics he conceived of it as an intelligent being. From this ungenerated being sprang the generated world of which we know, whereof there were six roots, having each its inner and its outer side, and arranged as follows:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Simonian Aeonology.jpg|600px|center|Diagram of the Simonian Aeonology, by [[G.R.S. Mead]]]]

These six roots, ''Mind, Voice, Reason, Reflection, Name'', and ''Thought'', are also called six powers. Commingled with them all was the great power, the "Boundless Power." This was that which "has stood, stands, and will stand," the seventh power (root) corresponding to the seventh day after the six days of creation. This seventh power existed before the world, it is the Spirit of God that moved upon the face of the waters (Genesis 1:2). It existed potentially in every child of man, and might be developed in each to its own immensity. The small might become great, the point be enlarged to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Philosophumena]]'', iv. 51, v. 9, vi. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This indivisible point which existed in the body, and of which none but the spiritual knew, was the Kingdom of Heaven, and the grain of mustard-seed.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Philosophumena]]'', v. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; But it rested with us to develop it, and it is this responsibility which is referred to in the words—"that we may not be condemned with the world" (1 Corinthians 11:32). For if the image of the Standing One were not actualized in us, it would not survive the death of the body. "The axe," he said, "is nigh to the roots of the tree: Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire"&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estudobiblico.org/en/biblical-comment/805-the-plan-that-the-father-hath-not-planted|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150211180825/http://estudobiblico.org/en/biblical-comment/805-the-plan-that-the-father-hath-not-planted|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-02-11|title=The plan that the Father hath not planted: Biblical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''cf.'' Matthew 3:10).

===Eden===
There is a remarkable physiological interpretation of the [[Garden of Eden]] that evinces a certain amount of anatomical knowledge on the part of Simon or his followers. Here, Paradise is the [[womb]], and the river going out of Eden is envisioned as the [[umbilical cord]].

{{quote|The [[navel]] [''i.e.,'' the umbilical cord], he says, is divided into four channels, for on either side of the navel two air-ducts [''i.e.,'' the [[umbilical arteries]]] are stretched to convey the breath, and two [[umbilical vein|[umbilical] veins]] to convey blood. But when, he says, the navel going forth from the region of Eden is attached to the [[foetus]] in the [[epigastric]] regions, that which is commonly called by everyone the navel . . . and the two veins by which the blood flows and is carried from the Edenic region through what are called the gates [''[[Transverse fissure of liver|porta]]''] of the [[liver]], which nourish the foetus. And the air-ducts, which we said were channels for breath, embracing the [[bladder]] on either side in the region of the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], are united at the great duct which is called the [[dorsal aorta]]. . . . The whole (of the foetus) is wrapped up in an envelope, called the [[amnion]], and is nourished through the navel and receives the essence of the breath through the dorsal duct, as I have said.}}

The five books of Moses are made to represent the five senses:
*[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]: ''Conception'' and ''Sight''
*[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]: ''Birth'' and ''Hearing''
*[[Leviticus]]: ''Respiration'' and ''Smell''
*[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]: ''Speech'' and ''Taste''
* [[Deuteronomy]]: ''Synthesis'' and ''Touch''

===Fragment===
As the female side of the original being appears the "thought" or "conception" (''ennoia''), which is the mother of the [[Aeon]]s. There is a mystical passage on the unity of all things, suggestive of the ''[[Emerald Tablet]].'' Its language seems to throw light on the story about Helen.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Philosophumena]]'', vi. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To you, therefore, I say what I say, and write what I write. And the writing is this.

Of the universal Aeons there are two shoots, without beginning or end, springing from one Root, which is the Power invisible, inapprehensible Silence. Of these shoots one is manifested from above, which is the Great Power, the Universal Mind ordering all things, male, and the other, (is manifested) from below, the Great Thought, female, producing all things.

Hence pairing with each other, they unite and manifest the Middle Distance, incomprehensible Air, without beginning or end. In this is the Father who sustains all things, and nourishes those things which have a beginning and end.

This is He who has stood, stands and will stand, a male-female power like the preëxisting Boundless Power, which has neither beginning nor end, existing in oneness. For it is from this that the Thought in the oneness proceeded and became two.

So he was one; for having her in himself, he was alone, not however first, although preëxisting, but being manifested from himself to himself, he became second. Nor was he called Father before (Thought) called him Father.

As, therefore, producing himself by himself, he manifested to himself his own Thought, so also the Thought that was manifested did not make the Father, but contemplating him hid him—that is to say the Power—in herself, and is male-female, Power and Thought.

Hence they pair with each other being one, for there is no difference between Power and Thought. From the things above is discovered Power, and from those below Thought.

In the same manner also that which was manifested from them although being one is yet found as two, the male-female having the female in itself. Thus Mind is in Thought—things inseparable from one another—which although being one are yet found as two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = G.R.S. Mead | last = Mead | first = G.R.S. | title = Simon Magus | year = 1892|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12892/12892-h/12892-h.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Practices==

===Heresiologists===
The Simonians were variously accused of using magic and [[theurgy]], incantations and love-potions; declaring [[idolatry]] a matter of indifference that was neither good nor bad, proclaiming all sex to be perfect love, and altogether leading very disorderly, immoral lives. [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his 4th century [[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]], writes that 'every vile corruption that could either be done or devised, is practised by this most abominable heresy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pamphilus |first1=Eusebius |authorlink=Eusebius of Caesarea |translator-last=Cruse |translator-first=Christian Frederick |url=https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiastica00euse#page/63/mode/1up |title=The ecclesiastical history of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea, in Palestine |volume=II, xiii. |location=New York, New York |publisher=Thomas N. Standford |year=1856 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, they were said to regard nothing in itself as good or bad by nature: it was not good works that made men blessed, in the next world, but the grace bestowed by Simon and Helena on those who followed them.

To this end, the Simonians were said to venerate Simon under the image of [[Zeus]], and Helena under that of [[Athena]]. However, Hippolytus adds that "if any one, on seeing the images either of Simon or Helen, shall call them by those names, he is cast out, as showing ignorance of the mysteries." From this it is evident that the Simonians did not allow that they actually worshipped their founders.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In the [[Clementine literature|Clementine]] ''Recognitions'' Helena is called [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]],&lt;ref&gt;ii. 8, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; which may mean that the images were allegorical representations of the [[sun]] and [[moon]].

The writer of the pseudo-Cyprian ''De Rebaptismate'' says that on the strength of the words of John, that "we were to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire," the Simonians maintained that the orthodox baptism was a mere form, and that they had the real baptism, for, as soon as their neophytes went down into the water, a fire appeared on it. The writer does not dispute the fact, but is at a loss what to make of it. Was it a bit of jugglery, or a natural phenomenon, or a piece of self-deception, or an effect of magic? In advocacy of this baptism, we are told, there was composed by the same heretics a book which was inscribed the ''Preaching of Paul.''&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===The Testimony of Truth===
Outside of these patristic sources, the Simonians are briefly mentioned in the ''[[Testimony of Truth]]'' (58,1-60,3) from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]], wherein the Gnostic author seems to include them among a long list of "heretics":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Marvin Meyer | last = Meyer | first = Marvin | title = The Nag Hammadi Scriptures | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-06-052378-7 | page = 624 | chapter= The Testimony of Truth | others = trans. Birger A. Pearson}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They do [not] agree with each other. For the Si[mo]nians get married and produce children, but the ...ans abstain from their ... nature ... [to passion] ... the drops of ... smear themselves ... we ... [they agree] with each other ... him ... they say ...

[''about 16 lines missing'']

... [there is] no judgment ... for these because of ... them ... the heretics ... schisms ... with males ... are men ... they will belong [to the world rulers of] darkness ... of the world ... they have ... the [archons ... power] ...

[''1 line missing'']

... judge [them] ....

But the ...ians ... words ...

[''about 11 lines missing'']

... speak ... [they will] become ... in [unquenchable] fire ... they are punished.}}

Translator Birger A. Pearson notes that these passages probably deal with the practices of libertine Gnostic sects, but from the fragmentary state of the text, it is impossible to know to what groups are being referred. The staunchly ascetic author may have had no more issue with the Simonians than their marrying and having children. However, Epiphanius also accuses the Simonians of having "enjoined mysteries of obscenity and—to set it forth more seriously—of the sheddings of bodies, ''emissionum virorum, feminarum menstruorum'', and that they should be gathered up for mysteries in a most filthy collection; that these were the mysteries of life, and of the most perfect ''gnosis''."&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion,'' 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article concerns the book. For a textual history of the Qur'an, see [[History of the Quran]].''
[[Image:OriginsOfTheKoran.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''''The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam’s Holy Book''''', is a 1998 book edited by [[Ibn Warraq]]. It contains a collection of 13 critical studies of the [[Qur'an]] written over the past two centuries by historians and scholars of the Middle East: [[Ibn Warraq]], [[Theodor Nöldeke]], [[Leone Caetani]], [[Alphonse Mingana]], [[Arthur Jeffery]], [[David Samuel Margoliouth]], [[Abraham Geiger]], [[William St. Clair Tisdall]], [[Charles Cutler Torrey]] and [[Andrew Rippin]].

The book examines widely held beliefs about the historical origins and sources of the Islamic holy book. It challenges the notion that the [[Qur'an]] is error free, a view held by Muslims. Divided into four parts, the book presents an examination of the Qur'an. After an introduction in Part One, Part Two focuses on the difficulty of establishing a reliable Qur'anic text, while Part Three claims to detail the [[Jewish]], [[Christian]], and [[Zoroastrian]] sources of the Qur'an. Part Four attempts to disprove the historical reliability of the earliest Islamic sources.

== Reviews ==
[[Herbert Berg (scholar)|Herbert Berg]] in his review from the ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' summarized the essays lauding the inclusion of the essay by Theodor Nöldeke while panning the inclusion of William St. Clair Tisdall's as "not a particularly scholarly essay". He concluded "[i]t seems that Ibn Warraq has included some of the essays not on the basis of their scholarly value or their status as 'classics', but rather on the basis of their hostility to Islam.  This does not necessarily diminish the value of the collection, but the reader should be aware that this collection does not fully represent classic scholarship on the Quran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Berg | first = Herbert | authorlink = Herbert Berg (scholar) | year = 1999 | title = Ibn Warraq (ed): The Origins of the Koran: Classic Essays on Islam's Holy Book | journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 557–558 | format =  | doi = 10.1017/S0041977X00018693 | jstor=3107591}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

François de Blois criticized Ibn Warraq's work for including the essay by St. Clair Tisdall describing it as a "shoddy piece of missionary propaganda" and the "worst" among the essays of the book. De Blois also indicated that there are "quite a few mistakes in the spelling of both of Arabic and of European languages" and added that "the fact that the piece of [[Islamic calligraphy|Qur'anic calligraphy]] reproduced on the front cover has been printed up-side down is not, presumably, an intentional insult to the editor's former co-religionists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = De Blois| first = François | year = 2000| title = Reviewed work(s): The Origins of the "Koran".

[[Christopher Melchert]], a professor at the University of Oxford, said that the collection offered "a fair impression of European Qur’an studies in the first half of the twentieth century" but also believes that the sources that Warraq cites are better to be read first-hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc//Bulletin/35-1/35-1RelPhilLaw.htm 35-1RelPhilLaw&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611202723/http://fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/ |date=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd Lawson said regarding the book that "arrogance and amateurish assumptions abound; and all is sounded in the key of gormless hysteria...It must be said that it undoubtedly demonstrates the editor's diligence and industry in finding churlish things to say about the Qur'an in English. It is difficult to recommend this production, except perhaps for antiquarian interests and the archaeology of the study of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lawson | first = Todd | year = 2002 | title = The Origins of the Koran: Classic Essays on Islam's Holy Book | journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume = 122 | issue = 3 | pages = 658 | doi = 10.2307/3087567 | last2 = Warraq | first2 = Ibn | jstor = 3087567 | publisher = American Oriental Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9576">'''The Philosophers' Football Match''' is a [[Monty Python]] [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] depicting a [[football (soccer)|football]] match in the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Munich Olympics]] between [[philosophy|philosophers]] representing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Starring in the sketch are Archimedes ([[John Cleese]]), Socrates ([[Eric Idle]]), Hegel ([[Graham Chapman]]), Nietzsche ([[Michael Palin]]), Marx ([[Terry Jones]]), and Kant ([[Terry Gilliam]]). Palin also provides the match television commentary.

The footage opens with the banner headline "International Philosophy", and Palin providing the narrative. [[Confucius]] is the referee and keeps times with an [[hourglass]].  [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (sporting [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]es) serve as linesmen.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; The German [[Coach (sport)|manager]] is [[Martin Luther]]. As play begins, the philosophers break from their proper football positions only to walk around on the pitch as if deeply pondering, and in some cases declaiming their theories.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;Gener, Randy. (May 1, 2006) [[Theatre Communications Group|American Theatre]] ''The French Misconnection, or What Makes a Writer French.'' Volume 23; Issue 5; Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Beckenbauer]], the sole genuine footballer on the pitch and a "surprise inclusion" in the German team, is left more than a little confused.

The sketch was performed in the [[Grünwalder Stadion]].&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Roman. (2011) ''Kultstätte an der Grünwalder Straße. Die Geschichte eines Stadions'' Page 129, Publisher: Die Werkstatt. {{ISBN|978-3-89533-780-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originally featured in the second ''[[Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus]]'' episode broadcast on 18 December 1972 and was later included in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl|Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982)]].''&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Darl. (2003) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qVa1Hfh11V0C&amp;pg=PA45 Monty Python, Shakespeare and English Renaissance Drama.]'' Page 45, Publisher: McFarland &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-1504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek players, mostly with long gray beards and hair, play in [[toga]]s, while the Germans sport a variety of period dress including [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[frock coat]]s and [[breeches]]. "Nobby" Hegel carries a grey [[top hat]], while Beckenbauer wears the red and white of the 1972 [[FC Bayern Munich#Historical kits|Bayern Munich football strip]].

==Outcome==

Nietzsche receives a [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]] after claiming that Confucius has no [[free will]]. Confucius replies, "Name go in book".

In the second half, with nothing being accomplished on the field other than contemplation, [[Karl Marx]] is noticed warming up vigorously on the German sidelines. Marx soon races onto the field to substitute [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], his energy appearing as an obvious game-changer. Upon the referee's restart, Marx simply pulls up and starts meandering in deep thought like the rest.

With just over a minute of the match remaining Archimedes cries out "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!", takes the first kick of the ball and rushes towards the German goal. After several passes through a perplexed German defence, Socrates scores the only goal of the match in a diving header off a cross from Archimedes.

As the sketch closes, the Germans dispute the call, as the match commentator says: "Hegel is arguing that the [[reality]] is merely an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] of [[Ethical non-naturalism|non-naturalistic]] [[ethics]], Kant via the [[categorical imperative]] is holding that [[Ontology|ontologically]] it exists only in the imagination, and Marx is claiming it was [[Offside (association football)|offside]]." The replay proves that, according to the [[Offside (association football)|offside rule]], Socrates was indeed offside, but the sketch, nevertheless, states that the Greeks have won.

The names of the Greek philosophers in the line-up are displayed in German in the sketch. Despite the sketch, Wittgenstein was in fact Austrian and not German. Supporting the main referee Confucius as linesmen were [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] and [[Thomas Aquinas|St Thomas Aquinas]] who were Roman African and Italian respectively.

==Philosophers Football Match 2010==

Inspired by the famous Monty Python sketch, and with the full backing of the surviving Pythons, a tribute/replay of '''The Philosophers' Football Match''' was held in North London, at [[Wingate &amp; Finchley F.C.|Wingate &amp; Finchley’s]] Harry Abrahams Stadium, [[Finchley]] on 9 May 2010.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | title=Who's the thinker in the white?| work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/apr/28/monty-python-philosophers-football-match|date=28 April 2010|last=Baggini|first=Julian|authorlink=Julian Baggini | accessdate = 24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[tongue-in-cheek]] re-staging—on a real London pitch—of the original sketch, was the idea of The Philosophy Shop, a specialist provider of education and training for primary school children. The group works to enable [[Philosophy]] graduates at University level to conduct practical philosophy sessions for children aged 5 to 11 as part of a drive to boost their reasoning skills from their first days in the school environment.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Philosophers [[A. C. Grayling]] and former [[England national football team|England]] Manager [[Graham Taylor]] had been appointed as managers for the event, and players included comedians [[Mark Steel]], [[Tony Hawks]], [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]], and [[Ariane Sherine]], as well as philosophers [[Julian Baggini]], [[Nigel Warburton]], [[Simon Glendinning]], [[Stephen Law]], [[Angie Hobbs]], and [[Mark Vernon]], plus other academics from Universities nationwide. Match supporters included sociologist and [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Thinking Allowed]]'' presenter [[Laurie Taylor (sociologist)|Laurie Taylor]], the BBC’s [[John Humphrys]], and educationalist and author [[Anthony Seldon]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

'''Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey''' is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery]] and retreat centre located in [[Northumberland]], in northern [[England]]. It follows the Serene Reflection [[Meditation]] Tradition, similar to the [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] sect in [[Japan]]. It is part of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives.

Throssel Hole was established in 1972.  It offers retreats, festivals and other events for anyone who wishes to learn about or deepen their practice of meditation.

It has been reviewed by the national press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Mia|title=Left heartbroken by my ex, I moved to a monastery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/08/first-person-mia-hansson|website=The Guardian|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey, North East England, United Kingdom|url = http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/alternative/throssel-hole-buddhist-abbey/15250/|website = World Reviewer|accessdate = 2015-10-10|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 it featured in a BBC article on The History of Buddhism in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - Religions - Buddhism: History of Buddhism in Britain|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/history/britishbuddhism_1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], the '''translation''' of [[relic]]s is the removal of holy objects from one locality to another (usually a higher status location); usually only the movement of the remains of the saint's body would be treated so formally, with [[secondary relic]]s such as items of clothing treated with less ceremony. Translations could be accompanied by many acts, including all-night [[vigil]]s and processions, often involving entire communities.

The solemn translation (in [[Latin]], ''translatio'') of relics is not treated as the outward recognition of sanctity. Rather, miracles confirmed a saint's sanctity, as evinced by the fact that when, in the twelfth century, the Papacy attempted to make sanctification an 'official' process; many collections of miracles were written in the hope of providing proof of the saint-in-question's status. In the early Middle Ages, however, solemn translation marked the moment at which, the saint's miracles having been recognized, the relic was moved by a bishop or abbot to a prominent position within the church. Local veneration was then permitted. This process is known as ''local canonization''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Waldram Kemp, ''Canonization and Authority in the Western Church'', Oxford, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of a translation of a saint's relics was celebrated as a [[feast day]] in its own right. For example, on [[January 27 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 27]] is celebrated the translation of the relics of [[St. John Chrysostom]] from the [[Armenia]]n village of [[Comana, Cappadocia|Comana]] (where he died in exile in 407) to Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/saints/john_chrysostom_relics.htm The Translation of the Relics of St. John Chrysostom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most commonly celebrated feast days, however, are the 'dies natales' (the day on which the saint died, not the modern idea of birthday).

Relics sometimes travelled very far. The relics of [[Saint Thyrsus]] at [[Sozopolis, Pisidia]], in [[Asia Minor]], were brought to [[Constantinople]] and then to [[Spain]]. His cult became popular in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], where he is known as San Tirso or Santo Tirso.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/tirso.html Christian Iconography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909070632/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/tirso.html |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his relics were brought to [[France]]: Thyrsus is thus the titular saint of the [[Sisteron Cathedral|cathedral of Sisteron]] in the [[Basses Alpes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0128.shtml#thyr&lt;/ref&gt; the Cathédrale Notre Dame et Saint Thyrse. Thyrsus is thus the [[patron saint]] of Sisteron.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sisteron-tourisme.fr/visiterlacathedraledesisteron.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liborius of Le Mans]] became patron saint of [[Paderborn]], in Germany, after his relics were transferred there in 836.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0723.shtml#libo Saints of July 23&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Petershausen Translatio Gregorii.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Translation of the relics of [[St. Gregory]] to the monastery of [[Petershausen]].]]
In the early church, the disturbance, let alone the division, of the remains of martyrs and other saints, was not of concern or interest, much less practised. It was assumed that they would remain permanently in their often unidentified resting places in cemeteries and the [[catacombs of Rome]] (but always outside the walls of the city, continuing a pagan taboo). Then, [[martyrium (architecture)|martyrium]]s began to be built over the site of the burial of saints. It came to be considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to saintly remains, and as such, several large "funerary halls" were built over the sites of martyr's graves, the primary example being the [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]. 

The earliest recorded removal of saintly remains was that of [[Saint Babylas]] at [[Antioch]] in 354. However, partly perhaps because Constantinople lacked the many saintly graves of Rome, translations soon became common in the Eastern Empire, even though it was still prohibited in the West. The Eastern capital was able to acquire the remains of Saints [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] and [[Saint Luke|Luke]]{{how|date=February 2017}}. The division of bodies also began; the 5th century theologian [[Theodoretus]] declaring that "Grace remains entire with every part". An altar slab dated 357, found in North Africa but now in the [[Louvre]], records the deposit beneath it of relics from several prominent saints.  

Non-anatomical relics, above all that of the [[True Cross]], were divided and widely distributed from the 4th century. In the West a decree of [[Theodosius I]] only allowed the moving of a whole [[sarcophagus]] with its contents, but the upheavals of the barbarian invasions relaxed the rules, as remains needed to be relocated to safer places.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; p. 73; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962;Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) on the Louvre slab and True Cross.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

In the 4th century, [[Basil the Great]] requested of the ruler of [[Scythia Minor]], Junius Soranus (Saran), that he should send him the [[relics]] of saints of that region. Saran sent the relics of [[Sabbas the Goth]] to him in [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]], [[Cappadocia]], in 373 or 374 accompanied by a letter, the 'Epistle of the Church of God in Gothia to the Church of God located in Cappadocia and to all the Local Churches of the Holy Universal Church'.{{fact|date=July 2014}} The sending of Sabbas' relics and the writing of the actual letter has been attributed to [[Bretannio]]. This letter is the oldest known writing to be composed on Romanian soil and was written in [[Greek language|Greek]].{{fact|date=July 2014}}

The spread of relics all over Europe from the 8th century onward is explained by the fact that after 787, all new Christian churches had to possess a relic before they could be properly [[consecration|consecrated]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;https://dhctranslations.com/history-of-translation/history-translation/&lt;/ref&gt; New churches, situated in areas newly converted to Christianity, needed relics and this encouraged the translation of relics to far-off places. Relics became collectible items, and owning them became a symbol of prestige for cities, kingdoms, and monarchs,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Relics were also desirable as they generated income from pilgrims traveling to venerate them.  According to one legend concerning [[Saint Paternian]], the inhabitants of [[Fano]] competed with those of [[Cervia]] for possession of his relics. Cervia would be left with a finger, while Fano would possess the rest of the saint's relics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comunecervia.it/turismo/scheda.asp?id=930000068 Riti e Credenze: San Paterniano 13 novembre - Cervia Turismo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213203/http://www.comunecervia.it/turismo/scheda.asp?id=930000068 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation of relics was a solemn and important event. In 1261, the [[relics]] of [[Lucian of Beauvais]] and his two companions were placed in a new [[reliquary]] by William of Grès (Guillaume de Grès), the [[bishop of Beauvais]]. The translation took place in the presence of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis IX]], the [[king of France]], and [[Theobald II of Navarre|Theobald II]], the [[king of Navarre]], as well as much of the French nobility.  The memory of this translation was formerly celebrated in the abbey of Beauvais as the ''fête des Corps Saints''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catho60.cef.fr/histoire/temoins/Saint_Lucien/st-lucien.htm St Lucien - 1er Evêque du Beauvaisis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204021635/http://catho60.cef.fr/histoire/temoins/Saint_Lucien/st-lucien.htm |date=2007-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1277, while work was being done at the church of St. John the Baptist (Johanniterkirche) in [[Cologne]], the body of [[Saint Cordula]], one of the companions of [[Saint Ursula]], was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Sighart, ''Albert the Great'' (R. Washbourne, 1876), 360.&lt;/ref&gt; Her relics were found to [[Odour of sanctity|be fragrant]] and on the forehead of the saint herself were written the words, “Cordula, Queen and Virgin.”  When [[Albert the Great]], who had been residing in Cologne in his old age, had listened to the account of the finding of the relics, &lt;blockquote&gt;... he wept, praised God from the depth of his soul, and requested the bystanders to sing the ''[[Te Deum]]''. Then vesting himself in his episcopal robes, he removed the relics from under the earth, and solemnly translated them into the church of the monks of St. John. After singing Mass, he deposited the holy body in a suitable place, which God has since made illustrious by many miracles.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Sighart, ''Albert the Great'' (R. Washbourne, 1876), 361-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:C0024-Macarius-Head-Reliquary.jpg|thumb|The Honorable Head of [[Macarius of Unzha|Venerable Macarius]] (in the golden reliquary held by Archbishop Georgy of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas) visits the city of [[Kstovo]] during its translation from [[Nizhny Novgorod]]'s [[Pechersky Ascension Monastery]] to [[Makaryev Monastery]]]]
Some relics were translated from place to place, buffeted by the tides of wars and conflicts. The relics of [[Saint Leocadia]] were moved from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to Oviedo during the reign of [[Abd ar-Rahman II]], and from Oviedo they were brought to [[Saint-Ghislain]] (in present-day [[Belgium]]). Her relics were venerated there by [[Philip the Handsome]] and [[Joanna of Castile]], who recovered for Toledo a [[tibia]] of the saint. [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]] attempted unsuccessfully to rescue the rest of her relics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.architoledo.org/SantaLeocadia/SantaLeocadia1 La diócesis de Toledo celebra el Año Jubilar de santa Leocadia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051353/http://www.architoledo.org/SantaLeocadia/SantaLeocadia1 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, a Spanish Jesuit, after many travels, brought the rest of the saint’s relics to [[Rome]] in 1586. From Rome they were brought to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] by sea, and then finally brought to Toledo from [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]]. [[Philip II of Spain]] presided over a solemn ceremony commemorating the final translation of her relics to Toledo, in April 1587.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Idesbald|Idesbald’s]] relics were moved from their resting-place at the abbey of Ten Duinen after the [[Geuzen]] (“Sea Beggars”) plundered the abbey in 1577; his relics were translated again to [[Bruges]] in 1796 to avoid having them destroyed by [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/49925 Beato Idesbaldo delle Dune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation of the relics continued into modern times.  On December 4, 1796, as a result of the [[French Revolution]], the [[relics]] of [[Saint Lutgardis]] were carried to [[Ittre]] from [[Awirs]].  Her relics remain in Ittre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91959 Santa Lutgarda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable translations==
[[Image:MHS przeniesienie relikwi Mikolaja XVII w p.jpg|thumb|17th-century [[icon]] of the Translation of the Relics of [[St. Nicholas of Myra]] (Historic Museum in [[Sanok]], [[Poland]]).]]

Among the most famous translations is that of [[Saint Benedict of Nursia|St Benedict of Nursia]], author of the "[[Rule of Saint Benedict|Regula S. Benedicti]]", from [[Monte Cassino|Cassino]] to [[Abbey of Fleury|Fleury]], which [[Adrevald of Fleury|Adrevald]] memorialized. In England, the lengthy travels of [[St Cuthbert]]'s remains to escape the [[Vikings]], and then his less respectful treatment after the [[English Reformation]], have been much studied, as [[St Cuthbert's coffin|his coffin]], [[Stonyhurst Gospel|gospel book]] and other items buried with him are now very rare representatives of [[Anglo-Saxon art]].{{fact|date=July 2014}}

Some well-known translations of relics include the removal of the body of [[Saint Nicholas]] from [[Myra]] in [[Asia Minor]] to [[Bari]], [[Italy]] in 1087. Tradesmen of Bari visited the relics of Saint Nicholas in 1087 after finding out their resting-place from the [[monk]]s who guarded them. According to one account, the monks showed the resting-place but then became immediately suspicious: "Why you men, do you make such a request? You haven't planned to carry off the remains of the holy saint from here? You don't intend to remove it to your own region?  If that is your purpose, then let it be clearly known to you that you parley with unyielding men, even if it mean our death."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nicholas-bari.html Medieval Sourcebook: The Translation of Saint Nicholas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tradesmen tried different tactics, including force, and manage to take hold of the relics. An anonymous chronicler writes about what happened when the inhabitants of Myra found out:

{{Quotation|Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the city learned of all that had happened from the monks who had been set free. Therefore they proceeded in a body, a multitude of men and women, to the wharves, all of them filled and heavy with affliction. And they wept for themselves and their children, that they had been left bereft of so great a blessing ... Then they added tears upon tears and wailing and unassuageable lamentation to their groans, saying: "Give us our patron and our champion, who with all consideration protected us from our enemies visible and invisible. And if we are entirely unworthy, do not leave us without a share, of at least some small portion of him."|Anonymous|Greek account of the transfer of the Body of Saint Nicholas, 13th century|&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;}}

Professor Nevzat Cevik, the Director of Archaeological Excavations in Demre (Myra), has recently recommended that the Turkish government should request the repatriation of St Nicholas' relics, alleging that it had always been the saint's intention to be buried in Myra.&lt;ref&gt;See http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8432314.stm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Venetians, who also claimed to have some parts of St Nicholas, had another story: The Venetians brought the remains back to Venice, but on the way they left an arm of St Nicholas at Bari (The Morosini Codex 49A).

[[File:Accademia - St Mark's Body Brought to Venice by Jacopo Tintoretto.jpg|thumb|[[Jacopo Tintoretto]]'s depiction of the secret translation of the relics of Saint Mark.]]

In 828, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchants acquired the supposed relics of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark the Evangelist]] from [[Alexandria]], Egypt. These are housed in [[St Mark's Basilica]]; in 1968, a small fragment of bone was donated to the Coptic Church in Alexandria.

==In recent times==

A famous and recent example is the return of the relics of [[St. John Chrysostom]] and [[St. Gregory of Nazianzus]] to the [[See of Constantinople]] ([[Greek Orthodox Church]]) by Pope [[John Paul II]] in 2007.{{fact|date=July 2014}} Another modern example is the exhumation, display, and reburial of the relics of [[Padre_Pio#Sainthood_and_later_recognition|St. Padre Pio]] in 2008-2009.{{fact|date=July 2014}}

[[File:Burley - De intensione et remissione formarum, 1496 - 163728.jpg |thumb|''De intensione et remissione formarum'', 1496]]
'''Walter Burley''' (or '''Burleigh''') (c. 1275–1344/5) was a [[medieval]] English [[scholastic philosopher]] and [[logician]] with at least 50 works attributed to him.  He studied under [[Thomas Wilton]]&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;Harjeet Singh Gill, ''Signification in language and culture'', Indian Institute of Advanced Study, 2002, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1301, and was a [[fellow]] of [[Merton College]], Oxford until about 1310.  He then spent sixteen years in Paris, becoming a fellow of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] by 1324, before spending 17 years as a clerical courtier in England and [[Avignon]].  Burley disagreed with [[William of Ockham]] on a number of points concerning logic and [[natural philosophy]].

==Early life==
Burley was born in 1274 or 1275, possibly in [[Burley-in-Wharfedale]], [[Yorkshire]], or in [[Burley, Leeds|Burley]] near [[Leeds]].{{r|ODNB}}  Little is known of his early life.  He was made rector of [[Welbury]] in Yorkshire in 1309, probably through the influence of Sir John de Lisle, a friend of [[William Greenfield]].{{sfnp|Ottman|Wood|1999|p=9}}  As throughout his career, he did not act as rector, employing a substitute and using the income from the living to finance his study in Paris, where he completed his lectures on Peter Lombard's ''[[Sentences]]'', and probably encountered the work of his contemporary [[William of Ockham]].  Burley's commentary on the ''Sentences'' has not survived.{{sfnp|Ottman|Wood|1999|p=10}}

==Political career==
Burley became a courtier during the political events that followed the deposition of [[Edward II]] of England in 1327. His first assignment was to try and obtain the [[canonisation]] of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], who had been one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Edward II; Thomas had become venerated as a [[martyr]] within a few months of his death. Burley was sent to the [[Avignon Papacy|papal court at Avignon]] to appeal directly to [[Pope John XXII]].  By coincidence, William of Ockham was also staying at Avignon, having been summoned there in 1324 to answer charges of possibly heretical statements (by 1326 there was a list of 51 charges against him).

Burley's associates were all closely involved in these attempts at canonisation (none of which was successful).  One was [[Richard de Bury]], a bibliophile and patron of the arts and sciences, who became Burley's patron and at whose request Bury translated some works of [[Aristotle]] into English.{{r|Denholm}}

==Ecclesiastical career==
Burley had become a master of theology by 1324. In May 1327 he became canon of Chichester by the provision of the pope, but exchanged the position in 1332 to become canon at [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]], where de Bury was [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]].  Bury had been involved in the coup d'état of 1330 that resulted in the execution of Mortimer, and the de facto accession of Edward III to the throne. In 1333 de Bury was consecrated [[Bishop of Durham]] by the king, over-ruling the choice of the monks, who had elected and actually installed their sub-prior, [[Robert de Graynes]].&lt;ref name=Handbook242&gt;Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1334 de Bury was made Lord Treasurer, an appointment he exchanged later in the year for that of Lord Chancellor.  He gathered together a group of intellectuals including [[Thomas Fitzralph]], [[Richard Kilvington|Richard de Kilvington]], [[Robert Holcot]]t, [[Thomas Bradwardine]] and Burley himself.

Walter may have been a relative of his younger contemporary [[Adam Burley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=53177|title=Burley, Adam (d. 1327/8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Burley was one of the first logicians to recognise the priority of the [[propositional logic|propositional calculus]] over the [[first-order logic|predicate calculus]], despite the fact that the latter had been the main focus of logicians until then.  Burley also seems to have been the only 14th-century logician to have taken the position that, in line with modern views on the [[material conditional]], the principle that "from the impossible anything follows" ("''ex impossibili sequitur quidlibet''") is both a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for explaining the logical relationship between [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]].{{sfnp|Jacobi|1993|p=162}}
He was also known for his commentaries on Aristotle's [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']], which include the quodlibet ''De Primo et ultimo instanti'' (around 1320) and the longer work ''Expositio in libros octo de physico auditu''.{{r|Sylla}}
Burley wrote 39 Commentaries on Aristotle and 32 Treatises and Questions (many unedited) &lt;ref&gt;Marta Vittorini, ''Appendix: A Complete List of Burley's Works'', in A. D. Conti (ed.), ''A Companion to Walter Burley'', Leiden: Brill, 2013, pp.46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''De Puritate Artis Logicae'', in two versions:
** ''Tractatus brevior'' (before 1324)
** ''Tractatus longior'' (1325–28)
This is Burley's main work, in which he covers such topics as the truth conditions for complex sentences, both [[truth-functional]] and [[Modal logic|modal]], as well as providing rules of inferences for different types of inferences.  This book is known to have been written after Ockham's ''[[Summa Logicae]]'' (c. 1323), possibly partly in response to it.{{sfnp|Böhner|1952|p=44}}
