An '''advertising campaign''' is a series of [[advertisement]] messages that share a single idea and theme which make up an [[marketing strategy|integrated marketing]] [[marketing communications|communication]] (IMC). An IMC is a platform in which a group of people can group their ideas, beliefs, and concepts into one large media base. Advertising campaigns utilize diverse media channels over a particular time frame and target identified audiences.  

The campaign theme is the central message that will be received in the promotional activities and is the prime focus of advertising campaign, as it sets the motif for the series of individual advertisements and other marketing communications that will be used. The campaign themes are usually produced with the objective of being used for a significant period but many of them are temporal due to factors like being not effective or market conditions, competition and [[marketing mix]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and Promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last1=Belch|first1=George|last2=Belch|first2=Michael,|first=|publisher=MacGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2004|isbn=0078028973|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising campaigns are built to accomplish a particular objective or a set of objectives. Such objectives usually include establishing a brand, raising brand awareness, aggrandizing the rate of conversions/sales. The rate of success or failure in accomplishing these goals is reckoned via effectiveness measures.  There are 5 key points at which an advertising campaign must consider to ensure an effective campaign. These points are, integrated marketing communications, media channels, positioning, the communications process diagram and [[touch point]]s.

== Integrated marketing Communication: (IMC) ==

Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is a conceptual approach used by the majority of organizations to develop a strategic plan on how they are going to broadcast their marketing and advertising campaigns. Recently there has been a shift in the way marketers and advertisers interact with their consumers and now see it as a conversation between Advertising/ Marketing teams and consumers. IMC has emerged as a key strategy for organizations to manage customer experiences in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;"Integrated Marketing Communications - Medill - Northwestern University". ''www.medill.northwestern.edu''. Retrieved 24/ 3/16&lt;/ref&gt; The more traditional advertising practices such as newspapers, billboards, and magazines are still used but fail to have the same effect now as they did in previous years.

The importance of the IMC is to make the marketing process seamless for both the brand and the consumer. IMC attempts to meld all aspects of marketing into one cohesive piece. This includes sales promotion, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, and social media. The entire point of IMC is to have all of these aspects of marketing work together as a unified force. This can be done through methods, channels, and activities all while using a media platform. The end goal of IMC is to get the brands message across to consumers in the most convenient way possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thedma.org/membership/member-groups-communities/integrated-marketing-community/integrated-marketing-definitions/|title=Integrated Marketing Definitions - Definition of Integrated Marketing {{!}} thedma.org|work=thedma.org|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of using IMC are that it has the ability to communicate the same message through several channels to create brand awareness. IMC is the most cost-effective solution when compared to mass media advertising to interact with target consumers on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://igotit.com/en/page/about.html|title=Buying, selling, trading and connecting with local businesses|last=Shultz|first=Orion|date=1 July 2008|website=igotit.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMC also benefits small businesses, as they are able to submerge their consumers with communication of various kinds in a way that pushes them through the research and buying stages creating a relationship and dialogue with their new customer. Popular and obvious examples of IMC put into action are the likes of direct marketing to the consumer that the organisation already has a knowledge that the person is interested in the brand by gathering personal information about them from when they previously shopped there and then sending mail, emails, texts and other direct communication with the person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In-store sales promotions are tactics such as ‘30% off’ sales or offering loyalty cards to consumers to build a relationship. Television and radio advertisement are also a form of advertising strategy derived from IMC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of the components of IMC play an important role and a company may or may not choose to  implement any of the integration strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Don E.|last2=Schultz|first2=Heidi F.|date=1998-01-01|title=Transitioning marketing communication into the twenty-first century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135272698345852|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/135272698345852|issn=1352-7266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Channels ==

Media channels, also known as, marketing communications channels, are used to create a connection with the target consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcl.stanford.edu/campaigns/|title=PCL: Political Campaigns|website=pcl.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional methods of communication with the consumer include newspapers, magazines, Radio, television, billboards, telephone, post and door to door sales. These are just a few of the historically traditional methods.

Along with traditional media channels, comes new and upcoming media channels. Social media has begun to play a very large role in the way media and marketing intermingle to reach a consumer base. Social media has the power to reach a wider audience. Depending on the age group and demographic, social media can influence a company's overall image. Using social media as a marketing tool has become a widely popular method for branding. A brand has the chance to create an entire social media presence based around their own specific targeted community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.contentfac.com/9-reasons-social-media-marketing-should-top-your-to-do-list/|title=Why Social Media Marketing Is Important For Any Business|website=www.contentfac.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With advancements in digital communications channels, marketing communications allow for the possibility of two-way communications where an immediate consumer response can be elicited. Digital communications tools include: websites, blogs, social media, email, mobile, and search engines as a few examples. It is important for an advertising campaign to carefully select channels based on where their target consumer spends time to ensure market and advertising efforts are maximized.

== Modern day implications to the advantages &amp; disadvantages of traditional media channels ==
In the rapidly changing marketing and advertising environment, exposure to certain consumer groups and target audiences through traditional media channels has blurred. These traditional media channels are defined as print, broadcast, out-of-home and direct mail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising: Strategy, Creativity and Media|last=Fill|first=Chris|last2=Hughes|first2=Graham|last3=De Francesco|first3=Scott|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=0273760890|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of various new modern-day media channels has altered their traditional advantages and disadvantages. It is imperative to the effectiveness of the Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) strategy that exposure to certain demographics, consumer groups and target audiences is anticipated to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communications impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Marketing Communication: Maybe Definition Is in the Point of View|last=Schultz|first=D. E|publisher=Marketing News|year=1993|isbn=0324593600|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Print media is mainly defined as newspapers and magazines. With the transition in last decade [2006 – 2016] to digital information on phones, computers and tablets, the demographic that still are exposed to traditional print media is going to be older. It is also estimated that there will be a reduction of print material in coming years. This has to be taken into account by the advertisers and in some cases, they could use this to their advantage. Newspapers advantages would be that it is low cost, timely, reader controls exposure and has moderate coverage to the older generations in western society. Disadvantages would obviously be the aging demographic, short life, clutter and low attention-getting capabilities. Magazines are similar in some cases but have defined differences as they are a niche product increasing segmentation potential; they also have high informational content and longevity. Disadvantages are they are visual only, lack of flexibility and a long lead time for advertisement placement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditional broadcast media’s primary platforms are television and radio. These are still relatively prominent in modern-day society, but with the emergence of online content such as YouTube, Instagram and Vine it would difficult to anticipate where the market is headed in the next decade. Televisions advantages are that it has mass coverage, high reach, quality reputation, low post per exposure and impacts human senses. Disadvantages would be that it has low selectivity, short message life and high production costs. Alternatively, radio offers flexibility, high frequency and low advertising &amp; production costs. Disadvantages to radio are that its audio only, low attention-getting and short message.

Out-of-home (OOH) media a broad marketing concept that is no longer relegated to large, static billboards on the side of motorways. More current and innovative approaches to OOH media range from street furniture to aerial blimps. Due to the constant and contemporary nature of the outdoors there will always be new ways in which a campaign can revitalize this media channel. Advantages would be the accessibility and reach, geographic flexibility and relatively low cost. Disadvantages to OOH media are that it has a short life, difficult to measure / control and it can convey poor brand image.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Direct mail is classified as messages sent directly to consumers through the mail delivery service. One of the more ‘dated’ media channels and in the modern day has very little advantages, other than it is highly selective and has high information content. Disadvantages are that it promotes a poor brand image – junk mail and that it has a high cost to contact ratio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Target Market ==
{{Manual|date=March 2017}}
When an organisation begins to construct their advertising campaign they need to research each and every aspect of their target market and target consumer. The target consumer is the person or group of people who is most likely to buy from an organisation, he is also called 'potential customer'. A target consumer can be categorized by several key characteristics; Gender, age, occupation, marital status, geographical location, behavioral,&lt;ref&gt;CBS(2014). ''Blue Jeans: The fabric of freedom.'' Retrieved December 8, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;Https://www.youtube.com/watch?V=UzOGdtV-_4w&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; level of income and education to name the main factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/target-market|title=Target Market|last=Staff|first=Entrepreneur|website=Entrepreneur|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called segmenting customers on the basis of demographics.

Gender is simply whether a person is male or female. Age is usually broken up into bracketed intervals of ten or so years, for example, a person's age between 15–25 years old. By understanding which age bracket the target market falls into the advertisers can position their efforts accordingly. Occupation is also known as a profession and refers to what a person does for a living; this could be a particular job, student, unemployed etc. A person’s marital status defines whether they are married or unmarried. Geographical location is a broad term specifying a particular area or place within a given country, state/ city, suburb or street as some examples. Income refers to how much money a person is earning annually which can help identify how much money they have left over after expenses to potential spend on a brand. The final factor to explain is education, whether a person went to school or not, what school they attended, what standard of education they have, diplomas, certificates, graduate, degrees, masters, Ph.D. or other forms of defining educational factors. Knowing this information can help an advertiser understand their target markets level of thinking to help adapt the advertising campaign to be understood by the given target consumer/s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

For a business to successfully find the appropriate Target Market for their products or services, it is important that they segment the market to better decide which customers to target. This is best done when the market is segmented into the four following areas: geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Geographic segmentation involves the market being divided into different nations, regions, states, counties, cities, or neighbourhoods. Segmenting the Target market geographically is effective as different areas have different needs, which can be affected by weather, fashion, etc.

Demographic segmentation separates the market into groups according to age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, religion, nationality, and race. It is important to note that this is the easiest and least expensive way to segment the market, as the research has already been done.

Psychographic segmentation is the process of markets being divided into groups based on social class, personality characteristics, and values.

Behavioural segmentation “divides a market into groups based on consumer knowledge, attitude, use, or response to a product” (Krause, T. 2007). This is believed to be the best starting point, when a business is building a market segment. The behavioural segment is important because it focuses on why consumers consume products. For example, during Father’s day and Mother’s day, flowers were promoted due to the heavy demand of flowers during these holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Target_Marketing.aspx|title=Target Marketing Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Target Marketing|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining the target market helps businesses and individuals design a marketing campaign. This in turns helps businesses/ individuals avoid waste and get their advertisements to likely customers. While attempting to find the correct target market it is important to focus on specific groups of individuals that will benefit from your product. By marketing to specific groups of individuals that specifically relate to the product, businesses and individuals will more quickly and efficiently find those who will purchase the product. Businesses and individuals that monitor their existing data (customer and sales data) will find it easier to define their target market, and surveying existing customers will assist in finding more customers.  Avoiding inefficiencies when finding a target market is equally as important. Wasting time and money advertising to a large group of potential customers is inefficient if only a handful become customers. A focused plan that reaches a tiny audience can work out well if they’re already interested in what you’re selling. Over time target markets can change. People interested today might not be interested tomorrow, and those not interested in the present time, might become interested over time. Analysing sales data and customer information helps businesses and individuals understand when their target market is increasing or decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-defining-target-market-69728.html|title=The Importance of Defining a Target Market|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many advantages that are associated with finding your Target Market. One advantage is the “ability to offer the right product” (Suttle. R. 2016) through knowing the age and needs of the customer willing to purchase the item. Another advantage of Target Marketing assists businesses in understanding what price the customer will pay for the products or service. Businesses are also more efficient and effective at advertising their product, because they “reach the right consumers with messages that are more applicable” (Suttle. R. 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/broad-targeting-advantages-marketing-25610.html|title=The Broad Targeting Advantages in Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are several disadvantages that can be associated with Target Marketing. Firstly, finding your Target Market is expensive. Often businesses conduct primary research to find whom their Target Market is, which usually involves hiring a research agency, which can cost “tens of thousands of dollars” (Suttle, R. 2016). Finding ones Target Market is also time-consuming, as it often “requires a considerable amount of time to identify a target audience” (Suttle, R. 2016). Also focusing on finding your Target Market can make you overlook other customers that are interested in your product. Businesses/ Individuals may find that their ‘average customer’ might not include those that fall just outside of the average customers “demographics” (Suttle, R. 2016), which will limit the sale of their products. The last disadvantage to note is the ethical ramifications that are associated with Target Marketing. An example of this would be a “beer company that may target less educated, poorer people with larger-sized bottles” (Suttle, R. 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-target-marketing-36131.html|title=The Disadvantages of Target Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positioning ==
{{Confusing section|small=no|date=March 2017}}
In advertising various brands compete to overtake the perceptual mapping in a consumers mind. Everyday consumers view advertising and rank particular brands compared to their competitors. Individuals rank these specific brands in an order of what is most important to them. For example, a person may compare brands of cars based on how sporty they think they look, affordability, practicality and classiness. How one person perceives a brand is different to another but is largely left to the advertising campaign to manipulate and create the perception that they want you to envision as the consumer. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Positioning is an important marketing concept that businesses implement to market their products or services. The positioning concept focuses on creating an image that will best attract the intended audience.  Businesses that implement the positioning concept focus on promotion, price, placement and product. When the positioning concept is effective and productive it elevates the marketing efforts made by a business, and assists the buyer in purchasing the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/positioning-marketing-plan-22983.html|title=What Is Positioning in a Marketing Plan?|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positioning process is imperative in marketing because of the specific level of consumer-based recognition is involved. A company must create a trademark brand for themselves in order to be recognizable by a broad range of consumers. For example, a fast food restaurant positions itself as fast, cheap, and delicious. They are playing upon their strengths and most visible characteristics. On the other hand a luxury car brand will position its brand as a stylish and expensive platform because they want to target a specific brand very different than the fast food brand. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://strategiccfo.com/market-positioning/|title=Market Positioning • The Strategic CFO|date=2013-07-24|work=The Strategic CFO|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the positioning concept to be effective one must focus on the concepts of promotion, price, place and product.

There are three basic objectives of promotion, which include: presenting product information to targeted business customers and consumers, increase demand among the target market, and differentiating a product and creating a brand identity. Tools that can be used to achieve these objectives are advertising, public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, and sales promotion.

Price of an object is crucial in the concept of positioning. Adjusting or decreasing the product price has a profound impact on the sales of the product, and should complement the other parts of the positioning concept. The price needs to ensure survival, increase profit, generate survival, gain market shares, and establish an appropriate image.

Positioning a product is essential in the positioning concept. It is the process marketers use to communicate their products’ attributes to the intended target market. In order for products to be successful businesses must focus on the customer needs, competitive pressures, available communication channels and carefully crafted key messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-product-positioning-marketing-plan-24275.html|title=The Importance of Product Positioning to the Marketing Plan|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product Positioning presents several advantages in the advertising campaign, and to the businesses/ individuals that implement it. Positioning connects with superior aspects of a product and matches “them with consumers more effectively than competitors” (Jaideep, S. 2016). Positioning can also help businesses or individuals realise the consumer’s expectations of the product/s they are willing to purchase from them. Positioning a product reinforces the companies name, product and brand. It also makes the brand popular and strengthens customer loyalty. Product benefits to customers are better advertised through positioning the product, which results in more interest and attention of consumers. This also attracts different types of consumers as products posse’s different benefits that attract different groups of consumers, for example: a shoe that is advertised for playing sports, going for walks, hiking and casual wear will attract different groups of consumers. Another advantage of positioning is the competitive strength it gives to businesses/ individuals and their products, introducing new products successfully to the market and communicating new and varied features that are added to a product later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/product/top-10-benefits-of-product-positioning/48605/|title=Top 10 Benefits of Product Positioning|website=YourArticleLibrary.com: The Next Generation Library|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication Process Diagram ==

The Communication of processes diagram refers to the order of operation an advertising campaign pieces together the flow of communication between a given organisation and the consumer. The diagram usually flows left to right (unless shown in a circular array) starting with the source. An advertising campaign uses the communication process diagram to ensure all the appropriate steps of communication are being taken in order.

The &lt;u&gt;source&lt;/u&gt; is the person or organisation that has a message they want to share with potential consumers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Belch,G., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2012) ''Advertisng and promotion: AN integrated marketing communication perspective'' (9th ed.) New York, NY: McGraw- Hill Irwin page 147- 158&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is Vodafone wanting to tell their consumers and new consumers of a new monthly plan.

The diagram then moves on to &lt;u&gt;encoding&lt;/u&gt; which consists of the organisation putting messages, thoughts and ideas into a symbolic form that be interpreted by the target consumer using symbols or words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The third stage in the diagram is &lt;u&gt;channel message&lt;/u&gt;. This occurs when the information or meaning the source wants to convoy, is put into a form to easily be transmitted to the targeted audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This also includes the method that communication gets from the source to the receiver. Examples of this is Vodafone advertising on TV, bus stops and university campuses as students may be the intended consumer for the new plan.

&lt;u&gt;Decoding&lt;/u&gt; is the processes that the viewer interprets the message that the source sent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Obviously it is up to the source to ensure that the message encoded well enough so that it is received as intended.

The &lt;u&gt;receiver&lt;/u&gt; is also known as the viewer or potential consumer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is the person who interprets the source message through channeling whether they are the intended target audience or not. Every day we interpret different advertisements even if we are not the target audience for that advertisement.

In between these steps there are external factors acting as distractions, these factors are called &lt;u&gt;noise&lt;/u&gt;. Noise distorts the way the message gets to the intended target audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These distractions are from all other forms of advertising and communication from every other person or organisation. Examples of noise are State of mind, unfamiliar language, unclear message, Values, Attitudes, Perceptions, Culture and Knowledge of similar products or services to name a few forms of noise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Finally there is the &lt;u&gt;response or feedback&lt;/u&gt;. This is the &lt;u&gt;receiver’s&lt;/u&gt; reaction to the communication of message&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the way they understood it. &lt;u&gt;Feedback&lt;/u&gt; relates to the way sales react as well as the interest or questions that arise in relation to the message put out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Touch Points ==

[[File:Customer journey with touchpoints English.png|thumb|Customer journey with touchpoints English]]
When considering touch points in an advertising campaign a brand looks Multisensory touch points. These touch points help the brand to develop a point of contact between themselves and the consumer. Modern day advancements in various forms of technology have made it easier for consumers to engage with brands in numerous ways. The most successful touch points are those that create value in the consumer and brands relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, J. (n.d.). ''Brand TouchPoint'' ''Matrix''. Retrieved March 19, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://brandtouchpointmatrix.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of touch points include social media links, QR codes, person handing out flyers about a particular brand, billboards, web sites and various other methods that connect the brand and consumer.

Multi sensory touch points are subconscious yet helps use to recognise brands through characteristic identified through human sensors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Heath, R., Brandt, D., &amp; Nairn, A. (2006). Brand relationships: Strengtheng. by emotion, weakened by attention. ''Journal of Advertising Research, 46''(4), 410-419.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics could be shape, colour, textures, sounds, smell or tastes associated with a given brand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is important for an advertising campaign to consider sensory cues into their campaign as market places continue to become increasingly competitive and crowded. Anyone of the given sensory characteristics may remind a person of the brand they best associate with. A prime example of this is Red Bull who use the colour, shapes and size of their cans to best relate their product to success and winning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A taller can looks like the 1st place podium when placed next to competitors, the design looks like the finish flag in racing representing winning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The opportunity for an advertising campaign to succeed is significantly increased with the use of multi sensory touch points used as a point of difference between brands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Guerrilla marketing==

Guerrilla marketing is an advertising strategy which increases brand exposure through the use of unconventional campaigns which initiate social discussion and "buzz". This can often be achieved with lower budgets than conventional advertising methods, allowing small and medium-sized businesses the chance to compete against larger competitors. Through unconventional methods, inventiveness and creativity, guerrilla marketing leaves the receiver with a long lasting impression of the brand as most guerrilla marketing campaigns target the receivers at a personal level, taking them by surprise and may incorporate an element of shock. Guerrilla marketing is typically executed exclusively in public places, including streets, parks, shopping centres etc., to ensure maximum audience resulting in further discussion on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, K., &amp; Hoffmann, S. (2011). Guerrilla marketing: The nature of the concept and propositions for further research. Asian Journal of Marketing, 5(2), 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla marketing is the term used for several types of marketing categories including street marketing, ambient marketing, presence marketing, alternative marketing, experimental marketing, grassroots marketing, wild posting, guerrilla projection advertising, undercover marketing and [[astroturfing]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Jay Conrad Levinson coined the term ''Guerrilla Marketing'' with his 1984 book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Paksoy, T &amp; Chang, C. (2010). Applied Mathematical Modelling. Revised multi-choice goal programming for multi-period, multi-stage inventory controlled supply chain model with popup stores in Guerrilla marketing, 34(34), 3586-3587&lt;/ref&gt; Through the enhancement of technology and common use of internet and mobile phones, marketing communication has become more affordable and guerrilla marketing is on the rise, allowing the spread of newsworthy guerrilla campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kolegjifama.eu/materialet/Biblioteka%20Elektronike/Chaotics%20The%20Business%20of%20Managing%20and%20Marketing%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Turbulence.pdf|title=Chaotics - The Business of Managing and Marketing in the Age of Turbulance.|author1=Kotler, P  |author2=Caslione, J|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When establishing a guerrilla marketing strategy, there are seven elements to a clear and logical approach.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"&gt;Levinson, J. (1989). Guerrilla Marketing Attack – New Stratigies, Tactics and Weapson for Winning Big Profits for your Small Business). Boston, United States of America: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, write a statement that identifies the purpose of the strategy. Secondly define how the purpose will be achieved concentrating on the key advantages. Next Levinson (1989) suggests writing a descriptive summary on the target market or consumers. The fourth element is to establish a statement that itemizes the marketing tools and methods planning to be used in the strategy (for example, radio advertising during 6.30am – 9am on weekday mornings or window displays that are regularly updated). The fifth step is to create a statement which positions the brand/product/company in the market. Define the brands characteristics and give it an identity is the sixth element. Lastly, clearly identify a budget which will be put solely towards marketing going forward.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"/&gt;

For a successful overall guerrilla marketing campaign, combine the above steps with seven winning actions.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Marketing Attack – New Stratigies, Tactics and Weapons for Winning Big Profits for your Small Business). Boston, United States of America: Houghton Mifflin Company.  p39&lt;/ref&gt; These seven principles are commitment – stick to the marketing plan without changing it; investment – appreciate that marketing is an investment, consistency – ensure the marketing message and strategy remains consistent across all forms of, confidence – show confidence in the commitment to the guerrilla marketing strategy, patience – time and dedication to the strategy, assortment – incorporate different methods of advertising and marketing for optimum results, and subsequent – build customer loyalty and retention though follow up marketing post-sale.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"/&gt;

Levinson suggests guerrilla marketing tactics were initiated to enable small businesses with limited financial resources to gain an upper hand on the corporate giants who had unlimited budgets and resources at their disposal. Large companies cottoned on to the success of guerrilla marketing and have had hundreds of effective attention grabbing campaigns using the strategies originally designed for smaller businesses with minimal marketing budgets.&lt;ref&gt;McNaughton, M. (2008). Guerrilla communication, visual consumption, and consumer public relations. Public Relations Review, 34(1), 303-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-traditional, unconventional and shocking campaigns are highly successful in obtaining media coverage and therefore brand awareness, albeit good or bad media attention. However, like most marketing strategies a bad campaign can backfire and damage profits and sales.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 2010"&gt;Levinson, J. &amp; Gibson, S. (2010). Guerrilla Social Media Marketing: 100+ Weapons to Grow Your Online Influence, Attract Customers, and Drive Profits. California, United States of America: Entrepreneur Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Undercover marketing and astroturfing are two type of guerrilla marketing that are deemed as risky and can be detrimental to the company.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 2010"/&gt;

“Advertising can be dated back to 4000 BC where Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Traditional advertising and marketing slowly developed over the centuries but never bloomed until early 1900s” ("What Is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2010). Guerrilla marketing are relatively simple, use tactics to advertise on a very small budget. It is to make a campaign that is “shocking, funny, unique, outrageous, clever and creative that people can’t stop talking about it” (Uk essays, 2016). Guerrilla marketing is different when compared to traditional marketing tactics (Staff, 2016).  “Guerrilla marketing means going after conventional goals of profits, sales and growth but doing it by using unconventional means, such as expanding offerings during gloomy economic days to inspire customers to increase the size of each purchase” (Staff, 2016).  Guerrilla marketing also suggests that rather than investing money, it is better to “invest time, energy, imagination and knowledge” (Staff, 2016) instead. Guerrilla marketing puts profit as their main priority not sales as their main focal point, this is done to urge the growth of geometrically by enlarging the size of each transactions. This all done through one of the most powerful marketing weapons around, the telephone. Research shows that it will always increases profits and sales. The term “guerrilla first appeared during the war of independence in Spain and Portugal at the beginning of the 19th century it can be translated as battle” (Uk essays, 2016).  Even thou guerrilla marketing was aimed for small business; this did not stop bigger business from adopting the same ideology. “Larger business has been using unconventional marketing to complement their advertising campaigns, even then some marketers argue that when bigger business utilize guerrilla marketing tactics, it isn’t true guerrilla” ("What Is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2010).  The reason being that larger companies have bigger budgets and usually their brands well established.  In some cases, it is far riskier for a larger business to do guerrilla marketing tactics. Which can cause problem when their stunts become a flop when compared to smaller business, as they do not run as much risk, as most people will just write it off as another failed stunt.  Many methods in guerrilla marketing consist of “graffiti (or reverse graffiti, where a dirty wall is selectively cleaned), interactive displays, intercept encounters in public spaces, flash mobs, or various PR stunts are often used” ("Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?” 2016).

Small business use social media as a form of marketing. This Is due to that social media in the 21st century is phenomenon. “Collecting billions of people around the world through a series of status updates, tweets, and other rich media” ("Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses", 2013). Social media is a powerful tool in the world of business. Guerrilla marketing strategies and tactics are a great and cost effective way to generate” awareness for your business, products and services. To maximize full potential in your marketing efforts, it’s to blend them with a powerful and robust online marking strategy with a marketing automation software” ("Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses", 2013). Which can boost small businesses. Guerrilla tactics consist of instruments that have effects on the efforts. Some instruments are usually there to maximize the surprise effect and some of these instruments mainly cutting advertising costs.” Guerrilla marketing is a way of increasing the number of individuals exposed to the advertising with the cost of campaign. The instrument of diffusion helps to each a wide audience, which causes none or little cost because consumers (viral marketing) or the media (guerrilla PR) pass on the advertising message” ("Guerrilla Marketing: The Nature of the Concept and Propositions for Further Research", 2016).  Guerrilla campaigns usually implement a free ride approach, this means that to cut their costs and increase the number of recipients simultaneously to maximize the low cost effect. For example, they will try to benefit from placing advertisements on big events e.g. sporting events. Guerrilla marketing was regarded to target existing customers rather than new ones, aiming to increase their engagement with a product and/ or brand. “When selecting audiences for a guerrilla message, a group that is already engaged with the product at some level is the best target; they will be quicker to recognize and respond to creative tactics, and more likely to share the experience with their friends, as social media has become a major feature of the market landscape, guerrilla marketing has shown to be particularly effective online. Consumers who regularly use social media are more likely to share their interactions with guerrilla marketing, and creative advertising can quickly go viral” ("Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?.

'''Śrĩ Atmananda''' (December 8, 1883 – May 14, 1959), also referred as '''Sri Atmananda Krishna Menon''', was an Indian [[Wise Old Man|sage]], [[guru]], and philosopher. He has been described by scholars as a "neo-Hindu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucas|first1=Phillip|title=New Religious Movements in the Twenty-first Century|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His teachings have become a foundation for a spiritual method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Be As You are|last=Godman|first=David|publisher=Penguin India|year=2000|isbn=978-0140190625|location=|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the Direct Path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucas|first1=Phillip|title=New Religious Movements in the Twenty-first Century|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=306, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born as P. Krishna Menon in 1883 at Cherukulathu House, in [[Peringara]], near [[Tiruvalla]], in the state of [[Travancore]], now a part of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="ad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/atmananda/atmananda.htm|title=Biography|publisher=advaita.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying law, he became a Government Advocate and Inspector and [[Superintendent of Police (India)|District Superintendent of Police]] and remained in service until 1939.

===Sadhana and realization===
Meanwhile, his search for a guru led to his meeting Swami Yogananda (not to be confused with [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]) briefly in 1913. In 1923, he assumed the name Sri Atmananda and started teaching [[Jnana Yoga]].&lt;ref name="ad" /&gt; After retirement from government service, he resided in his family home, ''Anandavadi'' on the river [[Pamba River|Pampa]] in Malakara.&lt;ref name="ad"/&gt;

He died at Trivandrum (now known as [[Thiruvananthapuram]]) in 1959.

==Legacy==
He published several books including, ''[http://libgen.io/book/index.php?md5=49AE51DB44211A9D3E8195304C2F2659 Atma Darshan]'' and ''[http://libgen.io/book/index.php?md5=652016F9CF810CD5D34BF866631FA2EA Atma Nirvriti]'' in [[Malayalam]] (both of which he translated into English), and ''Atmaramam'' (in Malayalam).

After his death, the book ''[http://docslide.us/documents/sri-atmananda-atmananda-tattwa-samhita.html Atmananda Tattwa Samhita]'', based on tape-recorded talks between Sri Atmananda and some disciples, was published. In the following years, his eldest son Adwayananda continued his teachings from his home in Anandawadi, Malakkara, near [[Chengannur]], till his death in 2001. A school in his name, [[Sri Atmananda Memorial School (Malakkara, Kerala)|Sri Atmananda Memorial School]], was founded in 1987 in Malakkara, and another [[Sri Atmananda Memorial School (Texas)|school of the same name]] was located in [[Austin, Texas]] from 1995 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Whittaker, [http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2009-10-23/898466/ "Modern School Lessons: Reading, Writing, and Real Estate. The sale of a historic Central Austin estate puts private schools in jeopardy."] ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When American mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] visited India (1954–1955), his meeting with Krishna Menon has been described as the "climax of his visit" to India, and is recounted in his book, ''Baksheesh and Brahman'', and the meditation he was given, "Where are you between two thoughts?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Campbell|editor=Robin Larsen |editor2=Stephen Larsen |editor3=Antony Van Couvering |title=Baksheesh and Brahman: Asian Journals - India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VySPqLx1DucC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=Joseph+Campbell+Krishna+Menon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OPTOnhiAFW&amp;sig=NJDSI7xr8HscvaGhUqqsi4h7ubE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VDNzTOvsGtOVcbeYnbwP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Joseph%20Campbell%20Krishna%20Menon&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|isbn=1577312376|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

One of the first researchers on the subject of bilingual memory and representation was [[linguist]] [[Uriel Weinreich]]. ''Languages in Contact'', an essay published by Weinreich in 1953, proposed a model of bilingual memory organization that made the theoretical distinction between the [[lexical semantics|lexical]] and conceptual level of representation.&lt;ref name=Golato&gt;Golato, P. (2007). The handbook of bilingualism. ''World Englishes, 26'', 534–536. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-971X.2007.00527.x&lt;/ref&gt; Three different types of organizational models were proposed: coordinate, compound, and subordinate, each having a different relationship between the lexical and conceptual levels of representation.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; In 1954, Ervin and Osgood reformulated Weinreich's compound-coordinate representational model and placed further emphasis on the context of language learning, similar to the [[encoding specificity principle]] later proposed by [[Tulving]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; In 1984, Potter et al. proposed the hierarchical model of bilingual memory, consisting of two memory structures, the word association model and concept mediation model. The word association model proposes a link between languages at the lexical level while the concept mediation model proposes a direct link between the conceptual representation and the lexical representation in each language.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; The hierarchical model was later revised by Kroll and Stewart in 1994 to account for linguistic proficiency and direction of translation, since then it has been re-revised.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt;

==Biological basis of bilingual memories==

One of the processes involved in analyzing which neural regions of the brain are involved in bilingual memory is a subtraction method. Researchers compare what has been impaired with what is functioning regularly. This contrast between the destroyed and intact regions of the brain, aids researchers in discovering the components of language processing. It has been found that under typical circumstances, when multiple languages are lost at the same time, they are usually regained in the same fashion. It is therefore presumed that areas of the brain, which are responsible for processing language, are potentially the same. There have been examples of cases where languages have been restored prior to one another and to a greater degree, but this is fairly uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Goral, M., Levy, E., &amp; Obler, L. (2002) Neurolinguistic aspects of bilingualism. ''International Journal of Bilingualism, 6''(4), 411-420. doi:10.1177/13670069020060040301&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques allowing researchers to observe brain activity in multilingual patients are conducted whilst the subject is simultaneously performing and processing a language. Research has proposed that the entire production and comprehension of language is most likely regulated and managed by neural pools, whose stations of communication are in the cortical and subcortical regions.&lt;ref name=Moretti&gt;Moretti, R., Torre, P., Antonello, R. M., Cazzato, G., &amp; Bava, A. (2003). Subcortical-cortical lesions and two-step aphasia in a bilingual patient. ''Advances in psychology research, 23'', 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that there are no grounds on which to assume the existence of distinct cerebral organization of separate languages in the bilingual brain. That is to say, the cerebral regions that are engaged for both languages are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Marangolo, P., Peran, P., Piras, F., Rizzi, C., &amp; Sabatini, U. (2009). Parallel recovery in a bilingual aphasic: a neurolinguistic and fMRI study. ''Neuropsychology, 23''(3), 405-409. doi:10.1037/a0014824&lt;/ref&gt; Although neurologists have a basic understanding of the underlying neural components and mechanisms of bilingual language, further research is necessary in order to fully understand or conclude any other findings.&lt;ref name=Moretti /&gt; 
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|alt=MRI|Anterior Cingulate]][[Neuroimaging]] techniques such as [[fMRI]]s have shown that at least four brain areas are involved in bilingual switching: [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], inferior frontal cortex, [[anterior cingulate]], and [[supramarginal gyrus]]. It is expected that switching from one language to another should involve different functional processes when compared to the brain of an individual who only speaks one language. However further studies on brain activation during this switching of languages needs to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Baker. S. A., Kovelman, I., &amp; Petitto, L. (2008). Bilingual and monolingual brains compared: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of syntactic processing and a possible "neural signature" of bilingualism. ''J Cogn Neurosci, 20''(1): 153–169. doi: 10.1162/jocn.2008.20011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual episodic memory==
[[Episodic memory]] is closely related to [[semantic memory]], [[Tulving]] created the two categories as a way to distinguish the specific knowledge from the general knowledge. Episodic memory contains the records of unique events which occurred at particular times,&lt;ref name=Macleod&gt;Macleod, C. M. (1976). Bilingual episodic memory: acquisition and forgetting. ''Journal of  Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 15'', 347-364.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly Autobiographical memories are stored in episodic memory.  It holds the events from personally experienced past,&lt;ref name= Schrauf&gt;Schrauf, R.W., Pavlenko, A. &amp; Dewaele J.-M. (2003) Bilingual episodic memory: An introduction. ''The International Journal of Bilingualism'', ''7''(3), 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; they exist in subjective time and space and using it requires a conscious recollection and a controlled process.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; Tulving referred to this as "mental time travel",&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; and he "classifies encoding as an event, rather than a process".&lt;ref name =Murray&gt;Murray, D. (1985). Review of elements of episodic memory. ''Canadian Psychology, 26''(3), 235-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested that bilinguals that have better control of their language processing should perform better in episodic than semantic memory tasks.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; Bilinguals store the input of language exceedingly well, regardless of their intention to learn.&lt;ref name=Macleod /&gt; Language forms a surface in the progressive retrieval of features of an event (e.g., on College Ave, at Tim Hortons, on Tuesday...), that triggers further forms within the same language serving to guide retrieval. The events, objects, characters, etc. are all cued by linguistic elements that might serve as a series of triggers.&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; This information is highly integrated, the superiority of action memory is due to better episodic integration for action memory (vs verbal);&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; we remember events based on language cues and these cues further solidify the events.

To test episodic memory researchers usually use items that can be better related to normal everyday life, such as sentences.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt;  Language recognition depends somewhat on the retrievability of meaning, but the extent of this dependence is unknown. Retrieval of memories is language-specific, it matches the language spoken at the time. Depending on what language is used what is recalled may be different because a cue can activate many meanings, it is the context that conditions what meaning is considered first,&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; and context can change over language and cultures.

Bilinguals also tend to be [[bicultural]], it is known that we filter all of our experiences through culturally shaped scripts. So, those that are bilingual and therefore for the most part bicultural have multiple scripts to draw from, or more than one set of narrative constraints. All experiences imply some sort of narrative structure, and narrative traditions are culturally shaped. They direct our perception of reality and the encoding of memories. Though they may not directly determine their perception of reality, they determine "how the story is told" which may be different from "how it happened".&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; This shapes memory, as stories that are deemed as worthy to be told are further solidified by the retelling and reliving of the experience.

===Bilingual autobiographical memory===

[[Autobiographical memory]] is a type of [[Episodic memory]] process which is involved in the recall of one's life experiences and personal events of ones past.&lt;ref name= Golato/&gt; Bilinguals have the ability to recall some life experiences in one language, and other events using another. When recalling language information it is important that the language is recalled in the same [[context (language use)|context]] as it was encoded. This is referred to as [[Context-dependent memory]] Ex. If one who is bilingual were to learn a Spanish song in a Spanish speaking country, and then come back to their native land, they would have difficulty remembering the song. However once they were immersed in a Spanish context again, recall would come with much more ease.&lt;ref name=Viorica&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Ulric, Neisser (2000.) Language-dependent recall of autobiographical memories. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 3'', 361-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that autobiographical memories have increased availability in the language they were created in. That is to say, memories are richer and more elaborate when recalled in the language that the event has taken place, rather than the other language available to them.&lt;ref name=Viorica /&gt; This can also be referred to as the [[Encoding specificity principle]], where memories appear to be encoded in a language-specific manner.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; Earlier memory events that occur during youth and are encoded in the first and dominant language, are more emotionally charged, have a higher quality of detail and are greater in number than those memories recalled in the second language.&lt;ref&gt;Schrauf, R. W. (2000), Bilingual autobiographical memory: experimental studies and clinical cases. ''Culture Psychology, 6''(4), 387-417. doi: 10.1177/1354067X0064001&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be argued that the language that is spoken and recalled more frequently, will have more associations to multiple circumstances and is therefore more likely to be remembered.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt;  Problems can arise if a language that comes to mind 'internally' is not the language that is being spoken externally. For example, if someone recalled an event in Spanish, but then reported it in English. This changeover in languages is most likely to do with the [[Content (memory)|content]] of the memory itself.&lt;ref name=Viorica /&gt; Evidence has been shown that language-specific recall of information when probed or cued in the matching language, is recalled vividly, and with much more elaboration and detail. It has also been shown that each language that a bilingual possesses, may represent experiences in somewhat different fashions.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt;

==Bilingual working memory==

[[File:Baddeley working memory.jpg|thumb|alt=Baddeley's model|Alan Baddeley's Model of Working Memory]]
[[Working memory]] is an active part of the memory system that temporarily stores and processes information during mental operations.&lt;ref name=Clellen&gt;Gutiérrez-Clellen, V.,F., &amp; Calderón, J. (2004). Verbal working memory in bilingual children. ''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 47''(4), 863-76. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/232333683&lt;/ref&gt; Highly related are the concepts of [[attention]] and executive control.&lt;ref name=Namazi&gt;Namazi, M., &amp; Thordardottir, E. (2010). A working memory, not bilingual advantage, in controlled attention. ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism, 13''(5), 597-616. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13670050.2010.488288&lt;/ref&gt; A major function of the working memory system is the retention and processing of verbal information.&lt;ref name=Namazi /&gt; [[Baddeley's model of working memory]] suggests the phonological loop, a slave system that is responsible for the rehearsal of verbal information and has been implicated in language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A., Gathercole, S., &amp; Papagno, C. (1998). The phonological loop as a language learning device. ''Psychological Review, 105''(1), 158-173. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/214220164&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures of verbal working memory are predictive of proficiency in a second language&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; and working memory capacity is strongly correlated with first and second language abilities.&lt;ref name=Namazi /&gt; Despite these correlations, research into the effects of bilingualism on working memory have been largely inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; Bilingual performance on working memory tasks can be affected by language dominance, language proficiency, and the nature of the task, variables which can be difficult to control and assess.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; However, most recent research suggests that there are no differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals in regards to working memory performance,&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel De Abreu, P. M. J. (2011). Working memory in multilingual children: Is there a bilingual effect? Memory (Hove.Print),19(5), 529-537. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/901183359&lt;/ref&gt; although more research is still required to make any conclusive claims. The evidence suggests that working memory performance has a stronger relationship with general linguistic proficiency than it does with the acquisition of a second language.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; It has also been observed that there are no significant cross-language differences within bilinguals, providing further support for the hypothesis that working memory is not language specific.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; Bilingual speakers are, however, more accurate in assessing their [[metalinguistic]] reading and working memory abilities compared to monolingual speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ransdell, S., Barbier, M., &amp; Niit, T. (2006). Metacognitions about language skill and working memory among monolingual and bilingual college students: When does multilingualism matter? ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism, 9''(6), 728-741. doi:10.2167/beb390.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digit span===

Research has found that there are cross-linguistic differences on a short-term memory test known as the [[digit-span]] task. For example, Chinese speakers as compared to English speakers had a greater digit span.&lt;ref name=Thorn&gt;Thorn, A. S. C., &amp; Gathercole, S. E. (2001). Language differences in verbal short-term memory do not exclusively originate in the process of subvocal rehearsal. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review: A Journal of the Psychonomic Society, Inc., 8(2), 357-364. doi:10.3758/BF03196173&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation of this observation is that digits in English take longer to say and subvocally rehearse in the [[phonological loop]], a component of Baddely's model of working memory. It has been suggested that because memory for short words is better than for long words, a phenomenon known as the ''word-length effect'', that there are cross-linguistic differences on the digit span task.&lt;ref name=Thorn /&gt; This difference has also been observed in Welsh-English bilinguals, who rated themselves as more proficient in Welsh but had a greater digit span in English because of the shorter digit names.&lt;ref name=Thorn /&gt; However, research has suggested that familiarity and long-term memory may play an important role and that differences are not strictly the result of subvocal rehearsal rates.&lt;ref name=Thorn /&gt;

===Inner speech===

Our thoughts often occur as the inner speech of our natural language. Inner speech is used for such things as rehearsing facts, having a mental conversation with oneself, and counting, among many others.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;Larsen, S. F., Schrauf, R. W., Fromholt, P., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2002). Inner speech and bilingual autobiographical memory: A polish-danish cross-cultural study. ''Memory, 10''(1), 45-54. doi:10.1080/09658210143000218&lt;/ref&gt; Being fluent in more than one language can affect inner speech in multiple ways. Studies have revealed that fluent bilinguals use their natural language to mentally represent exact numbers, however, non-numerical facts are retrieved in either language with equal ease.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, P. (2002). The cognitive functions of language. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 25''(6), 657-74; discussion 674-725. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/212317857&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual individuals report feeling and acting different when in different linguistic mindsets and are capable of switching between them for the strategic purpose of activating different (context/language-dependent) information.&lt;ref&gt;Schrauf, R. W. (2002). Bilingual inner speech as the medium of cross-modular retrieval in autobiographical memory.''Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 25''(6), 698-699. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/212295845&lt;/ref&gt; As perceived language proficiency in a second languages increases, the use of that second language for inner speech becomes more habitual.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt; As well, it has been reported that bilinguals who suffer from psychosis experience hallucinations or reduced linguistic competence in only one language.&lt;ref&gt;Henser, S. (2002). Relativistic implications of a natural-language-based format for thought. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences,2''5(6), 688-689. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/212296538&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual semantic memory==
[[Semantic memory]] is a term coined by [[Tulving]] and is closely related to episodic memory, it is a kind of mental dictionary containing all the attributes of event-free knowledge.&lt;ref name=Macleod /&gt; It relates to general facts about the world (e.g., the sky is blue, 2+2=4)&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; and it has no concern with time or space.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; Semantic memory does not require conscious thought, as it generally is automatic; it is not bound, except as interest links themes. It has been suggested that retrieval cues for semantic data are themselves semantic.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

Recent studies have shown that knowing a second language extends semantic memory and other cognitive capabilities&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; as they recruit different cognitive operations.  It is shown to increase the normal capacity and expose the person to new situations and different ways of organizing thoughts. They learn to incorporate different concepts, and language specific inputs.&lt;ref name= Kormi-NouriR /&gt;  The finding of a positive bilinguality effect for semantic memory provides support for the role of organization in bilinguality.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt;  [[Bilingualism]] and [[monolingualism]] semantic memory is often tested using word fluency tests, to gauge whether and how well these individuals organize their thoughts.  These tests have indicated that the type of material is not necessarily of importance but rather the mental activity is more important.  It is also found that the bilingualism effect can be observed more under automatic processing than under deliberate processing.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt;

There are two predominant models of bilingual memory, the Hierarchical Model and the Concept features model. The Hierarchical Model assumes three linked components: a first language lexicon, a second language lexicon, and a conceptual store containing semantic referents.&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; Links between words in the first language lexicon and their meanings in the underlying conceptual store would be strong for bilinguals.  For newer bilinguals links running from the second language lexicon to the conceptual store would be relatively weak, if present at all, the links from the second language lexicon to the first language lexicon would be the strong ones. So the bilingual would translate the word from the second language into the first language and from there access the conceptual store (Cheval to horse to basic idea of a horse vs. cheval to basic idea of a horse). Fluent bilinguals have stronger and more direct links to the conceptual store form both languages.  In the Concept Features Model, when words have highly prototypical, concrete referents (desk, juice) the translations in both languages would activate the same set of underlying semantic nodes. In more conceptual and abstract referents (poverty, intelligence) translation equivalents activate different but overlapping sets of semantic nodes.&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt;

In bilingual memory as Colin M. MacLeod&lt;ref name=Macleod /&gt; found the two translated words (e.g., Horse and Cheval) are not stored as synonyms, they share the same supralinguistic semantic representation in memory (a supralinguistic concept is an abstraction of meaning more primitive than the word itself, it cannot be defined). It is stored in a kind of tag on a language free semantic representation of the world, where the input language is stored as a semantic trace.

In general a positive effect of bilingualism in semantic memory is more pronounced for older than for younger children.&lt;ref name= Kormi-NouriR /&gt;  Since bilingual children engage in extensive practice of two languages at an early age, they become better at paying attention to parts of information and at inhibiting other parts. Overall they have better recall and recognition in letter fluency especially when older and more educated, but the more similarity between their two languages lessens the advantage, as when they are very close there is more overlap of information.

===Bilingual mental lexicon===
{{see also|Bilingual Lexicon|l1=Bilingual lexicon}}
[[Mental lexicon]] refers to the permanent store of words in an individual's memory, and is thought to be organized in a semantic network.&lt;ref name =Wang&gt;Wang, H., &amp; Hou, Y. (2011). Research into the mental lexicon representation of Chinese English learners based on spreading activation model. ''Studies in Language and Literature, 2''(1), 68-80.&lt;/ref&gt; This network is related to the [[spreading activation]] model purposed by Collins and Loftus, as one word (node) is activated, words that are semantically and lexically related will also be activated.&lt;ref name= Swanson /&gt;&lt;ref name =Wang /&gt; [[File:Semantic Features Model Mental Lexicon.png|thumb|alt=mental lexicon|Mental Lexicon Model]] Evidence has been found to support the view that a bilingual individual has the same conceptual system for both of their languages.&lt;ref name =Dong&gt;Dong, Y., Gui, S., &amp; Macwhinney, B. (2005). Shared and separate meanings in the bilingual mental lexicon. ''Bilingualism, 8''(3), 221-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Dong, Gui, and Macwhinney have demonstrated the convergence of a new language into a preexisting mental lexicon in their article "Shared and Separate Meanings in the Bilingual Mental Lexicon".&lt;ref name =Dong /&gt; When a person first learns a second language, the language has its own conceptual system and is heavily reliant on the first language to gain understanding and meaning of the new words.&lt;ref name =Dong /&gt; For example, a Spanish learner is learning the word "gato", and will refer back to their original language (ex. English) to translate it into "cat" to gain meaning, relation, and contextual information surrounding that word. However, the more advanced an individual becomes in acquiring a certain language, the two conceptual systems will eventual converge into one, where one language influences the other and vice versa.&lt;ref name =Dong /&gt;

===Tip of the tongue in bilinguals===

It has been found that Bilinguals are more susceptible to the [[tip of the tongue]], in cases where the [[phonology]] of a word is different in both languages. For example, when recalling a word such as "hair" in English, there is more [[Language transfer|interference]] from the French word "cheveux", because they sound and are spelled differently. However, when a word is phonologically similar in both languages, bilinguals produce less errors than individuals who are monolingual. For example, the word "chocolate" is similar to the translated word in French, which is "chocolat". Overall, bilinguals experience the tip of the tongue phenomenon more than individuals who are monolingual. This is confirmed by the evidence that bilinguals are less able to recall words, or initiate representations of words that are different in each language.&lt;ref&gt;Gollan, T. H., &amp; Acenas, L. R. (2004). What is a TOT? Cognate and translation effects on Tip-of-the-Tongue states in spanish–english and tagalog–english bilinguals. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition'', 30 (1), 246 –269. DOI: 10.1037/0278-7393.30.1.246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual-coding theory==

The [[dual-coding theory]] was first postulated by Paivio and Desrochers in 1980, and indicates that two systems are responsible for the encoding and retrieval of information from memory.&lt;ref name= Arnedt&gt;Arnedt C. S., &amp; Gentile, J. R. (1986). A test of dual coding theory for bilingual memory. ''Canadian Journal of Psychology, 40''(3), 290-299.&lt;/ref&gt; The verbal representational system encodes verbal information, such as words. While the imagery system encodes and retrieves non-verbal objects, such as images and scenes.&lt;ref name= PAC&gt;Paivio, A., Clark, J. M., &amp; Lambert, W. (1988) Bilingual dual-coding theory and semantic repetition effects on recall. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 14''(1), 163-172.&lt;/ref&gt; The dual-coding theory enunciates that these two systems can operate independently, as well as interdependently. Therefore, verbal cues can be activated independently of images, and vice versa. However verbal cues can also prime images through associative relationships, while images can prime verbal items through associative connections as well.&lt;ref name= PAC /&gt;  This is not surprising, as a person can often describe an image using verbal behaviors, indicating the interconnectedness of the two systems. This theme continues into the bilingual adaptation of the dual-coding theory, which indicates that an individual's verbal representational systems for their two languages operate independently of one another, but also have associative connections with each other.&lt;ref name= PAC /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid&gt;Vaid, J. (1988). Bilingual memory representations: A further test of dual coding theory. ''Canadian Journal of Psychology, 42''(1), 84-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, thinking of synonyms for "fierce" using English words, would only involve the English language system. But if a person is required to translate the word "fierce" into the French version, this would entail the two language systems to have associative connections. Indicating that the two language systems can act independently of each other, and that each language system has their own within language connections.&lt;ref name= Arnedt /&gt;&lt;ref name= PAC /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt;

Some flaws with the bilingual dual coding theory have been identified. One of which deals with the constant finding that translated items are better recollected than the words that are directly recalled or require deriving synonyms for.&lt;ref name= Arnedt /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt; This was originally thought because translated words are better remembered because they engage both memory systems, compared to synonyms which require the use of only one memory system. With this in mind, it was also thought that between language systems have stronger associations, compared to within language systems. This means that there are well developed associations for the translated words because there are stronger associations between two languages, compared to the connections within only one language, as seen with synonyms.&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt; Other explanations have also been explored to explain this phenomenon, one is that the translated words are better remembered because they are more deeply processed than words that people are simply asked to recall or create synonyms for.&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt; This is in line with the [[levels of processing effect]], where in relation to the bilingual dual coding theory, words that participants are required to think of synonyms for are better recalled than the words they were simply asked to copy. This is because creating synonyms requires deeper processing than just duplicating a word. Similarly, words that participants are required to translate will be better remembered than the words they created synonyms for.&lt;ref name= Arnedt /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt;

==Language-dependent recall==
Language-dependent recall is a phenomenon that signifies memories are best recalled when the language at encoding matches the language during recall.&lt;ref name= Ulric&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Ulric, N. (2000). Language-dependent recall of autobiographical memories. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 129''(3), 361-368.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the [[encoding specificity principle]] purposed by Tulving and Thompson, which states that recall is better when the retrieval context is similar to the context in which the memory was encoded.&lt;ref name= Fausey&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Fausey, C.M. (2006). Language-dependent memory in bilingual memory. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20''(8), 1025-1047.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language-dependent recall is also significantly related to [[context-dependent memory]]. In the perspective of bilingualism, context dependent memory indicates that the language spoken during the encoding of the event acts as the external context. Whereas the language that a person thinks, rehearses and conducts inner speech constitutes the internal environment. Therefore, it is important to reinstate these internal and external contexts in which a person encodes the memory in order to enhance recall.&lt;ref name= Ulric /&gt;

Consequently, this has major impacts on bilingual individuals, who can interchangeably encode a memory in English, for instance, and encode another memory in French due to their diverse language capabilities. An example of context-dependent memory in the case of bilingualism is seen in an example by Viorica and Kaushanskaya. They asked participants this question: "name a statue of someone standing with a raised arm while looking into the distance". This inquiry was asked in two separate languages, English and Mandarin. When asked the question in Mandarin, the individuals were more likely to say the "Statue of Mao". However, when asked in English, the participants said the "Statue of Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Kaushanskaya, M. (2007). Language content guides memory content. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 14''(5), 925-933.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when a person encodes a memory in English, but is asked about the memory in French, their inner verbalization of the memory, matches that during the encoding (i.e. they are remembering the event in the language that it was encoded with). Thus indicating the importance of reinstating the internal and external context during retrieval to match the context during encoding.

Accordingly, autobiographical memories and semantic knowledge can be impaired when the language during the recall (ex. English) of the memory does not match the language during encoding (ex. French).  However, there are several benefits when the contexts do match.  For example, Viorica and Fausey found that when the linguistics at encoding match the linguistics during retrieval it increases the speed, accuracy, and emotional intensity of the memory. Thus suggesting that language impacts the cues that are involved in the retrieval of bilingual memories.&lt;ref name= Fausey /&gt;

The '''Bonan language''' (pronounced {{IPA-mn|p⁼aoˈnaŋ|}}, ''Baonang'') (Chinese 保安语 ''Bǎo'ān yǔ'', Amdo Tibetan ''Dorké'') is the [[Mongolic language]] of the [[Bonans|Bonan]] people of [[China]].  As of 1985, it was spoken by about 8,000 people, including about 75% of the total Bonan ethnic population and many ethnic [[Monguor]], in [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]] Provinces and the [[Ningxia]] Hui Autonomous Prefecture.  There are several dialects, which are influenced to varying degrees — but always heavily — by [[Amdo Tibetan|Tibetan]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], while [[bilingualism]] in [[Wutun language|Wutun]] is less common. The most commonly studied is the Tongren dialect. There is no writing system in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XULERYYEJo0C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=zhu+yuanzhang+mosques&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sC3s4a7Ohi&amp;sig=PMfaDB4dKHT6ACoxBrv7XWgxht0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H2I_TNLfH4P58Abiv_iiAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBzgK#v=snippet&amp;q=bao%20ans%20no%20written%20language&amp;f=false|title=Islam in China|author=Shoujiang Mi, Jia You|year=2004|publisher=五洲传播出版社|location=|page=57|isbn=7-5085-0533-6|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is also referred to as "Manegacha", natively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/gerald.roche/posts/10156389317729276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

Bonan phonology has been heavily influenced by Tibetan.  [[Consonant]]s possess a [±aspirated] contrast.  Initial consonant clusters of mostly falling sonority are present in native words, as are heavy diphthongs, though the content of both is heavily restricted.  The possible word-initial consonant clusters in Bonan are {{IPA|[mp, nt, nt͡ɕ, ntʂ, ŋk, tʰχ, χt͡ɕ, rt͡ɕ, lt͡ɕ, ft, fk, ʂp, ʂk]}}.

Ñantoq Baoan has six vowels /a, e, ə, i, ɵ, u/, with long counterparts for all except /ə/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/289_fulltext.pdf|title=Mongolic Phonology and the Qinghai-Gansu Languages|last=Hans|first=Nugteren|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==

Bonan, like other [[Mongolic languages]], is agglutinative.

There are five [[grammatical case|case]] markings for Bonan nouns: [[Nominative]], Accusative-Genitive, Dative-Locative, Ablative-Comparative, and [[Instrumental case|Instrumentative]].

Verbal [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is quite complex.  [[Evidentiality]] is marked in the indicative mood as "definite" or "indefinite" with a specific suffix or with an auxiliary verb.  The present definite is used to mark naturally occurring phenomena, while the present indefinite indicates the habits of animals.  The indefinite may also mark volition. The future, continuous, and perfective suffixes also possess markers for evidentiality that are often used to mark negation.

== Syntax ==

Bonan has a primary [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] (subject–object–verb), but topicalization of an object is common. It is known for its peculiar double marking of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]].  A Mongolic copula, of which there are several with different meanings, comes sentence-finally, following Bonan SOV word order, while a copula {{IPA|[ʂɪ]}} from Chinese {{IPA|/ʂɨ̂/}} “to be” appears between the copula’s subject and complement, as in Chinese SVO word order.  This Chinese copula is optional and is used to emphasize the subject.  The definite, but not indefinite, copula can also act as a participle following some finite verbs.  For example:

:{{IPA|[ənə ʂɪ kuŋʂə-nə t͡ɕʰitʂə o]}}

this COP commune-GEN car IND.COP

“This is the commune’s car.” (Buhe &amp; Liu 1985: 65)

Uniquely among Mongolic languages, adjectives follow the noun they modify. This is due to Tibetan influence.

The '''buw Holding GmbH''', was an owner-run German company based in [[Osnabrück]] acquired by [[Convergys]] through a definitive merger, is especially known for its [[call centre]]s. buw has altogether about 6,000 employees who work in [[Osnabrück]], [[Münster]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Schwerin]], [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]], and [[Wismar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtai.com/uploads/media/FastTrack_BusinessServices_Winter08_Invest_in_Germany.pdf |title=Customer care specialist buw Group recently announced plans to open a new contact center in the fair trade city of Leipzig |accessdate=2011-07-07 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany,  [[Pécs]] in [[Hungary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kulkepviselet/IT/en/en_Kulpolitika/en_mo_a_vilagban.htm?printable=true |title=Germany's buw Holding, a telemarketing and customer care company, plans to invest EUR 10 million at its call centre in Pécs, in southwest Hungary |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921085752/http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kulkepviselet/IT/en/en_Kulpolitika/en_mo_a_vilagban.htm?printable=true |archivedate=2012-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.trademagazin.hu/en/esemenyek/budapest-calling.html |title=  buw Holding from Germany has 4,000 employees and their affiliate, with its headquarters in Pécs, has been up and running since 2005|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Timișoara]] and [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] in [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="standorte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buw.de/unternehmen/standorte |title=Die buw-Standorte |access-date=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Jens Bormann and Karsten Wulf, who met at the [[University of Osnabrück]], founded their company in March 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.asctelecom.com/brochures/en/CS_buw_english.pdf |title=  The buw Group (www.buw.de) was founded in 1993 by Jens Bormann and Karsten Wulf|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as b u. w ('''B'''ormann '''u'''nd '''W'''ulf) [[telemarketing|Telefonmarketing]] GmbH while they still were students.
In 2001 the company was restructured. In 2002 employees founded the organisation ''Lernen fürs Leben'' ("Learning for Life") which is committed to projects in the Third World, in particular if they serve the purpose to teach people how to make a living on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.engagiert.nrw.de/unterneng/beispiele/alphabetisch/lernen_fuers_leben/index.php# |title=''Lernen fürs Leben e. V.'' auf der Seite des Ministeriums für Generationen, Familie, Frauen und Integration des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen |access-date=2011-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326194923/http://www.engagiert.nrw.de/unterneng/beispiele/alphabetisch/lernen_fuers_leben/index.php# |archive-date=2012-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the buw Holding had 1,700 employees in Osnabrück, Münster and Munich. Temporarily it also ran a call centre in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

In 2006 the company received the ''European Call Centre Award'' for its [[corporate identity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.call-center-experts.de/index.cfm/Jens_Bormann/:var:site:experte:autor:1238 Portrait of Jens Bormann on Call Center Expert-Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the holding's turnover was EUR 76 million and in 2009 buw already employed up to about 3,700 people.

In February 2011 a call centre was opened in [[Timișoara]], Romania.

In August 2016 [[Convergys|Convergys Corporation]] has completed its previously announced acquisition of buw, By adding buw’s geographic footprint, complementary client base, and German language capabilities, Convergys becomes the second largest outsourced customer services provider in Germany. The combination creates a team of approximately 7,000 German-speaking service professionals, located in 19 sites and four countries – Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160801005702/en/Convergys-Completes-Acquisition-buw Convergys Completes Acquisition of buw]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The buw Holding GmbH consists of two main branches:

'''Chechen''' ({{lang|ce|нохчийн мотт}} , {{IPA-all|ˈnɔx.t͡ʃiːn mu͜ɔt|}}) is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] spoken by more than 1.4 million people, mostly in the [[Chechnya|Chechen Republic]] and by [[Chechen people|members of the Chechen diaspora]] throughout [[Russia]], [[Jordan]], [[Central Asia]] (mainly [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]), and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

==Classification==
Chechen is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]]. Together with the closely related [[Ingush language|Ingush]], with which there exists a large degree of mutual intelligibility and shared vocabulary, it forms the [[Vainakh languages|Vainakh branch]].

==Dialects==
There are a number of Chechen dialects: Akkish, Chantish, Chebarloish, Malkhish, Nokhchmakhkakhoish, Orstkhoish, Sharoish, Shuotoish, Terloish, Itum-Qalish, and Himoish. The [[Kist people|Kisti]] dialect of Georgia is not easily understood by northern Chechens without a few days' practice. One difference in pronunciation is that Kisti aspirated consonants remain aspirated when doubled (fortis) or after /s/, whereas they lose their aspiration in other dialects in these situations.

Dialects of Chechen can be classified by their geographic position within the Chechen Republic. The dialects of the northern lowlands are often referred to as "Oharoy muott" (literally "lowlander's language") and the dialect of the southern mountain tribes is known as "Laamaroy muott" (lit. "mountainer's language"). Oharoy muott forms the basis for much of the standard and literary Chechen language, which can largely be traced to the regional dialects of Urus-Martan and contemporary Grozny. Laamaroy dialects include (but are not limited to) Chebarloish, Sharoish, Itum-Qalish, Kisti, and Himoish. Until recently, however, Himoy was  undocumented and was considered a branch of Sharoish, as many dialects are also used as the basis of intertribal (teip) communication within a larger Chechen "tukkhum". Laamaroy dialects such as Sharoish, Himoish and Chebarloish are more conservative and retain many features from Proto–Chechen. For instance, many of these dialects lack a number of vowels found in the standard language which were a result of [[Umlaut (linguistics)|long-distance assimilation]] between vowel sounds. Additionally, the Himoy  dialect preserves word-final, post-tonic vowels as a schwa [ə], indicating Laamaroy and Ohwaroy dialects were already separate at the time that Oharoy dialects were undergoing assimilation.

==Geographic distribution==
According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|Russian Census]] of 2010, 1,350,000 people reported being able to speak Chechen.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

===Official status===
Chechen is an official language of [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Article 10.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
Chechens in [[Jordan]] have good relations with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and are able to practice their own culture and language. Chechen language usage is strong among the Chechen community in Jordan. Chechens are bilingual in both Chechen and Arabic, but do not speak Arabic among themselves, only speaking Chechen to other Chechens. Some Jordanians are literate in Chechen as well, having managed to read and write to people visiting Jordan from Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEq14wCaqwAC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=jordan+chechens#v=onepage&amp;q=chechens%20speak%20their%20own%20language%20punished%20if%20they%20speak%20arabic&amp;f=false|title=Middle Eastern minorities and diasporas|author=Moshe Maʻoz, Gabriel Sheffer|year=2002|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|location=|page=255|isbn=1-902210-84-0|pages=|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Some phonological characteristics of Chechen include its wealth of consonants and sounds similar to [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the [[Salishan languages]] of North America, as well as a large vowel system resembling those of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[German language|German]].

===Consonants===
The Chechen language has, like most indigenous [[languages of the Caucasus]], a large number of [[consonant]]s: about 40 to 60 (depending on the [[dialect]] and the analysis), far more than in most [[languages of Europe|European languages]]. Typical of the region, a four-way distinction between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]], [[voiceless]], [[ejective]], and [[geminate]] [[fortis (phonetics)|fortis]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s is found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johanna Nichols]], Chechen, ''The Indigenous languages of the Caucasus'' (Caravan Books, Delmar NY, 1994) {{ISBN|0-88206-068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly any consonant may be [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] because of [[focus gemination]], but only the ones above are found in [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s.
The consonants of the ''t'' cell and {{IPA|/l/}} are [[denti-alveolar]]; the others of that column are [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]. 
{{IPA|/x/}} is a back [[velar consonant|velar]], but not quite [[uvular consonant|uvular]].
The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} may be [[dark L|velarized]], unless it's followed by a front vowel. 
The trill {{IPA|/r/}} is usually articulated with a single contact, and therefore sometimes described as a [[tap consonant|tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}.
Except in the literary [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], and even then only for some speakers, the voiced [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}} have merged into the [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. A voiceless labial fricative {{IPA|/f/}} is found only in European [[loanword]]s.
{{IPA|/w/}} appears both in diphthongs and as a consonant; as a consonant, it has an allophone {{IPA|[v]}} before front vowels.

The approximately twenty [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] consonants do not appear in the table above. [[labial consonant|Labial]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] consonants may be pharyngealized, except for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]]. Pharyngealized consonants do not occur in [[verb]]s or [[adjective]]s, and in [[noun]]s and [[adverb]]s they occur predominantly before the [[low vowel]]s {{IPA|/a, aː/}} ({{IPA|[ə, ɑː]}}).

Except when following a consonant, {{IPAslink|ʢ}} is [[phonetics|phonetically]] {{IPAblink|ʔˤ}}, and can be argued to be a [[glottal stop]] before a "[[pharyngealized]]" (actually epiglottalized) vowel. However, it does not have the distribution constraints characteristic of the anterior [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized (epiglottalized) consonants]]. Although these may be analyzed as an [[wiktionary:anterior|anterior]] consonant plus {{IPA|/ʢ/}} (they surface for example as {{IPA|[dʢ]}} when [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and {{IPA|[pʰʜ]}} when [[voiceless]]), Nichols argues that given the severe constraints against [[consonant cluster]]s in Chechen, it is more useful to analyze them as single consonants.

The voiceless alveolar trill {{IPA|/r̥/}} contrasts with the voiced version {{IPA|/r/}}, but only occurs in two roots, ''vworh'' "seven" and ''barh'' "eight".

===Vowels===
Unlike most other languages of the Caucasus, Chechen has an extensive inventory of [[vowel]] sounds, about 44, putting its range higher than most languages of Europe (most vowels being the product of environmentally-conditioned allophonic variation, which varies by both dialect and method of analysis). Many of the vowels are due to [[I-mutation|umlaut]], which is highly productive in the standard dialect. None of the spelling systems used so far have distinguished the vowels with complete accuracy.

All vowels may be [[nasalization|nasalized]]. Nasalization is imposed by the [[genitive case|genitive]], [[infinitive]], and for some speakers the [[nominative case]] of [[adjective]]s. Nasalization is not strong, but it is audible even in final vowels, which are devoiced.

Some of the [[diphthong]]s have significant [[allophone|allophony]]: {{IPA|/ɥø/}} = {{IPA|[ɥø], [ɥe], [we]}}; {{IPA|/yø/}} = {{IPA|[yø], [ye]}}; {{IPA|/uo/}} = {{IPA|[woː], [uə]}}.

In [[closed syllable]]s, [[long vowel]]s become short in most dialects (not [[Kist people|Kisti]]), but are often still distinct from short vowels (shortened {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, and {{IPA|[ɑ̤]}} vs. short {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{IPA|[ə]}}, for example), though which remain distinct depends on the dialect. {{IPA|/æ/, /æː/}} and {{IPA|/e/, /eː/}} are in [[complementary distribution]] ({{IPA|/æ/}} occurs after [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] consonants, whereas {{IPA|/e/}} does not, and {{IPA|/æː/}}—identical with {{IPA|/æ/}} for most speakers—occurs in closed syllables, while {{IPA|/eː/}} does not) but speakers strongly feel that they are distinct sounds.

[[Pharyngealization]] appears to be a feature of the consonants, though some analyses treat it as a feature of the vowels. However, Nichols argues that this does not capture the situation in Chechen well, whereas it is more clearly a feature of the vowel in [[Ingush language|Ingush]]: Chechen {{IPA|[tsʜaʔ]}} "one", Ingush {{IPA|[tsaʔˤ]}}, which she analyzes as {{IPA|/tsˤaʔ/}} and {{IPA|/tsaˤʔ/}}. Vowels have a delayed [[breathy voice|murmured]] onset after pharyngealized voiced consonants and a noisy [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] onset after pharyngealized voiceless consonants. The high vowels {{IPA|/i/, /y/, /u/}} are diphthongized, {{IPA|[əi], [əy], [əu]}}, whereas the [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|/je/, /wo/}} undergo [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], {{IPA|[ej], [ow]}}.

===Phonotactics===
Chechen permits syllable-initial clusters {{IPA|/st px tx/}}, and non-initial {{IPA|/x r l/}} plus any consonant and any obstruent plus a uvular of the same manner. The only cluster of three consonants permitted is {{IPA|/rst/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ingush.narod.ru/chech/book/ch1011.gif|format=GIF|title=Indigenous Language of the Caucasus (Chechen)|pages=10–11|website=Ingush.narod.ru|accessdate=2016-01-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072204/http://ingush.narod.ru/chech/book/ch1011.gif|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Chechen is an [[agglutinative language]] with an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Chechen nouns belong to one of several genders or classes (6), each with a specific prefix with which the verb or an accompanying [[adjective]] agrees. The verb does not agree with the subject or object's person or number, having only tense forms and participles. Among these are an [[optative mood|optative]] and an [[antipassive voice|antipassive]]. Some verbs, however, do not take these prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;Awde, Nicholas and Galäv, Muhammad, ''Chechen''; p. 11. {{ISBN|0-7818-0446-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechen is an [[ergative language|ergative]], [[dependent-marking language]] using eight [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[absolutive case|absolutive]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[allative case|allative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]] and [[comparative case|comparative]]) and a large number of [[postposition]]s to indicate the role of nouns in sentences.

Word order is consistently [[left-branching language|left-branching]] (like in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), so that [[adjective]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and [[relative clause]]s precede the nouns they modify. [[Complementizer]]s and [[adverbial subordinator]]s, as in other [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast]] and in [[Northwest Caucasian languages]], are [[affix]]es rather than independent words.

Chechen also presents interesting challenges for [[lexicography]], as creating new words in the language relies on fixation of whole phrases rather than adding to the end of existing words or combining existing words. It can be difficult to decide which phrases belong in the dictionary, because the language's grammar does not permit the borrowing of new [[verb]]al [[morpheme]]s to express new concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Awde and Galäv; ''Chechen''; p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the verb '''dan''' (to do) is combined with [[noun phrase|nominal phrase]]s to correspond with new concepts imported from other languages.

===Noun classes===

Chechen nouns are divided into six lexically arbitrary [[noun class]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=RtyhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=chechen+noun+classes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qg7yqMUNp7&amp;sig=RIH3yCGfhqeBICWcaEem8sf_ttA&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBtcvB4YXUAhWM3SwKHSjuCI4Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=chechen+noun+classes&amp;f=false|title=Chechen-English English-Chechen Dictionary and Phrasebook|first1=Nicholas|last1=Awde|first2=Muhammad|last2=Galaev|date=22 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Morphologically, noun classes may be indexed by changes in the prefix of the accompanying verb and, in many cases, the adjective too. The first two of these classes apply to human beings, although some grammarians count these as two and some as a single class; the other classes however are much more lexically arbitrary. Chechen noun classes are named according to the prefix that indexes them:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Noun class 
!Noun example!! Singular prefix !! Plural prefix 
!Singular agreement
!Plural agreement
|-
| 1. v-class  
|''k'ant'' (boy)|| '''''v-''''' || '''''b-''' / '''d-''''' 
|''k'ant'' '''v-'''eza '''v-'''u 'the boy is heavy'
|''k'entii'' '''d-'''eza '''d-'''u 'the boys are heavy'
|-
| 2. y-class
|''zuda'' (woman)|| '''''y-''''' || '''''b-''''' / '''''d-''''' 
|''zuda'' '''y'''-eza '''y'''-u 'the woman is heavy'
|''zudari'' '''b-'''eza '''b-'''u 'the women are heavy
|-

|''ph'āgal'' '''y'''-eza '''y'''-u 'the rabbit is heavy'
|''ph'āgalash'' '''y'''-eza '''y'''-u 'the rabbits are heavy'
|-
| 4. d-class 
|''naž'' (oak)|| '''''d-''''' || '''''d-''''' 
|''naž'' '''d'''-eza '''d'''-u 'the oak is heavy'
|''niežnash'' '''d'''-eza '''d'''-u 'the oaks are heavy'
|-
| 5. b-class 
|''mangal'' (scythe)|| '''''b-''''' || '''''b-''''' / '''Ø-''' 
|''mangal'' '''b-'''eza '''b-'''u 'the scythe is heavy'
|''mangalash'' '''b-'''eza '''b-'''u 'the scythes are heavy'
|-
| 6. b-class II 
|''ˤaž'' (apple)|| '''''b-'''''|| '''''d-''''' 
|''ˤaž'' '''b-'''eza '''b'''-u 'the apple is heavy'
|''ˤežash'' '''d-'''eza '''d-'''u 'the apples are heavy'
|}

When a noun denotes a human being, it usually falls into v- or y-Classes (1 or 2). Most nouns referring to male entities fall into the v-class, whereas Class 2 contains words related to female entities. Thus ''lūlaxuo'' (a neighbour) is class 1, but takes v- if a male neighbour and y- if a female. In a few words, changing the prefixes before the nouns indicates grammatical gender; thus: ''vоsha'' (brother) → ''yisha'' (sister). Some nouns denoting human beings, however, are not in Classes 1 or 2: ''bēr'' (child) for example is in class 3.

==== Classed adjectives ====
Only a few of Chechen's adjectives index noun class agreement, termed ''classed adjectives'' in the literature. Classed adjectives are listed with the -d class prefix in the romanizations below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A grammar of Chechen|last=Dotton &amp; Doyle Wagner|first=Zura &amp; John|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* деза/d-eza ‘heavy’ 
* довха/d-ouxa ‘hot’ 
* деха/d-iexa ‘long’ 
* дуькъа/d-yq’a ‘thick’ 
* дораха/d-oraxa ‘cheap’ 
* дерстана/d-erstana ‘fat’ 
* дуьткъа/d-ytq’a thin’ 
* доца/d-oca ‘short’ 
* дайн/d-ain ‘light’ 
* дуьзна/d-yzna ‘full’ 
* даьржана/d-aerzhana ‘spread’ 
* доккха/d-oqqa ‘large/big/old’

===Declension===

Whereas [[Indo-European languages]] code noun class and case conflated in the same [[morpheme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Chechen nouns show no gender marking but decline in eight [[Grammatical case|grammatical cases]], four of which are core cases (i.e. [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and [[Dative case|dative]]) in singular and plural. Below the paradigm for "говр" (horse).

The locative still has a few further forms for specific positions

===Verbs===

Verbs do not inflect for  person (except for the special d- prefix for the 1st and 2nd persons plural), only for number and tense, aspect, mood. A minority of verbs exhibit agreement prefixes, and these agree with either their subject (intransitive verbs) or with their objects (transitive verbs), with the important note that verbs in compound continuous tenses have the auxiliary verb (-u, to be) agree with the subject and the main verb in participial form agree with the object, provided that the subject is left in the absolutive case (unmarked). If the subject of a transitive verb is marked ergative case, then the auxiliary can only agree with the direct object of the verb.

Example of verbal agreement in intransitive clause with a composite verb:

Со цхьан сахьтехь '''вогІур ву''' (so tsHan saHteH '''voghur vu''') = I (male) will come in one hour

Со цхьан сахьтехь '''йогІур ю''' (so tsHan saHteH '''yoghur yu''') = I (female) will come in one hour

Where the verb's future stem "-огІур" (will come) and the auxiliary "-у" (present tense of 'be') receive the prefix v- for a masculine subject but y- for a feminine subject.

Verbal tenses are formed by ablaut or suffixes, or both (there are five conjugations in total, below is one). Derived stems can be formed by suffixation as well (causative, etc.):

Numerous inscriptions in the [[Georgian script]] are found in mountainous Chechnya, but they are not necessarily in Chechen. Later, the [[Arabic script]] was introduced for Chechen, along with [[Islam]]. The Chechen Arabic alphabet was first reformed during the reign of [[Imam Shamil]], and then again in 1910, 1920 and 1922.

At the same time, the alphabet devised by [[Peter von Uslar]], consisting of Cyrillic, Latin, and Georgian letters, was used for academic purposes. In 1911 it too was reformed but never gained popularity among the Chechens themselves.

The Latin alphabet was introduced in 1925. It was unified with Ingush in 1934, but abolished in 1938.

In 1992, a new Latin Chechen alphabet was introduced, but after the defeat of the secessionist government, the Cyrillic alphabet was restored.

==Vocabulary==
Most Chechen vocabulary is derived from the Nakh branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family, although there are significant minorities of words derived from Arabic (Islamic terms, like "Iman", "Ilma", "Do'a") and a smaller amount from Turkic (like "kuzga", "shish"), belonging to the universal Caucasian stratum of borrowings) and most recently Russian (modern terms, like computer – "kamputar", television – "telvideni", televisor – "telvizar", metro – "metro" etc.).

==History==
Before the [[Caucasian War|Russian conquest]], most writing in Chechnya consisted of Islamic texts and clan histories, written usually in Arabic but sometimes also in Chechen using Arabic script. Those texts were largely destroyed by Soviet authorities in 1944.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Chechen literary language was created after the [[October Revolution]], and the [[Latin script]] began to be used instead of Arabic for Chechen writing in the mid-1920s. In 1938, the [[Cyrillic script]] was adopted, in order to tie the nation closer to Russia. With the declaration of the Chechen republic in 1992, some Chechen speakers returned to the Latin alphabet.

The Chechen diaspora in [[Jordan]], [[Turkey]], and [[Syria]] is fluent but generally not literate in Chechen except for individuals who have made efforts to learn the writing system, and of course the Cyrillic alphabet is not generally known in these countries.

The choice of alphabet for Chechen is politically significant: [[Russia]] prefers the use of Cyrillic, whereas the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|separatists]] preferred Latin.

'''Cosao''' (autonym: ''tsʰo55 sɔ55'';&lt;ref name="Bai2015-1"&gt;Bai (2015:1)&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|搓梭}}) is a [[Loloish language]] of China and Laos. The Cosao call themselves ''tsʰo55 sɔ55'', but are referred to by other ethnic groups as the Paijiao people (排角人).&lt;ref name="Bai2015-1"/&gt; They are officially classified by the Chinese government as ethnic [[Hani people]].&lt;ref name="Bai2015-1"/&gt;

==Demographics==
In China, there are 149 ethnic Cosao people living in the village of Man'gang 曼冈,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=182798&lt;/ref&gt; Mengban Village 勐伴村, Mengban Town 勐伴镇, [[Mengla County]], [[Yunnan]].

In northern Laos, there are 400 ethnic Cosao people in 2 villages in [[Phongsaly Province]], namely Ban Nanli 板南里 (21°45′15″N 102°11′21″E) and Ban Shalue 板沙略 in [[Boun Tay District]] 乌德县 (Bai 2015:2-3). Ban Nanli is the older village of the two, since Cosao residents of Ban Shalue report that their ancestors had migrated from Ban Nanli. The two villages are located about 20 kilometers apart from each other.

There are 550 Cosao people total in both China and Laos. In China, Cosao speakers are classified as ethnic [[Hani people|Hani]].

==Classification==
Cosao is most closely related to the [[Khir language]] of [[Phongsaly Province]], [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="Hsiu2016"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2016. [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1127810 The classification of Cosao: a Lolo-Burmese language of China and Laos]. Presented at the 22nd Himalayan Languages Symposium, Guwahati, India.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Cosao and Khir both belong to the [[Sila language (Laos)|Sila]] language cluster, which includes [[Sila language (Laos)|Sila]], Sida, [[Phusang language|Phusang]], [[Khir language|Khir]], and Cosao.

The '''Fer language''', also ''Dam Fer'' or ''[[Dār Fertit|Fertit]],'' one of several languages called Kara ("Kara of Birao"), is a [[Central Sudanic]] language spoken by some five thousand people in the northern [[Central African Republic]] near the [[Sudan]]ese and [[Chad]]ian borders, in the region known as [[Dar Runga]].

While the [[Ethnologue]] leaves it [[unclassified languages|unclassified]], it appears to be a [[Bongo–Bagirmi languages|Bongo–Bagirmi language]] within the Central Sudanic family ([[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]], Pascal Boyeldieu);&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt; [[Roger Blench]] classifies "Fer" as Bagirmi, but "Kara of Birao" as one of the related [[Kara languages]].

'''Gabriel Contino''', better known as '''Gabriel o Pensador''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Gabriel the Thinker") is a Brazilian rapper, writer, and composer known for his intellectual lyrics which speak of activism, and issues of race, politics, social problems, and the Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magaldi|first=Cristina|title=Adopting imports: New images and alliances in Brazilian popular music of the 1990s|journal=Popular Music|date=October 1999|volume=18|issue=3|pages=21|doi=10.1017/s0261143000008898}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel began his music career when he launched a [[demo tape]] containing the song  "Tô Feliz (Matei o Presidente)" I'm Happy (I killed the President) landing him a contract with [[Sony Music]]. Since then he has released eight albums: ''Ainda É Só o Começo'', ''Quebra-Cabeça'', ''Nádegas a Declarar'', ''Gabriel o Pensador'', ''Seja Você Mesmo (mas não Seja sempre o Mesmo)'', ''MTV ao Vivo'', ''Cavaleiro Andante'' and ''Sem Crise'' (this last one was released independently). Gabriel has also written three books: "Diário Noturno", "Um Garoto Chamado Rorbeto" and "Meu Pequeno Rubro-Negro". "Um Garoto Chamado Rorbeto" won the "Prêmio Jabuti", for best Children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabriel O Pensador leva prêmio Jabuti de melhor livro infantil|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u63192.shtml|publisher=Folha Online: Ilustrada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Coming from a middle-class family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bollig|first=Ben|title=White Rapper/Black Beats: Discovering a Race Problem in the Music of Gabriel o Pensador|journal=Latin American Music Review|date=Fall–Winter 2002|volume=23|issue=2|page=19|doi=10.1353/lat.2002.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a unique background among Brazilian rappers, Gabriel, the son of a well known journalist in [[Brazil]], hit fame in 1992 with the song "Tô Feliz (Matei o Presidente)" ("I'  m happy, I've killed the president"), the debut single from his first and eponymous album. This song was written in protest of President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] and his corrupt administration. Gabriel's mother was Collor's press secretary.&lt;ref name="Gabriel o Pensador"&gt;[http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/en/Artists/Artists.asp?Status=ARTISTA&amp;Nu_Artista=232 Gabriel o Pensador&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The same album also yielded other hits, including "Lôrabúrra" ("Dumb Blonde", shortened) and "Retrato de um Playboy" ("Portrait of a Playboy"), bringing hip hop mainstream attention in Brazil by catering to the middle class. Although rapping about everyday life, Gabriel also found time to talk about social injustices with his fourth single, "O Resto do Mundo" ("The Leftovers of the World", a pun on the words "leftovers" and "rest" being the same word), a more downbeat track about homeless life, with a purposefully depressive melody and flow. Gabriel was "notorious for his biting attacks on some of the major ills of Brazilian society: poverty, racism, violence."&lt;ref name="Behague, Gerard 2006"&gt;Behague, Gerard. "Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–95)." ''Latin American Music Review 27'', no.1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

His following albums were also commercially successful, with a careful blend of socially relevant tracks mixed with airwave-minded pop anthems. His third album, ''Quebra-Cabeça'', was released in 1997 and sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="Gabriel o Pensador"/&gt; History-minded, Gabriel was highly influenced by other Brazilian music, including [[bossa nova]], [[samba]] and [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], as well as using hip hop's traditional methods of sampling [[jazz]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] ("2345meia78", for example, sampled [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "Good Times").

In 1994, while touring in Portugal, Gabriel's song "Lavagem cerebral" (Brainwashing) was received with much praise. The piece was accepted as "a strong social critique of Brazilian society and of the ideology of the dominating classes."&lt;ref name="Behague, Gerard 2006"/&gt;

Besides his native Brazil, Gabriel, o Pensador is also well known in Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, and has worked with Portuguese musicians like [[Sérgio Godinho]] and General D.

===Other projects===
The musician has also released three books: "Diário Noturno" (Brazil and Portugal; poems and short stories), "Um garoto chamado Rorbeto" (Brazil; fiction poetry for children) "Meu Pequeno Rubro-Negro" (Brazil; about children who support [[Clube de Regatas Flamengo|Flamengo]], like himself). He has been a juror on the spelling bee contest "Soletrando" (in its second edition) on the program [[Luciano Huck|Caldeirão do Huck]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portal151.com.br/salaimprensa.php?2011/10/23/gabriel-o-pensador-a-estrela-da-campanha-pela-regulamenta-o-da-conven-o-151.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Concerned about the truancy among a group of boys he helped in [[Rocinha]], in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|, Rio de Janeiro]], Gabriel put his hands to work and created an NGO called "Pensando Junto"([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Thinking Together''), an organization serving a social, educational and cultural purpose for children and youth in the community of Rocinha, providing its participants with access to culture, education, leisure, food, medical, dental and psychological care. The organization offers tutoring and courses for a group of underprivileged children in the Rocinha district, located in Gabriel's hometown of Rio de Janeiro, where he still lives in today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redação Tititi|title=Gabriel O Pensador tem ONG que oferece reforço escolar|url=http://educarparacrescer.abril.com.br/amigos-educar/gabriel-pensador-529796.shtml|publisher=Educar Para Crescer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ong Pensando Junto (Gabriel O Pensador) |url=http://www.rocinha.org/ongs/view.asp?id=1444 |publisher=Rocinha.ORG |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017130809/http://www.rocinha.org/ongs/view.asp?id=1444 |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel is also a member of the Dreams Can Be Foundation, a nonprofit charitable supporting organization and a Brazilian NGO dedicated to aiding street children and impoverished youth in Brazil, working in partnership with local organizations and NGOs to provide: education, moral and social development, humanitarian relief, and the offering of opportunities where there were none before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=http://www.dreamscanbe.org/view/218 |publisher=Dreams Can Be Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017175504/http://www.dreamscanbe.org/view/218 |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hamzanama.jpg|thumb|The ''Hamzanama'' chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of [[Islam]]. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. This illustration shows the witch Anqarut in the guise of a beautiful young woman, who hopes to seduce the handsome king Malik Iraj, whom she has captured and tied to a tree.]]

It is number 38 in the 7th volume of the ''Hamzanama'', as inscribed between the legs of the man in the bottom center. It depicts a battle scene in which the protagonists Khwajah 'Umar and Hamzah and their armies engage in fierce battle. Originally, the faces were depicted; these were subsequently erased by iconoclasts, and repainted in more recent times.

The '''''Hamzanama''''' ([[Persian Language|Persian]]/[[Urdu Language|Urdu]]: {{lang|fa|حمزه نامه}} ''Hamzenâme'', Epic of Hamza) or '''''Dastan-e-Amir Hamza''''' (Persian/Urdu: {{lang|fa|داستان امیر حمزه}} ''Dâstâne Amir Hamze'', Adventures of [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Amir Hamza]]) narrates the [[legend]]ary exploits of Amir Hamza, an uncle of [[Muhammad]], though most of the stories are extremely fanciful, "a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts".&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the characters of the ''Hamzanama'' are fictitious. In the West the work is best known for the enormous illustrated manuscript commissioned by the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] in about 1562.

The ''Hamzanama'' contains 46 volumes and has approximately 48000 pages. It is said that Dastaan Ameer Hamza was written in the era of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].

The text augmented the story, as traditionally told in dastan performances. The dastan (storytelling tradition) about Amir Hamza persists far and wide up to Bengal and Arakan (Burma), as the [[Mughals]] controlled those territories.&lt;ref&gt;see Asim Roy, 1983, ''The Islamic Syncretistic Tradition in Bengal'', Sterling: New Delhi, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–5; The Bustan of Amir Hamzah (the Malay version of Dastan-e-Amir Hamza);Farooque Ahmed, ''The Sangai Express''-Imphal, May 25, 2006 Amir Hamza-book review, ''muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/%3Fp%3D1824''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Akbar's manuscript==
Though the first Mughal Emperor, [[Babur]], described the ''Hamzanama'' as "one long far-fetched lie; opposed to sense and nature",&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 60&lt;/ref&gt; his grandson [[Akbar]], who came to the throne at the age of fourteen, greatly enjoyed it.  He commissioned his court workshop to create an illustrated manuscript of the ''Hamzanama'' early in his reign (he was by then about twenty), which was conceived on such an unusually large scale that it took fourteen years, from about 1562 to 1577, to complete.  Apart from the text, it included 1400 full page [[Mughal miniature]]s of an unusually large size, nearly all painted on paper, which were then glued to a cloth backing.  The work was bound in 14 volumes.  After the early pages, where various layouts were experimented with, one side of most folios has a painting, about 69&amp;nbsp;cm x 54&amp;nbsp;cm (approx. 27 x 20&amp;nbsp;inches) in size, done in a fusion of [[Persian miniature|Persian]] and Mughal styles. On the other side is the text in [[Persian language|Persian]] in [[Nasta'liq script]], arranged so that the text is opposite the matching picture in most openings of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the commission was completely unprecedented, and stretched even the huge imperial workshop.  According to contemporary accounts, about thirty main artists were used, and over a hundred men worked on the various aspects of the book in all.  According to Badauni and Shahnawaz Khan the work of preparing the illustrations was supervised initially by Mir Sayyid Ali and subsequently by Abdus Samad, the former possibly being replaced as head of the workshop because the pace of production was too slow.  After seven years only four volumes were completed, but the new head was able to galvanize production and complete the ten volumes in another seven years, without any loss of quality. Indeed, "the later pages are the most exciting and innovative in the work".&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Colophon (publishing)#Production notes|colophon]] of this manuscript is still missing. None of the folios of this manuscript so far found is signed, though many have been attributed to different artists.  Compared to Akbar's ''[[Tutinama]]'', a smaller commission begun and completed while the ''Hamzanama'' commission was in progress, the manuscript shows a much greater fusion of the styles of Indian and [[Persian miniature]]s.  Though the elegance and finish may seem closer to Persian works, the compositional style and narrative drama owe more to Indian tradition.  Between them, these two manuscripts are the key works in the formation of the [[Mughal miniature]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a little over a hundred of the paintings survive.  The largest group of 61 images is in the [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna]] (Österreichisches Museum für angewandte Kunst or MAK), with the rest spread over many collections. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] possess 27 images, bought in [[Kashmir]], and the [[British Museum]] in London has one.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 189; [http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/hamzanama/ Titley says "only just over one hundred of the paintings have survived", while the V&amp;A says "about 140", but they are counting fragments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/scene_from_hamzanama,_painting.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018145357/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/scene_from_hamzanama,_painting.aspx |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MAK organized in 2009 the exhibition ''GLOBAL:LAB, Art as a Message.

==Other versions==

The ''Dastan-e-Amir Hamza'' existed in several other illustrated manuscript versions. One version by Navab Mirza Aman Ali Khan Ghalib Lakhnavi was printed in 1855 and published by the Hakim Sahib Press, Calcutta, India. This version was later embellished by Abdullah Bilgrami and published by the Naval Kishore Press, Lucknow, in 1871.  Two English language translations have been published. The first is available in an expanded version on the website of the translator Frances Pritchett, of Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pritchett|first=Frances|title=The Romance Tradition in Urdu: The Adventures from Dastan-e Amir Hamza|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/hamzah/index.html|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pritchett's former student at Columbia University, Pasha Mohamad Khan, who currently teaches at McGill University, researches qissa/dastan (romances) and the art of dastan-goi (storytelling), including the ''Hamzanama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/islamicstudies/people/tenure-stream-professors/pasha-m-khan|title=Pasha M. Khan {{!}} Institute of Islamic Studies - McGill University|website=www.mcgill.ca|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Musharraf Ali Farooqi]], a Pakistani-Canadian author, translated the Ghalib Lakhnavi/Abdulla Bilgriami version into English.

A Pakistani author [[Maqbool Jahangir]] wrote ''Dastan-e-Amir Hamza'' for children in 
Urdu language. His version contains 10 volumes and was published by [[Ferozsons]] (also Ferozsons Publishers).

The story is also performed in [[wayang|Indonesian puppet theatre]], where it is called ''Wayang Menak''.  Here, Hamzah is also known as Wong Agung Jayeng Rana or Amir Ambyah.

'''"I am Error"''' is a quote from the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[Video game|game]] ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''. The quote is spoken by a villager, apparently named Error, in the town of Ruto. In the original Japanese version of the game, the line is {{nihongo||オレノナハ エラー ダ...|Ore no na wa Erā da...}}, which translates to "My name is Error...".

The unlikely character name is widely believed to have been a programmer's in-joke, since the game also features a similar looking character named {{nihongo||バグ|Bagu}}, meaning [[software bug]]. In computing, a bug is a flaw in the programming code. Error and Bug are thus assumed to form a comical, in-universe parallel. In the English version, the name ''Erā'' was translated, but the name ''Bagu'' was not. Many gamers therefore missed the joke and variously believed the "I am Error" phrase to be a mistranslation, a misspelling, or an actual [[error message]].

The phrase has since become part of the NES folklore and became an early [[Internet meme]] around 2000. It has been referenced in a number of games, including ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'', and ''[[Guacamelee!]]''.

==Origin==
''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'' was released in Japan on 14 January 1987, and internationally in late 1988. The player controls [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who travels through Hyrule in his quest to rescue [[Princess Zelda]]. Early in the game, Link arrives in the town of Ruto, where he can enter a house inhabited by a bearded man with purple attire. If the player approaches him, he announces: "I AM ERROR."

Many puzzled gamers believed the cryptic phrase to be a translation mistake or a [[glitch]] within the game, but it is actually neither. The line is a correct English translation of the original Japanese text {{nihongo||オレノナハ エラー ダ...|Ore no na wa Erā da...}}, of which a more precise translation would be "My name is Error...".{{Refn | group=nb | Due to space considerations, the original Japanese version of this line was rendered in single-byte [[katakana]] rather than double-byte [[Shift JIS]] characters as would be expected for standard Japanese writing.}}&lt;ref name="Mandelin"&gt;{{Cite web | first=Clyde | last=Mandelin | title=What’s up with The “I am Error” Guy in Zelda II? | url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/whats-up-with-the-i-am-error-guy-in-zelda-ii/ | work=Legends of Localization | date=2013-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113095058/https://legendsoflocalization.com/whats-up-with-the-i-am-error-guy-in-zelda-ii/ | archivedate=2018-01-13 | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the character does not say anything else. However, when the player advances to the harbor town of Mido, a man there advises Link to "Ask Error of Ruto about the Palace". If the player then goes back to Error, he provides Link with a clue about how to gain access to the Island Palace, the game's third dungeon.

While no official explanation from Nintendo exists regarding the origin of the ''Erā''/Error character, his name is widely believed to have been an in-joke from the game's programmers. Aside from Error, the game also features a character named {{nihongo||バグ|Bagu}}, meaning "[[Software bug|&amp;#91;software&amp;#93; bug]]". ''Bagu''/Bug lives near Error, residing in a house hidden in a forest south of Ruto. The two characters look identical, except that Error wears a purple tunic, while Bug's tunic is red. It is therefore assumed that one of the developers named one character Error and another one Bug, so as having the two men form a humorous thematic connection within the game's universe.&lt;ref name="Mandelin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Altice"&gt;{{Cite book | first=Nathan | last=Altice | title=I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer / Entertainment System Platform | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | series=Platform Studies | date=2015 | pages=1-2 | isbn=9780262328401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media | title=Let's Play Zelda II #2 - I Am Error | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgPrbE0d18s | date=2013-05-29 | format=[[YouTube]] video | publisher=BaltisMC}} See 2:30 for Error and 6:34 for Bagu.&lt;/ref&gt; When the game was translated to English, the name ''Erā'' was (correctly) translated to Error, but the name ''Bagu'' was not translated to Bug, leading ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' to conclude: "In reality, then, ''Bagu'' is the mistake, because his name was translated wrongly and should have been Bug. So there."&lt;ref name="ONM"&gt;{{Cite web | first=Thomas | last=East | title=22 classic gaming mistakes |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/44941/features/22-classic-gaming-mistakes/?page=2 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | date=2012-12-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223025146/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/44941/features/22-classic-gaming-mistakes/?page=2 | archivedate=2012-12-23 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translator [[Clyde Mandelin]] wrote that the "I am Error" quote is often incorrectly believed to be a translation mistake, and is even considered "one of the biggest mistranslations of early NES games", even though it is not actually a mistranslation.&lt;ref name="Mandelin" /&gt; Another incorrect notion about Error is that his name is a typo and should have been Errol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Aaron | last=Kaluszka | title=A Legacy of Personality: The Characters of the Legend of Zelda | url=https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/26431/a-legacy-of-personality-the-characters-of-the-legend-of-zelda-error-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link | work=Nintendo World Report | date=2011-05-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005303/https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/26431/a-legacy-of-personality-the-characters-of-the-legend-of-zelda-error-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link | archivedate=2014-05-02 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gera"&gt;{{Cite web | first=Emily | last=Gera | title=Oddest Character Names in Games |url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/oddest_character_names_in_games.html | work=VideoGamer.com | date=2010-12-16 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005303/https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/26431/a-legacy-of-personality-the-characters-of-the-legend-of-zelda-error-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link | archivedate=2014-05-02 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Kyle | title=MAJORA’S MEMES – I AM ERROR | url=https://www.zeldadungeon.net/majoras-memes-i-am-error/ | work=Zelda Dungeon | date=2013-10-15 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112184829/https://www.zeldadungeon.net/majoras-memes-i-am-error/ | archivedate=2018-01-12 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siliconera" /&gt; The original Japanese text proves this wrong though. The reason for the phrase often being considered a translation or spelling mistake is likely because many early games from the 1980s and 90s, including [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|the first ''Zelda'' game]], were rife with mistranslations and poor English prose ('[[Engrish]]').&lt;ref name="Altice" /&gt; A well known example of this is "[[All your base are belong to us]]" from ''[[Zero Wing]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Ben_Huh"&gt;{{Cite web | first=Ben | last=Huh | title=10 classic memes that owned the Internet |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/11/opinion/10-classic-internet-memes/index.html | work=[[CNN]] | date=2014-03-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313042950/http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/11/opinion/10-classic-internet-memes/index.html | archivedate=2014-03-13 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Around 2000, "I am Error" became an early [[Internet meme]]. According to [[Ben Huh]], founder of [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|Cheezburger Inc.]], the meme was inspired by the successful "[[All your base are belong to us]]" meme, which in turn inspired a number of memes based on '[[Engrish]]' quotes from old games, such as "A Winner is You" (from the NES game ''[[Pro Wrestling (NES video game)|Pro Wrestling]]'').&lt;ref name="Ben_Huh" /&gt; The "All your base" joke is believed to have sprung up in 1998 and surged in popularity in 2000-2001, giving some indication of when the "I am Error" meme must have originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Time Line - All Your Base Are Belong to Us | url=http://www.frogstar.com/content/time-line-all-your-base-are-belong-us | work=Frogstar.com | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118094714/http://www.frogstar.com:80/content/time-line-all-your-base-are-belong-us | archivedate=2010-02-23 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a minor [[Non-player character|NPC]], Error has become part of the NES folklore and has been mentioned in several media. For example, VideoGamer's Emily Gera included him in a list of the "oddest character names in games", describing him as "[p]ossibly one of the most well known minor characters of all time".&lt;ref name="Gera" /&gt; [[GamesRadar+]] included his phrase in a list of the 40 most repeated quotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Tyler | last=Wilde | title=The 40 most repeated game quotes | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-40-most-repeated-game-quotes/?page=2 | work=[[GamesRadar+]] | date=2012-06-23 | accessdate=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] mentioned the phrase in an article discussing poor translation in video games, incorrectly calling it a 'translation oddity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Gamespot Staff | title=Un-Valentine's Day: Game Stuff We Love to Hate | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/un-valentines-day-game-stuff-we-love-to-hate/1100-6165750/ | work=[[GameSpot]] | date=2007-02-14 | accessdate=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] included it in their list of the worst in-game quotes at number two. The editor joked that the 'mystery' of Error "ranked up with [[Sasquatch]] and the [[Loch Ness Monster]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=IGN Staff | title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst In-Game Quotes |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/04/19/top-10-tuesday-worst-in-game-quotes | work=[[IGN]] | date=2006-04-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720212006/http://www.ign.com:80/articles/2006/04/19/top-10-tuesday-worst-in-game-quotes | archivedate=2014-07-20 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''{{'}}s Brett Staebell called Error a "pioneer in game humorology", and used the quote as the subtitle for his article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Brett | last=Staebell | title=A Comedy of Errors |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_220/6552-A-Comedy-of-Errors.3 | work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] | date=2009-09-22 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091315/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_220/6552-A-Comedy-of-Errors.3 | archivedate=2016-03-04 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' review for ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'' noted that the game has "an 'I AM ERROR'-esque script", likening the game's garbled translation to the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Morgan | last=Sleeper | title=Castlevania II: Simon's Quest | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/castlevania_ii_simons_quest_nes | work=[[Nintendo Life]] | date=2014-01-22 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905112713/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/castlevania_ii_simons_quest_nes | archivedate=2017-09-05 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From approximately 2012 to 2015, the [[404 page]] of nintendo.co.uk stated "I AM ERROR", along with a picture of the character.&lt;ref&gt;Archived versions of the page: [https://archive.fo/https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOTFOUND 1], [https://archive.fo/https://www.nintendo.co.uk/404.html 2].&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]], the Nintendo Treehouse's presentation of ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' displayed an error page based on the "I am Error" scene after experiencing technical difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edCQDRuL8Dk&amp;t=28m37s | title=Nintendo Treehouse: Live @ E3 2014 -- Day 2: Super Smash Bros. for Wii U | date=2014-06-12 | format=[[YouTube]] video | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | time=28:37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[MIT Press]] published a platform studies on the Nintendo Famicom / Entertainment System, titled "I Am Error".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Altice |first=Nathan |date=May 2015 |title=I Am Error |url= |location=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/i-am-error |publisher=MIT Press |page= |isbn=9780262028776 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearances in other video games===
''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' (2007) features a boss battle against a character named Fracktail, a robotic dragon.

==Dialects==
Ingush is not divided into dialects with the exception of Galain-Chazh (native name: Галайн-ЧӀаж), which is considered to be transitional between Chechen and Ingush.

==Grammar==
Ingush is a [[nominative–accusative language]] in its [[syntax]], though it has [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johanna Nichols]], ''Case in Ingush Syntax'', and Johanna Nichols,''Ingush Grammar'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010). {{ISBN|0-520-09877-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case===
The most recent and in-depth analysis of the language&lt;ref&gt;[[Johanna Nichols]], ''Ingush Grammar''.&lt;/ref&gt; shows eight cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[allative case|allative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[lative case|lative]], and [[comparative case|comparative]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Cases !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative   || -⌀            || -azh / -ii, -i&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Ergative     || -uo / -z, -aa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || -asha / –azh
|-
| Genitive     || -a, -n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;        || -ii, -i
|-
| Dative       || -na, aa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;       || -azh-ta
|-
| Allative     || -ga           || -azh-ka
|-
| Instrumental || -ca           || -azh-ca
|- 
| Lative       || -gh           || -egh
|-
| Comparative  || -l            || -el
|}
&lt;small&gt;
# ''-uo'' is the only productive form. ''-z'' appears with personal names, kin terms, and other nouns referring to humans. ''-aa'' occurs with some declensions and is increasingly productive in colloquial use.
# Allomorph after vowels
# The choice of ''-azh'' vs. ''-ii'' is lexically determined for the nominative, but other cases are predictable.
&lt;/small&gt;

===Numerals===
Like many Northeast Caucasian languages, Ingush uses a [[vigesimal]] system, where numbers lower than twenty are counted as in a base-ten system, but higher decads are base-twenty.

===Word order===
In Ingush, "for main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new ones, [[v2 word order|verb-second]] order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the clause".&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Johanna. (2011). ''Ingush Grammar''. Berkeley: The University of California Press. Pp. 678ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">'''Joshua Heschel Zoref''' (1633–1700) was a 17th-century ascetic, and an important figure in the [[Jews of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[Sabbatean]] movement.  During the messianic fervor of 1666, he claimed to experience visions similar to those of [[Ezekiel]]. He, like [[Judah Leib Prossnitz]] also, considered himself to be possessed of the role of [[Messiah ben Joseph]], with [[Shabbatai Tzvi]] playing the role of [[Messiah ben David]].

Shortly thereafter he began transcribing his visions into five books.  What has survived of these works show them to be entirely built upon the numerical speculations ([[gematriah]]) of [[Nathan Nata Spira]].  Some parts of this work, named ''Sefer Ha-Zoref'', came to [[Nathan ben Levi]], while others came into the possession of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], who evidently valued them highly while unaware of their origins.

Scholem (1974) contains a lengthier biography.

[[File:Koh-i-noor 1.1.jpg|thumb|right|Koh-i-Noor products]]
'''Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth a.s.''' is a Czech manufacturer and one of the world's largest producers and distributors of art supplies, writing equipment and stationery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koh-i-noor.cz/en/the-company-today KOH-I-NOOR HARDTMUTH]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1790 by [[Joseph Hardtmuth]] of [[Austria]]. In 1802, the company patented the first [[Pencil|pencil lead]] made from a combination of [[kaolin]] and [[graphite]].

In 1848, Joseph's sons, Karl and Ludwig, took over the family business, and the production was relocated to the [[Bohemia]]n town of [[České Budějovice|Budweis]], within the current [[Czech Republic]]. The products were given awards in many world exhibitions, including in 1855 in New York City, 1856, 1900 and 1925 in Paris, 1862 in London, 1882 in Vienna and 1905 in Milan.

At the 1889 [[World's fair|World Fair]] [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|in Paris]], the Hardtmuth's displayed their pencils rebranded as "Koh-I-Noor Hardtmuth". Each pencil was encased in a yellow [[Cedar wood|cedar]]-wood barrel. The inspiration for the name was the famous [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond (Persian for "Mountain of Light"), part of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] of the United Kingdom, and the largest diamond in the world at the time.

After the [[Second World War]], Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth became a state-owned company, before again becoming privately held in 1992. Since 2007, it has been a member of the Czech parent company KOH-I-NOOR Holding a.s. The company has production facilities in more than 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koh-i-noorholding.eu/ KOH-I-NOOR holding, about the company]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a contract manufacturer of small [[Injection molding|injection-moulded]] plastic products. Koh-i-Noor was a partner in making [[Jiří Barta]]'s 2009 animated feature ''In the Attic'', and its pencils appear frequently throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bioillusion.com/en/feature-films/in-the-attic/about-the-film/about-the-film.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://czechproperty.blogspot.com/2010/03/jiri-barta-na-pude.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lath.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Lath]] seen from the back with brown coat oozing through]]

'''Lath and plaster''' is a building process used to finish mainly interior dividing [[wall]]s and ceilings. It consists of narrow strips of [[wood]] ([[laths]]) which are nailed horizontally across the [[wall stud]]s or ceiling [[joists]] and then coated in [[plaster]]. The technique derives from an earlier, more primitive, process called [[wattle and daub]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Paul (2006). Built to meet needs : cultural issues in vernacular architecture (First ed). Architectural, Amsterdam ; London&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] the laths were generally sawn, but in the [[United Kingdom]] and its colonies [[Wood splitting|riven or split]] hardwood laths, of random lengths and sizes, were often used. Splitting the timber along its grain greatly improved strength and durability. In some areas of the U.K. [[Reed mat (plastering)|reed mat]] was also used as a lath. Lath and plaster largely fell out of favour in the U.K. after the introduction of [[plasterboard]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="On the level"&gt;Jeff Howell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/jeffhowell/3349760/On-the-level-is-the-old-plaster-best.html ''On the level: is the old plaster best?''], The Telegraph (London), May 10, 2006. Retrieved 2012-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] it remained in use until [[drywall]] began to replace the process in the 1950's.

==Description==
[[File:Lathwork and plaster.jpg|thumb|Partially-exposed wallpapered lath and plaster illustrating the technique.  Example from the [[Winchester Mystery House]], constructed between 1884 and 1922]]
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
The wall or ceiling finishing process begins with wood [[lath]]s. These are narrow strips of [[wood]], or split boards, nailed horizontally across the [[wall stud]]s or ceiling [[joist]]s. Each wall frame is covered in lath, tacked at the studs.  The lath is typically about one inch (2.5 cm) wide by four feet (1.22 meters) long by {{convert|1/4|in}} thick. Each horizontal course of lath is spaced about {{convert|3/8|in}} away from its neighboring courses.

Temporary lath guides are then placed vertically to the wall, usually at the studs. [[Plaster]] is then applied, typically using a wooden board as the application tool.  The applier drags the board upward over the wall, forcing the plaster into the gaps between the lath and leaving a layer on the front the depth of the temporary guides, typically about {{convert|1/4|in}}. A helper feeds new plaster onto the board, as the plaster is applied in quantity.  When the wall is fully covered, the vertical lath "guides" are removed, and their "slots" are filled in, leaving a fairly uniform undercoat.

In three coat plastering it is standard to apply a second layer in the same fashion, leaving about a half inch of rough, sandy plaster (called a ''brown coat'' or ''browning'' (UK)). A smooth, white finish coat goes on last.  After the plaster is completely dry, the walls are ready to be painted.  In this article's photo ("lath seen from the back...") the curls of plaster are called ''keys'' and are necessary to keep the plaster on the lath. Traditional [[Lime plaster|lime based mortar/plaster]] often incorporates [[horsehair]] which reinforces the plasterwork, thereby helping to prevent the keys from breaking away.

Eventually the wood laths became less common, and were replaced with ''rock lath'' (also known as "button board"), which is a type of [[gypsum]] wall board with holes spaced regularly across it, usually in sheets sized {{convert|2|ft|in}} by {{convert|4|ft|in}} (60 cm by 120 cm).  The purpose of the four-foot length is so that the sheet of lath reaches exactly across three wall studs, which are spaced {{convert|16|in}} apart on center (United States [[building code]] standard measurements). The holes serve the same purpose as the spaces between the wood lath strips, allowing plaster to ooze through the board when the plaster is applied, making the keys to hold the plaster to the wall board.

In addition to ''rock lath'', there were various types of ''metal lath'' which is categorized according to weight, type of ribbing, and whether the lath is [[galvanize]]d or not.  Metal lathing was spaced across a 13.5 inch center, attached by tie wires using lathers' nippers.  Sometimes, the mesh was dimpled to be self-[[furring]].

Lath and plaster has been mostly replaced with solid [[drywall]] or [[plasterboard]] (also a type of gypsum wall board, although a bit thicker), since it is faster and less expensive to install.

==Advantages==
An advantage of using lath is for ornamental or unusual shapes. For instance, building a rounded wall would be difficult if drywall were used exclusively, as drywall is not flexible enough to allow tight radii. Wire mesh often used for exterior Stucco is also found in combination or replacement of lath and plaster which serves similar purpose.

Traditional lath and plaster has superior sound-proofing qualities when used with lime plaster (which is denser than modern gypsum board).&lt;ref name="On the level" /&gt;

In many historic buildings lath and plaster ceilings have a major role for the prevention of fire spread. "They are critical to the protection of horizontal elements such as timber joisted floors, including the flooring on top, which in terms of fire performance is often in a poor condition due to the presence of gaps."&lt;ref&gt;"Fire Resistance of Historic Fabric" by Peter Jackman - http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/fireresist/fire_resistance.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis Chevreux''' (3 October 1855, Paris – 8 January 1935, [[Thézy-Glimont]]), commonly known as '''Louis de Beaufront''', was a major influence in the development of [[Ido (language)|Ido]], an [[international auxiliary language]]. Beaufront was initially an advocate of [[Esperanto]] and was largely responsible for its early diffusion in western [[Europe]] as well as one of its first French proponents.

==Work==
Beaufront first discovered Esperanto in 1888 and in 1889 founded Société Pour la Propagation de l'Espéranto (SPPE). In 1900, he wrote the ''Commentaire sur la grammaire espéranto''.

He was chosen to represent unmodified [[Esperanto]] before the Committee of the [[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]], attending the meetings of the Delegation Committee in October, 1907. While ostensibly representing [[Esperanto]] before the Committee, he was secretly secondary author after [[Louis Couturat]] of the original Ido project which impressed the Delegation Committee and led to the reform of [[Esperanto]] by the Committee's Permanent Commission. Letters that are kept in the [[Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum]] in [[Vienna]] show that he denied any co-authorship of Ido. Beaufront remained a proponent of Ido thereafter, and wrote the influential Ido grammar ''Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza'', published in 1925.

His personality was an unusual one. He claimed to be a Marquis, and claimed to have had an English grandmother, but there is no evidence for either of these claims.

He appears as a character in [[Joseph Skibell]]'s 2010 novel, ''A Curable Romantic''.

'''Lumber hooker''' is a nautical term for a [[Great Lakes]] ship designed to carry her own deck load of lumber and to tow one or two [[barges]].  The barges were [[schooner barge]]s: large old [[schooners]] stripped of their [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and running gear to carry large cargoes of lumber.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book| last= Boyer | first = Dwight| title= Great Stories of the Great Lakes: Thrilling Tales of Tragedy, Humor, and Heroism| publisher = Freshwater Press, Inc. | year=  1996| location = Cleveland, Ohio, USA| isbn = 0-912514-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1991 Latvian Mix Franked Cover.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Registered cover with mixed franking of two issuing entities. 5 kopecks Soviet stationery, 5 kopecks Soviet postage stamp and 10 kopecks Latvian postage stamp, postmarked 27 November 1991 — just a few months after the recognition of Latvian independence by the Soviet Union.]]

In [[philately]], a '''mixed [[franking]]''' is an occurrence of [[postage stamp]]s of more than one country or issuing entity on a single [[Cover (philately)|cover]] — or the occurrence of postage stamps of more than one [[currency]] of a country or issuing identity on a single cover. Since nearly all countries of the world have agreed to deliver each other's [[mail]], it is unusual to need more than the stamps of the originating country; valid mixed frankings are uncommon and valued by collectors.

Before the advent of the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1874, sending international mail was quite an adventure; it might be necessary to affix the stamps of the destination country in addition to those of the origin, and in the worst cases, possibly for several other countries along the way.  Sometimes the letter was held until the recipient brought stamps, they were affixed and cancelled, and the result handed to the recipient.  Since this only happened during the first few decades of stamp usage, and only for the few letters that were sent great distances, very few covers have survived.  For some combinations, only single examples have survived, and command spectacular prices among collectors.

Another form of mixed franking occurs in transitional periods, either as a way to help the public use up the stamps of a defunct government, or involuntarily as a propaganda tool.

An example of involuntary mixed franking is when [[Germany]] took over [[Austria]] in the [[Anschluss]] in 1938; during the several months while Austrian stamps were still accepted, Austrians sending mail to Germany were required to include a German stamp on the envelope.

Sometimes illegitimate mixed frankings occur when a postal user adds another country's stamps to an envelope just for fun.  Many countries' postal regulation require clerks to refuse to handle these, even if the correct postage of the country is present, because they slow down the sorting process, but such covers can still get through the system.

'''Dr. Mohua Mukherjee''' (born August 1952) is a social activist and an author from [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]]. She was schooled at Gokhale Memorial School, Kolkata. She married Alok Mukherjee in 1974. Her achievements include social activism, writing, documentary and short film making, artistry, theatre work and socio-economic research about tribes of [[India]]. She is also founder of a [[non-governmental organization]] named "Sanyog Audio Visual and Welfare Society".

==Career==
After marriage she took a freelance job at Hotel Oberoi Grand–Kolkata as an interior decorator. She joined St. Thomas Kidderpore as an art teacher.

He was born in [[Mundur (gram panchayat)|Mundur]] in [[Palghat]] to parents Manakulangara Govinda Pisharody and Anupurath Madhavi Pisharasyar. He completed schooling from Parali High School and mastered in English literature from [[Government Victoria College, Palakkad]]. He obtained a [[B.Ed]] degree from [[NSS College, Ottapalam]] and worked as a teacher in Palakkad VVP High School, Palakkad PMG High School and Chittoor Training School.

He wrote his first short story "Kannalichekkan" (Cow boy) in 1956 which was published in ''Navayugam''. The same year another story titled "Ambalavasikal" (Temple workers) was published in the ''[[Mathrubhumi Illustrated Weekly]]''. He had written more than 200 short stories and three novels. His stories are renowned for their realistic portrayal of life in Palakkad villages, focusing on the transformational crisis of an agrarian society.

Its relationship to the other Micronesian languages is not well understood.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Nauruan has 16–17 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s.  Nauruan makes phonemic contrasts between velarized and palatalized labial consonants.  Velarization is not apparent before long back vowels and palatalization is not apparent before non-low front vowels.&lt;ref name="Nathan"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974|p=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

|-
!colspan=2|[[Rhotic consonant|Rhotic]]
| || ||{{IPA|r}} {{IPA|rʲ}} || || ||
|}

Voiceless stops are [[geminate]]d and nasals also contrast in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974|pp=481–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dental stops {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} become {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} respectively before high front vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974|pp=481–482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximants become fricatives in "emphatic pronunciation." {{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974}} transcribes them as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|j}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|w}}}} but also remarks that they contrast with the non-syllabic allophones of the high vowels.

Depending on stress, {{IPA|/r/}} may be a flap or a trill. The precise phonetic nature of {{IPA|/rʲ/}} is unknown.  {{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974}} transcribes it as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|r̵}}}} and speculates that it may pattern like palatalized consonants and be partially devoiced.

Between a vowel and word-final {{IPA|/mˠ/}}, an epenthetical {{IPA|[b]}} appears.&lt;ref name="Nathan" /&gt;

===Vowels===
There are 12 phonemic vowels (six long, six short).  In addition to the allophony in the following table from {{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974}}, a number of vowels reduce to {{IPA|[ə]}}:&lt;ref name="Nathan_a" /&gt;
&lt;!-- (Nathan 1974) doesn't elaborate on the environmental conditions leading to such allophony --&gt;

|}

Non-open vowels (that is, all but {{IPA|/aa/, /a/, /ɑɑ/ /ɑ/}}) become non-syllabic when preceding another vowel, as in {{IPA|/e-oeeoun/}} → {{IPA|[ɛ̃õ̯ɛ̃õ̯ʊn]}} ('hide').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nathan|1974|p=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===

Stress is on the penultimate syllable when the final syllable ends in a vowel, on the last syllable when it ends in a consonant, and initial with reduplications.&lt;ref name="Nathan_a" /&gt;

== Writing system ==
{{missing information|how the phonemes listed above are represented by the letters listed here|date=June 2017}}
In the Nauruan written language, 17 letters were originally used:
* The five [[vowel]]s: a, e, i, o, u
* Twelve [[consonant]]s: b, d, g, j, k, m, n, p, q, r, t, w

The letters c, f, h, l, s, v, x, y and z were not included. With the growing influence of foreign languages (most of all [[German language|German]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Tok Pisin]] and [[Kiribati language|Kiribati]]) more letters were incorporated into the Nauruan alphabet.  In addition, phonetic differences of a few vowels arose, so that [[I-mutation|umlaut]]s and other similar-sounding sounds were indicated with a [[tilde]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

=== Attempt at language reform of 1938 ===
In 1938 there was an attempt by the Nauruan language committee and [[Timothy Detudamo]] to make the language easier to read for Europeans and Americans. It was intended to introduce as many [[diacritic]]al symbols as possible for the different vowel sounds to state the variety of the Nauruan language{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in writing. It was decided to introduce only a grave accent in the place of the former [[tilde]], so that the umlauts "õ" and "ũ" were replaced by "ò" and "ù". The "ã" was substituted with "e".

Also, "y" was introduced in order to differentiate words with the English "j" (''puji''). Thus, words like ''ijeiji'' were changed to ''iyeyi''. In addition, "ñ" (which represented the [[velar nasal]]) was replaced with "ng", to differentiate the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Ñ]], "bu" and "qu" were replaced with "bw" and "kw" respectively, "ts" was replaced with "j" (since it represented a pronunciation similar to English "j"), and the "w" written at the end of words was removed.

These reforms were only partly carried out: the umlauts "õ" and "ũ" are still written with tildes. However, the letters "ã" and "ñ" are now only seldom used, being replaced with "e" and "ng", as prescribed by the reform. Likewise, the writing of the double consonants "bw" and "kw" has been implemented. Although the "j" took the place of "ts", certain spellings still use "ts." For example, the districts [[Baiti]] and [[Ijuw District|Ijuw]] (according to the reform ''Beiji'' and ''Iyu'') are still written with the old writing style. The "y" has largely become generally accepted.

Today the following 29 Latin letters are used.
* [[Vowel]]s: a, ã, e, i, o, õ, u, ũ
* [[Semivowel]]s: j
* [[Consonant]]s: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ñ, p, q, r, s, t, w, y, z

== Dialects ==
According to a report published in 1937 in Sydney, there was a diversity of dialects until Nauru became a colony of [[Germany]] in 1888, and until the introduction of publication of the first texts written in Nauruan.  The variations were largely so different that people of various [[Districts of Nauru|districts]] often had problems understanding each other completely.  With the increasing influence of foreign languages and the increase of Nauruan texts, the dialects blended into a standardized language, which was promoted through dictionaries and translations by [[Alois Kayser]] and [[Philip Delaporte]].

Today there is significantly less dialectal variation.  In the district of [[Yaren District|Yaren]] and the surrounding area there is an eponymous dialect spoken, which is only slightly different.

==Delaporte's Nauruan Dictionary==
In 1907, [[Philip Delaporte]] published his pocket German-Nauruan [[dictionary]]. [http://www.trussel.com/kir/naudel.htm] The dictionary is small (10.5 × 14&amp;nbsp;cm), with 65 pages devoted to the glossary and an additional dozen to phrases, arranged alphabetically by the [[German language|German]]. Approximately 1650 German words are [[gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]ed in Nauruan, often by phrases or synonymous forms. There are some 1300 'unique' Nauruan forms in the glosses, including all those occurring in phrases, ignoring [[diacritical]] marks. The accents used there are not common; just one accent (the [[tilde]]) is in use today.

== Sample text ==
The following example of text is from the [[Bible]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], 1.1–1.8):

''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Ñaga ã eitsiõk õrig imim, Gott õrig ianweron me eb. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Me eitsiõk erig imin ñana bain eat eb, me eko õañan, mi itũr emek animwet ijited, ma Anin Gott õmakamakur animwet ebõk. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Me Gott ũge, Enim eaõ, me eaõen. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Me Gott ãt iaõ bwo omo, me Gott õekae iaõ mi itũr. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Me Gott eij eget iaõ bwa Aran, me E ij eget itũr bwa Anũbũmin. Ma antsiemerin ma antsioran ar eken ũrõr adamonit ibũm. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Me Gott ũge, Enim tsinime firmament inimaget ebõk, me enim ekae ebõk atsin eat ebõk. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Me Gott eririñ firmament, mõ õ ekae ebõk ñea ijõñin firmament atsin eat ebõk ñea itũgain firmament, mõ ũgan. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Me Gott eij egen firmament bwe Ianweron. Ma antsiemerin ma antsioran ar eke ũrõr karabũmit ibũm.''

It is notable that the Nauruan vocabulary contains a few [[German loanword]]s (e.g. ''Gott'', [[God]]; and ''Firmament'', [[celestial sphere]]), which is traced back to the strong influence of [[Germany|German]] [[missionary|missionaries]].  There are also [[Latin]] loanwords such as "õrig" (from Lat. ''origo'', beginning) that appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">In the theory of [[formal language]]s, '''Ogden's lemma''' (named after William F. Ogden) is a generalization of the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]].

Ogden's lemma states that if a language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is context-free, then there exists some number &lt;math&gt;p\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; may or may not be a pumping length) such that for any string &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of length at least &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and every way of "marking" &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; or more of the positions in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;s = uvwxy&lt;/math&gt;
with strings &lt;math&gt;u, v, w, x,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, such that

#&lt;math&gt;vwx&lt;/math&gt; has at most &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; marked positions,
#&lt;math&gt;vx&lt;/math&gt; has at least one marked position, and
#&lt;math&gt;uv^n wx^n y \in L&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case where every position is marked, Ogden's lemma is equivalent to the pumping lemma for context-free languages. Ogden's lemma can be used to show that certain languages are not context-free in cases where the pumping lemma is not sufficient. An example is the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^i b^j c^k d^l : i = 0 \text{ or } j = k = l\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Ogden's lemma can also be used to prove the [[Ambiguous grammar#Inherently ambiguous languages|inherent ambiguity]] of some languages{{Citation needed|reason=this is not trivial to see and requires a reference|date=September 2017}}.

An '''overline''', '''overscore''', or '''overbar''', is a [[typographical]] feature of a [[horizontal and vertical|horizontal]] line drawn immediately above the text. In [[mathematical notation]], an overline has been used for a long time as a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'', a way of showing that certain symbols belong together. The original use in [[Ancient Greek]] was to indicate compositions of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] as [[Greek numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T. P. (2013). ''How Big is Big and How Small is Small: The Sizes of Everything and Why''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin it indicates [[Roman numeral]]s multiplied by a thousand and it forms medieval abbreviations ([[sigla]]). Marking one or more words with a continuous line above the characters is sometimes called ''[[overstriking]]'', though overstriking generally refers to printing one character on top of an already-printed character.

An overline, that is, a single line above a chunk of text, should not be confused with the [[macron (diacritic)|macron]], a [[diacritical mark]] placed above (or sometimes below) ''individual'' letters. The macron is narrower than the character box.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/dia/diacritics-revised.htm#macron | title=Orthographic diacritics and multilingual computing | publisher=[[University College London]] | date=2001 | accessdate=23 March 2014 | author=[[John C. Wells|Wells, J.C.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[Unicode Consortium]] assign names to characters in their unique fashion and often ignore the established typographical [[terminology]], [[Unicode]] includes two characters {{unichar|00AF|macron}} (formerly {{smallcaps|spacing macron}}) and {{unichar|203E|overline}} that ''both'' look like an overlined [[space (punctuation)|space]] in most fonts, similar to a [[reflection symmetry|mirrored]] [[underscore]] symbol. An overline proper can be encoded as a Unicode diacritic; see [[#Unicode|below]].

==Uses==

===Medicine===
An overbar over a letter is a traditional way of specifying certain [[Latin]] abbreviations. For example, s̅  (s overbar) stands for Latin, ''sine'' (meaning ''without''), c̅  (c overbar) is an abbreviation for Latin, ''cum'' (meaning ''with''), ā (a overbar) stands for Latin, "ante" (meaning "before"), and p̄ (p overbar) stands for Latin, "post" (meaning "after").

===Math and science===

====Vinculum====
In mathematics, an overline can be used as a [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]].

The vinculum can indicate a [[line segment]]:
*&lt;math&gt;\overline{\rm AB}&lt;/math&gt;
The vinculum can indicate a [[repeating decimal]] value:
*{{frac|1|7}} = 0.{{overline|142857}} = 0.1428571428571428571...
When it is not possible to format the number so that the overline is over the digit(s) that repeat, one overline character is placed to the left of the digit(s) that repeat:
*3.¯3 = 3.{{overline|3}} = 3.333333333333...
*3.12¯34 = 3.12{{overline|34}} = 3.123434343434...

Historically, the vinculum was used to group together symbols so that they could be treated as a unit. Today, parentheses are more commonly used for this purpose.

====Statistics====
The overline is &lt;span id="sample mean"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; used to indicate a [[sample mean]]:
*&lt;math&gt;\overline x&lt;/math&gt; is the average value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;

[[Survival function]]s or complementary cumulative distribution functions are often denoted by placing an overline over the symbol for the cumulative:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F}(x) =1-F(x)&lt;/math&gt;
====Negation====
In [[set theory]] and some [[electrical engineering]] contexts, [[negation]] operators can be written as an overline above the term or expression to be negated, for example:

Common set theory notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overline{A \cup B} &amp;\equiv \overline{A} \cap \overline{B} \\
  \overline{A \cap B} &amp;\equiv \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Electrical engineering notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overline{A \cdot B} &amp;\equiv \overline {A} + \overline {B} \\
      \overline{A + B} &amp;\equiv \overline {A} \cdot \overline {B}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
in which implied multiplication, the times (cross) and the dot all mean logical AND, and the plus sign means logical OR.

Both illustrate [[De Morgan's laws]] and its mnemonic, "break the line, change the sign".
====Negative====
In [[common logarithms]] a bar over the characteristic indicates that it is negative whilst the mantissa remains positive. This notation avoids the need for separate tables to convert positive and negative logarithms back to their original numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}0.012\approx-2+0.07918=\bar{2}.07918&lt;/math&gt;
====Reciprocal====
Rarely, a bar over a number or expression means its [[multiplicative inverse]]&lt;ref name="mansfield"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mansfield |first=Daniel, and N. J. Wildberger |title=Plimpton 322 is Babylonian exact sexagesimal trigonometry |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0315086017300691 |journal=Historia Mathematica |doi=10.1016/j.hm.2017.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is more commonly shown as a fraction or negative exponent
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{2l} = 1/(2l) = (2l)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
====Complex numbers====
The overline notation can indicate a [[complex conjugate]] and analogous operations.
*if &lt;math&gt;x = a + ib&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\overline{x} = a - ib.&lt;/math&gt;
====Vector====
In physics, an overline sometimes indicates a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], although [[boldface]] and [[arrow (symbol)|arrows]] are also commonly used:
*&lt;math&gt;\overline x = |x|\hat x&lt;/math&gt;

====Improper rotation====
In [[crystallography]], an overline indicates an [[improper rotation]] or a [[negative number]]:
*&lt;math&gt;\overline 3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]] for a threefold rotoinversion, used in [[crystallography]].
*&lt;math&gt;[\overline 11\overline2]&lt;/math&gt; is the direction with [[Miller index|Miller indices]] &lt;math&gt;h=-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;l=-2&lt;/math&gt;.

====Maximal conductance====
In [[computational neuroscience]], an overline is used to indicate the 'maximal' conductances in [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]]s. This goes back to at least the landmark paper published by Nobel prize winners [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Fielding Huxley]] around 1952.&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{Cite journal

: &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Na}(t)=\bar{g}_\mathrm{Na} m(V_m)^3h(V_m)(V_m-E_\mathrm{Na})&lt;/math&gt;
====Antiparticles====
Overlines are used in subatomic particle physics to [[Antimatter#Notation|denote antiparticles]] for some particles (with the alternate being distinguishing based on electric charge). For example, the proton is denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}}, and its corresponding antiparticle is denoted as {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}.

=== Engineering ===
An [[active low]] signal is designated by an overline, e.g. {{overline|RESET}}, [[Overline#Negation|representing logical negation]].

=== Morse (CW) ===
Some Morse code [[Prosigns for Morse code|prosigns]] can be expressed as two or three characters run together, and an overline is often used to signify this. The most famous is the [[SOS|distress signal]], {{overline|SOS}}.

===Writing===
An overline-like symbol is traditionally used in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text to mark abbreviations and numbers. It has dots at each end and the center. In German it is occasionally used to indicate a pair of letters which cannot both be fitted into the available space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Gräfinnen|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/6388399531/|website=Flickr|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieder zur Weihnachtszeit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Lieder zur Weihnachtszeit (1940)|url=https://fontsinuse.com/uses/11409/lieder-zur-weihnachtszeit-1940|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=26 December 2017|quote=It used to be common to mark omitted double letters with an overbar, especially for 'mm' and 'nn'. These abbreviations come in handy when lyrics have to match the musical notes, see 'da kom[m]t er her'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Morse code]] is written out as text, overlines are used to distinguish [[prosigns for Morse code|prosigns]] and other concatenated character groups from strings of individual characters.

===Linguistics===
[[X-bar theory]] makes use of overbar notation to indicate differing levels of [[syntactic structure]]. Certain structures are represented by adding an overbar to the unit, as in {{overline|X}}. Due to difficulty in typesetting the overbar, the [[prime symbol]] is often used instead, as in X′. Contemporary typesetting software, such as LaTeX, has [[#TeX|made typesetting overbars considerably simpler]]; both prime and overbar markers are accepted usages. Some variants of X-bar notation use a double-bar (or double-prime) to represent phrasal-level units.

X-bar theory derives its name from the overbar. One of the core proposals of the theory was the creation of an intermediate syntactic node between phrasal (XP) and unit (X) levels; rather than introduce a different label, the intermediate unit was marked with a bar.

==Implementations==

===HTML with CSS===

In [[HTML]] using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], the overline is implemented via [[text-decoration]] property: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, results in: {{overline|text}}.
It supports also other typographical features with horizontal lines: [[underline]] (a line below the text) and [[strikethrough]] (a line through the text).

===Unicode===

As mentioned above, Unicode includes two [[graphic character]]s, {{unichar|00AF|macron}} and {{unichar|203E|overline}}. They are [[Unicode equivalence|compatibility equivalent]] to the {{unichar|0020|space|nlink=space (punctuation)}} with non-spacing diacritics {{unichar|0304|combining macron|cwith=◌|nlink=macron (diacritic)}} and {{unichar|0305|combining overline|cwith=◌}} respectively; the latter allows an overline to be placed over any character. As with any [[combining character]], it appears in the same character box as the character that logically precedes it: for example, x̅, compared to x‾. A series of overlined characters usually results in an unbroken line, depending on the font (for example, 1̅2̅3̅).

For East Asian ([[CJK]]) computing, {{unichar|FFE3|fullwidth macron}} is available. Despite the name, Unicode maps this character to both U+203E and U+00AF.&lt;ref name="UnicodeFull"/&gt;

Unicode maps the overline-like character from [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] and [[code page 850]] to the {{unichar|00AF|macron}} symbol mentioned above. In a reversal of its official name (and compatibility decomposition), it is much wider than an actual macron diacritic over most letters, and actually wider than {{unichar|203E|overline}} in most fonts. In [[Microsoft Windows]], U+00AF can be entered with the keystrokes Alt+0175 (where numbers are entered from the [[numeric keypad]]).
In [[GTK+|GTK]]/GTK+, the symbol can be added using the keystrokes {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift|U}} to activate [[Unicode input]], then type "00AF" as the code for the character.

The Unicode character {{unichar|070F|Syriac Abbreviation Mark|nlink=}} is used to mark [[#Writing|Syriac abbreviations and numbers]]. However, several computer environments do not render this line correctly or at all.

===Word processors===
In [[Microsoft Word]], overstriking of text can be accomplished with the &lt;code&gt;EQ \O()&lt;/code&gt; field code. The field code &lt;code&gt;{EQ \O(x,¯)}&lt;/code&gt; produces {{overline|x}} and the field code &lt;code&gt;{EQ \O(xyz,¯¯¯)}&lt;/code&gt; produces {{overline|xyz}}. (Doesn't work in Word 2010; it is necessary to insert MS Equation object).
Windows: Alt+0773 (once before character, one more time after character).

[[LibreOffice]] has direct support for several styles of overline in its "Format / Character / Font Effects" dialog.

Overstriking of longer sections of text, such as in {{overline|123}}, can also be produced in many [[word processing|text processors]] as [[markup language|text markup]] as a special form of understriking.

===TeX===&lt;!--caution: an internal #-link --&gt;
In [[LaTeX]], a text &lt;text&gt; can be overlined with &lt;code&gt;$\overline{\mbox{&lt;text&gt;}}$&lt;/code&gt;. The inner &lt;code&gt;\mbox{}&lt;/code&gt; is necessary to
override the math-mode (here invoked by the dollar signs) which the &lt;code&gt;\overline{}&lt;/code&gt; demands.

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
The '''[[Pemako|Pemakö]] dialect''' ({{bo|t=པདྨ་བཀོད་ཚངས་ལ་སྐད་|w=pad ma bkod btsang la skad}} , also ''Padma bkod skad'') is a dialect of the [[Tshangla language]]. It is the predominant speech in the Pemako region of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and an adjoining contiguous area south of the [[McMahon]] line in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in [[India]]. Though Tshangla is not a [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic language]], it shares many similarities with [[Classical Tibetan]], particularly in its [[vocabulary]]. Many Tibetan loanwords are used in Pemako, due to centuries of close contact with various [[Tibetan people|Tibetan tribes]] in the Pemako area. Pemako Tshangla has undergone tremendous changes due to its isolation and Tibetan influence.

Below appears a table of Tshangla consonants according to Andvik (2010). Non-native phonemes, in parentheses, are contrasted only marginally with native sounds: /ɬ/ is often nativized to /l/; /dz/ becomes /z/; and /ʑ/ becomes /y/.&lt;ref name=Andvik&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sc9XZ2jJGgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Grammar of Tshangla |volume=10 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |series=Tibetan Studies Library |first=Erik E. |last=Andvik |year=2010 |isbn=90-04-17827-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–12}}

==Formation==
Ever since [[Pemako]] was first opened to outside world thousands of people from different walks of life settled in the region, among them, earliest were the [[Tshangla]] people from [[Trashigang District|Eastern Bhutan]] who fled their homeland and took refuge there. Among the first clans of Tshangla people were the Ngatsangpas (Snga Tsang pa)who paved ways for others to join them in their plight for a promised land free from sufferings. The exodus of Tshangla community continued from the beginning of the 17th century until the early 20th century. Political and religious turmoil in Tibet forced many Tibetans to join Tshangla people in Pemako a land where religious serenity pledge through many revered Lamas who had been to this land, prophesied by [[Padmasambhava|Guru Rinpoche]] in the mid 8th century to be a land of final call where devotees would be flocking at the time of Religious persecutions, the last sanctuary for Buddhism, with the time Pemako's popularity grew more and more, with the popularity many [[Tibetan people]] particularly from [[Kham]] followed their [[lama]]s and settled alongside Tshangla populace. Over the period of time Tibetans and Tshangla migrants [[amalgamation (race)|amalgamated]] to form an homogeneous group called Pemako pas ( Pad-ma dkod pa). The process of infusion gave birth to a new Tshangla dialect called [[Pemako Tshangla language|Pemako dialect]]. People who reside in Pemako enclave are of mixed blood originated from early Tshangla settlers and different [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] tribes, [[Standard Tibetan]] is also spoken in Pemako, with many different languages such [[Khams Tibetan language|Khampa language]], [[Kongpo|Kongpo dialect]], [[Bomê County|Poba Language]] etc.

There are approximately 10,000 [[Pemako|Tshangla]] speaker in Upper [[Pemako]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], 4000–5000 in Lower [[Upper Siang District|Pemako]], in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and approximately 3500–4000 [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan Tshangla community]] residing in three different Tibetan settlements, [[Tezu]], [[Miao, Changlang|Miao]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. Many Pemakos in the past have spread to western countries as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">Afghanistan possesses a rich [[language|linguistic]] legacy of pre-Islamic scripts, which existed before being displaced by the [[Arabic alphabet]], after the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]].
Among these scripts are [[Śāradā script|Sharada]], [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]], [[Kharosthi]], [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] and [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]] . For thousands of years, Afghanistan was inhabited by Indo-Vedic people and thus all ancient documents, tracts, monuments and remains are of Hindu origins. Later, Buddhism became the major force in Afghanistan and brought with it its own liturgical languages.

Abundant archeological evidence in the form of [[inscriptions]], [[numismatics]] and [[manuscripts]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} has provided traces of the precursors of the contemporary [[Languages of Afghanistan]] such as [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Dari language|Dari]] and other [[Dardic languages]].

==Sanskrit==
Recent Archeological unearthings of [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions attest to the prevalence of the Sanskrit alphabet in Afghanistan. 

Some later Sanskrit inscriptions in late Brahmi of about around the fifth to eighth centuries have also been found in Afghanistan in recent decades. Worthy of note are the Dilberjin fresco inscriptions (Drevniaia Baktriia); the [[Gardez]] inscriptions on an image of Ganesa; and the [[Parvati|Uma]] Maheshvara image inscriptions from Tapa Skandar. Several Buddhist inscriptions of this period with the Buddhist creed on votive clay tablets have also been discovered at [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]]&lt;ref&gt;''Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit and the other Indo-Aryan languages'', Richard Salomon, p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kushan Empire]] employed Sanskrit abundantly for use in Buddhist literary texts, as is evident from epigraphic evidence.

The presence of Buddhist literary texts in Sanskrit of the Kushan period goes hand in hand with the codification of the Sanskrit canon of the Sarvastivada school in Kashmir at the Buddhist council in the time of Kanishk.&lt;ref&gt;''The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750'', Volume 3, Boris Anatol'evich Litvinskiĭ, R. Shabani Samghabadi, Unesco Publishing P. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians attest the largest population of the region  including [[Bactria]] spoke vernacular dialects of Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Silk Road in World History'', Xinru Liu, Oxford University Press, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Śāradā==
[[Śāradā script|Śāradā]] texts have been widely found in Afghanistan; one of them was engraved on a marble statue of the Indian elephant god [[Ganesha|Ganesh]] that was found near [[Gardez]]. Another was inscribed on the large ''Uma Maheshvara'' from ''Tepe Skandar'', north of [[Kabul]]. The Śāradā inscriptions all seem to date to the [[8th century|8th century CE]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Afghans'', Willem Vogelsang, p.186, Blackwell Publishers Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 750 and 1000 A.D., the [[Kabul Shahi|Shahi]]'s issued silver coins to provide currency for eastern Afghanistan and [[Gandhara]]. Most of the coins have an obverse legend in either Spalpati Deva or Samanta Deva, which are Śāradā scripts.&lt;ref&gt;''India and Central Asia: classical to contemporary periods'', Braja Bihārī Kumāra, Astha Bharati (Organization), Indian Council for Cultural Relations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandhari==
In what was [[Gandhara]] (Eastern Afghanistan and Northern [[Pakistan]]), scholars have found a large quantity of Buddhist scrolls, written in the [[Gandhari language]] (a dialect of [[Sanskrit]]) with the Kharosthi script. Gandhari most likely was the daily language of the [[Kushan]]s after they established their empire. From Gandhara, this script spread east and north into various parts of [[Central Asia]]. In the centuries that followed, Kharoshthi became the main script in the [[Tarim basin]] (now part of China's [[Xinjiang]] [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] Autonomous region) for writing local languages.&lt;ref&gt;''The Silk Road in World History'', Xinru Liu, p.58, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kharosthi==
Inscriptions and documents in [[Kharosthi]] have been found over a broad area in Afghanistan. To the far west and northwest, several specimens have been found at sites along the [[Kabul River]] in Afghanistan as far west as [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]] or Khawat, some 20 miles west of Kabul. Recent archaeological excavations have also yielded numerous Kharosthi inscriptions from north of the [[Hindu Kush]], in ancient [[Bactria]], both in sites in northern Afghanistan such as [[Qunduz]] and in several places in the former Soviet republics of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit and other Indo-Aryan languages''.

[[File:Party SMS.jpg|thumb|SMS language, abbreviating "we are" to "we r"]]
'''SMS language''', '''textspeak''' or '''texting language'''&lt;ref&gt;also known as '''txt-speak''', '''txtese''', '''chatspeak''', '''txt''', '''txtspk''', '''txtk''', '''txto''',  '''texting language''', '''txt lingo''', '''SMSish''', '''txtslang''', '''txt talk''', '''text shorthand'''&lt;/ref&gt; is the abbreviated language and [[slang]] commonly used with mobile phone text messaging, or other [[Internet]]-based communication such as [[email]] and [[instant messaging]].

Three features of early mobile phone messaging encouraged users to use abbreviations:
# Text entry was difficult, requiring multiple key presses on a small keypad to generate each letter;
# messages were limited to 160 characters; and
# it made texting faster.

Once it became popular it took on a life of its own and was often used outside to write formal emails or letters.

==History==
[[SMS]] language is similar to that used by those sending telegraphs that charged by the word. It seeks to use the fewest number of letters to produce ultra-concise words and sentiments&lt;ref name="Lily Huang"&gt;{{cite web|author= Lily Huang |url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/150449 |title = Technology: Textese May Be the Death of English  | work= Newsweek |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
in dealing with space, time and cost constraints of [[text messaging]]. This follows from how early SMS permitted only 160 characters and that carriers began charging a small fee for each message sent (and sometimes received). This, together with the difficulty and inefficiency in creating messages led the desire for a more economical language for the new medium.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= History of Short Message Service (SMS) |url= http://www.besttextmarketing.com/sms-marketing/history-of-short-message-service-sms/| work= Reviews and Ratings of SMS Marketing Services| publisher=Best Text Marketing| accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also shares some of these characteristics with Internet and [[Telex]] speak following from how its evolution is rather symbiotic to the evolution of use of shorthand in Internet [[chat room]]s. Likewise, such a change sought to accommodate the small number of characters allowed per message, and to increase convenience for the time-consuming and often small [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]s on mobile phones. In addition, similarly [[Ellipsis|elliptical]] styles of writing can be traced to the days of [[telegraphese]] 120 years back, where telegraph operators were reported to use abbreviations similar to those used in modern text when chatting amongst themselves in between sending of official messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radnedge |first=Aidan |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/872560-stripped-down-text-speak-is-over-120-years-old-research-reveals |title= The stripped-down form of writing that goes with texting has been with us for more than 120 years, research has uncovered| publisher= www.metro.co.uk |date= 2011-08-16 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faramerz Dabhoiwala wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2016: "modern usages that horrify linguistic purists in fact have deep historical roots. "OMG" was used by a septuagenarian naval hero, admiral of the fleet Lord Fisher, in 1917".&lt;ref name="Guardian 2 April 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Dabhoiwala |first= Faramerz |title= How English Became English by Simon Horobin review – ‘OMG’ was first used 100 years ago |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/31/how-english-became-english-simon-horobin-review| date= 2 April 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] (Review section) |page= 7| location=London| accessdate=8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/memoriesbyadmira00fishuoft#page/77/mode/1up | page=78 | title=Memories | last= Fisher | first=John Arbuthnot | publisher =Hodder and Stoughton | location=London | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the invention of mobile phone messaging is considered to be the source for the invention of SMS language. In general, SMS language thus permits the sender to type less and communicate more quickly than one could without such shortcuts. One example is the use of "tomoz" instead of "tomorrow". Nevertheless, there are no standard rules for the creation and use of SMS languages. Any word may be shortened (for example, "text" to "txt"). Words can also be combined with numbers to make them shorter (for example, "later" to "l8r"), using the numeral "8" for its [[Homophone|homophonic]] quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beverly, Plester |author2=Wood, Clare |author3=Joshi, Puja | title=Exploring the relationship between children's knowledge of text message abbreviations and school literacy outcomes| journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=23 March 2009| volume=27| issue=1| pages=145–161|doi= 10.1348/026151008X320507| pmid=19972666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMS language as a multilingual entity===
[[File:Hitler-est-mechant.jpg|thumb|left|French comic featuring SMS language. The child's speech (in full French spelling, "Mais c'est vrai! T'es quoi, un Nazi?", translated as "But it's true! What are you, a Nazi?") is written in French SMS abbreviations.]]

Some may view SMS language to be a nascent dialect of the [[English language]],&lt;ref name="Lily Huang" /&gt; that is a dialect strongly if not completely derivative of the English language. This may not be so. Such generalization may have risen from the fact that mobile phones had only been able to support a limited number of default languages in the early stages of its conception and distribution.&lt;ref name="Shirali-Shahreza"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mohammad| last= Shirali-Shahreza|title=Multilingual SMS|journal=Idea Group Inc.|year=2007|series=Category: Mobile Phone|pages=666–668|url=http://www.igi-global.com/viewtitlesample.aspx?id=17153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mobile operating system]] (OS) such as [[Symbian]] and language packs enable the linguistic localization of products that are equipped with such interfaces, where the current Symbian release (Symbian Belle) supports the scripts  and [[Orthography|orthographies]] of over 48 languages and dialects, though such provisions are by no means fully comprehensive as to the languages used by users all over the world. Researcher Mohammad Shirali-Shahreza (2007)&lt;ref name="Shirali-Shahreza" /&gt; further observes that mobile phone producers offer support "of local language of the country" within which their phone sets are to be distributed.

Nevertheless, various factors contribute as additional constraints to the use of non-English languages and scripts in SMS. This motivates the [[anglicization]] of such languages, especially those using non-[[Latin spelling and pronunciation|Latin orthographies]] (i.e. not using Latin alphabets) following for instance, the even more limited message lengths involved when using for example, [[Cyrillic]] or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters.&lt;ref name="David Crystal"&gt;{{cite book | title=Txtng the gr8 db8| last=Crystal| first=David| year=2009| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, researcher Gillian Perrett observes the de-anglicization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perrett|first=Gillian|title=Globalization and the de-Anglicization of English|url=http://journal.teflin.org/index.php/teflin/article/viewFile/240/170|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalum|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the English language following its use and incorporation into non-English linguistic contexts.

As such, on top of the measures taken to minimize space, time and cost constraints in SMS language, further constraints upon the varied nature and characteristics of languages worldwide add to the distinct properties and style of SMS language(s).

==Linguistic properties and style==

The primary motivation for the creation and use of SMS language was to convey a comprehensible message using the fewest number of characters possible. This was for two reasons; one, telecommunication companies limited the number of characters per SMS, and also charged the user per SMS sent. To keep costs down, users had to find a way of being concise while still communicating the desired message. Two, typing on a phone is normally slower than with a keyboard, and capitalization is even slower. 
As a result, punctuation, grammar, and capitalization are largely ignored. In many countries, people now have access to unlimited text options in their monthly plan, although this varies widely from country to country, and operator to operator. However, screens are still small and the input problem persists, so SMS language is still widely used for brevity.

Observations and classifications as to the linguistic and stylistic properties of SMS language have been made and proposed by Crispin Thurlow,&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurlow|first=Crispin|title=Generation Txt? The sociolinguistics of young people's text messaging.|url=http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/v1/n1/a3/thurlow2002003.html|publisher=Discourse Analysis Online (DAOL)}}&lt;/ref&gt; López Rúa&lt;ref name="López-Rúa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=López-Rúa|first=Paula|title=Teaching L2 vocabulary through SMS language: some didactic guidelines|journal=ELIA|year=2007|issue=7|pages=165–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Crystal&lt;ref name="David Crystal"/&gt; among many others. Although they are by no means exhaustive, some of these marked properties involve the use of:

*Initialisations ([[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]] and [[abbreviation]]s composed of initials)
*Reductions and shortenings, and omission of parts of speech
:*[[Pragmatics]] and [[context (language use)|context]] in interpretation of ambiguous shortenings
*Reactive tokens
*[[Pictogram]]s and [[logogram]]s (rebus abbreviation)
*[[Paralanguage|Paralinguistic]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features
:*[[Capitalization]]
:*[[Emoticon]]s
*Variations in spelling
*[[Punctuation]], or lack thereof

===Initialisations (acronyms and abbreviations composed of initials)&lt;ref name="López-Rúa" /&gt;===

There are many examples of words or phrases that share the same abbreviations (e.g., ''lol'' could mean ''laugh out loud'', ''lots of love'', or ''little old lady'', and ''cryn'' could mean ''crayon'' or ''cryin(g)'').

===Reductions and shortenings,&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; and omission of parts of speech&lt;ref name="Freudenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freudenberg|first=Kristy|title=Investigating the impact of SMS speak on the written work of English first language and English second language high school learners|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/2052/Freudenberg,%20K.pdf?sequence=1|work=MA Thesis: Philosophy Stellenbosch University|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

For words that have no common abbreviation, users most commonly remove the vowels from a word, and the reader is required to interpret a string of consonants by re-adding the vowels (e.g. ''dictionary'' becomes ''dctnry'' and ''keyboard'' becomes ''kybrd''). Omission of words, especially function words (e.g.: determiners like "a" and "the") are also employed as part of the effort to overcome time and space constraints.&lt;ref name="Freudenberg" /&gt;

The advent of [[predictive text]] input and [[smartphone]]s featuring full [[QWERTY|QWERTY keyboards]] may contribute to a reduction in the use of shortenings in SMS language.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

====Pragmatics and context in interpretation of ambiguous shortenings====
Recipients may have to interpret the abbreviated words depending on the context in which they are being used. For instance, should someone use ''ttyl, lol'' they may probably mean ''talk to you later, lots of love'' as opposed to ''talk to you later, laugh out loud''. In another instance, if someone were to use ''omg, lol'' they may perhaps mean ''oh my god, laugh out loud'' as opposed to ''oh my god, lots of love''.

Therefore, co-textual references and context are crucial when interpreting textese, and it is precisely this shortfall that critics cite as a reason not to use it (although the English language in general, like many other [[language]]s, has many words that have different meanings in different contexts).

SMS language does not always obey or follow standard [[grammar]], and additionally the words used are not usually found in standard dictionaries or recognized by [[List of language regulators|language academies]].

===Reactive tokens===
The feature of "reactive tokens" that is ubiquitous in [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), is also commonly found in SMS language. Reactive tokens include phrases or words like "yeah I know", which signifies a reaction to a previous message. In SMS language, however, the difference is that many words are shortened unlike in spoken speech.&lt;ref name="TESOL"/&gt;

===Pictograms and logograms (rebus abbreviation)&lt;ref name="David Crystal"/&gt;===

Some tokens of the SMS language can be likened to a [[rebus]], using pictures and single letters or numbers to represent whole words (e.g. "i &lt;3 u", which uses the pictogram of a heart for ''love'', and the letter ''u'' replaces ''you'').

The dialect has a few [[hieroglyph]]s (codes comprehensible to initiates) and a range of face symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walters |first=Guy |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2008/07/gr8-db8-crystal-texting-txtng |title=New Statesman |publisher=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paralinguistic and prosodic features===
Prosodic features in SMS language aim to provide added semantic and syntactic information and context from which recipients can use to deduce a more contextually relevant and accurate interpretation. These may aim to convey the textual equivalent of verbal prosodic features such as facial expression and tone of voice&lt;ref name="Walt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=Helen J.|title=How Does the Use of Modern Communication Technology Influence Language and Literacy Development? - A Review|journal=Contemporary Issues Communicatio Science and Disorders|year=2010|volume=37|pages=141–148|url=http://www.nsslha.org/uploadedFiles/NSSLHA/publications/cicsd/2010F-Use-of-Modern-Communication-Technology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Syntactic Aspects in Text Messaging"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nancy Anashia Ong'onda |author2=Peter Maina Matu |author3=Pamela Anyango Oloo | title=Syntactic Aspects in Text Messaging| journal=World Journal of English Language| year=2011| volume=1| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, even though SMS language exists in the format of written text, it closely resembles normal speech in that it does not have a complicated structure and that its meaning is greatly contextualised.

====Capitalization====
In the case of capitalization in SMS language, there are three scenarios:&lt;ref name="Ling 2005"&gt;Ling, Richard. 2005. "The socio-linguistics of SMS: An analysis of SMS use by a random sample of Norwegians" in ''Mobile communications: Renegotiation of the social sphere'', edited by R. Ling and P. Pedersen. London: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

SMS messages with:
*No capitalization
*Capitalization of only the first word
*Full capitalization as appropriate that conforms to all grammatical rules

Most SMS messages have done away with capitalization. Use of capitalizations on the first word of a message may in fact, not be intentional, and may likely be due to the default capitalization setting of devices.

Capitalization too may encode prosodic elements, where copious use may signify the textual equivalent of raised voice to indicate heightened emotion.&lt;ref name="Walt" /&gt;

Just as body language and facial expressions can alter how speech is perceived, emoji and emoticons can alter the meaning of a text message, the difference being that the real tone of the SMS sender is less easily discerned merely by the emoticon. Using a smiling face can be perceived as being sarcastic rather than happy, thus the reader has to decide which it is by looking at the whole message.&lt;ref name="Nurulah, Sabreena, Subarna"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ahmed, Sabreena |author2=Nurullah, Abu Sadat |author3=Sakar, Subarna | title=The Use of SMS and Language Transformation in Bangladesh| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of punctuation and capitalization to form emoticons distracts from the more traditional function of such features and symbols. Nevertheless, uses do differ across individuals and cultures. For example, overpunctuation may simply be used to communicate paralinguistic aspects of communication without the need to create an emotion from it like so: "Hello!!!!".&lt;ref name="Freudenberg" /&gt;

===Punctuation, or lack thereof===
While vowels and punctuation of words in SMS language are generally omitted, [[David Crystal]] observes that apostrophes occur unusually frequently. He cites an American study of 544 messages, where occurrence of apostrophes in SMS language is approximately 35 percent.&lt;ref name="David Crystal"/&gt;  This is unexpected, seeing that it is a hassle to input an apostrophe in a text message with the multiple steps involved. The use of apostrophes cannot be totally attributed to users attempting to disambiguate words that might otherwise be misunderstood without it.

There are not that many cases in English where leaving out the apostrophe causes misunderstanding of the message. For example, "we're" without the apostrophe could be misread as "were". Even so, these are mostly understood correctly despite being ambiguous, as readers can rely on other cues such as part of sentence and context where the word appears to decide what the word should be. For many other words like "Im" and "Shes", there is no ambiguity. Since it is not imperative that users use apostrophes to ensure that their message is understood accurately, this phenomenon may in part be attributed to texters wanting to maintain clarity so that the message can be more easily understood in a shorter amount of time.&lt;ref name="David Crystal"/&gt;  The widespread mobile phone auto-correct feature contributes to the frequency of the apostrophe in SMS messages, since, even without user awareness, it will insert an apostrophe in many common words, such as "I'm", "I'll", and "I'd".

===Tone===

===Variations in spelling===
Users may also use spellings that reflect their illocutionary force and intention rather than using the standard spelling. For example, the use of "haha" to signify "standard" laughter, and "muahaha" to encode perhaps more raucous or evil sound of laughter.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tesol-france.org/Documents/Colloque07/SMS%20Text%20Analysis%20Language%20Gender%20and%20Current%20Practice%20_1_.pdf|title=SMS text analysis: Language, gender and current practices|accessdate=2012-02-27|author=Muhammad, Shaban Rafi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this, regional variations in spelling can also be observed. As such, SMS language, with its intergroup variations, also serves as an identity marker.&lt;ref name="Syntactic Aspects in Text Messaging"/&gt;

===SMS dictionaries===
SMS language has yet to be accepted as a conventional and stable form, dialect and language. As a result, (as much as it is also a consequence), notable [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] efforts and publications (e.g. dictionaries) dealing specifically with SMS language have yet to emerge.&lt;ref name="Mashamaite et al"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mashamaite, Kwena  |author2=Mphahlele, Lorna Mampa |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Impact of Short Message Service (SMS) Language on Language Proficiency of Learners and the SMS Dictionaries: A Challenge for Educators and Lexicographers|journal=IADIS International Conference Mobile Learning 2005|year=2005|pages=161–168|url=http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200506L022.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps with the exception of the SMS dictionary that the service provider [[Vodacom]], provides its clients with as a supplement to their cellphone purchase.&lt;ref name="Mashamaite et al" /&gt; However, as a result text message slang has aided many children's language. By constantly using this ungrammatical form of texting so frequently, it has become a part of their "normal language" {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

Vodacom provides lists of abbreviations and acronyms with their meanings in its website.&lt;ref name=vodacom&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS Dictionary|url=https://www.vodacommessaging.co.za/dictionary.asp?|publisher=Vodacom Messaging|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of Short Message Service (SMS) Language on Language Proficiency of Learners and the SMS Dictionaries|url=http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200506L022.pdf|work=IADIS International Conference Mobile Learning 2005|publisher=IADIS International Conference Mobile Learning|accessdate=16 March 2012|author1=Mampa Lorna Mphahlele |author2=Kwena Mashamaite |page=168|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere on the Internet, there has been effort to provide dictionaries of sorts for SMS language. Such websites usually have an alphabetical list of "words" used in SMS language, together with their intended meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS Text Dictionary|url=http://www.sms-text-guide.com/sms-text-language.html|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lingo2word1&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Message Translator, Online Text Message Dictionary|url=http://www.lingo2word.com/|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text messages can also be "translated" to standard language on certain websites as well, though the "translations" are not always accurate.&lt;ref name=Lingo2word2&gt;{{cite web|title=Translate your txt messages|url=http://www.lingo2word.com/translate.php|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall observations and criticisms==

===Frequency of use===
In one American study, researchers found that less than 20% of messages used SMS language. Looking at his own texting history, the study's author, linguist [[David Crystal]], said that just 10% of his messages used SMS language.&lt;ref name="2b"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crystal|first=David|title=2b or not 2b? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/05/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview |accessdate=25 March 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 July 2008|authorlink=David Crystal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive===

====Effect on verbal language use and literacy====
According to research done by Dr. Nenagh Kemp of [[University of Tasmania]], the evolution of "textese" is inherently coupled to a strong grasp of grammar and phonetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilemessaging2.com/2008/12/12/textese-mobility-and-the-evolution-of-language/Mobile |title=Messaging 2.0 |publisher=Mobilemessaging2.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Crystal]] has countered the claims that SMS has a deleterious effect on language with numerous scholarly studies. The findings are summarized in his book ''[[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]''.
In his book, Crystal argues that: 
*In a typical text message, words are not abbreviated as frequently as widely thought
*Abbreviating has been in use for a long time, and thus is not a novel phenomenon only found in SMS language. Furthermore, some words such as "[[sonar]]" and "[[laser]]" that are accepted as standard words in the dictionary are originally acronyms.
*Both children and adults use SMS language, so if adults do not display the errors seen in children's written work, they cannot be attributed to SMS language alone.
*Use of abbreviations in written work and examinations is not that prevalent among students.
*A prerequisite to using SMS language is the knowledge of spelling, so use of SMS language does not necessarily imply low literacy.
 
He further observes that this is by no means a cause for bad spelling, where in fact, texting may lead to an improvement in the literacy of the user.&lt;ref name="David Crystal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crystal|first=David|title=The joy of txt|journal=Spotlight| date=November 2008 |pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are others who feel that the claims of SMS language being detrimental to English language proficiency are overrated. A study of the written work of 100 students by Freudenberg found that the actual amount of use of SMS language found in the written work was not very significant. Some features of SMS language such as the use of emoticons was not observed in any of the written work by the students. Of all the errors found, quite a substantial amount cannot be attributed to use of SMS language. These included errors that have already appeared even before the  advent of SMS language.&lt;ref name="Freudenberg" /&gt;

There are also views that SMS language has little or no effect on grammar.&lt;ref name="Solomon Ali Dansieh"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Solomon Ali Dansieh| title=SMS Texting and Its Potential Impacts on Students' Written| journal=International Journal of English Linguistics| year=2011| volume=1| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view feel that SMS language is merely another language, and since learning a new language does not affect students' proficiency in English grammar, it cannot be said that SMS language can affect their grammar. With proper instruction, students should be able to distinguish between slang, SMS language and correct English and use them in their appropriate contexts.&lt;ref name="Solomon Ali Dansieh"/&gt;

====Efficiency and economy====
According to a study, though SMS language is faster to write, more time is needed to read it compared to conventional English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4B90YA20081210?rpc=64 |title=If u cn rd this quickly, gd 4 u |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2011-12-20|newspaper=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative===

====Effect on verbal language use and communication====
Although various other research supports the use of SMS language, the popular notion that text messaging is damaging to the linguistic development of young people persists and many view it as a corruption of the standard form of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://david-crystal.blogspot.com/2008/07/on-txtng.html|title=DCBLOG|publisher=Blog.oup.com |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh journalist and television reporter [[John Humphrys]] has criticized SMS language as "wrecking our language". The author cites [[ambiguity]] as one problem posed, illustrating with examples such as "lol", which may either be interpreted to mean "laughing out loud", "lots of love", and "little old lady" depending on the context in which it is being used. Ambiguous words and statements have always been present within languages. In English for example, the word "duck" can have more than one meaning. It could be referring to either the bird or the action, and such words are usually disambiguated by looking at the context in which it was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3705|title=Waterstones | author=Geoffrey K. Pullum | work=Language Log | accessdate=2012-03-18 | date=2012-01-15 | authorlink=Geoffrey K. Pullum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of SMS language has been criticized for causing the deterioration of English language proficiency and its rich heritage. Opponents of SMS language feel that it undermines the properties of the English language that have lasted throughout its long history. Furthermore, words within the SMS language that are very similar to their English-language counterparts can be confused by young users as the actual English spelling and can therefore increase the prevalence of spelling mistakes.&lt;ref name="Isabel Berman"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Berman, Isabel| title=Email-"Inspired" Changes in Non-Native Legal Discourse| journal=Language@Internet| year=2006| volume=3| url=http://www.languageatinternet.org/about.journal_html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indolence vs. efficiency====
Humphrys describes emoticons and textese as "irritating" and essentially lazy behavior, and surmises that "sloppy" habits gained while using textese will result in students' growing ignorance of proper grammar and punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-483511/I-h8-txt-msgs-How-texting-wrecking-language.html|title=I h8 txt msgs: How texting is wrecking our language|accessdate=2009-05-26|date=2007-09-24|author=John Humphrys|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in school work, assignments and exams====
Use of SMS language in schools tended to be seen as negative effects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} There have been some reports in the media of children using SMS language for essays in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Is txt mightier than the word?|publisher=BBC|date=2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2814235.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] refuted press reports that they had authorized the use of text abbreviations in exam answers, with a spokesperson saying that "there had been no change to guidelines and there was no specific policy about text language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Text language risky move in NCEA examinations |author=Claire Trevett |author2=Mike Houlahan |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/students-study/news/article.cfm?c_id=329&amp;objectid=10410066 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SMS language and identity==
According to Sean Ó Cadhain, abbreviations and acronyms elicits a sense of group identity as users must be familiar with the lingo of their group to be able to comprehend the SMS language used within the group.&lt;ref name="Sean Ó Cadhain"&gt;{{cite book | title=Teen txtuality and the txt flirt| last= Cadhain| first=Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to use and understand these language short forms that are unique to each group indicates that an individual is part of the group, forging a group identity that excludes outsiders. SMS language is thus thought to be the "secret code of the youth" by some.&lt;ref name="Sean Ó Cadhain"/&gt; The fact that sometimes, shortened forms are used for reasons other than space constraints can be seen as interlocutors trying to establish solidarity with each other.&lt;ref name="Sean Ó Cadhain"/&gt;

===Differences between male and female use of SMS language===
According to Norwegian researcher [[Richard Ling]], there are differences in the SMS language of females and males.&lt;ref name="Ling 2005" /&gt; The lexical, morphological and syntactic choices between males and females SMS users&lt;ref name="TESOL"/&gt; suggested to Ling that women are more "adroit" &lt;ref group=Note name=Note01/&gt; and more "literary" texters.&lt;ref name="David Crystal"/&gt; 
[[Richard Ling]] observes:
:
*Women's messages tend to be "longer"
*Women used more "complex structure" and grammar
*Men's messages tend to comprise "one-sentence", "one-clause" or "one-thought" constructions (the latter is markedly observable among male users within the ages 16 to 19)
*More greetings and words of parting were observed in women's messages
*Women had messages with emotional and practical (e.g. arranging a meeting) content unlike men, who mostly used SMS language for practical content only.
*Women and the younger users (across gender) tend to use more shortened forms and emoticons than men per se
*While women observed conventional rules more than men, the difference is marginal. This involves the use of correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc.

==Use in advertisements==
In recent years, advertisements have been increasingly influenced by SMS language. The longer the message in the advertisement, the less impression it will leave. Hence, short messages that are more catchy, cost and space saving are more commonly used.&lt;ref name="Mampa Lorna Mphahlele"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200506L022.pdf|title=The impact of short message service (SMS) language on language proficiency of learners and the SMS dictionaries: A challenge for educators and lexicographers|accessdate=2012-02-27|year=2005|author=Mampa Lorna Mphahlele}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual effect elicited by SMS language also lends a feeling of novelty that helps to make the advertisement more memorable. For example, an advertisement of a book uses the SMS language: ''EAT RIGHT 4 YOUR TYPE''.&lt;ref name="Mampa Lorna Mphahlele"/&gt;

Companies focusing on the teen market have the tendency to make use of SMS language in their advertising to capture the attention of their target audience.&lt;ref name="Marketers Try to Be 'Kewl' With Text-Message Lingo "&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120719487786785755|title=Marketers Try to Be 'Kewl' With Text-Message Lingo |accessdate=2012-02-27|year=2008|author=Vranica, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since teenagers tend to be the ones using SMS language, they are able to relate to advertisements that use SMS language. 
Unilever's advertisement for their novel range of deodorant for teenage girls uses the phrase "OMG! Moments." David Lang, president of the team who created the advertisement commented that they desired to bring across the impression that they identify with youth culture and discourse.&lt;ref name="Marketers Try to Be 'Kewl' With Text-Message Lingo "/&gt;

Many other companies like McDonald's have also attempted to pursue the teenage market by using SMS language abbreviations in their commercials. McDonald's in Korea has an online video commercial which concludes with: "r u ready?".&lt;ref name="Marketers Try to Be 'Kewl' With Text-Message Lingo "/&gt;

[[Image:Sardar Mohammad Khan.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sardar Muhammad Khan]]

'''Sardar Mohammad Khan''' (1 January 1915 &amp;ndash; 26 May 1998), also known as "SMK", was a renowned [[Pakistan]]i [[Research|researcher]] of [[Linguistics|linguistics]].&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/826746/the-pathan-who-wrote-the-largest-punjabi-dictionary/ |title=The Pathan who wrote the largest Punjabi dictionary|publisher= The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; 

==Early life==
He was born in a [[Pathan]] family at Basti Danishmandan ([[Jalandhar]]). After doing his secondary and higher secondary education, he did his B.A degree from the [[University of the Punjab]], [[Lahore]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=punjabian/&gt; He joined united Indian Army as a civilian employee and retired as a civilian gazetted officer from the [[Pakistan Army]] General Headquarters (G.H.Q.), [[Rawalpindi]] in 1969. Being a government servant, under the rules, he could not  publish any book until his retirement.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=punjabian/&gt;

==Work==
Sardar Muhammad Khan gave fifty years of his life to writing the largest Punjabi-Urdu dictionary in the history of Punjabi language. This dictionary, which has been published by the Pakistan Academy of Letters along with Punjabi Adbi Board in 2009, consists of two volumes of more than 3500 pages each.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/483447/punjabi-urdu-dictionary-launched Punjabi-Urdu dictionary launched] Dawn (newspaper), Published 11 August 2009, Retrieved 10 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=punjabian/&gt; 

It has been written with a scholarly approach, and besides giving meanings and explanations of  Punjabi words in [[Urdu]], it also explains idioms, riddles, children's games, traditions, customs and religious terms. His love for dictionaries was evident from the fact that he remembered all the contents of Oxford Dictionary. He said, "it is the spelling that makes a dictionary: the pronunciation can differ from Peshawar to Sindh, but once you agree on a spelling, one word shall suffice for all". This Punjabi-Urdu dictionary has been proven to be the most detailed and authoritative on the subject as of 2015.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt;

Sardar Mohammad Khan had a command of  [[Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] and could write and speak  in these languages fluently. He had thoroughly studied the [[Quran]] and Islam and could speak in a scholarly manner on any  aspects of this great religion with confidence.

He also wrote a book on phonetics, ''Aswatiat'' in Urdu. It is a very specialized book. He got it printed in a small press that he himself ran.

He never did anything half-heartedly. His love for songs that brought him into the subjects of sounds/phonetics and dialects, forms the basis of his philological research in literature. This love made him a scholar of music and he learned to sing 'raags' (a kind of music) and play the [[Sitar|sitar]].
 
He had a great passion for working on his family history. He worked hard to give details of his ancestors' migration from one place to another with genealogy of the family of the past three hundred years.

'''Settle Stories''' is a registered charity and company founded in 2010 by Sita Brand to promote storytelling for individuals, communities and organisations. 

== History ==
In 2010, Sita Brand, a performance storyteller, theatre director, writer, and producer, established Settle Stories in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], a small market town in [[North Yorkshire]]. Brand proposed a storytelling festival for the town and set about obtaining funding for her idea.  Her aims were:
# To increase access to traditional and modern forms of storytelling.
# To improve the storytelling skills of users.
# To increase the availability of, access to, and diversity of stories and storytelling.
At the core of the initiative was a belief by Brand in the power of storytelling to help people learn and communicate universal truths. Brand believes that stories ignite the imagination in ways that help people to listen, learn, make emotional connections with ideas and effectively communicate with others. She also saw the festival as a way of contributing to the economic development of the market town.

Funding was obtained from the [[Arts Council England]], with additional contributions from Craven District Council, Settle Town Council. The first Settle Stories Storytelling Festival was successfully launched in 2010, involving professional storytellers, musicians and other artists. Over 500 people attended, with a similar number of local children taking part in schools-based workshops.

Following the success of the 2010 festival, Settle Stories became a registered charity (registered charity no.1141649). Subsequent festivals in each of the following years saw a steady increase in visitors, with over 1,000 attending the 2013 event. The festival has since grown to become the largest storytelling festival in the north of England with over 50 events in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.junomagazine.com/settle-stories-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Settle Stories established the W R Mitchell Archive, which is a unique collection of audio and visual recordings of life in the [[North West of England]], particularly the [[Yorkshire Dales]].  The charity is now in the process of digitising the material and making it available as a resource for learning (see below).

In August 2012, the charity obtained an office in Settle Town Hall.  It has two members of staff but employs others, including performers at the festivals, on a freelance and consultative basis. It has a team of trustees and volunteers, and its Patron is [[Mike Harding]], a well-known Yorkshire author, broadcaster, performer and storyteller.

By 2013, Settle Stories had involved the following stakeholders in its work:
* Local community: including children and young people, families, and schools.
* Visitors: including those specifically drawn to the Festival, and visitors to the region, drawn to the Dales, and attending the Festival as part of their visit.
* Artists: storytellers, musicians, visual artists and other performers at the annual festival.
* Local Businesses: hotels and guest houses, restaurants and shops.
* Volunteers: who willingly give their time and expertise to support the aims of the charity.
* Suppliers: supplying materials for the Festival and other Settle Stories activities.
* Funders: [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]], Craven District Council, Settle Town Council, Trusts and Foundations, commercial sponsors and individuals.

== W R Mitchell Archive ==
The W R Mitchell Archive is a collection of oral history recordings, photographs and other materials collected by Dr W R Mitchell over a 60-year period to record the history of Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire.

Dr Mitchell (1928 - 2015) was a journalist, historian, and author of over 100 books and articles on the Dales.  He joined ''The Dalesman'' magazine in 1948 and was its editor from 1968&amp;ndash;88. From the 1980s onward, Bill toured the region recording on cassette tape the memories of local people on a wide range of topics, but particularly the everyday experiences of people, as remembered and told by Dales people in their own words and dialects.  In 1996, in recognition of his work, he was awarded the MBE and was made an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Bradford.

By 2010, Dr Mitchell had amassed a collection of over 300 audio tapes, with an accompanying collection of photographs and some video footage, of his interviewees.

In January 2012, Settle Stories received a £50,000 Heritage Lottery Fund Grant for a pilot project to digitise a selection of cassette tapes and make the recordings available online.

[[File:HN-British-3-inch-coastal-gun-1.jpg|thumb|British-made three-inch coastal gun damaged by a squib]]
A '''squib load''', also known as a '''squib round''', '''pop and no kick''', or just a '''squib''', is a [[firearm]] [[Firearm malfunction|malfunction]] in which a fired projectile does not have enough force behind it to exit the [[gun barrel|barrel]], and thus becomes stuck. This type of malfunction can be extremely dangerous, as failing to notice that the projectile has become stuck in the barrel may result in another round being fired directly into the obstructed barrel, resulting in a [[catastrophic failure]] of the weapon's structural integrity.

==Causes==
Squib rounds are possible in all [[black powder]] and [[smokeless powder]] based projectile weapons. They are most often caused by negligence in the powder loading process (insufficient or no powder load), or a failure of the primer to ignite the powder at all. In the case of no gunpowder in the cartridge, the primer, when struck, produces just enough force to push the bullet into the barrel but no further. Subsequent rounds will pile up in a very strong weapon or destroy a weaker one. While this occurs most often because of [[handloading]] by inexperienced reloaders, squib loads are known to occur even in reputable factory brands.  Other causes include deformed bullets and attempting to fire a bullet which is slightly too large for the barrel, although both of these scenarios would more likely result in some variety of catastrophic failure instead of a squib.
A weapon that has been subjected to the abuse of a stuck bullet then had another one fired, will display a slight bulge in the barrel at the site of the original stuck bullet (provided the weapon survives). This bulge sometimes presents itself as a ring around the barrel or can be detected by sliding one's fingers along the barrel to check for this occurrence should no ring be seen.

==Diagnosis==
Signs of a squib include: 
*Much quieter and unusual discharge noise. Smaller or empty powder loads, combined with the primer discharge echoing in the casing or barrel, produce an unusual noise. This noise is often called a "ping" or "pop", rather than the expected "bang" of a standard shot.
*Lighter or nonexistent felt recoil force. Lower force on the projectile, insufficient to clear the barrel, translates to a lower recoil force, which may be completely absorbed by the firearm's recoil mechanisms. 
*Discharge from the ejection port or cylinder gap, instead of the barrel. The primer and any burned powder produce smoke, less than a standard load, which cannot be vented through the barrel as normal. 
*Failure of the action to cycle (in semi-automatic firearms). Both [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback]] and [[Blow forward|blowforward]] semi-automatic designs rely on the recoil force to eject the spent casing and cycle the next round. Lighter recoil force may not be sufficient to cycle the action.
Squib loads are also referred to as "pop and no kick", in recognition of the above symptoms.

'''Tradio''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "trade" and "radio") is the name given to a type of [[talk radio]] show format where listeners call in to buy or sell items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Weekend: Listen up! | work=The Courier | date=2008-08-03 | url=http://www.thecourier.com/Issues/2008/Aug/03/ar_news_080308_story6.asp?d=080308_story6,2008,Aug,03&amp;c=n | accessdate=2008-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is analogous to [[Classified advertising|classified ads]] in local newspapers. 

The format is also often called '''Swap Shop''', '''Buy Sell or Trade''', '''Biz Baz''', or '''Trading Post'''.

==Format==
Most tradio programs follow a similar format to each other. Callers are given a studio line in which they can call in and advertise, for free, a limited number of items for sale, or request an item to purchase from another listener. The caller then gives a phone number so that other listeners can contact the person for further information. Since the increased prevalence of [[e-mail]] and other electronic media, most stations permit the sending in of items to sell via e-mail or fax, though due to regular and/or [[identity theft]] concerns some stations will assign a code number to anonymize the transaction and keep identifying information off the air. Most stations also permit listeners to send lists of items through postal mail. Tradio programs are particularly associated with the [[full service (radio format)|full service]] format; tradio was commonly found on [[Independent Local Radio]] in the UK when it used a similar format (up to around 1990).

There are usually some limits to what can be bought and sold through tradio programs. Most stations stipulate that only individuals, and no businesses, may use the tradio service, since the financial security of these small stations usually relies on the advertising dollars from these businesses. Federal regulations prohibit the sale of [[firearms]] through these services; [[real estate]] is also usually not allowed on tradio programs. Restrictions on the sale of [[automobile]]s varies from station to station.

The name "tradio" does not apply to any one particular program and there are no national or [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] tradio programs. It is technically not a [[media franchise|franchised format]], either.  However, the name "tradio" has been trademarked by Simply Local Broadcasting and [[WRIL]] [[Pineville, Kentucky]].

==Popularity==
Typically tradio and similar programs are only heard on small, rural stations; [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] is the largest market with a tradio program, airing weekly on Saturday afternoons. A similarly-styled program titled ''Wheelin' and Dealin' with Dave Ramos'' also airs during the weekends on [[WTAM]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (but is not in a regular timeslot). In smaller markets, tradio programs can air daily. The smallest radio station in America that airs a Tradio program is [[KEDU-LP|KEDU]] in [[Ruidoso, New Mexico]]. The program is on a weekly set schedule Monday through Friday at 9:30am.

Various Tradio programs have been the target of prank phone calling by ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''{{'}}s [[Richard Christy]] and [[Sal Governale]].&lt;ref name=tff2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Trf Radio Station Victim Of Howard Stern Show Prank|url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/2110221-trf-radio-station-gets-prank-call-comedians-linked-howard-stern | accessdate=31 January 2018|newspaper=[[Grand Forks Herald]]|date=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''Trumpet Voluntary''' is the name given to several [[England|English]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] pieces from the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era. A [[trumpet]] [[Voluntary (music)|voluntary]] is most commonly played on the [[organ (music)|organ]] using the trumpet [[Organ stop|stop]], hence the name. Trumpet voluntaries usually consist of a slow introduction followed by a faster section with the right hand playing [[fanfare]]-like figures over a simple accompaniment in the left hand.
In some instances, the Trumpet is replaced by the Cornet [[Organ stop|stop]], or even a Flute stop. Echo effects are also used sometimes.

The most celebrated trumpet voluntary is the ''[[Prince of Denmark's March]]'', a [[musical composition|composition]] by [[Jeremiah Clarke]] written circa. 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Norris (1981) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PhQkTfy-KaeShAell4W3Dg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=KcMXAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=jeremiah+clarke+1699+prince+of+denmark%27s&amp;q=Voluntary%2C+was+published+as+a+keyboard+piece+in+1700 A musical gazetteer of Great Britain &amp; Ireland] p.61. David &amp; Charles, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; It is properly a [[rondo]] for [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] and was not originally called a trumpet voluntary.

It is now known to have been the work of Clarke.

The organist and composer [[John Stanley (composer)|John Stanley]] also wrote a number of trumpet voluntaries, as did Clarke's teacher [[John Blow]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">[[Image:Pedalierdorgue3.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The '''tutti''' piston seen over the organ pedalboard]]
'''''Tutti''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] word literally meaning ''all'' or ''together'' and is used as a musical term, for the whole orchestra as opposed to the soloist. It is applied similarly to [[choir|choral]] music, where the whole section or choir is called to sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutti|url=http://musicterms.artopium.com/t/Tutti.htm|work=Artopium musical terms|accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music examination boards may instruct candidates to "play in tuttis", indicating that the candidate should play both the solo and the tutti sections.

# An [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] may specify that a section leader (e.g., the principal violinist) plays alone, while the rest of the section is silent for the duration of the [[Solo (music)|solo]] passage, by writing '''''solo''''' in the music at the point where it begins and ''tutti'' at the point he wishes the rest of the section to resume playing.
# In [[Organ (music)|organ music]], it indicates that the '''full organ''' should be used: all stops and all couplers. Some organ consoles offer a toe stud or piston to toggle the tutti: pressing once activates all stops (although it does not physically move the stop knobs), and pressing again reverts to the previous registration.

'''Wanka Quechua''' is a variety of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] language, spoken in the southern part of [[Peru]]vian region of [[Junín region|Junín]] by the [[Huancas]].

Wanka Quechua belongs to [[Quechua I]], like [[Ancash Quechua]]. It has about 300,000 speakers and three main dialects: Waylla Wanka in [[Huancayo]] and Chupaca provinces, Waycha Wanka in [[Concepción Province, Peru|Concepción]] and Shawsha Wanka in [[Jauja]]. [[Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino]], a native Wanka speaker, published the first Wanka grammar and dictionary in 1977.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17030">'''Writing assessment''' refers to an area of study that contains theories and practices that guide the evaluation of a writer's performance or potential through a writing task. Writing assessment can be considered a combination of scholarship from [[composition studies]] and measurement theory within [[educational assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. "Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States" ''Assessing Writing'' 16 (2011) 189-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing assessment can also refer to the [[technologies]] and practices used to evaluate student writing and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Huot, B. &amp; Neal, M. (2006). Writing assessment: A techno-history. In C. A. MacArthur, S. Graham, &amp; J. Fitzgerald (Eds.), Handbook of Writing Research (pp. 417-432). New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==

Writing assessment began as a classroom practice during the first two decades of the 20th century, though [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes]] and [[Standardized testing|standardized tests]] also emerged during this time.&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia"&gt;Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. "Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States" ''Assessing Writing'' 16 (2011) 189-211&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, [[College Board]] shifted from using direct writing assessment to indirect assessment because these tests were more cost-effective and were believed to be more reliable.&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia" /&gt; Starting in the 1950s, more students from diverse backgrounds were attending colleges and universities, so administrators made use of standardized testing to decide where these students should be placed, what and how to teach them, and how to measure that they learned what they needed to learn.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen"&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act." ''College Composition and Communication''. 50.3 (1999): 483-503. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The large-scale statewide writing assessments that developed during this time combined direct writing assessment with [[Multiple choice|multiple-choice]] items, a practice that remains dominant today across U.S. large scale testing programs, such as the [[SAT]] and [[GRE]].&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia" /&gt; These assessments usually take place outside of the classroom, at the state and national level. However, as more and more students were placed into courses based on their standardized testing scores, writing teachers began to notice a conflict between what students were being tested on—[[grammar]], [[usage]], and [[vocabulary]]—and what the teachers were actually teaching—[[writing process]] and revision.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Because of this divide, educators began pushing for writing assessments that were designed and implemented at the local, programmatic and classroom levels.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huot, Brian. ''(Re)Articulating Writing Assessment for Teaching and Learning.'' Logan, Utah: Utah State UP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; As writing teachers began designing local assessments, the methods of assessment began to diversify, resulting in timed essay tests, locally designed rubrics, and portfolios. In addition to the classroom and programmatic levels, writing assessment is also hugely influential on [[Writing center|writing centers]] for [[writing center assessment]], and similar academic support centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Hard Questions Are Asked: Evaluating Writing Centers.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED416479|language = en|first = James H.|last = Bell|journal = The Writing Center Journal|volume = 21.1|pages = 7–28|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Because writing assessment is used in multiple [[Context (language use)|contexts]], the history of writing assessment can be traced through examining specific concepts and [[rhetorical situation|situation]]s that prompt major shifts in theories and practices. Writing assessment [[scholars]] do not always agree about the origin of writing assessment.

In "Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act," [[Kathleen Blake Yancey]] offers a history of writing assessment by tracing three major shifts in [[Methodology|methods]] used in assessing writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; She describes the three major shifts through the [[metaphor]] of overlapping [[wave|waves]]: "with one wave feeding into another but without completely displacing waves that came before". In other words, the theories and practices from each wave are still present in some current contexts, but each wave marks the prominent theories and practices of the time.

The first wave of writing assessment (1950-1970) sought [[objective test]]s with indirect measures of assessment. The second wave (1970-1986) focused on [[holistic grading|holistically scored tests]] where the students' actual writing began to be assessed. And the third wave (since 1986) shifted toward assessing a collection of student work (i.e. portfolio assessment) and programmatic assessment.

Bob Broad in ''What We Really Value''&lt;ref&gt;Broad, Bob. ''What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing''. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; points to the publication of ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability'' in 1961 by Diederich, French, and Carlton as the birth of modern writing assessment. Diederich, French, and Carlton based much of their book on research conducted through the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) for the previous decade. This book is an attempt to [[standardization|standardize]] the assessment of writing and, according to Broad, created a base of research in writing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability. Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major concepts==

===Validity and reliability===
Yancey traces the major shifts in writing assessment by pointing toward each wave's swing toward or away from the concepts of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]].&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking Back as We Look Forward"&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy O'Neill, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot explain in ''A Guide To College Writing Assessment'' that reliability and validity are the most important terms in discussing best practices in writing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Peggy, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot. A Guide to College Writing Assessment. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first wave of writing assessment, the emphasis is on [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking back as We Look Forward"&lt;/ref&gt; reliability confronts questions over the consistency of a test. In this wave, the central concern was to assess writing with the best predictability with the least amount of cost and work.

The shift toward the second wave marked a move toward considering principles of [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Validity confronts questions over a test's appropriateness and effectiveness for the given purpose. Methods in this wave were more concerned with a test's [[construct validity]]: whether the material prompted from a test is an appropriate measure of what the test purports to measure. Teachers began to see an incongruence between the material being prompted to measure writing and the material teachers were asking students to write. [[holistic grading|Holistic scoring]], championed by Edward M. White, emerged in this wave. It is one method of assessment where students' writing is prompted to measure their writing ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Holisticism." ''College Composition and Communication,'' 35 (December, 1984): 400-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third wave of writing assessment emerges with continued interest in the validity of assessment methods. This wave began to consider an expanded definition of validity that includes how portfolio assessment contributes to learning and teaching. In this wave, portfolio assessment emerges to emphasize theories and practices in [[Composition studies|Composition and Writing Studies]] such as [[revision (writing)|revision]], drafting, and [[writing process|process]].

===Direct and indirect assessment===
Indirect writing assessments typically consist of multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Examples include [[High stakes testing|high-stakes]] standardized tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], [[SAT]], and [[GRE]], which are most often used by colleges and universities for [[College admissions|admissions]] purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass and [[Accuplacer#Accuplacer|Accuplacer]], are used to [[Placement testing|place]] students into [[Remedial education|remedial]] or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like the timed essay test, require at least one sample of student writing and
are viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual samples of writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces of student writing written over the course of a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple samples of student writing that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple samples of student writing and multiple drafts of a single essay.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;

===As technology===

==Methods==
Methods of writing assessment vary depending on the context and type of assessment. The following is an incomplete list of writing assessments frequently administered:

===Portfolio===
Portfolio assessment is typically used to assess what students have learned at the end of a course or over a period of several years. Course portfolios consist of multiple samples of student writing and a reflective letter or essay in which students describe their writing and work for the course.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Kimberly. "Rethinking Genres of Reflection: Student Portfolio Cover Letters and the Narrative of Progress." ''Composition Studies'' 31.1 (2003): 43-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NealMichael"&gt;Neal, Michael. ''Writing Assessment and the Revolution in Digital Texts and Technologies.'' NY: Teachers College, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Edward. "The Scoring of Writing Portfolios: Phase 2." ''College Composition and Communication'' 56.4 (2005): 581-599.&lt;/ref&gt; "Showcase portfolios" contain final drafts of student writing, and "process portfolios" contain multiple drafts of each piece of writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen_a"&gt;Yancey, Kathleen. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios: Theoretical Issues in the Representation of Student Work." ''ePortfolio Performance Support Systems: Constructing, Presenting, and Assessing Portfolios.'' Eds Katherine V. Wills and Rich Rice. Fort Collins, Colorado: WAC Clearinghouse. Web. 16 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Both print and electronic portfolios can be either showcase or process portfolios, though electronic portfolios typically contain [[hyperlink]]s from the [[Reflective writing|reflective essay]] or letter to samples of student work and, sometimes, outside sources.&lt;ref name="NealMichael" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen_a" /&gt;

===Timed-essay===
[[Test (assessment)#Essay|Timed essay tests]] were developed as an alternative to multiple choice, indirect writing assessments. Timed essay tests are often used to place students into writing courses appropriate for their skill level. These tests are usually [[proctor]]ed, meaning that testing takes place in a specific location in which students are given a prompt to write in response to within a set time limit. The SAT and GRE both contain timed essay portions.

===Rubric===
A [[rubric]] is a [[tool]] used in writing assessment that can be used in several writing contexts. A rubric consists of a set of criteria or descriptions that guides a rater to [[Test score|score]] or [[grading (education)|grade]] a writer. The origins of rubrics can be traced to early attempts in education to [[standardization|standardize]] and scale writing in the early 20th century. Ernest C Noyes argues in November 1912 for a shift toward assessment practices that were more science-based. One of the original scales used in education was developed by Milo B. Hillegas in ''A Scale for the Measurement of Quality in English Composition by Young People''. This scale is commonly referred to as the Hillegas Scale. The Hillegas Scale and other scales used in education were used by administrators to compare the progress of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. "On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate" ''The English Journal'' Vol 97. No. 4. (Mar. 2008) pp 87-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Diederich, French, and Carlton from the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) publish Factors in Judgments for Writing Ability a rubric compiled from a series of raters whose comments were categorized and condensed into a five-factor rubric:&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ideas'': relevance, clarity, quantity, development, persuasiveness
*''Form'': Organization and analysis
*''Flavor'': style, interest, sincerity
*''Mechanics'': specific errors in [[punctuation]], [[grammar]], etc. 
*''Wording'': choice and arrangement of words

As rubrics began to be used in the classroom, teachers began to advocate for criteria to be negotiated with students to have students stake a claim in the how they would be assessed. Scholars such as Chris Gallagher and Eric Turley,&lt;ref&gt;Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. "On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate"&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Broad,&lt;ref&gt;Broad, Bob. ''What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing''&lt;/ref&gt; and Asao Inoue&lt;ref&gt;Inoue, Asao B. "Community-based Assessment Pedagogy." Assessing Writing. 9 (2005): 208-38. Web. 23 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (among many) have advocated that effective use of rubrics comes from local, contextual, and negotiated criteria.

===Multiple-choice test===
[[Multiple choice|Multiple-choice]] tests contain questions about [[usage]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]]. Standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are typically used for college or graduate school admission. Other tests, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are typically used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses.

===Automated essay scoring===

[[Automated essay scoring]] (AES) is the use of non-human, computer-assisted assessment practices to rate, score, or grade writing tasks.

==Race==
Some scholars in writing assessment focus their research on the influence of [[race (human classification)|race]] on the performance on writing assessments. Scholarship in race and writing assessment seek to study how categories of race and perceptions of race continues to shape writing assessment outcomes. However, scholars in writing assessment recognize that [[color blindness (race)|racism in the 21st century is no longer explicit]],&lt;ref&gt;Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. ''Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; LittleField Publishers, Inc., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but point out that writing assessment practices are silently racist. Nicholas Behm and Keith D. Miller in "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-Blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;Behm, Nicholas, and Keith D. Miller. "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship." Race and Writing Assessment. Asao B. Inoue, and Mya Poe, eds. NYC: Peter Lang Publishing, 2012. 127-38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; advocate for the recognition of another wave after the three that Yancey offers. Behm and Miller advocate for a wave where the intersections of race and writing assessment are brought to the forefront of assessment practices. As the authors explain, [[racism|racial inequalities]] in writing assessment are typically justified with non-racial reasons.
