[[File:Unknown-artist-eadwine-the-scribe-at-work-eadwine-psalter-christ-church-canterbury-england-uk-circa-1160-70.jpg|thumb|Scribe of [[Eadwine Psalter]] (mid-12th century, English)]]

This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in the '''12th century'''.

The 12th century in Western Europe saw an increase in the production of Latin texts and a proliferation of literate clerics from the multiplying cathedral schools. At the same time, vernacular literatures ranging from Provençal to Icelandic embodied in lyric and romance the values and worldview of an increasingly self-conscious and prosperous courtly aristocracy. These two trends contributed to a sweeping revival of letters with a lasting influence on the development of literature in the following centuries.

'''Achmet Resmî Efendi''' ([[English language|English]], "Ahmed Efendi of [[Resmo]]"), also called by some Arabic sources as '''Ahmed bin İbrahim Giridî''' ("Ahmed the son of İbrahim the [[Cretan Turks|Cretan]]"), was a [[Greek people|Greek]]-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]&lt;ref name=" Houtsma, Martinus T. 1987 1145 "/&gt; statesman, diplomat and author of the late 18th century. In international relations terms, his most important - and unfortunate - task was to act as the chief of the Ottoman delegation during the negotiations and the signature of the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]].&lt;ref name=" Uyar, Mesut; Erickson, Edward J. 2009 116 "&gt;{{cite book |author1=Uyar, Mesut |author2=Erickson, Edward J. |title=A military history of the Ottomans: from Osman to Atatürk |publisher=ABC-CLIO  |year=2009 |page=116 |isbn=978-0-275-98876-0 |quote= Ahmed Resmi Efendi (1700–1783) was an early example of this new generation. After classical scribal training Ahmed Resmi served as ambassador to Vienna (1757–1758) and Berlin (1763–1764). Additionally, he performed important administrative duties at the front during the disastrous Ottoman-Russian was of 1768-1774, and he was the chief Ottoman negotiator of the Kucuk-Kaynarca peace treaty. Thanks to this unique combination of experiences he witnessed the direct results of the empire’s structural problems and was familiar with its military deficiencies. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the literary domain, he is remembered for various works among which his [[sefâretnâme]] recounting his embassies in [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] occupy a prominent place. He was [[Turkey]]'s first ever ambassador in Berlin.

==Early life==
Ahmed Resmi was born into a family of [[Greek people|Greek]] descent&lt;ref name=" Houtsma, Martinus T. 1987 1145 "&gt;{{cite book | author= Houtsma, Martinus T. |title=E. J.

He entered Ottoman service in 1733 and after holding a number of posts in local administration, was sent on missions to Vienna (1758) and Berlin (1763-4). He later held a number of important offices in central government. In addition, Resmi Ahmad was a contemporary historian of some distinction. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Sir Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb 1954 294 "&gt;{{cite book |author = Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb |title= Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=Brill |year=1954 |page=294 |isbn=90-04-16121-X |quote= Ahmad b. Ibrahim, known as Resmi came from Rethymno (Turk. Resmo; hence his epithet?) in Crete and was of Greek descent (cf. Hammer- Purgstall, viii, 202). He was born in 1112/ 1700 and came in 1 146/1733 to Istanbul, }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Crete|Cretan]] town of [[Rethymno]], which was known as Resmo in the Ottoman Empire in the year 1700. According to [[Muhammed Muradî]], the source for the little that is known concerning his early life, Ahmed Resmî arrived in İstanbul towards his forties, in 1734. Most sources credit him with expertise in the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] and [[letter (mail)|epistolary]] arts. Rising through the Ottoman bureaucracy, he allied himself with a circle of reformers, who transformed diplomatic relations of the Ottomans with [[Europe]] in the 18th century and established some of the first privately endowed public libraries of Istanbul.

When his father-in-law and first patron [[Tavukçubaşı Mustafa]], a diplomat and one of the prominent figures in [[grand vizier]] [[Koca Mehmed Ragıp Pasha]]'s entourage, died in 1749, Ahmed Resmî began writing his first work, the bibliographical compilation of Ottoman chief [[scribe]]s "Sefinet ür-rüesa". It was in this period that he wrote "İstinas fi ahval el-efras", to demonstrate his scribal and literary skills, celebrating the spring ritual of releasing the royal horses for grazing and which served as an [[encomium]] to the [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud I]]. These works also served as a means of introduction to potential patrons, such as grand vizier [[Köse Bahir Mustafa Pasha]].

Ahmed Resmî was appointed in late 1757 to an embassy to Vienna to announce the accession of [[Mustafa III]] to the throne. In 1749, he also composed "Hamilet el-kübera", a biographical list of the chief black [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] (kızlar ağaları) of the Palace.

The embassy to Vienna was followed by a similar appointment, the first ever Turkish embassy to the court of [[Frederick the Great]] in Berlin in 1763/1764. After both embassies, Ahmed Resmî submitted detailed reports on the geography of his passage and the politics of the courts he encountered. In the case of the Berlin embassy, he left behind not just an account of diplomatic niceties but also a portrayal of Frederick and the description of the [[Seven Years' War]]. His tentative observations inaugurated a new emphasis for the Ottoman Empire on the need to study European politics.
[[File:Achmet Resmi Greek Effendi.JPG|thumb|640px|right|Ahmed Resmî Efendi's arrival in [[Berlin]] on 9 November 1763.]]
Upon his return from Berlin, he was appointed chief correspondence officer (''mektupçu'') to the grand vizier. In 1765, he became chief sergeant-at-arms (''çavuşbaşı'') and began his long connection with [[Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha]], who was twice appointed grand vizier. Among his other appointments to the highest offices was his brief posting as second-in-command (''sadaret kethüdası'') to grand vizier [[Moldovanlı Ali Pasha]] in 1769 while the grand vizier was on the [[Bulgaria]]n battlefront. He served in this capacity again with Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha from 1771 until the grand vizier’s death at the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]]. Ahmed Resmî was present at many of the war councils on the battlefield and was noted for his largesse toward wounded soldiers. His quarrels with and observations on the head of the Ottoman delegation during the ten-month truce between the two episodes of the war, [[Çenebaz Osman Efendi]] or Yenişehirli Osman Efendi, by the name either of a town near [[Bursa]] or now in [[Greece]], was recorded by him in one of the most vivid accounts of the war.

Even though the above-mentioned three posts were considered stepping-stones to the office of grand vizier, he never achieved that status. It is likely that Ahmed Resmî’s regular and scathing criticism of the state of Ottoman military organization played a major role in this turn of events.

Ahmed Resmî acted as first plenipotentiary (''murahhas-ı evvel'') to the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca|Küçük Kaynarca]] peace negotiations in 1774 and became one of the signatories of the resulting [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca|treaty]]. He understandably disappeared from the appointment rolls for some time after 1775. Ahmed Resmî resurfaced one last time as chief of the palace cavalry bureau (''süvari mukabelecisi'') under grand vizier [[Halil Hamid Pasha]], probably in recognition of his continuous service behind the scenes in difficult negotiations with [[Russia]] over the future of the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and the [[Crimean Tatars|Tatars]]. Ahmed Resmî died in August 1783, shortly before the [[Aynalıkavak Convention]] ceding the Crimea to [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] was signed in early 1784. One son is said to have preceded Ahmed Resmî to the grave; no other information has been discovered to date concerning his family life.

==Literary works==

* Hamiletü’l-kübera (1749): A biographical list of the [[chief black eunuch]]s from Mehmed Agha (1574–1590) up to [[Morea|Moralı]] Beşir Agha (the second eunuch with the same name, who served between 1746 and 1752) dedicated to Koca Ragıp Mehmed Pasha. It includes biographies of thirty-eight eunuchs, focusing on their origins and professional careers. A concluding part addresses the history of the downfall and execution of Moralı Beşir Agha and provides as much justification for, as explication of, the events.
* Hülasat el-itibar (1781): Critical and satirical history of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]]. Ahmed Resmî was on the battlefield and acutely aware of the failings of the [[Janissary]] corps. The writing is accessible, indignant, sometimes comic, but sincere and passionate.
* Layiha: A [[memorandum]] presented to grand vizier [[İvazzade Halil Pasha]] in 1769 concerning the need for reorganization and control of military headquarters.
* Layiha: A political [[memoir]] on the [[Russian people|Russians]] during the temporary truce and the negotiations to end the 1768-1774 war presented to [[Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha]] and [[Abdürrezzak Efendi]], chief negotiator on the battlefront in 1772. Ahmed Resmî presented this Layiha as the Ottomans undertook ultimately abortive negotiations with the Russians between 1772 and 1773, in which he pressed for peace, arguing that the Russians were badly overextended, and that both sides should recognize their military and territorial limitations. Such language was still novel in Ottoman negotiations. Ahmed Resmî’s view in this last work as well as in Hülasat el-itibar represents an understanding of the balance of power diplomacy he observed in the courts of Vienna and Berlin.
* [[Sefaretname]]-i Ahmed Resmî or Sefaretname-i [[Prussia|Prusya]]: Report of Ahmed Resmî’s embassy to Berlin in 1763-1764 containing a logbook for the journey, reflections on the cities of passage, as well as a record of the official meetings with [[Frederick the Great]], and many reflections on the rise of Frederick, his kind of rule, and his parsimony. Both this and the Vienna embassy report have been edited and transcribed numerous times, and discussed at length in [[English language|English]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].
* Sefinet er-rüesa or Halifet er-rüesa: This is the only biographical compilation of Ottoman chief scribes (''reis ül-küttab'') until 1744, started by Ahmed Resmî around 1749, and continued by [[Süleyman Faik]] until 1804. The work ends with the entries on Ahmed Resmî’s own patrons, Tavukçubaşı Mustafa and [[Koca Ragıp Mehmed Pasha]], and constitutes the main source of information on these two personalities.
* Viyana Sefaretnamesi: Report of Ahmed Resmî’s embassy to [[Vienna]] in 1757-1758, written immediately upon his return.

His two works on Vienna and Berlin embassies have been translated into [[German language|German]] by [[Joseph von Hammer]] in 1809.

She is a 1974 recipient of a Distinguished Alumni Award of [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s [[Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing]].

==Early life and education==
Duerk was born in [[Defiance, Ohio]], on March 29, 1920 to Albert and Emma Duerk.&lt;ref name="DCVD"/&gt; She had nursing training at Toledo (Ohio) [[Hospital]] [[School]] of Nursing, from which she received her diploma in 1941.&lt;ref name="OffBio"&gt;Official U S Navy Biography, Navy Office of Information, Biographies Branch (OI-O111), June 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
On January 23, 1943, she was appointed as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Navy Nurse Corps|Nurse Corps]] of the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]]. After receiving her commission in 1943, she was assigned in March of that year as a Ward Nurse at [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. In January 1944, she transferred, in a similar capacity, to the Naval Hospital, [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and in May 1945 joined the {{USS|Benevolence|AH-13|6}} That vessel, anchored off [[Eniwetok]], received the sick and wounded brought back from [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] operations against [[Japan]] and later joined the Third Fleet for its last strikes against the enemy.  After the cessation of hostilities, that hospital ship remained in Japanese waters, off [[Yokosuka]], to assist in the processing of liberated Allied [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].  The ''Benevolence'' returned to the United States with wounded servicemen in late 1945.  Assigned in January 1946 to the Naval Hospital, [[Great Lakes, Illinois]], Durek continued duty there until June of that year, when she was released from active naval service.&lt;ref name="OffBio"/&gt;

She attended the [[Frances Payne Bolton]] School of Nursing at [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], from which she received the degree of [[Bachelor of Science]] in Ward Management and Teaching, Medical and Surgical Nursing, in 1948.  Employed as Supervisor and Instructor, Medical Nursing, at Highland Park (Michigan) General Hospital, she remained there until 1951. While there, she joined a ready naval reserve unit in [[Detroit, Michigan]], in 1948.&lt;ref name="OffBio"/&gt;

Ordered to return to active naval service, she reported in June 1951, as a ward nurse at the Naval Hospital, [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Transferred in September 1951 to the Naval Hospital Corps School, Portsmouth, she was a Nursing Instructor there until October 1956, when she became Interservice Education Coordinatorat the Naval Horpital, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. From June 1958 to May 1961 she served as Nurse Programs Officer at the Naval Recruiting Station, [[Chicago, Illinois]], after which she had duty as Charge Nurse at the U. S. Naval Station Hospital, [[Subic Bay]], [[Republic of the Philippines]]. In April 1962 she was assigned as Assistant Chief Nurse at the U.S. Naval Hospital, [[Yokosuka (city)|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="OffBio"/&gt;

During the period May 1963 to June 1965 she was the Senior Nurse Corps Officer at the Naval Station Dispensary, [[Long Beach, California]].

==Personal Life and Retirement==
Having heard of her promotion to Rear Admiral on the radio in her car, a toll booth operator was the first person Duerk spoke to about it. But by the time she had gotten home, family was already calling and the press was waiting for her.&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt; From that time on, she felt that she was not only an admiral, she was a spokeswoman for all the women in the Navy. In that role, she frequently made appearances and statements in support of her Navy women, fighting for increases in pay, better conditions and recruiting nurses.&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt; 

After retirement, she joined the board of the Visiting Nurse Association in the early 1990s, which later became the Visiting Nurse Foundation in 1997, serving on the board for nearly 25 years. The board established the Admiral Alene Duerk Endowed Scholarship Fund at [[University of Central Florida]] in her honor.&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt;

Although she was very close to her family, Duerk never married or had children of her own.&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt;

Brivati is also currently director of The Stabilisation and Recovery Network, the objects of which are to carry out activities that contribute to the stabilisation and recovery efforts of post conflict states by delivering innovative projects through a network of likeminded individuals. The network develops projects that build good governance and the rule of law, combat corruption, aid the recovery of victims of sexual violence and counter the extremism that fuels conflict. The Network also works on related fields that contribute to building peaceful societies and consolidating representative governments while defending, promoting and extending human rights and enhancing gender equality and recovery for the survivors of conflict. They work through training and capacity building centred on individuals who are working in the field and who will join the network because of their direct experience. They work online in areas such as cyber security, combating online radicalisation and remote delivery of projects when and where this is appropriate. TSRN works in any geography in which the skills and the knowledge of their network can make a difference.

The '''Charter of Amiens''' ({{lang-fr|Charte d'Amiens}}) was adopted at the 9th Congress of the ''[[Confédération générale du travail]]'' (CGT) French trade-union, which took place in [[Amiens]] in October 1906. Its main proposal was the separation between the union movement and the political parties. The CGT was then dominated by [[anarcho-syndicalist]]s who preferred the constitution of an alternate system through the elaboration of workers' union rather than moderate reforms through the electoral path. The motion for the Charter was drafted by [[Victor Griffuelhes]], general secretary of the CGT, and [[Émile Pouget]]. The Charter was adopted by 830 participants, 8 having voted "no" and 1 abstained, and marked the victory of the current of [[revolutionary syndicalism]] in the CGT of the time.

== Aims ==

The Charter of Amiens assigned two aims to the [[workers' movement]]: the "defense of immediate and daily demands" and the "struggle for a global transformation of society in complete independence from political parties and from the state." By this Charter, the CGT explicitly recognized [[class struggle]]. Immediate goals included reduction of [[worktime]] (the [[8 hours day]]) and increase of wages. But the longer term goal was nothingless than "expropriation of the capitalists" through the means of a [[general strike]]. It considered the trade-union to be the future group of production and of social repartition and the basis for a social reorganization &amp;mdash; a main view of the [[syndicalism]] movement.

Considering that all [[employee]]s were submitted to the same [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[Social alienation|alienation]], both material and spiritual, it stated that it was a duty for all of them to belong to a trade-union. This, in turn, was followed by the proclamation of the complete freedom for its members to choose the form of political struggle (and, therefore, any party membership) which it deemed the fitter. In exchange, it requested for the union member not to introduce in the union opinions which it professed outside.

== Legacy ==
The Charter of Amiens has become a cornerstone of the unions' tradition in France and the guarantee of their autonomy from political parties, although after World War II and the creation of the social-democrat ''[[Force Ouvrière]]'' (FO) trade-union, close to the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and then to the [[French Socialist Party]] (PS), the CGT has maintained unofficial links with the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). The CGT, FO, the ''[[Union nationale des syndicats autonomes]]'' (UNSA), the ''[[Union syndicale Solidaires]]'', the ''[[Confédération nationale du travail]]'' (CNT), the [[FGAAC]] and the ''[[Fédération syndicale unitaire]]'' (FSU) today all claim as theirs the Charter of Amiens. The [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-AIT, founded in 1922, is the only one to reject the Charter, alleging that by proclaiming an autonomy between trade-unions and political parties it organizes the submission of the workers' union to parties. Furthermore, the CNT-AIT &amp;mdash; French section of the [[International Workers Association]] (IWA) &amp;mdash; which qualifies itself as an [[anarchist communist]] organization, also criticizes the formulation according to which the trade-union will become the future cell of social organization: in its views, in the event of an overhaul of [[Capitalism]], the trade-unions will be called to disappear lest they become organizations of control.&lt;ref name=CNTAIT&gt;[http://cnt-ait.info/article.php3?id_article=1241 La Charte d'Amiens est morte... ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025917/http://cnt-ait.info/article.php3?id_article=1241 |date=September 27, 2007 }}, website of the CNT-AIT, 12 June 2006 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3820">[[File:Zubrytsky Denys-1-.jpg|thumb|right|Denis Zubrytsky]]
'''Denis Ivanovych Zubrytsky''' ({{lang-uk|Дени́с Іва́нович Зубри́цький}}  (1777, Zhovka district, [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] (now [[Kamianka-Buzka Raion]], Ukraine) – January 16, 1862, [[Lviv|Lemberg]]), was the first Ukrainian historian in Galicia and a major early figure in the [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Galician Russophile movement]].&lt;ref name = "Encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages/Z/U/ZubrytskyDenys.htm Denys Zubrytsky, Encyclopedia of Ukraine] (1993). Volume 5. Article written by Roman Senkus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Denis Zubrytsky was born in 1777 into a family of [[Western Ukrainian Nobility|Ukrainian nobles]].&lt;ref name = "Subtelny"&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]]. (2000) ''Ukraine: A History''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 317&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating from Lviv's [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnazium]] in 1795 he worked as a civil servant.  In his youth he had been pro-Polish, and had even supported Napoleon's invasion of Austria-Hungary; in 1809 he served as a secretary to the pro-French Polish forces who occupied the city. Later in his life Zubrytsky became very hostile to Polish interests and an ardent supporter of Russophilism.&lt;ref name = "HimkaRus"&gt;John-Paul Himka. (2001). The Construction of Nationality in Galician Rus': Icarian Flights in Almost All Directions. In ''Intellectuals and the Articulation of the Nation '' (Ronald Grigor Suny, Michael D. Kennedy, Eds.) Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press pg. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1829 and 1847 he held various positions within the [[Stauropegion Institute]], an important cultural and historical institution in western Ukraine that served as a bastion of Russophilism.  In 1842 he became a corresponding member of the St. Petersburg Archeological Commission and in 1855 he became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1843 he was commissioned to organize the [[Lviv]] municipal archive.&lt;ref name = "Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Works and ideas==

Zubrytsky was highly influenced by his friend, [[Mikhail Pogodin]], and his idea that Ukrainians and Russian constituted one nation. During his time Austria and Russia were allies and Zubrytsky idealized Russian autocracy while also being loyal to Austria-Hungary.  He opposed the Polish nobility and the Polish domination of Galicia while also objecting to the abolition of serfdom.&lt;ref name = "Encyclopedia"/&gt; Through Zubrytsky's efforts many Galicians, such as [[Yakiv Holovatsky]], one of the members of the Ruthenian Triad, were converted to Russophilism.&lt;ref name = "Subtelny"/&gt;

Denis Zubrytsky published numerous historical works.  His most significant work, written in the Russian language, was the ''History of the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia'', written in 1852 and 1855. He also published articles on Galician folk songs, histories of the Ruthenian people and church figures in medieval times, and other historical articles.&lt;ref name = "Encyclopedia"/&gt; According to a letter Zubtrytsky wrote to Mikhail Pogodin, the purpose of his historical research was to acquaint Galicians (western Ukrainians) with Russian history and with the Russian language.&lt;ref&gt;Serhiy Plokhy. (2005). ''Unmaking imperial Russia: Mykhailo Hrushevsky and the writing of Ukrainian history'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp.161-162&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earl Oliver''' (born June 23, 1948) is an American writer, musician, [[variety act|variety]], [[street entertainer]], and [[graphic artist]]. An accomplished [[blues]] and [[jazz]] guitarist and singer in [[Northern California]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], popularly known as the '''Walkin' Blues Man''', he hosted a popular [[public-access television|cable-access television program]], "Earl Oliver &amp; Friends: Live from LaVal's", later called "Live on Location", that aired in 16 stations throughout the region from 1992 to 1995. He has also been the lead vocalist for several California-based bands, most recently, the Groovinators.

From May, 2005 until August, 2013, Oliver was a regular performer on the [[Skunk Train]], a [[heritage railway]] which runs daily from [[Fort Bragg, California|Fort Bragg]] and [[Willits, California]], and at events such as the Palo Alto Art Walk and [[Project Read]] for the [[San Francisco Public Library]]. In 2001, he was called "one of San Francisco's undiscovered treasures" by ''San Francisco Arts Magazine''.

The nephew of [[professional wrestler]] [[Rip Oliver|Rip "The Crippler" Oliver]], Oliver is a longtime wrestling columnist and historian. He is perhaps best known in the [[internet wrestling community]] as the founder of [[#Solie's Vintage Wrestling|Solie's Vintage Wrestling]], a [[history of professional wrestling|historical professional wrestling website]] dedicated to the memory of announcer [[Gordon Solie]], which is the oldest continually active pro wrestling website on the internet.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Earl Oliver was born in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], but later moved with his family to [[Southern California]]. At age 14, Oliver began playing as a professional musician and in 1969 moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he performed at local [[jazz]] and rock music [[night clubs]] such as ''The Melting Pot'', ''La Bohème'', ''The Vintner'', ''Family Farmacy'', and the ''Seventh Seal Coffee-House'' by the early-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jazz, Rock This Weekend |first= |last= |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 2, 1973 |url=http://www.solie.org/1970s.gif |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying music, he was given singing lessons from one-time [[Metropolitan Opera]] [[diva]] Margo Weiss.&lt;ref name="Blake"&gt;{{cite news |title=Night Out |author=Blake, Bill |newspaper=San Fernando Valley Daily News |date=October 2, 1989 |url=http://www.solie.org/niteout.gif |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became involved in [[stage actor|stage acting]] within a few years with memorable performances in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[George M!]]'' and ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' at the Glendale Center, as well performing as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] at ''[[The Magic Castle]]''. In 1977, he portrayed the "evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]" in ''[[Aladdin]]'' at [[Pamela Kosh|Pamela and Walter Gilmore]]'s Golden Mall Playhouse. Around this time, he began producing a variety show, ''The Showcase'', which included musicians, singers, comics, [[clowns]], [[fire eaters]], [[poetry reading|poetry readers]] and other entertainers. It was very successful on the night club circuit, being regularly featured at ''the Horn'' in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], and received praise from the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' in July 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earl Oliver's Showcase A Hit |author=Lenow, Mark |newspaper=[[LA Weekly]] |date=July 22, 1979 |url=http://www.solie.org/lawkly.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and television career===
In the 1980s, Oliver returned to the music scene finding limited success with the bands ''JUMP CITY'' and ''The Sphere''. He also entered the recording business producing [[radio advertisements]] for local camera stores and shoe emporiums, doing [[voice over]]s and writing [[jingles|advertising jingles]]. Also during this time, he began developing the stage persona of "a blues shouting, guitar playing" singer called the "Walkin' Blues Man". The character would become a familiar sight at countless parades, music and art festivals, county fairs, farmers markets and other outdoor events throughout the [[West Coast of the United States]] and in Canada for the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Walkin' Blues Man lights up the parade! |author= Carl Kress|newspaper=Orinda Post |date=September 20, 1993 |url=http://www.solie.org/press.html |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the decade, Oliver had also developed a unique [[variety act]] by incorporating [[magic (illusion)|magic]] into his musical performances, such as draping a scarf over his guitar at the end of his set and making it disappear, which was favorably reviewed by the ''San Fernando Valley Daily News'' in October 1989.&lt;ref name="Blake"/&gt; In 1992, Oliver began producing a monthly cable-access television program, "Earl Oliver &amp; Friends: Live from LaVal's", later called "Live on Location", which featured variety acts at ''La Val's Subterranean'' basement club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Night Life: Dancing/Clubs/Comedy |newspaper=Express |date=April 2, 1993 |url=http://www.solie.org/1990s.gif |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show became very popular in San Francisco and was eventually broadcast in 16 stations throughout the region until 1995.

===Internet writing===
Oliver held a number of entertainment and music-related occupations throughout his life including as a disk jockey, [[carnival barker]], [[broadcast journalist]], [[answering service|answering service operator]], [[voice artist]], and [[ring announcer]]. However, he was primarily employed as a [[graphic artist|graphic production artist]] and later, with rise of the internet during the 1990s, as a [[web designer]] and [[corporate trainer]].

As a young man, he developed an interest in [[professional wrestling]], being the nephew of [[Rip Oliver|Rip "The Crippler" Oliver]], and was especially a fan of famed ''[[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]'' [[play-by-play announcer]] [[Gordon Solie]]. In 1995, Oliver started a website in his honor, Solie's Vintage Wrestling, dedicated to the [[history of professional wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pro Wrestling's Heart and Solie The voice of Florida wrestling, Gordon Solie, takes the Internet to the mat, and vice versa. |author=Gotlieb, Andy |newspaper=[[Tampa Tribune]] |date=May 29, 1997 |url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/Nos.768-773.htm |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of its kind at the time of its opening and remains the oldest professional wrestling website still active. He was also the editor of the weekly ''Solie's Wrestling Newsletter'' from 1996 to 2003.

In addition to Solie's Vintage Wrestling, Oliver has also occasionally contributed to WrestlingClassics.com and was later interviewed in The Wrestling Channel Radio Network's first original production ''Jeremy Hartley's Up Close and Personal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/Nos.201-207.html |title=The Wrestling Channel Radio Network! |year=1998 |work=The WAWLI Papers No. 202 |publisher=WrestlingClassics.com |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he publicly criticized [[Canoe.ca|SLAM!

===Recent years===
In 2001, he was called "one of San Francisco's undiscovered treasures" by ''San Francisco Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Jasai |date=December 2001 |title=Rue De Nouveau, Music Info from the Streets of the Bay Area |magazine=San Francisco Arts Magazine |publisher=Sheilah Boothby |volume=1 |issue=12 |pages= |url=http://www.sanfranciscoartmagazine.com/2001/december/rue/rue.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020419225502/http://www.sanfranciscoartmagazine.com/2001/december/rue/rue.html |archivedate=April 19, 2002 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003 he moved to Fort Bragg, California where Oliver and his wife Lonna settled in a 90-year-old farmhouse. After being [[laid off]] from [[IKON Office Solutions]]' [[Print on Demand|Print on Demand Division]] in 2005, Oliver left the corporate world to become a full-time musician and writer. In his familiar "Walkin' Blues Man" act, he has appeared at such civic events such as the Palo Alto Art Walk and [[Project Read]] for the [[San Francisco Public Library]]. He has been a regular performer on the [[Skunk Train]], an [[heritage railway]] running between [[Fort Bragg, California|Fort Bragg]] and [[Willits, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/carl/SkunkTrain/SkunkTrainFortBragg.html |title=Skunk Train at Fort Bragg, CA. |date=June 2005 |work=Carl's TrainWeb Reports and Travelogues |publisher=TrainWeb.org |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on hand with Greg Schindel, The Trainsinger and The Black Bart Gunfighters to celebrate its 120th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Skunk Train celebrates 120th anniversary |author=Hartzell, Frank |newspaper=Fort Bragg Advocate-News |date=July 1, 2005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver also formed a partnership with Mendocino Coast music legend, Butch Kwan, releasing the ''Skunk Train Blues'' album, and performed together for over two years appearing at the 2004 and 2006 Caspar World Folk Festival, "Art in the Gardens" at the [[North Coast Regional Botanic Garden|North Coast Botanical Gardens]], and headlined the 12th annual "Local Licks Live" concert sponsored by [[KOZT|KOZT 95.3 FM]]. Beginning in 2005, they were regular performers at Fort Bragg's annual "World's Largest Salmon BarBQ". In recent years, he has revisited several of these events as the lead vocalist for The Groovinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theseaokies.com/theseaokies/the_Sea_Okies.html |title=Those who came had fun, fish, fireworks and fog |author=Dowd, Harvey |date=July 11, 2009 |work=Fort Bragg Advocate |publisher=TheSeaOkies.com |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mendocinostories.com/MUSIC_Groovinators.html |title=The Groovinators |editor=DeMatteo, Pattie |year=2010 |work=Music |publisher=MendocinoStories.com |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2010, and again on May 26, 2012, Oliver sang with the Symphony of the Redwoods during their annual POPS Benefit Concerts. At the 2012 concert, Earl was asked to perform with the orchestra for the finale of the show, a "Tribute to Old Blues Eyes" medley of Frank Sinatra hits.&lt;ref&gt;

'''George Grantham''' (also George W. Grantham) (born May 11, 1941) is an American economic historian and Emeritus Professor at [[McGill University]]. His contribution to economics has focused mainly on the agricultural development, particularly of the French rural economy in the 18th and 19th centuries. For many years before his retirement in 2009, he was a prominent teacher of economics at McGill University and in 2000 he was awarded the [[Cliometric Society]]'s annual prize – the Clio Can for exceptional support to the field of [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2012.749745?journalCode=rfec20 ''Feminist Economics'', Volume 18, Issue 4, 2012, Notes on Contributors (Accessed Jan 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/node/2728 Economic History Association:EH.NET] (Accessed Dec 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cliometrics.org/awards.htm Cliometrics Society: Awards] (Accessed Dec 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaidarforum.ru/en/news/en/george-grantham-professor-at-mcgill-university-canada-to-take-part-in-gaidar-forum-2013/ Gaidar Forum /January 16–19, 2013, ''Russia and the World: Challenges of Integration'':George Grantham] (Accessed Jan 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GlobalHeritageNetworkcover.jpg|thumb |alt=Global Heritage Network |The Global Heritage Network: Threat Monitoring &amp; Collaborative Solutions for Cultural Heritage Sites in the Developing World]]

'''Global Heritage Network (GHN)''', established by [[Global Heritage Fund]] (GHF), was created in response to the damage and destruction facing cultural heritage sites throughout the developing world. GHN is an online multimedia platform that uses Google Earth and [[social networking]] for threat monitoring and collaborative preservation of those sites. GHN features an [[online community]] for networking and discussion of possible solutions, while critical support and software for the platform have been donated by [[Google]], [[DigitalGlobe]], [[Autodesk]], [[Ashtech]], [[Exelis Visual Information Solutions]] and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]].&lt;ref name=ghnaboutus&gt;[http://globalheritagefund.org/gh_network/about Global Heritage Network (GHN): About GHN] Retrieved on June 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network==

===Sites===
—
GHN consists of an extensive database (GHN Sites) of approximately 650 globally significant sites in the developing world color-coded by threat level: Destroyed (Black), Rescue Needed (Red), At Risk (Yellow), Stable (Green). Each site contains a profile with background information, photos, documentation, maps, videos and satellite imagery. GHN's partnership with [[DigitalGlobe]] ensures that these sites are updated frequently with recent satellite imagery.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2011-04-15-archeology-satellites_N.htm USA Today: Spy satellites watch ancient ruins] Retrieved on June 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

GHN invites global conservation experts and local stakeholders to become site coordinators, which entails guiding a GHN site through a program of investigation, planning, scientific conservation, community development, and partnerships.&lt;ref name=ghnsc&gt;[http://globalheritagefund.org/gh_network/site_coordinator_description Global Heritage Network (GHN): Site Coordinators] Retrieved on June 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
″°

===Community===

GHN has also incorporated a customized social network (GHN Community) that provides site-based and thematic discussion groups, composed of national governments, local communities, professional archaeologists, conservators and other concerned parties.&lt;ref name="ghnaboutus"/&gt;

===Library===

Lastly, the GHN library houses a collection of heritage preservation-related electronic documents including bibliographies, management plans, guidelines, case studies held in the GHN Library.&lt;ref name=ghnlibrary&gt;[http://ghn.globalheritagefund.org/library.php Global Heritage Network (GHN): Library] Retrieved on June 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Egon Friedlander'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n80060339}}&lt;/ref&gt; (24 September 1930 – 17 October 2012) was a German-American Jewish historian of [[the Holocaust]] noted for his arguments in favor of broadening the scope of casualties of the Holocaust.

Born in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], to a [[Jew]]ish family, Friedlander moved to the [[United States]] in 1947 as a survivor of Auschwitz,&lt;ref name = obit&gt;{{cite news |title= Death Notice: Henry Friedlander |url= http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=henry-friedlander&amp;pid=160547867&amp;fhid=10909 |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= 21 October 2012 |accessdate= 22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining his BA in history at [[Temple University]] in 1953 and his MA and PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1954 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second Generation. Émigrés from Nazi Germany as Historians|last=Daum|first=Andreas W., ed.|publisher=Berghahn|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78238-985-9|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975 until his retirement in 2001, Friedlander served as a professor in the department of Judaic studies at Brooklyn College of the [[City University of New York]].

==Personal life==
Son of physician Bernhard Fritz Friedländer and Ruth Friedländer, née Löwenthal,&lt;ref&gt;http://scans.hebis.de/21/06/38/21063814_toc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Friedlander was married to fellow historian [[Sybil Milton]] (1941–2000),&lt;ref name = obit/&gt; who has a [[German Studies Association]] memorial prize named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Sybil Halpern Milton Memorial Book Prize |url= http://www.thegsa.org/prizes/milton.html |publisher= [[German Studies Association]] |accessdate= 23 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the Holocaust==
Friedlander argued that three groups should be considered victims of the Holocaust, namely Jews, [[Romani people|Romani]], and the mentally and physically disabled,&lt;ref&gt;[[#J1994|Friedlander 1994]], p.&amp;nbsp;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1431896 495].&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the latter were Nazism's first victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#J1997|Friedlander 1997]], p.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinions concerning the inclusion of both the disabled and Romani as victims of the Holocaust often gave rise to intense debates with those, such as the Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]], who argued that only Jews should be considered victims of the Holocaust.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Like Friedlander, Sybil Milton supported a more expansive, inclusive definition of the Holocaust, arguing against the "exclusivity of emphasis on Judeocide in most Holocaust literature [that] has generally excluded Gypsies (as well as blacks and the handicapped) from equal consideration",{{sfn|Milton|1991|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/494697 375]}} and exchanging views on the topic with [[Yehuda Bauer]].{{sfn|Bauer|Milton|1992}}

According to Friedlander, the origins of the Holocaust can be traced to the coming together of two lines of Nazi policies: the [[antisemitic]] policies of the Nazi regime, and its "racial cleansing" policies that led to the [[Action T4]] program.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Arguing that the ultimate origins of the Holocaust came from the T4 program, he pointed to the fact that both the poison gas and the crematoria were originally deployed in the T4 program in 1939.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} It was only later, in 1941, that the experts from the T4 program were imported by the SS to help design, and later run, the death camps for the Jews of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Friedlander did not deny the importance of the Nazi's antisemitic ideology, but, in his view, the T4 program was the crucial seed that gave birth to the Holocaust.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The '''Historic Places Act 1954''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. It established the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] for the purpose of preserving, marking and recording places of historic interest in New Zealand. The organisation has since been renamed to [[Heritage New Zealand]].

One of the early structures that was covered by a heritage order was the [[Pencarrow Head Lighthouse]] at the entrance to [[Wellington Harbour]], which was added to the register at its centenary in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The lighthouse and its surroundings |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/pencarrow-lighthouse/lighthouse-and-surroundings |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=31 October 2018 |date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Uganda}}
The '''history of Uganda since 11 April 1979''' comprises the [[history of Uganda]] since the end of the [[Uganda under Idi Amin|dictatorship]] of [[Idi Amin]]. This period has seen the second rule of [[Milton Obote]] and the presidency of [[Yoweri Museveni]] since 1986, in which Ugandan politics have been dominated by the [[National Resistance Movement]].

==Uganda after Amin==

===Interim period===

A month before the liberation of [[Kampala]], during the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]], representatives of twenty-two Ugandan civilian and military groups were hastily called together at Moshi, Tanzania, to try to agree on an interim civilian government once Amin was removed. Called the [[Unity Conference]] in the hope that unity might prevail, it managed to establish the [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF) as political representative of the UNLA. [[Yusuf Lule]], former principal of [[Makerere University]], became head of the UNLF executive committee. 

As an academic rather than a politician, Lule was not regarded as a threat to any of the contending factions. Shortly after Amin's departure, Lule and the UNLF moved to Kampala, where they established an interim government. Lule became president, advised by a temporary parliament, the [[National Consultative Council]] (NCC). The NCC, in turn, was composed of representatives from the Unity Conference.

Conflict surfaced immediately between Lule and some of the more radical of the council members who saw him as too conservative, too autocratic, and too willing as a [[Muganda]] to listen to advice from other [[Baganda]]. After only three months, with the apparent approval of [[Julius Nyerere]], whose troops still controlled Kampala, Lule was forcibly removed from office and exiled. He was replaced by [[Godfrey Binaisa]], a Muganda like Lule, but one who had previously served as a high-ranking member of [[Milton Obote]]'s UPC. 

It was not an auspicious start to the rebuilding of a new Uganda, which required political and economic stability. Indeed, the quarrels within the NCC, which Binaisa enlarged to 127 members, revealed that many rival and would-be politicians who had returned from exile were resuming their self-interested operating styles. Ugandans who endured the deprivations of the Amin era became even more disillusioned with their leaders. Binaisa managed to stay in office longer than Lule, but his inability to gain control over a burgeoning new military presence proved to be his downfall.

The [[Military of Uganda|armed forces]] numbered fewer than 1,000 troops who had fought alongside the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to expel Amin. The army had shrunk to the size of the original [[King's African Rifles]] at independence in 1962. But in 1979, in an attempt to consolidate support for the future, leaders such as [[Yoweri Kaguta Museveni]] and Major General (later Chief of Staff) [[David Oyite Ojok]] began to enrol thousands of recruits grew to 8,000; Ojok's original 600 became 24,000. When Binaisa sought to curb the use of these militias, which were harassing and detaining political opponents, he was overthrown in a military coup on 10 May 1980. 

The coup was engineered by Ojok, Museveni, and others acting under the general direction of [[Paulo Muwanga]], Obote's right-hand man and chair of the [[Military Commission]]. The TPDF was still providing necessary security while Uganda's police force, which had been all but destroyed by Amin, was rebuilt, but Nyerere refused to help Binaisa retain power. Many Ugandans claimed that although Nyerere did not impose his own choice on Uganda, he indirectly facilitated the return to power of his old friend and ally, [[Milton Obote]]. In any case, the Military Commission headed by Muwanga effectively governed Uganda during the six months leading up to the national elections of December 1980.

Further evidence of the militarization of Ugandan politics was provided by the proposed expenditures of the newly empowered Military Commission. Security and defense were to be allotted more than 30 percent of the national revenues. For a country desperately seeking funds for economic recovery from the excesses of the previous military regime, this allocation seemed unreasonable to civilian leaders.

Shortly after Muwanga's 1980 coup, Obote made a triumphant return from Tanzania. In the months before the December elections, he began to rally his former UPC supporters. Ominously, in view of recent Ugandan history, he often appeared on the platform with General [[Oyite-Ojok]], a fellow [[Langi people|Lango]]. Obote also began to speak of the need to return to a UPC one-party state.

The national election on 10 December 1980 was a crucial turning point for Uganda. It was, after all, the first election in eighteen years. Several parties contested, the most important of which were Obote's UPC and the DP led by [[Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere]]. Most of Uganda's Roman Catholics were DP members, along with many others whose main concern was to prevent the return of another Obote regime. Because the Military Commission, as the acting government, was dominated by Obote supporters (notably chairman [[Paulo Muwanga]]), the DP and other contenders faced formidable obstacles. By election day, the UPC had achieved some exceptional advantages, summarized by Minority Rights Group Report Number 66 as follows: Seventeen UPC candidates were declared "unopposed" by the simple procedure of not allowing DP or other candidates to run against them. 

Fourteen district commissioners, who were expected to supervise local polling, were replaced with UPC nominees. The chief justice of Uganda, to whom complaints of election irregularities would have to be made, was replaced with a UPC member. In a number of districts, non-UPC candidates were arrested, and one was murdered. Even before the election, the government press and Radio Uganda appeared to treat the UPC as the victor. Muwanga insisted that each party have a separate ballot box on election day, thus negating the right of secret ballot. There were a number of other moves to aid the UPC, including Muwanga's statement that the future parliament would also contain an unspecified number of unelected representatives of the army and other interest groups.

Polling appeared to be heavy on election day, and by the end of the voting, the DP, on the basis of its own estimates, declared victory in 81 of 126 constituencies. The British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America broadcast the news of the DP triumph, and Kampala's streets were filled with DP celebrants. At this point, Muwanga seized control of the Electoral Commission, along with the power to count the ballots, and declared that anyone disputing his count would be subject to a heavy fine and five years in jail. Eighteen hours later, Muwanga announced a UPC victory, with 72 seats. Some DP candidates claimed the ballot boxes were simply switched to give their own vote tally to the UPC runner-up. 

Nevertheless, a small contingent of neutral election watchers, the [[Commonwealth Observer Group]], declared itself satisfied with the validity of the election. Some Ugandans criticized the Commonwealth Observer Group, suggesting that members of the group measured African elections by different standards than those used elsewhere or that they feared civil war if the results were questioned. Indeed, popular perception of a stolen election actually helped bring about the civil war the Commonwealth Observer Group may have feared.

===Second Obote period: 1981&amp;ndash;1985===
{{See also|Ugandan Bush War}}

In February 1981, shortly after the new Obote government took office, with [[Paulo Muwanga]] as vice president and minister of defense, a former Military Commission member, [[Yoweri Museveni]], and his armed supporters declared themselves the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA). Museveni vowed to overthrow Obote by means of a popular rebellion, and what became known as "the war in the bush" began. Several other underground groups also emerged to attempt to sabotage the new regime, but they were eventually crushed. Museveni, who had guerilla war experience with the [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (Frente de Libertaçâo de Moçambique—Frelimo), campaigned in rural areas hostile to Obote's government, especially central and western [[Buganda]] and the western regions of [[Ankole]] and [[Bunyoro]].

The Obote government's four-year military effort to destroy its challengers resulted in vast areas of devastation and greater loss of life than during the eight years of Amin's rule. UNLA's many [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Lango]] had been hastily enrolled with minimal training and little sense of discipline. Although they were survivors of Amin's genocidal purges of north-east Uganda, in the 1980s they were armed and in uniform, conducting similar actions against Bantu-speaking Ugandans in the south, with whom they appeared to feel no empathy or even pity. 

In early 1983, to eliminate rural support for Museveni's guerrillas the area of [[Luwero]] District, north of Kampala, was targeted for a massive population removal affecting almost 750,000 people. These artificially created refugees were packed into several internment camps subject to military control, which in reality meant military abuse. Civilians outside the camps, in what came to be known as the "Luwero Triangle," were presumed to be guerrillas or guerilla sympathizers and were treated accordingly. The farms of this highly productive agricultural area were looted—roofs, doors, and even door frames were stolen by UNLA troops. Civilian loss of life was extensive, as evidenced some years later by piles of human skulls in bush clearings and alongside rural roads.

The army also concentrated on the north-western corner of Uganda, in what was then West Nile District. Bordering Sudan, West Nile had provided the ethnic base for much of Idi Amin's earlier support and had enjoyed relative prosperity under his rule. Having borne the brunt of Amin's anti-Acholi massacres in previous years, Acholi soldiers avenged themselves on inhabitants of Amin's home region, whom they blamed for their losses. In one famous incident in June 1981, Ugandan Army soldiers attacked a Catholic mission where local refugees had sought sanctuary. When the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) reported a subsequent massacre, the government expelled it from Uganda.

Despite these activities, Obote's government, unlike Amin's regime, was sensitive to its international image and realized the importance of securing foreign aid for the nation's economic recovery. Obote had sought and followed the advice of the [[International Monetary Fund]], even though the austerity measures ran counter to his own ideology. He devalued the Uganda shilling by 100 percent, attempted to facilitate the export of cash crops, and postponed any plans he may once have entertained for re-establishing one-party rule. The continued sufferance of the DP, although much harried and abused by UPC stalwarts, became an important symbol to international donors. The government's inability to eliminate Museveni and win the civil war, however, sapped its economic strength, and the occupation of a large part of the country by an army hostile to the Ugandans living there furthered discontent with the regime. 

Abductions by the police, as well as the detentions and disappearances so characteristic of the Amin period, recurred. In place of torture at the infamous [[State Research Bureau (organisation)|State Research Bureau]] at [[Nakasero]], victims met the same fate at so-called "Nile Mansions." [[Amnesty International]], a human rights organization, issued a chilling report of routine torture of civilian detainees at military barracks scattered across southern Uganda. The overall death toll from 1981 to 1985 was estimated as high as 500,000. Obote, once seen by the donor community as the one man with the experience and will to restore Uganda's fortunes, now appeared to be a liability to recovery.

In this deteriorating military and economic situation, Obote subordinated other matters to a military victory over Museveni. [[North Korea]]n military advisers were invited to take part against the NRA rebels in what was to be a final campaign that won neither British nor United States approval. But the army was warweary, and after the death of the highly capable General [[Oyite Ojok]] in a helicopter accident at the end of 1983, it began to split along ethnic lines. Acholi soldiers complained that they were given too much front-line action and too few rewards for their services. 

Obote delayed appointing a successor to Oyite Ojok for as long as possible. In the end, he appointed a Lango to the post and attempted to counter the objection of Acholi officers by spying on them, reviving his old paramilitary counterweight, the mostly Langi Special Force Units, and thus repeating some of the actions that led to his overthrow by Amin. As if determined to replay the January 1971 events, Obote once again left the capital after giving orders for the arrest of a leading Acholi commander, Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], who mobilized troops and entered Kampala on 27 July 1985. Obote, together with a large entourage, fled the country for Zambia. This time, unlike the last, Obote allegedly took much of the national treasury with him.

===Return of Military Rule (1985-1986)===
The military government of General [[Tito Okello]] ruled from July 1985 to January 1986 with no explicit policy except the natural goal of self-preservation—the motive for their defensive coup. To stiffen the flagging efforts of his army against the NRA, Okello invited former soldiers of Amin's army to re-enter Uganda from the Sudanese refugee camps and participate in the civil war on the government side. As mercenaries fresh to the scene, these units fought well, but they were equally interested in looting and did not discriminate between supporters and enemies of the government. The reintroduction of Amin's infamous cohorts was poor international public relations for the Okello government and helped create a new tolerance of Museveni and the NRM/A.

Okello could hardly expect to govern the entire country with only war-weary and disillusioned [[Acholi]] troops to back him. From August to December 1985, the Okello government attempted to negotiate a peace deal with Museveni, the [[Nairobi Agreement, 1985|Nairobi Agreement]]. The resulting ceasefire broke down almost immediately. With Okello and the remnants of the UNLA army thoroughly discouraged, Museveni had only to wait for the regime to disintegrate. 

In January 1986, welcomed enthusiastically by the local civilian population, Museveni moved against Kampala. Okello and his soldiers fled northward to their ethnic base in [[Acholiland]]. [[Yoweri Museveni]] formally claimed the presidency on 29 January 1986. Immense problems of reconstruction awaited the new regime.

==1986 to present ==
A referendum was held in March 2000 on whether Uganda should retain the Movement system or adopt multi-party politics. Although 70% of voters endorsed retention of the Movement system, the referendum was widely criticized for low voter turnout and unfair restrictions on Movement opponents. Museveni was reelected to a second five-year term in March 2001. Parliamentary elections were held in June 2001, and more than 50% of contested seats were won by newcomers. Movement supporters nevertheless remained in firm control of the legislative branch. Observers believed that the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections generally reflected the will of the electorate; however, both were marred by serious irregularities, particularly in the period leading up to the elections, such as restrictions on political party activities, incidents of violence, voter intimidation, and fraud. 

In 2001 the [[Constitutional Review Commission]] (CRC) began soliciting opinions and holding public hearings on amending the 1995 Constitution. The CRC was set up to examine the constitutional provisions relating to sovereignty, political systems, democracy and good governance. Its report, scheduled for release by October 2003, has not yet been delivered to Cabinet or made public. The Cabinet, however, presented a list of its suggestions for constitutional change to the CRC in September. These changes included the introduction of a full multiparty system, an increase in executive authority vis-à-vis the other branches, and the lifting of presidential term limits. The elimination of term limits would clear the way for Museveni to run again in 2006, and there are increasing signs that he wishes to do so. However, this proposal has also produced significant controversy and it is not yet clear when or how the constitution will be changed. 

The bizarre and cult-like [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) continues to harass government forces and murder and kidnap civilians in the north and east. Although the LRA does not threaten the stability of the government, LRA violence has displaced 1.2 million people and created a humanitarian crisis. At least 20,000 children have also been abducted over the years. The [[Uganda Peoples Defense Force]] (UPDF) launched "Operation Iron Fist" against LRA rebels in northern Uganda in 2002 and conducted operations against LRA sanctuaries in southern Sudan with the permission of the Sudanese Government. Uganda and Sudan have resumed diplomatic relations and exchanged Ambassadors; however, Uganda continues to accuse Sudan of supporting the LRA. Sudan denies the allegations.

In 1998, Uganda deployed a sizable military force to eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), ostensibly to prevent attacks from Ugandan rebel groups operating there. There were widespread allegations that Ugandan military and civilian officials were involved in the illegal exploitation of DRC natural resources. After much international pressure, Uganda withdrew its troops from DRC in June 2003.

On 14 November 2004 it was reported that the President had declared a week-long truce with the rebels that was to begin the following day.

In August 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5% supported restoring multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or "movement system". 

In October 2005 [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's main political rival, returned from exile. The same month, another of Museveni's rivals, Milton Obote, died in South Africa, and was given a state funeral in Kampala.

The [[Ugandan general election, 2006|February 2006 elections]], the first multiparty elections in 25 years, were held with Besigye's [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC) as the main challenger to Museveni's [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM). NRM won most seats in the [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]], and Museveni won the presidency.

On 20 August 2007, Uganda declared that it is seeking legal advice on setting a [[war crime]]s court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6954860.stm |title=Uganda considers war crimes court |accessdate=20 August 2007 |format= |work=BBC News | date=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2011, US President Obama authorized the deployment to Uganda of approximately 100 combat-equipped US forces to help regional forces "remove from the battlefield" – meaning capture or kill – Lord’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and senior leaders of the LRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tapper|first=Jake|title=Obama Sends 100 US Troops to Uganda to Help Combat Lord’s Resistance Army|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-sends-100-us-troops-to-uganda-to-combat-lords-resistance-army/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knot]]s and '''knotting''' have been used and studied throughout '''[[history]]'''. For example, [[Chinese knotting]] is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the Tang and Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) in China, later popularized in the Ming. [[Knot theory]] is the recent mathematical study of [[unknot]]s.

Knots of ancient origin include the [[bottle sling]], [[bowline]], [[cat's paw (knot)|cat's paw]], [[clove hitch]], [[cow hitch]], [[double fisherman's knot]], [[eskimo bowline]], [[figure-eight knot]], [[fisherman's knot]], [[half hitch]], [[kalmyk loop]], [[one-sided overhand bend]], [[overhand knot]], [[overhand loop]], [[reef knot]], [[running bowline]], [[single hitch]], [[thief knot]], [[Turk's head knot]], and [[two half-hitches]].

The eleven main knots of Chinese knotting are the four-flower knot, six-flower knot, [[Chinese button knot]], [[Matthew Walker knot|double connection knot]], [[carrick bend|double coin knot]], agemaki, [[friendship knot|cross knot]], square knot, Plafond knot, [[endless knot|Pan Chang knot]], and the good luck knot.

Knots of more recent origin include the [[friendship knot]] of Chinese knotting. The [[sheepshank|sheepshank knot]] originates from 1627 while the [[Western Union splice]] originates from the beginning of [[telegraphy]].

The '''history of the Caribbean''' reveals the significant role the region played in the [[Colonialism|colonial]] struggles of the [[Europe]]an powers since the 15th century. In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|landed in the Caribbean]] and claimed the region for [[Spain]]. The First Spanish settlements were established in the Caribbean starting in 1493. Although the Spanish conquests of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|Aztec empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca empire|Inca empire]] in the early sixteenth century made [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]] more desirable places for Spanish exploration and settlement, the Caribbean remained strategically important.

Beginning in the 1620s and 1630s, non-Hispanic [[privateer]]s, traders, and settlers established permanent colonies and trading posts on islands neglected by Spain. Such colonies spread throughout the Caribbean, from the Bahamas in the North West to Tobago in the South East. In addition, beginning in the 1620s, French and English [[buccaneer]]s settled in places like the island of Tortuga, the northern and western coasts of Hispaniola, and later in Jamaica.

After the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in the early 19th century, only the islands of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] remained part of the Spanish Empire in the [[New World]]. In the 20th century the [[Caribbean]] was again important during [[World War II]], in the [[decolonization]] wave after the war, and in the tension between Communist Cuba and the United States. Genocide, slavery, immigration, and rivalry between world powers have given Caribbean history an impact disproportionate to its size.

The islands were then repopulated by successive waves of invaders travelling south to north from initial bases in the [[Orinoco River]] valley. Between 400 and {{nowrap|200 BC}}, the [[Saladoid people|Saladoid]] spread north from Trinidad, introducing agriculture and ceramic pottery. Sometime after {{nowrap|AD 250}}, the [[Barrancoid people|Barrancoid]] followed and replaced them on Trinidad. This society's settlements in the Orinoco collapsed around 650 and another group, the [[Arauquinoid people|Arauquinoid]] (the later "[[Taíno]]" or "[[Arawak people#History|Arawaks]]"), expanded into the area and northward along the island chain. Around 1200 or 1300, a twentieth group, the [[Mayoid people|Mayoid]] (the later "[[Island Caribs#History|Caribs]]"), entered Trinidad. They remained dominant until the Spanish conquest.

At the time of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] arrival, three major [[Amerindian]] [[indigenous peoples]] lived on the islands: the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] in the [[Greater Antilles]], [[Bahamas|The Bahamas]] and the Leeward Islands; the [[Island Caribs]] and [[Galibi]] in the [[Windward Islands]]; and the [[Ciboney]] in western [[Cuba]]. The Taínos are subdivided into Classic Taínos, who occupied Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, Western Taínos, who occupied Cuba, Jamaica, and the arabian archipelago, and the Eastern Taínos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Irving. ''The Tainos : Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus'' {{ISBN|0-300-05696-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups.

New scientific [[DNA]] studies have changed some of the traditional beliefs about pre-Columbian indigenous history. [[Juan Martinez Cruzado]], a geneticist from the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez]] designed an island-wide DNA survey of [[Puerto Rico]]'s people. According to conventional historical belief, Puerto Ricans have mainly Spanish ethnic origins, with some African ancestry, and distant and less significant indigenous ancestry. Cruzado's research revealed surprising results in 2003. It found that, in fact, 61% of all Puerto Ricans have Amerindian mitochondrial DNA, 27% have African and 12% Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kearns|first=Rick|title=Indigenous Puerto Rico:  DNA evidence upsets established history|journal=Issues in Caribbean Amerindian Studies|date=Jun 2003 – Jun 2004|volume=V|issue=2|url=http://www.centrelink.org/KearnsDNA.html|accessdate=March 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302041407/http://www.centrelink.org/KearnsDNA.html|archivedate=March 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early colonial history ==
[[File:Pg300 Map of the Caribbee Islands to the year 1536.jpg|thumb|1536 map of the Caribbean]]

Soon after the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[Americas]], both [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] ships began claiming territories in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. These colonies brought in gold, and other European powers, most specifically [[England]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[France]], hoped to establish profitable colonies of their own. Imperial rivalries made the Caribbean a contested area during European wars for centuries. In the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in the early nineteenth century, most of Spanish America broke away from the [[Spanish Empire]], but Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under the Spanish crown until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898.

During the first voyage of the explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] contact was made with the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]] in the [[Bahamas]] and the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] in [[Cuba]] and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], and a few of the native people were taken back to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]]. Small amounts of gold were found in their personal ornaments and other objects such as masks and belts. The Spanish, who came seeking wealth, enslaved the native population and rapidly drove them to near-extinction.  To supplement the Amerindian labor, the Spanish imported African slaves. (See also [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies]].) Although Spain claimed the entire Caribbean, they settled only the larger islands of [[Hispaniola]] (1493), [[Puerto Rico]] (1508),  [[Jamaica]] (1509), [[Cuba]] (1511), and [[Trinidad]] (1530). The Spanish made an exception in the case of the small 'pearl islands' of [[Cubagua]] and [[Margarita Island|Margarita]] off the Venezuelan coast because of their valuable pearl beds, which were worked extensively between 1508 and 1530.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Huxtable Elliott]], ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America, 1492–1830'' (Yale University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molly Warsh, ''American Baroque: Pearls and the Nature of Empire, 1492-1700''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other European powers ===
The other European powers established a presence in the Caribbean after the [[Spanish Empire]] declined, partly due to the reduced native population of the area from European diseases. The Dutch, the French, and the British followed one another to the region and established a long-term presence. They brought with them millions of slaves imported from Africa to support the tropical plantation system that spread through the Caribbean islands.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Martin, ''Caribbean History: From Pre-colonial Origins to the Present'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huguenot corsairs ===
During the first three-quarters of the sixteenth century, matters of balance of power and dynastic succession weighed heavily on the course of European diplomacy and war. Europe’s largest and most powerful kingdoms, France and Spain, were the continent’s staunchest rivals. Tensions increased after 1516, when the kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] were formally unified under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]], who three years later expanded his domains after his election as Holy Roman Emperor and began to surround France. In 1521, France went to war with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Spanish troops routed French armies in France, the Italian Peninsula, and elsewhere, forcing the French Crown to surrender in 1526 and again in 1529. The [[Italian Wars]], as the French-Spanish wars came to be known, reignited in 1536 and again in 1542. Intermittent warring between the Valois monarchy and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] continued until 1559.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martínez-Fernández|first1=Luis|title=Far beyond the Line: Corsairs, Privateers, Buccaneers, and Invading Settlers in Cuba and the Caribbean (1529-1670)|journal=Revista de Indias|date=7 May 2015|volume=75|issue=263|pages=7–38|doi=10.3989/revindias.2015.002}}  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.es_ES Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French corsair]] attacks began in the early 1520s, as soon as France declared war on Spain in 1521. At the time, prodigious treasures from Mexico began to cross the Atlantic en route to Spain. French monarch [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] challenged Spain’s exclusivist claims to the New World and its wealth, demanding to see “the clause in Adam’s will which excluded me from my share when the world was being divided.” Giovanni da Verrazzano (aka [[Jean Fleury|Jean Florin]]) led the first recorded French corsair attack against Spanish vessels carrying treasures from the New World. In 1523, off the [[Cape of St. Vincent]], Portugal, his vessels captured two Spanish ships laden with a fabulous treasure consisting of 70,000 ducats worth of gold, large quantities of silver and pearls, and 25,000 pounds of sugar, a much-treasured commodity at the time.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

The first recorded incursion in the Caribbean happened in 1528, when a lone French corsair vessel appeared off the coast of [[Santo Domingo]] and its crew sacked the village of [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]] on the western coast of [[Puerto Rico]]. In the mid-1530s, corsairs, some Catholic but most of them Protestant ([[Huguenot]]), began routinely attacking Spanish vessels and raiding Caribbean ports and coastal towns; the most coveted were Santo Domingo, [[Havana]], [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]], and San Germán. Corsair port raids in [[Cuba]] and elsewhere in the region usually followed the rescate (ransom) model, whereby the aggressors seized villages and cities, kidnapped local residents, and demanded payment for their release. If there were no hostages, corsairs demanded ransoms in exchange for sparing towns from destruction. Whether ransoms were paid or not, corsairs looted, committed unspeakable violence against their victims, desecrated churches and holy images, and left smoldering reminders of their incursions.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

In 1536, France and Spain went to war again and French corsairs launched a series of attacks on Spanish Caribbean settlements and ships. The next year, a corsair vessel appeared in Havana and demanded a 700-ducat rescate. Spanish men-of-war arrived soon and scared off the intruding vessel, which returned soon thereafter to demand yet another rescate. Santiago was also victim of an attack that year, and both cities endured raids yet again in 1538. The waters off Cuba’s northwest became particularly attractive to pirates as commercial vessels returning to Spain had to squeeze through the 90-mile-long strait between Key West and Havana. In 1537–1538, corsairs captured and sacked nine Spanish vessels. While France and Spain were at peace until 1542, beyond-the-line corsair activity continued. When war erupted again, it echoed once more in the Caribbean. A particularly vicious French corsair attack took place in Havana in 1543. It left a gory toll of 200 killed Spanish settlers. In all, between 1535 and 1563, French corsairs carried out around sixty attacks against Spanish settlements and captured over seventeen Spanish vessels in the region (1536–1547).&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

=== Wars of Religion ===
While Frenchmen and Spaniards fought one another in Europe and the Caribbean, [[Kingdom of England|England]] sided with Spain, largely because of dynastic alliances. In 1509, Prince [[Henry VIII of England|Henry of England]] married Princess [[Catherine of Aragon]] and soon thereafter they were crowned king and queen. It was a tortuous marriage, to say the least, and Henry VIII began to separate from Catherine in 1527. When [[Pope Clement VII]] refused to annul the marriage, Henry VIII pushed the English Catholic Church to separate from Rome and become the Church of England, free from the pope’s authority. Following Henry VIII’s death in 1547, yet another Anglo-Spanish dynastic marriage was arranged, this time between Spain’s Prince [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip]] and Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], the Catholic daughter of Anglican Henry VIII. During their brief reign, the Church of England was again subject to the pope’s authority.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

When Mary I died in 1558, Phillip II ceased to be king of England and England broke from Rome again. Her successor, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], actually rejected a plan to continue the Anglo-Spanish dynastic union when she refused to consider marrying Philip; she was to remain virgin and Protestant. As Protestantism spread further in European kingdoms such as England and France and it became predominant in other formerly Catholic nations, religious antagonisms played an increasingly important role in determining war and peace among the nations of Europe. Tensions increased between England and Spain, particularly following the ascent of Anglican Queen Elizabeth to the throne in 1558. The new English monarch’s anti-Catholic zeal mirrored Philip II’s trenchant hatred of the Protestant faith. Protestantism also spread in France and throughout parts of the Holy Roman Empire. By the mid-1560s, two discernible opposing blocs had taken shape: a southern European Catholic bloc led by Spain and a northern European bloc led by England.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

One of the most valuable ideological weapons of the Reformation and wars against Catholic Spain was the “[[Black Legend]],” the systematic denigration of Spain and its people, culture, and religion. Largely fed by the works of [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], English and Dutch Protestants portrayed Spaniards as backward, dishonest, fanatical, cruel, and lazy. Dutch, English, and German editions of las Casas’ Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies circulated throughout Europe beginning in 1578 with titles such as “Spanish cruelties and tyrannies.” Theodore De Bry, a Protestant, edited, illustrated, and published editions of las Casas’ book and others on related topics and included gruesome engravings depicting Spanish cruelty.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

Spain’s relations with England further soured upon the crowning of Elizabeth in 1558. She openly supported the Dutch insurrection and aided Huguenot forces in France. After decades of increasing tensions and confrontations in the northern Atlantic and the Caribbean, Anglo-Spanish hostilities broke out in 1585, when the English Crown dispatched over 7,000 troops to the Netherlands and Queen Elizabeth liberally granted licenses for privateers to carry out piracy against Spain’s Caribbean possessions and vessels. Tensions further intensified in 1587, when Elizabeth I ordered the execution of Catholic Mary Queen of Scotts after twenty years of captivity and gave the order for a preemptive attack against the Spanish Armada stationed in Cadiz. In retaliation, Spain organized the famous naval attack that ended tragically for Spain with the destruction of the “invincible” Armada in 1588. Spain rebuilt its naval forces, largely with galleons built in Havana, and continued to fight England until Elizabeth’s death in 1603. Spain, however, had received a near-fatal blow that ended its standing as Europe’s most powerful nation and virtually undisputed master of the Indies.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

Following the Franco-Spanish peace treaty of 1559, crown-sanctioned French corsair activities subsided, but piratical Huguenot incursions persisted and in at least one instance led to the formation of a temporary Huguenot settlement in the Isle of Pines, off Cuba. English piracy increased during the reign of Charles I, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1625–1649) and became more aggressive as Anglo-Spanish relations tensed up further during the [[Thirty Years’ War]]. Although Spain and the Netherlands had been at war since the 1560s, the Dutch were latecomers, appearing in the region only after the mid-1590s, when the Dutch Republic was no longer on the defensive in its long conflict against Spain. Dutch privateering became more widespread and violent beginning in the 1620s.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

English incursions in the Spanish-claimed Caribbean boomed during Queen Elizabeth’s rule. These actions originally took the guise of well-organized, large-scale smuggling expeditions headed by piratical smugglers the likes of [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], [[John Oxenham]], and [[Francis Drake]]; their primary objectives were smuggling African slaves into Spain’s Caribbean possessions in exchange for tropical products. The first instances of English mercantile piracy took place in 1562–63, when Hawkins’ men raided a Portuguese vessel off the coast of [[Sierra Leone]], captured the 300 slaves on board, and smuggled them into Santo Domingo in exchange for sugar, hides, and precious woods. Hawkins and his contemporaries mastered the devilish art of maximizing the number of slaves that could fit into a ship. He and other slave traders methodically packed slaves by having them lay on their sides, spooned against one another. Such was the case of the slave-trading vessel bearing the sub-lime name Jesus of Lübeck, into whose pestilent bowels, in partnership with Elizabeth I, Hawkins jammed 400 African slaves. In 1567 and 1568, Hawkins commanded two piratical smuggling expeditions, the last of which ended disastrously; he lost almost all of his ships and three-fourths of his men were killed by Spanish soldiers at [[San Juan de Ulúa]], off the coast of [[Veracruz]], the point of departure of the fleet of New Spain. Hawkins and Drake barely escaped but Oxenham was captured, convicted of heresy by the [[Inquisition]] and burned alive.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

Many of the battles of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish war]] were fought in the Caribbean, not by regular English troops but rather by privateers whom Queen Elizabeth had licensed to carry out attacks on Spanish vessels and ports. These were former pirates who now held a more venerable status as privateers. During those years, over seventy-five documented English privateering expeditions targeted Spanish possessions and vessels. Drake terrorized Spanish vessels and ports. Early in 1586, his forces [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|seized Santo Domingo]], retaining control over it for around a month. Before departing they plundered and destroyed the city, taking a huge bounty. Drake’s men destroyed church images and ornaments and even erected a defensive palisade with wooden images of saints in the hope that the Spanish soldiers’ Catholic fervor would keep them from firing saints as human shields of sorts.&lt;ref name="Martínez-Fernández"/&gt;

Klein and Ben Vinson, ''African slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean'' (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of agriculture in the Caribbean required a large workforce of manual labourers, which the Europeans found by taking advantage of the slave trade in Africa. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves to British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Spanish colonies in the Americas, including the Caribbean. Slaves were brought to the Caribbean from the early 16th century until the end of the 19th century. The majority of slaves were brought to the Caribbean colonies between 1701 and 1810. Also in 1816 there was a slave revolution in the colony of Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Beckles, ''Black rebellion in Barbados: The struggle against slavery, 1627-1838'' (Antilles Publishing, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table lists the number of slaves brought into some of the Caribbean colonies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[abolitionism|Abolitionists]] in the Americas and in Europe became vocal opponents of the slave trade throughout the 19th century. The importation of slaves to the colonies was often outlawed years before the end of the institution of slavery itself. It was well into the 19th century before many slaves in the Caribbean were legally free. The trade in slaves was abolished in the British Empire through the [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act]] in 1807. Men, women and children who were already enslaved in the British Empire remained slaves, however, until Britain passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] in 1833. When the Slavery Abolition Act came into force in 1834, roughly 700,000 slaves in the British West Indies immediately became free; other enslaved workers were freed several years later after a period of forced apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Wesley, "The Negro in the West Indies, slavery and freedom." ''Journal of Negro History'' (1932): 51-66.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2714675 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was abolished in the Dutch Empire in 1814. Spain abolished slavery in its empire in 1811, with the exceptions of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Santo Domingo]]; Spain ended the slave trade to these colonies in 1817, after being paid ₤400,000 by Britain. Slavery itself was not abolished in Cuba until 1886. France abolished slavery in its colonies in 1848.

==== Marriage, separation, and sale together ====
"The official plantocratic view of slave marriage sought to deny the slaves any loving bonds or long-standing relationships, thus conveniently rationalising the indiscriminate separation of close kin through sales."&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (1990), ''Slave Women in Caribbean Society: 1650–1838'', Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press ({{ISBN|0-85255-057-X}} &amp; 0-253-21251-0), p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Plantocracy|Plantocratic]], of a political order dominated by plantation owners}} "From the earliest days of slavery, indiscriminate sales and separation severely disrupted the domestic life of individual slaves."&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p108"&gt;Bush (1990), ''Slave Women in Caribbean Society'', p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves could be sold so that spouses could be sold separately. "Slave couples were sometimes separated by sale&amp;nbsp;.... They lived as single slaves or as part of maternal or extended families but considered themselves 'married.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Morrissey, Marietta (1989), ''Slave Women in the New World: Gender Stratification in the Caribbean'', Lawrence, Kans.: University Press of Kansas ({{ISBN|0-7006-0394-8}}), p.&amp;nbsp;85 and see p.&amp;nbsp;99 (author assoc. prof. sociology, Univ. of Toledo).&lt;/ref&gt; Sale of [[estate (disambiguation)|estates]] with "stock" to pay debts, more common in the late period of slavery, was criticized as separating slave spouses.&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p108" /&gt; [[William Beckford of Somerley|William Beckford]] argued for "families to be sold together or kept as near as possible in the same neighbourhood"&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p108" /&gt; and "laws were passed in the late period of slavery to prevent the breakup of slave families by sale,&amp;nbsp;... [but] these laws were frequently ignored".&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p108" /&gt; "Slaves frequently reacted strongly to enforced severance of their emotional bonds",&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p108" /&gt; feeling "sorrow and despair",&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p108" /&gt; sometimes, according to [[Thomas Cooper (Caribbean settler)|Thomas Cooper]] in 1820, resulting in death from distress.&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p109"&gt;Bush (1990), ''Slave Women in Caribbean Society'', p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stewart (Caribbean settler)|John Stewart]] argued against separation as leading slave buyers to regret it because of {{Nowrap|"despair[,]&amp;nbsp;...}} utter {{Nowrap|despondency[,]}} or {{Nowrap|'put[ting]}} period to their lives{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bush (1990), ''Slave Women in Caribbean Society'', p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;!--(single quote marks so in original)--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Separated slaves often used free time to travel long distances to reunite for a night&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p109" /&gt; and sometimes runaway slaves were married couples.&lt;ref name="SlaveWomenCaribbeanSoc-p109" /&gt; However, "sale of slaves and the resulting breakup of families decreased as slave plantations lost prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Morrissey (1989), ''Slave Women in the New World'', p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial laws ===
European plantations required laws to regulate the plantation system and the many slaves imported to work on the plantations. This legal control was the most oppressive for slaves inhabiting colonies where they outnumbered their European masters and where rebellion was persistent such as [[Jamaica]]. During the early colonial period, rebellious slaves were harshly punished, with sentences including death by torture; less serious crimes such as assault, theft, or persistent escape attempts were commonly punished with mutilations, such as the cutting off of a hand or a foot.&lt;ref name="Rogozinski 2000 132–3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=Jan|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-452-28193-6|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under British rule, slaves could only be freed with the consent of their master, and therefore freedom for slaves was rare. British colonies were able to establish laws through their own legislatures, and the assent of the local island governor and the Crown. British law considered slaves to be property, and thus did not recognize marriage for slaves, family rights, education for slaves, or the right to religious practices such as holidays. British law denied all rights to freed slaves, with the exception of the right to a jury trial. Otherwise, freed slaves had no right to own property, vote or hold office, or even enter some trades.&lt;ref name="Rogozinski 2000 132–3"/&gt;

The French Empire regulated slaves under the [[Code Noir]] (Black Code) which was in force throughout the empire, but which was based upon French practices in the Caribbean colonies. French law recognized slave marriages, but only with the consent of the master. French law, like Spanish law, gave legal recognition to marriages between European men and black or [[Creole peoples|Creole]] women. French and Spanish laws were also significantly more lenient than British law in recognizing [[manumission]], or the ability of a slave to purchase their freedom and become a "freeman". Under French law, free slaves gained full rights to citizenship. The French also extended limited legal rights to slaves, for example the right to own property, and the right to enter contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of colonialism on the Caribbean ==

=== Economic exploitation ===
The exploitation of the [[Caribbean]] landscape dates back to the Spanish [[conquistadors]] starting in the 1490s, who forced indigenous peoples held by Spanish settlers in [[encomienda]] to [[placer mining|mine]] for gold. The more significant development came when Christopher Columbus wrote back to Spain that the islands were made for sugar development.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Malcolm (1979), ''Urbanization and Urban Growth in the Caribbean'', New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Caribbean agricultural dependency is closely linked with European colonialism which altered the financial potential of the region by introducing a plantation system. Much like the Spanish exploited indigenous labor to mine gold, the 17th century brought a new series of oppressors in the form of the Dutch, the English, and the French. By the middle of the 18th century [[sugar]] was Britain's largest import which made the Caribbean that much more important as a colony.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (1979), ''Urbanization and Urban Growth in the Caribbean'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar was a luxury in Europe prior to the 18th century. It became widely popular in the 18th century, then graduated to becoming a necessity in the 19th century. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|author=Sidney Mintz|isbn=978-0-14-009233-2|year=1986|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caribbean islands with plentiful sunshine, abundant rainfalls and no extended frosts were well suited for sugarcane agriculture and sugar factories.

Following the emancipation of slaves in 1833 in the United Kingdom, many liberated Africans left their former masters. This created an economic chaos for British owners of Caribbean [[sugar cane]] plantations. The hard work in hot, humid farms required a regular, docile and low-waged labour force. The British looked for cheap labour. This they found initially in China and then mostly in India. The British crafted a new legal system of forced labour, which in many ways resembled enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New System of Slavery|author=Hugh Tinker|year=1993|isbn=978-1-870518-18-5|publisher=Hansib Publishing|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of calling them slaves, they were called [[indentured labourers|indentured labour]]. Indians and southeast Asians began to replace Africans previously brought as slaves, under this indentured labour scheme to serve on sugarcane plantations across the British empire. The first ships carrying indentured labourers for sugarcane plantations left India in 1836. Over the next 70 years, numerous more ships brought indentured labourers to the Caribbean, as cheap and docile labor for harsh inhumane work. The slave labor and indentured labor - both in millions of people - were brought into Caribbean, as in other European colonies throughout the world.&lt;ref name=britain1&gt;{{cite web|title=Forced Labour|year=2010|publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Question of Labour: Indentured Immigration Into Trinidad &amp; British Guiana, 1875–1917|author=K.

[[File:Cane cutters in Jamaica.jpg|thumb|Cane cutters in [[Jamaica]], 1880s.]]
The New World plantations were established in order to fulfill the growing needs of the Old World. The sugar plantations were built with the intention of exporting the sugar back to Britain which is why the British did not need to stimulate local demand for the sugar with wages.{{dubious|date=May 2015}}{{elucidate|date=May 2015}} A system of slavery was adapted since it allowed the colonizer to have an abundant work force with little worry about declining demands for sugar.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (1979), ''Urbanization and Urban Growth in the Caribbean'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century wages were finally introduced with the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. The new system in place however was similar to the previous as it was based on white capital and colored labor.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (1979), ''Urbanization and Urban Growth in the Caribbean'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of unskilled workers were hired to perform repeated tasks, which made if very difficult for these workers to ever leave and pursue any non farming employment. Unlike other countries, where there was an urban option for finding work, the Caribbean countries had money invested in agriculture and lacked any core industrial base.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (1979), ''Urbanization and Urban Growth in the Caribbean'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities that did exist offered limited opportunities to citizens and almost none for the unskilled masses who had worked in agriculture their entire lives. The products produced brought in no profits for the countries since they were sold to the colonial occupant buyer who controlled the price the products were sold at. This resulted in extremely low wages with no potential for growth since the occupant nations had no intention of selling the products at a higher price to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (1979), ''Urbanization and Urban Growth in the Caribbean'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of this economic exploitation was a plantation dependence which saw the Caribbean nations possessing a large quantity of unskilled workers capable of performing agricultural tasks and not much else. After many years of colonial rule the nations also saw no profits brought into their country since the sugar production was controlled by the colonial rulers. This left the Caribbean nations with little capital to invest towards enhancing any future industries unlike European nations which were developing rapidly and separating themselves technologically and economically from most impoverished nations of the world.

=== Wars ===
[[File:Thomas Mitchell - The battle of the Saintes.jpg|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes'' by Thomas Mitchell. This 1782 battle between the British and French navies took place near [[Guadeloupe]].]]
The Caribbean region was war-torn throughout much of colonial history, but the wars were often based in Europe, with only minor battles fought in the [[Caribbean]]. Some wars, however, were borne of political turmoil in the Caribbean itself.
* [[Thirty Years' War]] between the Netherlands and Spain.
* The [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]], [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]], and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s were battles for supremacy.
* [[Nine Years' War]] between the European powers.
* The [[War of Spanish Succession]] (European name) or Queen Anne's War (American name) spawned a generation of some of the most infamous pirates.
* The [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (American name) or The War of Austrian Succession (European name) Spain and Britain fought over trade rights; Britain invaded Spanish Florida and attacked the citadel of [[Cartagena de Indias]] in present-day Colombia.
* The [[Seven Years' War]] (European name) or the [[French and Indian War]] (American name) was the first "world war" between France, her ally Spain, and Britain; France was defeated and was willing to give up all of Canada to keep a few highly profitable sugar-growing islands in the Caribbean. Britain seized Havana toward the end, and traded that single city for all of Florida at the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In addition France ceded [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], and [[Saint Vincent (island)]] to Britain.
* The [[American Revolution]] saw large British and French fleets battling in the Caribbean again. American independence was assured by French naval victories in the Caribbean, but all the British islands that were captured by the French were returned to Britain at the end of the war.
* The [[French Revolutionary War]] enabled the creation of the newly independent Republic of [[Haiti]]. In addition, in the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, Spain ceded Trinidad to Britain.
* Following the end of the [[Napoleonic War]] in 1814 France ceded [[Saint Lucia]] to Britain.
* The [[Spanish–American War]] ended Spanish control of Cuba (which soon became independent) and Puerto Rico (which became a US colony), and heralded the period of American dominance of the islands.

[[Piracy in the Caribbean]] was often a tool used by the European empires to wage war unofficially against one another. Gold plundered from Spanish ships and brought to Britain had a pivotal effect on European interest in colonizing the region.

=== Slave rebellions ===
[[File:Frontispiece from the book Saint-Domingue, ou Histoire de Ses Révolutions. ca. 1815 (colorcopy).jpg|thumb|Illustration circa 1815 showing "Incendie du Cap" (Burning of Cape Francais) during the [[Haitian Revolution]]. The caption reads: "General revolt of the Blacks. Massacre of the Whites".]]
The plantation system and the slave trade that enabled its growth led to regular slave resistance in many Caribbean islands throughout the colonial era. Resistance was made by escaping from the plantations altogether, and seeking refuge in the areas free of European settlement. Communities of escaped slaves, who were known as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], banded together in heavily forested and mountainous areas of the [[Greater Antilles]] and some of the islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The spread of the plantations and European settlement often meant the end of many Maroon communities, although they survived on [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] and [[Dominica]], and in the more remote mountainous areas of [[Jamaica]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent resistance broke out periodically on the larger Caribbean islands. Many more conspiracies intended to create rebellions were discovered and ended by Europeans before they could materialize.&lt;ref name="Rogozinski 2000 161–3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=161–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual violent uprisings, involving anywhere from dozens to thousands of slaves, were regular events, however. [[Jamaica]] and [[Cuba]] in particular had many slave uprisings. Such uprisings were brutally crushed by European forces.

== Independence ==
[[File:Carte antilles 1843.jpg|thumb|Map of Antilles / Caribbean in 1843.]]
[[Haiti]], the former French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] on [[Hispaniola]], was the first Caribbean nation to gain independence from European powers in 1804. This followed 13 years of war that started as a slave uprising in 1791 and quickly turned into the [[Haitian Revolution]] under the leadership of [[Toussaint l'Ouverture]], where the former slaves defeated the French army (twice), the Spanish army, and the British army, before becoming the world's first and oldest black [[republic]], and also the second-oldest republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]] after the United States. This is additionally notable as being the only successful slave uprising in history. The remaining two-thirds of Hispaniola were conquered by Haitian forces in 1821. In 1844, the newly formed [[Dominican Republic]] declared its independence from Haiti.

The nations bordering the Caribbean in Central America gained independence with the 1821 establishment of the [[First Mexican Empire]]—which at that time included the modern states of [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]]. The nations bordering the Caribbean in South America also gained independence from Spain in 1821 with the establishment of [[Gran Colombia]]—which comprised the modern states of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Panama]].

[[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] remained as Spanish colonies until the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, after which [[Cuba]] attained its independence in 1902, and [[Puerto Rico]] became an [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]] of the United States, being the last of the [[Greater Antilles]] under colonial control.

Between 1958 and 1962 most of the British-controlled Caribbean was integrated as the new [[West Indies Federation]] in an attempt to create a single unified future independent state—but it failed. The following former British Caribbean island colonies achieved independence in their own right; [[Jamaica]] (1962), [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] (1962), [[Barbados]] (1966), [[Bahamas]] (1973), [[Grenada]] (1974), [[Dominica]] (1978), [[St. Lucia]] (1979), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]] (1979), [[Antigua &amp; Barbuda]] (1981), [[St. Kitts &amp; Nevis]] (1983).

In addition British Honduras in Central America became independent as [[Belize]] (1981), British Guiana in South America became independent as [[Guyana]] (1966), and  Dutch Guiana also in South America became independent as [[Suriname]] (1975).

== Islands currently under European or U.S. administration ==
[[File:Martinique Carriage on Rue Ernest Deproge IMG 0415 C.JPG|thumb|A carriage on a street in [[Martinique]], one of the Caribbean islands that has not become independent. It is an [[overseas region]] of [[France]], and its citizens are full French citizens.]]
It should be noted that as of the early 21st century, not all Caribbean islands have become independent. Several islands continue to have government ties with European countries, or with the United States.

[[French overseas departments and territories]] include several Caribbean islands.  [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] are French [[overseas region]]s, a legal status that they have had since 1946.  Their citizens are considered full French citizens with the same legal rights. In 2003, the populations of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] and [[St. Barthélemy]] voted in favour of secession from Guadeloupe in order to form separate overseas collectivities of France. After a bill was passed in the [[French Parliament]], the new status took effect on 22 February 2007.

[[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] are officially territories of the United States, but are sometimes referred to as "protectorates" of the United States. They are self governing territories subject to Congress plenary powers over the territories.

[[British overseas territories]] in the Caribbean include:
* [[Anguilla]]
* [[Bermuda]]
* [[British Virgin Islands]]
* [[Cayman Islands]]
* [[Montserrat]]
* [[Turks and Caicos]]

[[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Sint Maarten]] are all presently separate constituent countries, formerly part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. Along with [[Netherlands]], they form the four constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  Citizens of these islands have full Dutch citizenship.

== History of U.S. relations ==
[[File:PSM V61 D370 Usa rescue effort at st vincent.png|thumb|United States' rescue effort at [[St. Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], 1902, following an eruption of the volcano at [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]].]]
Since the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the United States gained a major influence on most Caribbean nations. In the early part of the twentieth century this influence was extended by participation in [[The Banana Wars]]. Areas outside British or French control became known in Europe as "America's tropical empire".

Victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] and the signing of the [[Platt amendment]] in 1901 ensured that the United States would have the right to interfere in Cuban political and economic affairs, militarily if necessary. After the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 [[Cuba-United States relations|relations]] deteriorated rapidly leading to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and successive US attempts to destabilise the island. The US invaded and occupied [[Hispaniola]] (present day [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]) for 19 years (1915–34), subsequently dominating the Haitian economy through aid and loan repayments. The United States invaded Haiti again in 1994 and in 2004 were accused by [[CARICOM]] of arranging a coup d'état to remove elected Haitian leader [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].

In 1965, 23,000 U.S. troops landed in the Dominican Republic to quash a [[Dominican Civil War|military coup]] in what was the first [[Foreign interventions by the United States|U.S. military intervention]] in Latin America in more than 30 years.&lt;ref name="oxbib"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleijeses|first1=Piero|title=The United States Invasion of the Dominican Republic, 1961–1966|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766581/obo-9780199766581-0071.xml|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online|accessdate=1 February 2018|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766581-0071|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Lyndon Johnson]] had ordered the invasion to stem what he claimed to be a "Communist threat", but the mission appeared ambiguous and was condemned throughout the hemisphere as a return to [[gunboat diplomacy]].&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. troops land in the Dominican Republic|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/u-s-troops-land-in-the-dominican-republic|website=History.com|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 the United States [[US invasion of Grenada|invaded]] [[Grenada]] to remove populist left-wing leader [[Maurice Bishop]]. The United States maintains a naval military base in Cuba at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. The base is one of five unified commands whose "area of responsibility" is Latin America and the Caribbean. The command is headquartered in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].

As an arm of the economic and political network of the Americas, the influence of the United States stretches beyond a [[military]] context. In [[economic]] terms, the United States represents a [[primary market]] for the [[export]] of Caribbean goods. Notably, this is a recent historical trend.  The [[post-war]] era reflects a time of transition for the [[Caribbean basin]] when, as [[Colonialism|colonial]] powers sought to disentangle from the region (as part of a larger trend of [[decolonization]]), the US began to expand its hegemony throughout the region.  This pattern is confirmed by economic initiatives such as the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] (CBI), which sought to congeal alliances with the region in light of a perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat.  The CBI marks the emergence of the Caribbean basin as a [[geopolitical]] area of strategic interest to the US.

This relationship has carried through to the 21st century, as reflected by the [[Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act]].  The Caribbean Basin is also of strategic interest in regards to trade routes; it has been estimated that nearly half of US foreign cargo and [[crude oil]] imports are brought via Caribbean seaways.  During wartime, these figures only stand to increase.  It is important to note that the United States is also of strategic interest to the Caribbean. Caribbean foreign policy seeks to strengthen its participation in a global [[free market]] economy.  As an extension of this, Caribbean states do not wish to be excluded from their primary market in the United States, or be bypassed in the creation of “wider hemispheric trading blocs” that stand to drastically alter trade and production in the Caribbean Basin.  As such, the US has played an influential role in shaping the Caribbean’s role in this hemispheric market.  Likewise, building trade relationships with the US has always figured in strongly with the political goal of economic security in post-independence Caribbean states.

The mainstay of the Caribbean economy, sugar, has declined gradually since the beginning of the 20th century, although it is still a major crop in the region. Caribbean sugar production became relatively expensive in comparison to other parts of the world that developed their own sugar cultivation industries, making it difficult for Caribbean sugar products to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caribbean economic diversification into new activities became essential to the islands.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:United Fruit Co to Jamaica.jpg|thumb|A 1906 advertisement in the [[Montreal Medical Journal]], showing the [[United Fruit Company]] selling trips to [[Jamaica]].]]
By the beginning of the 20th century, the Caribbean islands enjoyed greater political stability. Large-scale violence was no longer a threat after the end of slavery in the islands. The British-controlled islands in particular benefited from investments in the infrastructure of colonies. By the beginning of World War I, all British-controlled islands had their own police force, fire department, doctors and at least one hospital. Sewage systems and public water supplies were built, and death rates in the islands dropped sharply. Literacy also increased significantly during this period, as schools were set up for students descended from African slaves. Public libraries were established in large towns and capital cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These improvements in the quality of life for the inhabitants also made the islands a much more attractive destination for visitors. Tourists began to visit the Caribbean in larger numbers by the beginning of the 20th century, although there was a tourist presence in the region as early as the 1880s. The U.S.-owned [[United Fruit Company]] operated a fleet of "banana boats" in the region that doubled as tourist transportation. The United Fruit Company also developed hotels for tourist accommodations. It soon became apparent, however, that this industry was much like a new form of colonialism; the hotels operated by the company were fully staffed by Americans, from chefs to waitresses, in addition to being owned by Americans, so that the local populations saw little economic benefit. The company also enforced racial discrimination in many policies for its fleet. Black passengers were assigned to inferior cabins, were sometimes denied bookings, and were expected to eat meals early before white passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duval|first=David Timothy|title=Tourism in the Caribbean: trends, development, prospects|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-30362-0|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular early destinations were Jamaica and the Bahamas; the Bahamas remains today the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean.

Post-independence economic needs, particularly in the aftermath of the end of preferential agricultural trade ties with Europe, led to a boom in the development of the tourism industry in the 1980s and thereafter. Large luxury hotels and resorts have been built by foreign investors in many of the islands. Cruise ships are also regular visitors to the Caribbean.

Some islands have gone against this trend, such as Cuba and Haiti, whose governments chose not to pursue foreign tourism, although Cuba has developed this part of the economy very recently. Other islands lacking sandy beaches, such as Dominica, missed out on the 20th-century tourism boom, although they have recently begun to develop [[eco-tourism]], diversifying the tourism industry in the Caribbean.

=== Financial services ===
The development of [[offshore banking]] services began during the 1920s. The close proximity of the Caribbean islands to the United States has made them an attractive location for branches of foreign banks. Clients from the United States take advantage of offshore banking services to avoid U.S. taxation. The Bahamas entered the financial services industry first, and continues to be at the forefront of financial services in the region. The Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and the Netherlands Antilles have also developed competitive financial services industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogozinski|first=|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipping ===
[[File:Stadt München moored in Bridgetown 2.JPG|thumb|A container ship docked in the deep water harbour of [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]], which opened in 1961.]]
Ports both large and small were built throughout the Caribbean during the colonial era. The export of sugar on a large scale made the Caribbean one of the world's shipping cornerstones, as it remains today. Many key shipping routes still pass through the region.

The development of large-scale shipping to compete with other ports in Central and South America ran into several obstacles during the 20th century. [[Economies of scale]], high port handling charges, and a reluctance by Caribbean governments to privatize ports put Caribbean shipping at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessen, Anneke; Ennio Rodríguez Céspedes; Inter-American Development Bank. Integration, Trade, and Hemispheric Issues Division|title=The Caribbean Community: Facing the Challenges of Regional and Global Integration|year=1999|publisher=BID-INTAL|isbn=978-950-738-080-8|pages=35–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many locations in the Caribbean are suitable for the construction of deepwater ports for commercial ship container traffic, or to accommodate large cruise ships. The deepwater port at [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, was completed by British investors in 1961. A more recent deepwater port project was completed by Hong Kong investors in [[Grand Bahama]] in the Bahamas.

Some Caribbean islands take advantage of [[flag of convenience]] policies followed by foreign merchant fleets, registering the ships in Caribbean ports. The registry of ships at "flag of convenience" ports is protected by the [[Law of the Sea]] and other international treaties. These treaties leave the enforcement of labour, tax, health and safety, and environmental laws under the control of the registry, or "flag" country, which in practical terms means that such regulations seldom result in penalties against the merchant ship. The Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Antigua, Bermuda, and St. Vincent are among the top 11 flags of convenience in the world. However, the flag of convenience practice has been a disadvantage to Caribbean islands as well, since it also applies to cruise ships, which register outside the Caribbean and thus can evade Caribbean enforcement of the same territorial laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duval|first=David Timothy|title=Tourism in the Caribbean: Trends, Development, Prospects|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-30362-0|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|400px|Roman Empire in 117 AD. Imperial provinces are shown in green. Pink indicates senatorial provinces, as well as Italy itself, which was governed directly by the senate.]]
An '''imperial province''' was a [[Roman province]] during the [[Principate]] where the [[Roman Emperor]] had the sole right to appoint the governor (''[[legatus]] Augusti''). These provinces were often the strategically located border provinces.

The provinces were grouped into imperial and [[senatorial province]]s shortly after the accession of [[Augustus]].

The following provinces were imperial provinces:

*[[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Aegyptus]]
*[[Alpes Cottiae]]
*[[Alpes Maritimae]]
*[[Alpes Poenninae]]
*[[Roman Armenia|Armenia]]
*[[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]]

The ancient town of ''La Hoya'' ([[Laguardia, Álava|Biasteri]], [[Alava]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]) is a most important archaeological site of the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s of the Basque Country and nearby areas of [[Spain]].

The fortified town was inhabited between the 15th and 3rd centuries BCE and occupies four [[hectare]]s. It has three levels:

* Middle-Late Bronze Age: in this early period, the fortifications, as well the houses, were all made of [[wood]].
* Early-Middle Iron Age: construction became more complex using mixed formulas with stone, wood and [[adobe]]. Most houses were near the wall in this period.
* Late Iron Age, with a cultural context that some classify as ''[[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]]'', shows important changes in urbanization: with paved streets and plazas that form a reticular structure. The wall is also rebuilt on stone. This final period also shows great advancement in the technologies: potter's wheel, elaborated blacksmitting, etc.

The successive layers of rubble, that served as cimentations for further edification, make up a small [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] 3 meters high.

The town was destroyed violently c. 300 BCE, leaving the remains of the people and their quotidain tools in the streets.

{{Democracy}}

This is an incomplete list of wars between entities that have a [[constitution]]ally [[democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]] and actually practice it. Two points are required: that there has been a war, and that there are democracies on at least two opposing sides. For many of these entries, whether there has been a war, or a democracy, is a debatable question; all significant views should be given. For example, see [[list of types of democracy]].

==Definition dependence==
:''See also: [[List of types of democracy]], [[History of democracy]],  and [[Democratic peace theory]].''
Almost all of these depend on the definition of "democracy" (and of "war") employed. As James Lee Ray points out, with a sufficiently restrictive definition of democracy, there will be no wars between democracies: define democracy as true universal suffrage, the right of all – including children – to vote, and there have been no democracies, and so no wars between them.

On the other hand, Ray lists the following as having been called wars between democracies,  with broader definitions of democracy: The [[American Revolution]] including the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Belgian Revolution]], the [[Sonderbund War]], the war of 1849 between the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] and the [[Second French Republic]], the [[American Civil War]], the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[Second Philippine War]], the [[Second Boer War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]] (as a whole, and also the [[Continuation War]] by itself), the [[Israeli War of Independence]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]–1948, the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan War]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lee Ray: "Wars between democracies: Rare, or nonexistent?", ''International Interactions'' Volume 18, Issue 3 February 1993, pages 251–276; child suffrage and  from Ray, ''Democracy and International Conflict'' p.88. Restricted definitions of democracy can also be constructed which define away all wars between democracies, and yet include many regimes often held to be democratic; Ray finds this more rhetorically effective than saying that ''full-scale'' international war between ''established'' democracies with ''wide'' suffrage is less likely than between other pairs of states.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes also had democratic forms of government, and they often fought each other up until the late 19th century, as did many tribes of [[Norsemen]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Similarly, the school of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], founder of the [[Polity IV]] dataset, divides regimes into three classes: democracies, autocracies, and "[[Anocracy|anocracies]]"; the last being the sort of weak or new states which are marginal democracies or marginal autocracies; many of the wars below involve weak or marginal democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Ze'ev Maoz, Nasrin Abdolali, "Regime Types and International Conflict, 1816–1976", ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''  vol. 33, no. 1 (March 1986) pp. 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early democracy==

===Greek democracies===
{{See also|Athenian democracy}}
The [[Peloponnesian war]] included a great many conflicts among Greek city-states. The principal war was between Athens and her allies (most of them democracies) on one side, and Sparta and her allies (most of them oligarchies—although most of them held elections among a citizen body{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}) on the other. But the war lasted for twenty-seven years, with a brief armistice, and a great many side-conflicts occurred; and states changed from democracy to oligarchy and back again. Most notable of the wars between democracies was the [[Sicilian Expedition]], 415–413 BC, in which Athens went to war with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. [[Bruce Russett]] finds 13 conflicts between "clear" democratic pairs (most of these being Athens and allies in the Sicilian Expedition) and 25 involving "other" democratic pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Russett, ''Grasping the Democratic Peace'', p. 47–71; Russett, one of the few to consider the democratic peace before 1750, thinks it likely that the norm of interdemocratic peace developed gradually through the centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; Classicist [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] thinks one of Russett's examples unlikely, but adds several instances of wars between democracies before and after the Peloponnesian War.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen ''et al.'': ''An inventory of archaic and classical poleis'' (2005), p. 85 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Republic===
{{See also|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The constitution of the [[Roman Republic]], before its collapse in the late 1st century BC, is amply documented; its magistrates (including the [[Roman Senate]], which was composed of current and former magistrates) were elected by universal suffrage by adult (male) citizens; all male citizens were eligible. There was a political class of wealthy men; most successful candidates belonged to this class, and all of them were supported by a party drawn from it, but this does not distinguish Rome from other democracies—nor, indeed, from non-democratic states; freedom of speech was, however, a characteristic difference between the Republic and the later [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Roman Revolution'' (1939, repr. and revised 1962), including the view on the oligarchy behind ''all'' constitutions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;David Churchman, ''Why We Fight: Theories of Aggression and Human Conflict'', University Press of America (2005), p.143, who discusses Rome ''and'' Carthage.&lt;/ref&gt; The old constitution of Carthage, before the [[First Punic War]], was described by Aristotle as a mixture of democracy and oligarchy; after the disastrous end of that war, about 240&amp;nbsp;BC, there was a democratic change, the direct election of a pair of executives, and the [[Second Punic War]] was fought under that constitution; there continued to be an oligarchic party.  There were several further changes of party, and democratic reforms; the election of the democratic party, which favored a less passive foreign policy, in 151&amp;nbsp;BC provoked Rome to begin the [[Third Punic War]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel: ''History of Carthage'' (1993, Eng. tr. 1995) pp. 116–120, 411; Richard Miles ''"Carthage must be destroyed"'' (2010): 214, 318, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Babst. "Elective Governments — A Force For Peace." ''The Wisconsin Sociologist'' 3 (1, 1964): 9–14 (he writes of, and defines, ''freely elective governments'', but his papers have been taken as the founding of democratic peace theory, and cited as being about democracies); Raymond Cohen, "Pacific unions: a reappraisal of the theory that 'democracies do not go to war with each other'", ''Review of International Studies'' 20 (3, 1994) 207–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
* [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13): The [[Young Turks]] had re-established constitutional government in Ottoman Turkey in 1908, and continued to struggle for greater liberalization;&lt;ref&gt;Ayhat Kansu, ''Politics in post-revolutionary Turkey, 1908-1913'', passim&lt;/ref&gt; the "relatively democratic" Constitution of Serbia had been restored in 1903, and attained complete openness of executive recruitment. Serbia and its allies, the constitutional monarchies of Greece and Bulgaria, won the war; Turkey suffered a military coup as a result of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; pp. 210-11, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First World War]]: The Polity IV dataset does not rank any of the [[Central Powers]] as democracies, although the component of democracy for Germany had been higher than that of autocracy since the 1890s, when Bismarck was replaced by [[Leo von Caprivi]];&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; neither does the somewhat controversial&lt;ref&gt;Vanhanen calls his own methodology of ranking democracies approximate, and subject to short-term variation; others call it "unacceptable", and using "invalid" or "controversial" indicators; see Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p. 36,61. He primarily uses it to measure and compare long-term trends in the democracy of single countries, in which such fluctuations will cancel out.&lt;/ref&gt; ranking of [[Tatu Vanhanen]];&lt;ref&gt;Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p72&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, all of the Central Powers had elected parliaments; the Reichstag had been elected by universal suffrage, and voted on whether a credit essential to the German conduct of the war should be granted. Whether this is democratic control over the foreign policy of the Kaiser is "a difficult case"; [[Michael W. Doyle]] concludes, however, that the government was not absolutely dependent on the Reichstag - and that Germany was a [[dyarchy]], effectively a mixture of two different constitutions, and democratic on internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael W.

* [[Polish–Lithuanian War]]: Fought in 1920, with about 1000 estimated battle deaths. In both states, elections had been held with universal suffrage. In the polity scale, Poland received a +8 rating in combined democracy/autocracy in 1920, while Lithuania received a +7 in democracy and a +4 in combined democracy/autocracy.&lt;ref name="PIVP"/&gt; The conflict is seen by both Polish and Lithuanian historians as a part of the wars of independence from the Soviet Union.

'''Lü Simian''' ({{zh|c=呂思勉|p=Lǚ Sīmiǎn|w=Lü Ssu-mien}}; February 27, 1884 &amp;ndash; October 9, 1957) was a prominent Chinese historian as well as a former professor and history department head at [[Kwang Hua University]], a predecessor of the [[East China Normal University]] in [[Shanghai]]. Lü took the courtesy name Chéngzhī (诚之) and wrote under the pseudonym Núniú (驽牛). His students included famous historians [[Ch'ien Mu]] and [[Yang Kuan]]. Historian Yan Gengwang (严耕望) considered Lü one of the four greatest modern Chinese historians, along with his student Ch'ien Mu, [[Chen Yuan (historian)|Chen Yuan]], and [[Chen Yinke]].

In 1926 Lü was invited to teach at Kwang Hua University by his friend and the school's headmaster Qián Jībó (钱基博). Lü remained at the school, which later became part of [[East China Normal University]], until his death.

Lü was born in Wujin (now [[Wujin district]] of [[Changzhou]] city) in China's [[Jiangsu]] province. At the age of 15 he entered the county school. In the second year he began teaching himself history. He later became a member of the [[Doubting Antiquity School]] which was a group of scholars and writers who showed doubts regarding the authenticity of pre-[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] texts.

His former residence in Changzhou is a protected property open to the public, offering numerous artifacts from his life displayed in the restored building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.51766.com/img/lsmgj/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics and law, '''mediatisation''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|m|iː|d|i|ə|t|aɪ|ˈ|z|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}) is the loss of [[Imperial immediacy|immediacy]], the status of persons not subject to local lords but only to a higher authority directly, such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In a [[Feudalism|feudal]] context, it is the introduction of an intervening level of authority between a lord and his vassal so that the former is no longer the ''immediate'' lord of the latter, but rather his lordship is mediated by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=triI4k_DlCYC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=mediatisation+holy+roman+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS0Z6uqo_XAhUJblAKHRP7DDYQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=mediatisation%20holy%20roman%20empire&amp;f=false|title=Mediatization: Concept, Changes, Consequences|last=Lundby|first=Knut|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|year=|isbn=9781433105623|location=|pages=11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the process had been going on since the [[Middle Ages]], the term "mediatisation" was originally applied to the [[German mediatization|reorganisation of the German states during the early 19th century]]. In this case, many states that were immediate vassals of the Holy Roman Emperor became instead vassals of other immediate states so that the total number of states immediately subject to the emperor decreased.

==Holy Roman Empire==
{{main|German mediatisation}}
Between 1803 and 1806, the final years of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the vast majority of the states of the Holy Roman Empire were mediatised. These states lost their [[imperial immediacy]] (''Reichsunmittelbarkeit'') and became part of other states. The number of states was reduced from about three hundred to about thirty. Mediatisation went along with secularisation: the abolition of most of the [[Imperial_State#Composition|ecclesiastical states]].

The legal basis for mediatisation was the ''[[German Mediatisation#Reichsdeputationshauptschluss|Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' of 1803, which had become necessary under pressure from [[France]]. The Treaty of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] of 1806 continued the process of mediatisation. The constitution of the [[German Confederation]] of 1815 confirmed the mediatisation, but preserved certain rights for the mediatised princes within their former realms, now ranked as [[State country|state countries]], such as [[court of first instance|first instance jurisdiction]], supervision of religion and foundations.

Mediatised sovereign houses rank higher than other houses of nominally equal (or higher) rank, but who never ruled a state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This division had great social significance, as mediatised princes were considered equal to royals for marriage purposes; in essence they were regarded as royalty. However, there were two types of mediatised families; old and new. Old were those who have for centuries ruled immediate imperial territories. New families were those who obtained immediate status after the end of the Middle Ages, mostly as a reward for service and loyalty to the reigning Emperor. Most of these families came from hereditary Habsburg lands and south-western Germany; originally they were mediate nobles, upgraded to immediate status. After the mediatisation, these families were officially regarded as equals to royalty; however, the reigning houses often, but not always declined to treat them as such. [[Emperor Franz Joseph]], for example, forbade his nephew’s son, future [[Charles I of Austria]], even to consider a possible match with a [[Hohenlohe]] princess even though the Hohenlohes were an old family who reigned for centuries prior to the mediatisation, and King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] had to marry [[morganatic marriage|morganatically]] the Countess [[Auguste von Harrach]] even though she came from a mediatised family. 
Thus in theory, if a scion from the most obscure mediatised family (say the child of an impoverished mediatised count) married an emperor or a king, their alliance was considered equal, not morganatic, and their children had dynastic rights. In practice, however, this never happened.
The authoritative guide to the royal and noble houses of Europe, the ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'', has been, since the late 19th century, divided into three sections: sovereign houses, mediatised houses, and noble houses.

'''Mikołaj Siwicki''' ([[ukr]] Микола Сивiцький, Mykoła Sywićkyj; 20 October 1917 – 13 January 2004) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] literary critic and [[historian]] ([[PhD]] in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (literature)).

==Biography==

Born in a village just outside [[Dubno]], with the annexation of [[Volhynia]] from Poland by the Soviet Union, Siwicki was arrested in 1939 by the [[NKVD]] and spent 5 years incarcerated in the Soviet Gulag near [[Murmansk]]. At the end of his incarceration walked back to his childhood home in Ukraine, and because  his Polish passport had not been changed to a Soviet one, enlisted in the Polish Army. He took part in the capture of Berlin where he lost a leg. As a decorated invalid Polish soldier he was able to receive government subsidies to complete his tertiary education.

Siwicki completed his studies at  [[University of Warsaw]] (graduated in 1956), doctorate at [[University of Krakow]] in 1983 under professor [[Ryszard Łużny]] with a dissertation on  the Ukrainian writer and university professor [[Bohdan Lepky|Bohdan Łepky]].

He was active in the formation of the Ukrainian Cultural Centre in Warsaw and became editor of the weekly newspaper ''[[Nasze Słowo]]'' (1956–1960), before being forced to change his employment to the editing of a Polish commercial newspaper

From 1956  Mykoła Siwicki lived in Warsaw [[Bródno|Bródnie]].

* Numerous articles in journals such as "Slavia Orientalis”, "Studia Polono-Slavica- Orientalia. Acta Litteraria”.
* "Dzieje konfliktów polsko-ukraińskich" - about the Polish-Ukrainian conflicts in the 20th century.

Siwicki's works on Polish-Ukrainian conflict are considered by Polish sources to be outside scholarly mainstream &lt;ref&gt;[http://ece.columbia.edu/research/intermarium/vol7no1/wnuk.pdf Recent Polish Historiography on Polish-Ukrainian Relations During World War II and its Aftermath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604234037/http://ece.columbia.edu/research/intermarium/vol7no1/wnuk.pdf |date=2010-06-04 }} (also [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/sipa/REGIONAL/ECE/vol7no1/wnuk.pdf here]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3294">'''Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Musa''' (? - outskirts of [[Zaragoza]], 898), was a [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Feudal lord|lord]] who held the [[medina quarter]] of [[Zaragoza]] and [[Lleida|Larida]],&lt;ref name="Diccionari"&gt;[[#Mestre|Mestre, 1998]]: p. 722, entry: "Muhammad ibn Llop"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEC"&gt;{{cite book|author= Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana|title=Muḥammad ibn Llop|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0044742.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Upper March]] of [[Al-Andalus]].

==Family==
Muhammad was son to [[Lubb ibn Musa ibn Musa|Lubb ibn Musa]] (and thus grandson to the famous [[Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi]]), from the prominent [[Muladi|Muwallad]] [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Banu Qasi]] clan, of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] or [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] extraction.

He had at least six sons, [[Lubb ibn Muhammad|Lubb]], Musa, Yusuf, Abd Allah, Yunus and Mutarrif.  The sons began to quarrel among themselves, thus provoking, to a great extent, the complete dismantling of Banu Qasi power throughout the [[Ebro]] valley.

==Biography==

When his father and his uncles rebelled against [[emir]] [[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad I]] [[Emirate of Córdoba|of Córdoba]], Muhammad ibn Lubb supported the emir leading an army that defeated his own uncle, [[Isma'il ibn Musa]].&lt;ref name="Diccionari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt;

In 882, he had already conquered Zaragoza, where attempted to rule independent of Córdoba [[Feudal lord|lord]],&lt;ref name="Diccionari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt; but the constant pressure of the [[Arabs|Arab]] [[Banu Tujibi]] clan ({{lang-ar|بنو تجيب}}), forced him into the choice of selling the Zaragoza to the emir by 885.&lt;ref name="Diccionari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt;  [[Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza|Raimon, count of Pallars]] acted as intermediary in the transfer.&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt;

After further family disputes, and with the ascendancy of [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi|Abd Allah]] to the throne of Córdoba, Muhammad's pact with the new emir led him to be appointed new ''[[Walī|wali]]'' of Larida (contrarily to the pretensions that the wali of [[Huesca]], the also Muwallad [[Muhammad al-Tawil of Huesca|Muhammad al-Tawil]], had to such dignity).&lt;ref name="Diccionari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt; But Muhammad then ceded the dignity to his son Lubb.&lt;ref name="Diccionari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt;

In 897, Muhammad conquered [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].&lt;ref name="GEC"/&gt;

In 898, he initiated a new [[military campaign]] to recover Zaragoza, but died during its siege&lt;ref name="Diccionari"/&gt; surprised by an enemy warrior while he was resting, in October 8.&lt;ref name="Cañada68"&gt;[[#Cañada|A. Cañada, 1980]]: p. 68-70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nafplio''' ({{lang-ell|Ναύπλιο}}, '''Nauplio''' or '''Nauplion''' in Italian and other Western European languages) is a seaport town in the [[Peloponnese]] in [[Greece]] that has expanded up the hillsides near the north end of the [[Argolic Gulf]]. The town was an important seaport held under a succession of royal houses in the [[Middle Ages]] as part of the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], held initially by the [[de la Roche]] following the [[Fourth Crusade]] before coming under the [[Republic of Venice]] and, lastly, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The town was the capital of the [[First Hellenic Republic]] and of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]], from the start of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] in 1821 until 1834. Nafplio is now the capital of the regional unit of [[Argolis]].

==Name==

The name of the town changed several times over the centuries. The [[modern Greek]] name of the town is ''Nafplio'' (Ναύπλιο).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/10/06/%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%8D%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BF%CE%BD%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82/ |title=Ναύπλιον – Ετυμολογία του Ονόματος |author=« ΑΡΓΟΛΙΚΗ ΑΡΧΕΙΑΚΗ ΒΙΒΛΙΟΘΗΚΗ ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΠΟΛΙΤΙΣΜΟΥ |publisher=Argolikivivliothiki.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English language|modern English]], the most frequently used forms are ''Nauplia'' and ''Navplion''.&lt;ref&gt;See Merriam-Webster's (1993), p. 1495.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[History of Europe#Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], it was known as ''Nauplia'' (Ναυπλία) in [[Attic Greek]]&lt;ref name="LiddellScottJones1940"&gt;See Liddell and Scott revised by Jones (1940), Ναυπλία. Retrieved 2012-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiddellScott1889"&gt;See Liddell and Scott (1889), Ναυπλία. Retrieved 2012-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailly1901"&gt;See Bailly (1901), p. 585, Ναυπλία. Retrieved 2013-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith1854"&gt;See Smith (1854), NAU´PLIA. Retrieved 2012-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Naupliē'' (Ναυπλίη) in [[Ionian Greek]].&lt;ref name="LiddellScottJones1940"/&gt; In [[Latin language|Latin]], it was called ''Nauplia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=v20OAAAAQAAJ |title=Entick's English-Latin dictionary |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[History of Europe#Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], several variants were used in [[Byzantine Greek]], including ''Náfplion'' (Ναύπλιον), ''Anáplion'' (Ἀνάπλιον), and ''Anáplia'' (Ἀνάπλια).&lt;ref name="Smith1854"/&gt;

During the [[History of Europe#Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] and [[History of Europe#Early modern Europe|early modern period]], under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] domination, the town was known in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''Napoli di Romania'', after the medieval usage of "Romania" to refer to the lands of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and to distinguish it from ''Napoli'' ([[Naples, Italy|Naples]]) in [[Italy]].

Also during the early modern period, but this time under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name of the town was ''Mora Yenişehir'', after [[Morea]], a medieval name for the [[Peloponnese]], and ''"yeni şehir"'', the Turkish term for "new city" (apparently a translation from the Greek Νεάπολη, Italian ''Napoli''). The Ottomans also called it ''Anabolı''.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, the town was called indiscriminately ''Náfplion'' (Ναύπλιον) and ''Nafplio'' (Ναύπλιο) in [[modern Greek]]. Both forms were used in official documents and travel guides. This explains why the old form ''Náfplion'' (sometimes transliterated to ''Navplion'') still occasionally survives up to this day.

==Geography==
{{wide image|Вид на Напфлио.jpg|750px|Panorama of modern Nafplion.}}

Nafplio is situated on the [[Argolic Gulf]] in the northeast [[Peloponnese]]. Most of the old town is on a peninsula jutting into the gulf; this peninsula forms a naturally protected bay that is enhanced by the addition of man-made [[mole (architecture)|moles]]. Originally almost isolated by marshes, deliberate landfill projects, primarily since the 1970s, have nearly doubled the land area of the city.

==Municipality==
[[File:2011 Dimos Nafplieon.png|thumb|200px|Nafplio municipality]]

The municipality Nafplio was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mythical origins and Classical antiquity===
The area surrounding Nafplio has been inhabited since ancient times, but few signs of this, aside from the walls of the [[Acronauplia]], remain visible. The town has been a stronghold on several occasions during [[History of Europe#Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]. It seems to be mentioned on an Egyptian funerary inscription of [[Amenophis III]] as ''Nuplija''.&lt;ref&gt;See Latacz (2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Nauplia ({{lang-grc|ἡ Ναυπλία}}) was the port of [[Argos]], in [[ancient Argolis]]. It was situated upon a rocky peninsula, connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus. It was a very ancient place, and is said to have derived its name from [[Nauplius (mythology)|Nauplius]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Amymone]], and the father of [[Palamedes (Greek mythology)|Palamedes]], though it more probably owed its name, as [[Strabo]] has observed, to its harbour.&lt;ref&gt;ἀπὸ τοῦ ταῖς ναυσὶ προσπλεῖσθαι, {{Cite Strabo|viii. p.368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|2|38|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] tells us that the Nauplians were [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]] belonging to the colony which [[Danaus]] brought to Argos;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|4|35|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the position of their city upon a promontory running out into the sea, which is quite different from the site of the earlier Grecian cities, it is not improbable that it was originally a settlement made by strangers from the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Nauplia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nauplia was at first independent of Argos, and a member of the maritime confederacy which held its meetings in the island of [[Calaureia]].&lt;ref name=Strabo&gt;{{Cite Strabo|viii. p.374}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the time of the [[Second Messenian War]], it was conquered by the Argives; and the [[ancient Sparta|Lacedaemonians]] gave to its expelled citizens the town of [[Methone (Messenia)|Methone]] in [[ancient Messenia|Messenia]], where they continued to reside even after the restoration of the Messenian state by the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] general [[Epaminondas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|4|24|4}}, 4.27.8, 4.35.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Argos now took the place of Nauplia in the Calaureian confederacy; and from this time Nauplia appears in history only as the seaport of Argos.&lt;ref&gt;ὁ Ναύπλιος λίμην, [[Euripides]] ''Orest.'' 767; λιμένες Ναύπλιοι, ''Electr.'' 451.&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is mentioned by [[Strabo]],&lt;ref name=Strabo/&gt; but in the time of Pausanias (2nd century) the place was deserted. Pausanias noticed the ruins of the walls of a temple of [[Poseidon]], certain forts, and a fountain named Canathus, by washing in which [[Hera]] was said to have renewed her virginity every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|2|38|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine and Frankish rule===

[[File:Peter von Hess - The Entry of King Othon of Greece into Nauplia - WGA11386.jpg|thumb|''The Entry of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] into Nauplia'' by [[Peter von Hess]]]]
The [[Acronauplia]] has walls dating from pre-classical times. Subsequently, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Principality of Achaea|Franks]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] added to the fortifications. In the middle ages Nauplia was called τὸ Ναύπλιον, τὸ Ἀνάπλιον, or τὰ Ἀνάπλια. It became a place of considerable importance in the middle ages, and has continued so down to the present day. In the time of the [[Crusades]] it first emerges from obscurity. Nafplio was taken in 1212 by French crusaders of the [[Principality of Achaea]]. It became part of the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], which in 1388 was sold to the Republic of Venice,&lt;ref&gt;''Diplomatarium'' No. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; who regarded it as one of their most important places in the Levant. During the subsequent 150 years, the lower city was expanded and fortified, and new fortifications added to Acronauplia.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venetian and Ottoman rule===
{{Further|Stato da Màr|Ottoman Greece}}
The city, under Venetian rule twice repelled [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks and sieges, first by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] during the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79)]] and then by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The city surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540, who renamed it Mora Yenişehri and established it as the seat of a [[Sanjak of Mora|sanjak]]. At that period, Nafplio looked very much like the 16th century image shown below to the right.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] retook Nafplio in 1685 and made it the capital of their "[[Kingdom of the Morea]]". The city was strengthened by building the castle of [[Palamidi]], which was in fact the last major construction of the [[Stato da Mar|Venetian empire]] overseas. However, only 80 soldiers were assigned to defend the city and it was easily retaken by the Ottomans in 1715. Palamidi is located on a hill north of the old town. During the [[Greek War of Independence]], it played a major role. It was captured by [[Staikos Staikopoulos]] in November 1822.

===19th century===
During the [[Greek War of Independence]], Nafplio was a major Ottoman stronghold and was besieged for more than a year. The town finally surrendered on account of forced starvation. After its capture, because of its strong fortifications, it became the seat of the [[First Hellenic Republic|provisional government of Greece]].

Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], first head of state of newly liberated Greece, set foot on the Greek mainland for the first time in Nafplio on 7 January 1828 and made it the official capital of Greece in 1829.  He was assassinated on 9 October 1831 by members of the [[Mavromichalis]] family, on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplio. After his assassination, a period of anarchy followed, until the arrival of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] and the establishment of the new [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]]. Nafplio remained the capital of the kingdom until 1834, when King Otto decided to move the capital to [[Athens]].

===20th and 21st centuries===

Tourism emerged slowly in the 1960s, but not to the same degree as some other Greek areas. Nevertheless, it tends to attract a number of tourists from [[Germany]] and the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] countries in particular. Nafplio enjoys a very sunny and mild climate, even by Greek standards, and as a consequence has become a popular day or weekend road-trip destination for Athenians in wintertime.

Nafplio is a port, with fishing and transport ongoing, although the primary source of local employment currently is tourism, with two beaches on the other side of the [[peninsula]] from the main body of the town and a large amount of local accommodation.

The building of the [[National Bank of Greece]] is probably the only one in the world to have been built in the [[Mycenaean Revival]] architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;"Greece At Its Most Greek," by Phyllis rose, September 10, 2000, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0D91631F933A2575AC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4 ''New York Times''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
[[File:Nauplia Bahnhof 2.jpg|thumb|Nafplio train station in 2008.]]
===Bus===
Since 1952, the town has been served by public bus ([[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]] Argolida), which provides daily services to all destinations in region as well as other major Greek centers such as Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company|url=http://www.ktelargolida.gr/?module=default&amp;pages_id=4&amp;lang=en|publisher=K.T.E.L Argolidas|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transportation Means|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/transportationmeansmenu.html|website=Municipality of Nafplion|publisher=Municipality of Nafplion|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey to Athens takes two to two hours and 20 minutes, going via Corinth/Isthmos and [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Map/Transport|url=http://www.visitnafplio.com/visitnafplio.com/Map_Transport.html|website=Visit Nafplio|accessdate=6 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401194143/http://www.visitnafplio.com/visitnafplio.com/Map_Transport.html|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
Rail service began in 1886 using an earlier station that still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The historical railway station of Nafplio|url=http://www.trainose.gr/en/%CE%BF-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85/|publisher=TrainOSE|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town is connected by a branch line of ten kilometers from Argos to Nafplio. In 2011, the Corinth–[[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]]–Nafplio train service was suspended during the [[Greek financial crisis]]. There was a plan to re-open the line as an extension of the [[Proastiakos|suburban railway]] that connects Corinth with Athens, but that has not happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zikakou|first1=Ioanna|title=Hellenic Railway to Reach Nafplio|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/10/13/hellenic-railway-to-reach-nafplio/|publisher=Greek Reporter|accessdate=6 April 2016|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and urban sculpture==

[[File:Τραβέρσα Γκαμπέλο 7792.jpg|thumb|Fortifications of Acronauplia]]

[[Acronauplia]] is the oldest part of the city though a modern hotel has been built on it. Until the thirteenth century, it was a town on its own. The arrival of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] transformed it into part of the town fortifications. Other fortifications of the city include the [[Palamidi]] and [[Bourtzi (Nafplio)|Bourtzi]], which is located in the middle of the harbour.

Nafplio maintains a traditional architectural style with many traditional-style colourful buildings and houses, influenced by the Venetians, because of the domination of 1338–1540. Also, modern-era neoclassical buildings are also preserved, while the building of the [[National Bank of Greece]] is an example of [[Mycenaean Revival architecture]].

Around the city can be found several sculptures and statues. They are related mostly with the modern history of Nafplio, such as the statues of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], [[Otto of Greece]] and [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]].

{{Nationalism sidebar |Development}}

The idea of '''national treasure''', like [[national epic]]s and [[national anthem]]s, is part of the language of [[romantic nationalism]], which arose in the late 18th century and 19th centuries. [[Nationalism]] is an ideology which supports the nation as the fundamental unit of human social life, which includes shared language, values and culture. Thus national treasure, part of the ideology of nationalism, is shared culture.

A national treasure can be a shared cultural asset, which may or may not have monetary value; for example, a skilled banjo player would be a Living National Treasure. Or it may refer to a rare cultural object, such as the medieval manuscript [[Plan of St. Gall]] in Switzerland. The government of Japan designates the most famous of the nation's cultural properties as [[National Treasures of Japan]]. The [[National Treasures of Korea]] are a set of artifacts, sites, and buildings which are recognised by South Korea as having exceptional cultural value.

==Notable national treasures==
There are thousands of national treasures around the world. Listed here are samples of the different types of things that can be national treasure:

===People===
Examples of people who have been described as national treasures include the following:
* Certain countries officially designate individuals or groups as Living National Treasures. See, for example, [[Living National Treasures of Japan]].
* American actress, comedian, television presenter and producer [[Betty White]], who has been working in television since 1939, is often referred to as a national treasure in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://jezebel.com/watch-captain-america-help-walk-national-treasure-betty-1678184860&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standard.net/Movies-TV/2015/01/18/Betty-White-s-93rd-birthday-flash-mob-surprise&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comedian, actor, author and director [[Stephen Fry]], broadcaster and naturalist [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]], and racing driver [[Stirling Moss]] have in several high-brow non-industry-specific publications been referred to as national treasures of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/6139097/Stirling-Moss-at-80-the-interview.html |title=Stirling Moss at 80: the interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fordham |first=Mike |url=http://www.influx.co.uk/wordpress/features/stirling-moss/ |title=Sir Stirling Moss: The Knight of the Road |work=Influx Magazine|date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/sir-stirling-moss-still-stirling-stuff-760575.html |title=Sir Stirling Moss: Still Stirling stuff |work=The Independent |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3671485/Stephen-Fry-gives-some-Quite-Interesting-answers.html Stephen Fry gives some Quite Interesting answers] ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 29 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldemayer |first=Winston |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/01/eye-burrowing-worms-national-t.html |title=Short Sharp Science: Eye-burrowing worms, national treasures... and creationism |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/4413130/Sir-David-Attenborough-Man-was-given-permission-to-exploit-the-natural-world-by-the-Bible.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Paul | last=Kendall | title=Sir David Attenborough: 'Man was given permission to exploit the natural world by the Bible' | date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2982907/Margaret-Thatcher-Richard-Branson-and-Judi-Dench-picked-as-National-Treasures.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Margaret Thatcher, Richard Branson and Judi Dench picked as National Treasures | date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the [[Brazil national football team]] won the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]], wealthy European clubs offered massive fees to sign their young star player, [[Pelé]], but the government of [[Brazil]] declared him an official national treasure to prevent him from being transferred out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=63869/index.html | title=Pelé (Edson Arantes do Nascimento) The King of football | work=FIFA.com | author= | date= | accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The late [[German humour|German humorist]] [[Vicco von Bülow]] alias ''Loriot'' had the status of a national treasure in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/24/germany-comedy-loriot |title=Germany mourns king of comedy Loriot |work=The Guardian |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' began running a column poking fun at an exponential increase in references in the press to "national treasures".&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Private Eye'' no. 1340 (17–30 May 2013), "National Treasures", p. 13, contains excerpts from newspaper reports which attach the status to [[Olivia Colman]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Graham Norton]] and (formerly) [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Desrey de Troyes''' ({{circa|1450–1514}}) was a French chronicler, historian, genealogist and translator. 
Relatively little is known of his life, but his work is of value to historians.

==Life and work==
[[File:Vergänglichkeitsbuch 295 143r.jpg|thumb|Page from the ''Vergänglichkeitsbuch'' of Wilhelm Werner, a translation of the ''Visio Heremitae'' by Pierre Desrey]]
Desrey was born around 1450 and died around 1514.{{sfn|Pastan|White|Gilbert|2014|p=15}}
He was a native of [[Troyes]]. His motto was said to be ''Tout par honneur'' (All in good faith).{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=2}}
Little is known of his life, but his work indicates that he was well educated and had broad interests.{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=4}}
He was a scholar with deep knowledge of the scriptures, a translator and a compiler of history who drew on different sources.{{sfn|Weill|Suard}}
In his continuation of the ''Chronicles de Enguerran de Monstrelet'', which includes the whole reign of [[Charles VIII of France]], he describes himself as a "''simple orateur de Troyes en Champagne''."{{sfn|Dacier|1867|p=35}}
Since there is no record of his being a member of the clergy, "''orateur''" may be taken as meaning "prose writer".{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=5}}

Desrey contributed to the ''Mystère de la Passion de Troyes'', and acted in the plays as a member of the ''Compagnons de Mystère''.{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=26}}
According to Théophile Boutiot, Desrey was one of the main actors in 1497, and could be called the principal.
That year he represented the eternal Father. The town gave him 100 sous for his expenses and effort.{{sfn|Bibolet|1987|p=xxii}}
His writings include a Latin version of the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'' (1490), a translation of [[Nicholas of Lyra]]'s ''Les Postilles et Expositions des Epistres et Evangilles Dominacales'' (1493), a translation of [[Werner Rolevinck]]'s ''Fleurs et Manières des Temps Passées'' (1495), a compilation ''La genealogie avecques les gestes et nobles faitz d'armes du trespreux et renommé prince Godeffroy de Boulion'' (1504), ''Parement et triumphe des Dames d'Olivier de la Marche'' (1510) and contributions on Monstrelet (1512) and Gaguin (1514) to the ''Grandes Chroniques de France''.{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=4}}

Desrey is thought to be the author of several poems, and is also thought to be the author of the Troyes ''Mémoire''.{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=4}}
This was apparently written in 1492.{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=5}}
It is a set of instructions for artists making tapestries for the [[Church of Saint-Urbain, Troyes]], that would depict legends of [[Saint Urban]] and [[Saint Cecilia]].
They gave a good sense of the details he thought important as an iconographer, but left considerable freedom of expression to the artist.{{sfn|Pastan|White|Gilbert|2014|p=15}}
{{blockquote|Item, to begin the representation ... a domestic tabernacle shaped like a noble palace will be portrayed in which glorious St. Urban will be depicted, dressed as a young schoolboy, hands joined, eyes looking up to heaven, kneeling humbly before an altar.{{sfn|Pastan|White|Gilbert|2014|p=15}} }}
Desrey's ''Genealogie de Godefroi de Buillon'', completed in 1499, survives only in print.
It gives a complete history of the [[Crusades]], starting with the birth of the ''Chevalier au Cygne'' ([[Knight of the Swan]]), the mythical ancestor of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] (1060–1100), and ending after the accession of [[Philip IV of France]] (1268–1314).
At least six editions are preserved from the 16th century, published between 1504 and 1580.{{sfn|Weill|Suard}}

The '''Good Name Redoubt''' – '''Polish Anti-Defamation  League''' or '''Polish League Against Defamation''' ({{lang-pl|Fundacja Reduta Dobrego Imienia - Polska Liga Przeciw Zniesławieniom}}) is a [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. It was founded in 2013 by [[Maciej Świrski]], who according to internet media company [[BuzzFeed|Buzzfeed]] has close ties to the ruling [[Law and Justice|Law and Justice Party]].&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed201803"&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/the-first-people-have-just-been-accused-of-violating?utm_term=.deNAYdWYy#.tfx4JlMJx The First People Have Just Been Accused Of Violating Poland's New Holocaust Law], Buzzfeed News, J. Lester Feder &amp; Marcin Krasnowolski, 3 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==
The stated objectives of the League are to defend the name of Poland and the Polish people against acts of vilification in the international media or historical misrepresentation in the world of politics. For instance, on the 75th anniversary of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 2014, the League staged a protest in front of the Russian Embassy in Warsaw against the Russian government's denial of responsibility for the [[War_crimes_in_occupied_Poland_during_World_War_II#Soviet_war_crimes_against_Poland|atrocities committed by the Soviet Union in occupied Poland]]. The protest was attended by several hundred people including civil rights organizations such as [[Euromaidan]] from Ukraine and [[Solidarność Walcząca]].&lt;ref name="niezalezna2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://niezalezna.pl/59503-wielki-protest-przed-ambasada-rosji-17-wrzesnia-75-lat-temu-sowieci-napadli-na-polske | title=Wielki protest przed ambasadą Rosji - 17 września, 75. lat temu Sowieci napadli na Polskę | publisher=Niezalezna.pl | work=Informacje | date=17 September 2014 | accessdate=26 July 2015 | author=Magdalena Piejko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the League's founder Maciej Świrski, the League acts through lobbying, publishing ads, open letters as well as articles which promote Poland's World War II history of defiance, stressing the country's critical role in defeating [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=Swirski&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wpolityce.pl/artykuly/41513-reduta-dobrego-imienia-polski-bronmy-sie-sami-widzac-biernosc-polskiej-wladzy |title=Reduta Dobrego Imienia Polski.

Seeing the passivity of the Polish government, let defend ourselves.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Świrski, the League fights "anti-Polish propaganda" in foreign media and film, countering widely held perceptions that Poles were co-responsible with the Nazis for the Holocaust, and informs the general public on the [["Polish death camp" controversy]].&lt;ref name=Swirski /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wpolityce.pl/wydarzenia/46407-wazne-slowa-jana-pietrzaka-niemcy-udaja-ze-ich-w-ii-wojnie-swiatowej-nie-bylo-dlaczego-komorowski-to-wspiera |title=Ważne słowa Jana Pietrzaka: Niemcy udają, że ich w II Wojnie Światowej nie było… "Dlaczego Komorowski to wspiera?" |language=pl |first= |last= |date=February 26, 2013 |work=wPolityce.pl |trans-title=The Germans pretend as if they didn't exist during World War II… "Why is Komorowski supporting this?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Following the international release of the 2013 Polish film ''[[Ida (film)|Ida]]'', the league called for the film to carry title cards stating that Poland was under German occupation during the events depicted. More than 40,000 people signed a petition organized by the league criticizing ''Ida'''s supposed inaccuracies and anti-Polish bias. The film's director called the demands "absurd", "too silly to comment on", and "a stream of hatred from the rightist Polish media".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/30/pawel-pawlikowski-ida-criticism-film Ida director Pawel Pawlikowski stands ground against complaints of historical inaccuracy], Guardian, 30 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The League collected tens of thousands of signatures in order to pass the [[Act on the Institute of National Remembrance#2018 amendment|Polish Holocaust law]], which has been criticized by historians as an attempt to silence discussion of Polish complicity in wartime atrocities. Świrski, who heads the league, was instrumental in passing the bill and was possibly the only person consulted prior to the law being presented to parliament by the Justice ministry. In March 2018, following passage of the Holocaust law, the League filed a lawsuit the Argentine newspaper Pagina12 which published in December 2017 an item on the [[Jedwabne pogrom]] which contained a photograph that the League says is a post-war photograph rather than a 1941 photograph from Jedwabne.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed201803"/&gt;

==Criticism==

[[The Daily Telegraph]], [[The Times of Israel]], [[The Jewish Chronicle]], and [[The Jerusalem Post]] have described the organization as "nationalist".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/oscar-nominated-ida-attacked-by-polish-nationalists/ Oscar-nominated ‘Ida’ attacked by Polish nationalists], Times of Israel, 28 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/11425629/Oscars-2015-Pawel-Pawlikowski-on-Oscar-winner-Ida.html Oscars 2015: Pawel Pawlikowski on Oscar winner Ida], Telegraph, Tim Robey, 23 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpost.com/International/Argentina-newspaper-first-target-of-controversial-Polish-Holocaust-law-544098 ARGENTINA NEWSPAPER FIRST TARGET OF CONTROVERSIAL POLISH HOLOCAUST LAW], JPost, Eytan Halon, 3 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/world/polish-historian-says-he-was-forced-to-switch-jobs-because-of-his-holocaust-research-1.461937 Polish historian says he was forced to switch jobs because of his Holocaust research], [[The Jewish Chronicle]], Sam Sokol, 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International's Poland researcher Barbora Černušáková, it is a "nationalist organization close to Poland’s government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/5193301/poland-holocaust-law-freedom-speech-amnesty/ Poland's Holocaust Law Is a Dangerous Threat to Free Speech], Time, 9 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Index on Censorship]], has described the organization as a "campaign group close to the ruling Polish party",&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306422018770110?journalCode=ioca Gebert, Konstanty.

Página/12 published an article in December 2017 about the massacre of Jews in Jedwabne in 1941, featuring an image of anti-communist Polish partisans. The Polish League Against Defamation claims confusing the image of the partisans with the issue of Jedwabne is defamatory. Since then, other media have shared the article.&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/polish-group-files-suit-against-argentina-newspaper-over-holocaust-story Poland: group sues Argentinian newspaper under new Holocaust law], Guardian, Christian Davies and Uki Goñi, 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] described the League as a "right-wing Polish group".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jta.org/2018/03/04/news-opinion/polish-group-sues-newspaper-argentina-controversial-new-holocaust-law Polish group sues newspaper in Argentina under controversial new Holocaust law], 4 March 2018, [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Haaretz]] it is an "independent organization considered close to Poland’s right-wing, nationalist government".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/poland-s-holocaust-law-first-lawsuit-filed-using-contentious-law-1.5867841 Poland's Holocaust Law: First Lawsuit Filed Using Contentious Legislation], Haaretz, Ofer Aderet, 4 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9437">[[File:John Dewey in 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Pragmatic ethics was discussed by [[John Dewey]] (pictured)]] '''Pragmatic ethics''' is a theory of [[normative ethics|normative]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[ethics]]. Ethical pragmatists such as [[John Dewey]] believe that some societies have progressed [[morality|morally]] in much the way they have attained progress in [[science]]. Scientists can pursue [[inquiry]] into the [[truth]] of a [[hypothesis]] and [[belief|accept]] the hypothesis, in the sense that they act as though the hypothesis were true; nonetheless, they think that future generations can advance science, and thus future generations can refine or replace (at least some of) their accepted hypotheses. Similarly, ethical pragmatists think that norms, principles, and moral criteria are likely to be improved as a result of [[inquiry]].

==Contrast with other normative theories&lt;!--'Peircean realism' redirects here--&gt;==
Much as it is appropriate for scientists to act as though a hypothesis were true despite expecting future inquiry to supplant it, ethical pragmatists acknowledge that it can be appropriate to practice a variety of other normative approaches (e.g. [[consequentialism]], [[deontological ethics]], and [[virtue ethics]]), yet acknowledge the need for mechanisms which allow society to advance beyond such approaches, a freedom for discourse which does not take any such theory as assumed.&lt;ref name=Liszka&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2005/Liszka.htm |title= What Is Pragmatic Ethics? |first= James |last= Liszka | accessdate= 2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, aimed at [[social innovation]], the ''practice'' of pragmatic ethics supplements the practice of other normative approaches with what [[John Stuart Mill]] called "experiments of living".&lt;ref name=Mill1863&gt;{{harvtxt|Mill|1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatic ethics also differs from other normative approaches ''theoretically'', according to {{harvtxt|Lafollette|2000}}:&lt;ref name="Lafollette2000"/&gt;

# It focuses on society, rather than on lone individuals, as the entity which achieves morality.&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{harvtxt|Lafollette|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dewey's words, "all conduct is ... social." &lt;ref name=Dewey1922&gt;{{harvtxt| Dewey|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It does not hold any known moral criteria as beyond potential for revision.&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; Pragmatic ethics may be misunderstood as [[Moral relativism|relativist]], as failing to be objective, but that is like suggesting that science fails to be objective. Ethical pragmatists, like scientists, can maintain that their endeavor is objective on the grounds that it converges towards something objective (a thesis called '''Peircean realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;).&lt;ref name="Almeder1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Almeder |first= R. |year=1983 |title= Scientific Progress and Peircean Utopian Realism |journal= Erkenntnis |issue= 20 |pages= 253–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It allows that a moral judgment may be appropriate in one age of a given society, even though it will cease to be appropriate after that society progresses (or may already be inappropriate in another society).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; For example, the writings of [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|on slavery]] framed slavery as ultimately immoral, yet temporarily moral until America was ready for abolition.&lt;ref name="HEI"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bateman | first = Newton |author2=Paul Selby |author3=Frances M. Shonkwiler |author4=Henry L Fowkes  | title = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois | publisher = Munsell Publishing Company | year = 1908 | location = Chicago, IL | page = 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to pragmatism==
Establishing that this normative theory entails [[pragmatism]] (or vice versa) remains an open challenge. The ''Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory'' refers to this theory as pragmatic and finds it in the writings of [[John Dewey]] (a pragmatist). However, it also finds key concepts in the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]],&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; and we can see at least some of its distinguishing characteristics in the concept of [[social gadfly]] attributed to [[Socrates]] in [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.Apol.30e&amp;lang=original | title = Apology 30e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Pragmatic ethics has been criticized as conflating [[descriptive ethics]]  with [[normative ethics]], as describing the way people ''do'' make moral judgments rather than the way they ''should'' make them. While some ethical pragmatists may have questioned the distinction between normative and descriptive truth, the theory of pragmatic ethics itself does not conflate them any more than science conflates truth about its subject matter with current opinion about it.&lt;ref name=Liszka/&gt;

==Moral ecology==
Moral ecology is a variation of pragmatic ethics which additionally supposes that morality evolves like an [[ecosystem]], and ethical practice should therefore include strategies analogous to those of [[ecosystem management]] (e.g. protecting a degree of moral diversity). The term "moral ecology" has been used since at least 1985 to imply a [[symbiosis]] whereby the viability of any existing moral approach would be diminished by the destruction of all alternative approaches.&lt;ref name=Bellah1985&gt;{{harvtxt|Bellah|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Hertzke1998&gt;{{harvtxt| Hertzke |1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tim Dean, current scientific evidence confirms that humans do take diverse approaches to morality, and such [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] gives humanity [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] against a wider range of situations and environments (which makes moral diversity a natural consequence of [[frequency-dependent selection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:12763/SOURCE02?view=true |last1 = Dean | first1 = Tim |title= Evolution &amp; Moral Ecology | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' is the period in European art from either the emergence of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian kingdom]] in about AD 500 or from the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the late 8th century, to the beginning of the 11th century [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period. The term is generally used in English only for [[architecture]] and [[monumental sculpture]], but here all the arts of the period are briefly described.

The primary theme during this period is the introduction and absorption of [[Classical art|classical]] Mediterranean and [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] forms with Germanic ones, which fostered innovative new forms. This in turn led to the rise of Romanesque art in the 11th century. In the outline of [[Medieval art]] it was preceded by what is commonly called the [[Migration Period art]] of the "barbarian" peoples: [[Insular art|Hiberno-Saxon]] in the British Isles and predominantly [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]] on the Continent.

In most of western Europe, the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] architectural tradition survived the collapse of the empire. The Merovingians ([[Franks]]) continued to build large stone buildings like [[monastery]] [[church architecture|churches]] and palaces.

The unification of the Frankish kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church. Two hundred monasteries existed south of the [[Loire]] when [[St Columbanus]], an Irish missionary, arrived in Europe in 585.  Only 100 years later, by the end of the 7th century, over 400 flourished in the Merovingian kingdom alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-art.org/history128-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The building plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition.

Many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in [[Bishop]] [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''History of the Franks'' of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at [[Tours]] by [[Saint Perpetuus]] (bishop 460–490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: "Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'' (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merovingian dynasty were replaced by the [[Carolingian dynasty]] in AD 752, which led to [[Carolingian architecture]] from 780 to 900, and [[Ottonian architecture]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from the mid-10th century until the mid-11th century. These successive Frankish dynasties were large contributors to [[Romanesque architecture]].

==Imperial styles==

===Carolingian art===
[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Saint Mark, from the so-called [[Ebbo Gospels]], a piece of Carolingian illustration.]]
{{main|Carolingian art|Carolingian architecture}}

Carolingian art is the roughly 120-year period from about 780 to 900, during [[Charlemagne]]'s and his immediate heirs' rule, popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Although brief, it was very influential; northern European kings promoted classical Mediterranean Roman art forms for the first time, while also creating innovative new forms such as naturalistic figure line drawings that would have lasting influence. Carolingian churches generally are [[basilica]]n, like the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated [[westwork]]s, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original [[westwork]] survives today at the [[Abbey of Corvey]], built in 885. After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

===Ottonian art===
{{main|Ottonian art|Ottonian architecture}}
[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] pre-Romanesque art during the 120-year period from 936 to 1056 is commonly called Ottonian art after the three [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon]] emperors named Otto ([[Otto the Great|Otto I]], [[Otto II]], and [[Otto III]]) who ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 936 to 1001.

After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon (Ottonian) dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.

Much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], Theoderich, and [[Justinian]] as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly [[Charlemagne]].

Ottonian monasteries produced some of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.

==Regional styles==

===Croatia===
{{Main|Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
[[File:Zadar2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pre-Romanesque Church of [[Donatus of Zadar|St Donatus]] in [[Zadar]], from the 9th century.]]

In the 7th century the [[Croats]], with other [[Slavs]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111211445/http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Croatian churches were built as royal sanctuaries, and the influence of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplifications and alterations of inherited forms, and even creation of original buildings, appeared.

All of them (a dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with roughly cut stone bounded with a thick layer of malter on the outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three [[naves]] like [[Church of Holy Salvation, Cetina|Church of Holy Salvation]] ({{lang-hr|Crkva Sv. Spasa}}) at the spring of the river [[Cetina]], built in the 9th century, along with the [[Church of Saint Cross]] in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]]. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is dedicated to [[Donatus of Zadar|Saint Donatus]] in [[Zadar]].

[[Altar]] rails and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] that is called ''[[pleter]]'' (meaning to weed) because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through itself. Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art; sometimes figures from the Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like ''relief in Holy Nedjeljica'' in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. This also happened to engravings in early Croatian script – [[Glagolitic]]. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with [[Latin]] on altar rails and [[architrave]]s of old-Croatian churches.

From the ''Crown Church of [[King Zvonimir]]'' (so called ''Hollow Church'' in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]]) comes the altar board with ''figure of Croatian King'' on the throne with [[Carolingian]] crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king.

By joining the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] crown in the twelfth century, Croatia lost its full independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead this ensured the beginning of a new era of [[Central Europe]]an cultural influence.

===England===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon architecture}}
[[File:Meister des Benedictionale des Heiligen Aethelwold 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|Benedictional of Saint Aethelwold]], an [[List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts|Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscript]].]]

Anglo-Saxon art covers the period from the time of [[King Alfred]] (885), with the revival of English culture after the end of the Viking raids, to the early 12th century, when [[Romanesque art]] became the new movement. Prior to King Alfred there had been the [[Hiberno-Saxon]] culture, producing in [[Insular art]] the fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs, which had largely ceased in Ireland and Northern England with the [[Viking]] invasions. Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through [[illuminated manuscripts]] and metalwork.

===France===
After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, so that lacking any organized Imperial patronage, French art of the 10th and 11th centuries became localised around the large monasteries, and lacked the sophistication of a court-directed style.

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts (as models to draw from), and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of [[Saint Bertin]] became an important centre under its abbot [[Odbert]] (986–1007) who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of [[Abbey of St. Vaast|Saint Vaast]] created a number of works. In southwestern France at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|monastery of Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]] a number of manuscripts were produced around year 1000, as were produced in [[Albi]], [[Figeac]] and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascony]]. In Paris there developed a style at the abbey of [[Saint Germain-des-Prés]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style developed from 975 onward.

===Spain and Portugal===
{{main|Spanish Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
[[File:Capela de S. Frutuoso.JPG|thumb|right|[[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in [[Braga]], Portugal.]]
The first form of Pre-Romanesque in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] was the [[Visigothic art]], that brought the horse-shoe arches to the latter [[Moorish architecture]] and developed jewellery.

After the Moorish occupation, Pre-Romanesque art was first reduced to the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], the only Christian realm in the area at the time which reached high levels of artistic depuration. (See ''[[Asturian art]]''). The Christians who lived in Moorish territory, the [[Mozarab]]s, created their own architectural and illumination style, [[Mozarabic art]].

The best preserved Visigothic monument in [[Portugal]] is the [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in [[Braga]].

===Italy===
{{see also|Lombard Romanesque}}
Southern Italy benefited from the presence and cross fertilization of the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Normans, while the north was mostly controlled first by the Carolingians. The [[Italo-Norman|Normans]] in Sicily chose to commission Byzantine workshops to decorate their churches such as [[Monreale]] and [[Cefalù Cathedral]]s where full iconographic programmes of [[mosaic]]s have survived. Important frescos and illuminated manuscripts were produced.

== Inspiration ==
During the [[Iraq War]], the rising number of troops killed and wounded by underbelly IEDs buried by insurgents in the middle of the road prompted the U.S. military to funnel billions of dollars into the development of several  countermeasures to either detect the explosive or minimize the damage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/01/AR2007100101760.html|title='You can't armor your way out of this problem'|last=Atkinson|first=Rick|date=October 2, 2007|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the frequent delays in producing and delivering these countermeasures to Iraq lead to shortages in effective IED-defeating technology. As a result, several soldiers on the battlefield ended up improvising their own solutions that took advantage of how the passive infrared sensors on the IEDs reacted to heat signatures. One unnamed soldier proposed mounting a large hair dryer to the front of the vehicle to blow hot air on the road to prematurely set off any hidden IEDs and clear the path. Another soldier supposedly purchased a toaster at a bazaar, plugged the appliance into his Humvee, and attached it to the end of a long pole that was welded to the front of the vehicle. These and other similar ideas led JIEDDO to develop Rhino in 2006, one of their earliest innovations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/07/ff_roadside_bombs/all/|title=U.S. Military Learns to Fight Deadliest Weapons|last=Higginbotham|first=Adam|date=July 28, 2010|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial design consisted of a glow plug that was placed inside a metal ammunition can, which was then attached to a 10&amp;nbsp;ft long metal pole with the other end mounted onto the front of a vehicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The glow plug acted as a heat decoy, which triggered any nearby IED’s infrared sensor prematurely and fired the [[EFP (explosively formed penetrator)|copper explosively formed penetrator (EFP)]] slug at the Rhino instead of the vehicle behind it. The countermeasure proved to be a success at the time as U.S. forces found that the Rhino could not only take the impact of an EFP but also, in rare cases, continue working afterwards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Changes ==
Despite the favorable outcome of the Rhino’s initial run, insurgents soon began making modifications to the IEDs to account for this countermeasure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within six weeks, the aim of the EFP was adjusted so that the slug was fired 10 feet back from the Rhino to hit the vehicle. In response, JIEDDO and researchers at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] in Adelphi, Maryland designed and developed the Rhino II, which came with a telescoping pole whose length could be adjusted to change the position of the heat decoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+the+U.S.+army+research+laboratory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji8OGloNHbAhWMpFkKHXZRCqEQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhino&amp;f=false|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=Army Research Laboratory|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 16,000 Rhino II devices were deployed to the U.S. Army and Marines in Iraq by the end of 2008, costing around $1,800 each to produce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before long, the Rhino II was featured on almost every U.S. vehicle in Iraq. However, by 2010, newer IEDs began to use high-powered radio waves from coalition jammers instead of heat signatures to set of the EFP as a countermeasure against Rhino II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Currently, more than 34,000 Rhino gadgets have been deployed to U.S. troops overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pica.army.mil/pmccs/CombatMunitions/Defeat/Rhino.html|title=Rhino Convoy Protection Device|website=www.pica.army.mil|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert of Torigni''' (also known as ''Roburtus de Monte'') (c.1110–1186) was a Norman [[monk]], [[prior]], [[abbot]] and an important twelfth century [[chronicle]]r.

==Religious life==
He was born at Torigni-sur-Vire, Normandy c.1110&lt;ref&gt;"Robert De Torigni," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition (Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 2012) 25 Apr. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; most probably to an aristocratic family but his family name was abandoned when he entered [[Bec Abbey]] in 1128&lt;ref name="RDM6"&gt;''The Chronicles of Robert de Monte'', ed. Joseph Stevenson (Llanerch Publishers, 1991), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1149 Robert of Torigni became the prior of Bec replacing [[Roger de Bailleul]] who had by that time become abbot.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Gibson, 'History at Bec in the twelfth century', ''The Writing of History in the Middle Ages; Essays Presented to Richard William Southern'', Ed. R.H.C. Davis, J.M. Wallace-Hadrill (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1981), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In 1154 Robert became the abbot of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronique de Robert de Torigni'', ed. Leopold delisle, Vol. I (A.Le Brument, Rouen  1872), p. i&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1158 Robert hosted kings [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Henry II of England]] at Mont Saint-Michel.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicles of Robert de Monte'', ed. Joseph Stevenson (Llanerch Publishers, 1991), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later Robert de Torigni, along with [[Achard of St. Victor]], Bishop of Avranches, stood as sponsors (Godfathers) to [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], born to [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Queen Eleanor]] at [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]] in 1161.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicles of Robert de Monte'', ed. Joseph Stevenson (Llanerch Publishers, 1991), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1163 he was in Rome.&lt;ref name="chX"&gt;''The Church Historians of England'', Vol. IV, Part II, ed. Joseph Stevenson (Seeleys, London, 1856), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known to have visited England representing Mont Saint-Michel.&lt;ref name="chX"/&gt; In June 1186 Robert died and was buried in the [[nave]] of the chapel at Mont Saint-Michel under a simple grave marker.&lt;ref&gt;''Saturday Review,'' Vol. LXX (London, 1890), p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 a lead disc was found in his coffin bearing his epitaph. The translation reads: Here lies Robert Torigni, abbot of this place, who ruled the monastery 32 years, and lived 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis de Tombelaine, ''Le Mont Saint-Michel et ses Merveilles'' (Société Française d'imprimerie, 1919), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Robert developed a reputation as being a pious monk, an accomplished diplomat, a skilled organizer&lt;ref name="Msr"&gt;''The Messenger'', Vol. VIII, Fifth Series/Vol XLIV of the whole series (The Messenger, New York City, 19050, P. 477&lt;/ref&gt; and a great lover and collector of books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/france/ensavoirplus/sources/RobertTorigni.htm# Pierre Bouet, Office of Academic Studies Norman, University of Caen, ''Introduction to L. Delisle, Robert Torigni Chronicle'', 2 vols., Rouen, 1872-1873 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Under Robert de Torigni Mont Saint-Michel became a great center of learning with sixty monks producing copious manuscripts and a library collection so vast it was called the ''Cité des Livres'' (City of Books).&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Barbour, ''Brittany'' (Cadogan Guides, London, 2005)  p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Robert himself was called "The Great Librarian of the Mont".&lt;ref name="Msr"/&gt; Robert's principal interest was not so much in man's path to salvation, or in the moral lessons of history; it was in what he called "chronography" (organizing historical events in chronological order).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Gibson, 'History at Bec in the twelfth century, ''The Writing of History in the Middle Ages; Essays Presented to Richard William Southern'', Ed. R.H.C. Davis, J.M. Wallace-Hadrill (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1981), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; He made no attempts to interpret history but wrote plainly "without a trace of romance in his soul."&lt;ref name="MG176"&gt;Margaret Gibson, 'History at Bec in the twelfth century, ''The Writing of History in the Middle Ages; Essays Presented to Richard William Southern'', Ed. R.H.C. Davis, J.M. Wallace-Hadrill (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1981), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stevenson|Stevenson]] said, however, Torigni was not always correct in his chronology and made errors even in matters in Normandy of which he should have known better, yet he was always honest and truthful and his mistakes did not greatly affect the overall value of his chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicles of Robert de Monte'', ed. Joseph Stevenson (Llanerch Publishers, 1991), p. 6 n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Modern writers too have pointed out errors in his work;&lt;ref&gt;D. J. A. Matthew, 'Review of the [[Gesta Normannorum Ducum]] of William of Jumièges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Vol. II: Books V-VIII by William of Jumièges; Orderic Vitalis; Robert of Torigni; Elisabeth M. C. van Houts', ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 112, No. 449 (Nov., 1997), p. 1238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Peerage'', vol. xii/1, ed. G.H. White (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London, 1953), pp. 491-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth M.C. Van Houts, 'Robert of Torigni as Genealogist', ''Studies in Medieval History presented to R. Allen Brown'', ed. Christopher Harper-Bill, Christoper J. Holdsworth, Janet L. Nelson (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 1989), pp. 215, 217, 222, 224, 229, 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Elisabeth Van Houts in her article ('Robert of Torigni as Genealogist', ''Studies in Medieval History presented to R. Allen Brown'', Boydell Press, 1989, p. 222) suggests that not all the mistakes in Robert de Torigni's Chronicles are his own, that a few are attributable to modern historians who have difficulty with his narrative style genealogies.&lt;/ref&gt;   and where he has given confusing or conflicting accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth M.C. Van Houts, 'Robert of Torigni as Genealogist', ''Studies in Medieval History presented to R. Allen Brown'', ed. Christopher Harper-Bill, Christoper J. Holdsworth, Janet L. Nelson (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 1989), pp. 225, 228-9, 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.S.B. Keats-Rohan, Aspects of Torigny's Genealogies Revisited, ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', Vol. 37 (1993) pp. 21, 23, 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Léopold Victor Delisle|Delisle]] wrote that it was through Robert's affection for Henry II that he made almost no mention in his chronicle of the death of [[Thomas Becket]] or Henry II's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronique de Robert de Torigni'', ed. Leopold Delisle, Vol. II (A.Le Brument, Rouen  1873), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==His works==
He is best known as the last of the three contributors to the ''[[Gesta Normannorum Ducum]]'' (Deeds of the Norman dukes), a [[chronicle]] originally written by [[William of Jumièges]], appended to by [[Orderic Vitalis]] and lastly Robert de Torigni, who brought the history up to the time of Henry I.&lt;ref&gt;Cassandra Potts, 'Review of the Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumièges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni Volume II: Books V-VIII by Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts', ''Albion'',  Vol. 29, No. 1 (Spring, 1997), page 82&lt;/ref&gt; Robert relied more on Orderic's work than that of William of Jumièges and added information regarding the reign of William the Conqueror, a history of Bec, and a volume on Henry I.&lt;ref&gt;Wace; Glyn S Burgess; Elisabeth M.C. Van Houts, ''The History of the Norman people: Wace's Roman de Rou'' (Boydell Press, Rochester, NY, 2004), p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Another source he used was [[Henry of Huntingdon|Henry of Huntingdon's]] ''Historia Anglorum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon, Historia Anglorum'', ed. Diana Greenway (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996), p. lxi&lt;/ref&gt; Henry, the Archdeacon of Huntingdon, had visited Bec in 1139 and during his stay there provided Robert with much of the information regarding the reign of Henry I which Robert used in his own chronicles.&lt;ref name="MG176"/&gt; Robert, in turn, introduced Henry to a new work by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], the [[Historia Regum Britanniae]], a copy of which first reached Bec circa 1138.&lt;ref name="MG176"/&gt;
[[File:MontStMichel-StatueFremiet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{center|the Archangel Saint Michel guards the steeple of Mont Saint-Michel}}]]
[[John Bale]], the sixteenth-century English churchman and historian, in his ''Index Britanniae Scriptorum'', identified Robert as the author of two Arthurian romances, based in part by the author's initialing his work with the letter "R". These were ''[[De Ortu Waluuanii]]'' and ''Historia Meriadoci'', but this identification remains controversial and is doubted by some authorities.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Dr. James Bruce analyzed the writing style of these two romances compared to the writings of Robert de Torigni. His opinion was they did not match, and also pointed out how Bale made the mistake of attributing these romances to Robert based on an incorrect assumption. Additional evidence shows these romances to be the products of thirteenth century writers, not twelfth. See: ''Two Arthurian Romances of the XIIIth Century in Latin Prose'', ed. J. Douglas Bruce (Johns Hopkins Press, 1913), pp. x-xv, sub: "II. Bale's ascription of the romances to Robert de Torigni". Also see: Mildred Leake Day, ''Latin Arthurian literature'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 3–11 for more discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Archaeological Institute''' ('''RAI''') is a [[learned society]], established in 1844, with interests in all aspects of the archaeological, architectural and landscape history of the British Isles. Membership is open to all with an interest in these areas.

==Activities==
One of the Institute's principal activities is the publication of the ''[[Archaeological Journal]]'', an annual [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal containing reports of archaeological and architectural survey and fieldwork on sites and monuments of all periods, and syntheses and overviews of similar work throughout the British Isles. It also hosts lectures and seminars, and both sponsors and participates in field trips to archaeological sites and landscapes. It works in cooperation with other archaeological bodies and societies. A programme of monthly lectures is held from October to May at [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Royal Archaeological Institute |publisher=Royal Archaeological Institute |url=http://www.royalarchinst.org/about |accessdate=24 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==

In his work, Dr. Gerovitch emphasizes the influence of underlying cultural processes on science progress. For example, he introduced the term [http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/newspeak.htm "cyberspeak"], that is a [[newspeak]] of [[cybernetics]], i.e., "the language we use to talk about that computer" [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jahc/3310410.0008.211/--slava-gerovitchs-from-newspeak-to-cyberspeak-a-history?rgn=main;view=fulltext] that was a must in Soviet Union to survive in science. In his research, Gerovitch demonstrates how the progress of technology (e.g., aeronautics in Soviet Union) fits into the surrounding reality, culture and politics.

Slava Gerovitch is an author of more than 50 of peer reviewed journal publications, translations and book chapters on [[history of technology]] and science, including mathematics, cybernetics and aeronautics that were highly acknowledged by the experts in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Culture of Mathematics|url=http://www.sciculture.ac.uk/2013/10/15/the-culture-of-mathematics/|website=Art and Humanities Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Connections|issue=4 (7)|publisher=UNC at Chapel Hill Center FedEx Global Education Center,|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=Benjamin|title=From Newspeak to Cyberspeak: A History of Soviet Cybernetics|journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]]|date=2006|volume=78 | issue = 4 |pages=1010–1011|doi=10.1086/511249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balzer|first1=Harley|title=Slava Gerovitch.

In 2010, together with [[Pavel Etingof]] he co-founded [[Program for Research In Mathematics, Engineering and Science (PRIMES)]], the MIT Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science for High School Students, and has since served as its Program Director.&lt;ref&gt;"World-class research … in the 10th grade," [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/primes-research.html MIT News] (October 5, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012 Dr. Gerovitch has served as program director for the Math Department's [https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/rsi/index.php RSI] and [http://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/index.php SPUR] summer programs.

In addition to writing on the history of scientific theories, Slava Gerovitch is writing poetry in English and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerovitch|first1=Slava|title=Wordplay: A book of Russian and English poetry (Russian Edition)|date=2014|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=1495337081|pages=112|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wordplay-book-Russian-English-poetry/dp/1495337081/}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lyric poetry contains allusions to the works of [[Homer]], [[Dante]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Pushkin]], [[Trakl]], [[Pasternak]], [[Mandelshtam]], [[Nabokov]], [[Brodsky]], and [[Okudzhava]].

== Education and awards ==

Dr. Gerovitch was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].

И. Вавилова РАН|Institute for the History of Natural Science and Technology in Moscow]] in 1992 with thesis "The Dynamics of Research Programs in the Artificial Intelligence Field.", and Ph.D. in history and social study of science from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s Science, Technology and Society Program in 1999 under [[Loren Graham]] with thesis "Speaking Cybernetically: The Soviet Remaking of an American Science".  In 2001 - 2006 Slava Gerovitch was a Dibner/Sloan Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Associate at the [http://web.mit.edu/dibner/ Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology at MIT].
Dr. Gerovitch has been lecturing in [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] since 1999. His most recent class is Cultural History of Mathematics. His research interests include history of mathematics, cybernetics, and computing, space history and policy, history of Russian and Soviet science and technology, history and memory, and rhetoric and science.

His book, [http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/newspeak.htm From Newspeak to Cyberspeak: A History of Soviet Cybernetic], received the honorable mention for the [http://www.aseees.org/programs/aseees-prizes/wayne-s-vucinich-book-prize Wayne S. Vucinich Book Prize] for an outstanding monograph in [[Russian studies]]. According to the [http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/newspeak.htm MIT Press release, 2002] [https://history.stanford.edu/people/david-holloway|Dr David Holloway, Raymond A. Spruance Professor of International History], [[Stanford University]] called it "An exceptionally lively and interesting book. This is by far the best-informed and most insightful account of cybernetics in the Soviet Union". The British Journal for the History of Science describes that "the book offers useful and stimulating insight into this most American of technology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=D.

The '''Szarvas inscription''' refers to the inscription on a bone [[needlecase|needle case]] found near [[Szarvas]] in southeastern [[Hungary]] and dating from the second half of the 8th century, the "[[Late Avar]]" period (700-791).&lt;ref&gt;[[András Róna-Tas|Róna-Tas, András]] (1996): A honfoglaló magyar nép [The landtaking Hungarian nation].

==The name of the script of the Szarvas inscription==
[[File:Carphatian_Basin_Rovas_alphabet_on_coin_1996.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Picture of the bone needle case of Szarvas with Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet on a coin issued around 1996.]]
The Hungarian archeologist, historian and linguist [[Gábor Vékony]] named the script used on the needle case  as ''"Kárpát-medencei rovásírás"'' ("Carpathian Basin Rovas script").&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 203, first line of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Hosszú: [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4006.pdf Proposal for encoding the Carpathian Basin Rovas script in the SMP of the UCS]. National Body Contribution for consideration by UTC and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2, January 21, 2011, revised: May 19, 2011, Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set. ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N4006&lt;/ref&gt; He often used this term in his  book, ''A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története'', e.g. in the chapter ''"A kárpát-medencei rovásábécé korabeli feljegyzése"'' ("The contemporary record of the Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet").

Vékony analysed the similarities and the differences between the Old Hungarian and the Carpathian Basin scripts on page 154 of his book.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 154, first row of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; On page 232, Vékony wrote: ''"- Aethicus Ister jelei azonosak az egykori Kárpát-medencei rovásírás jeleivel."'' ("The symbols of Aethicus Ister are identical to the symbols of the quondam Carpathian Basin script").&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 232, eighth and ninth rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

Vékony also writes : ''"E jel a Szarvason azonosított Kárpát-medencei '''f''' alig torzult megfelelője..."'' ("This symbol is identical to the Carpathian Basin 'f' identified in Szarvas". (referring to the bone needle case found in Szarvas)&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 235, second and third rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

In page 233, Vékony writes: ''"Erre utalhat az is, hogy ez a betűalak levezethető egy párthus alep formából. Feltehető tehát ennek a jelnek a megléte a Kárpát-medencei rovásírásban is (a székelybe is innen származhatott)."'' ("This could imply also that this glyph can be derived from the Parthian Aleph form. Consequently, the existence of this symbol can be supposed in the Carpathian Basin script as well (it could originate from this to the Székely)."&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 233, last six rows in the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; Here the 'Szekely' refers to the ''Szekely-Hungarian Rovas'' script also known as [[Old Hungarian script]]. Vékony's writing suggests a proposal that a Carpathian Basin Rovas script may be one of the ancestors of the Szekely-Hungarian Rovas script.

==Critics and alternative theories==
Vékony had read the Szarvas transcription as Hungarian, thus proposing it as evidence that the Hungarian-speaking people had appeared in the region by the 7th century. There are several critics of Vékony's theories and translations, most notably the Hungarian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and historian, [[András Róna-Tas]]. The debates were summarized by István Riba in 1999 and 2000: "many find themselves unable to accept Vékony's theory".&lt;ref&gt;Riba,István: Jöttek, honfoglaltak, fújtak. Régészvita egy rovásírásról [Came, settled, blown. Archaeological debate about the runic writing]. In: Heti Világgazdaság [Weekly Word's Economy], Vol. 21. 1999. N. 46. pp. 101-102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riba, István (2000). [http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no157/080.shtml "Reading the Runes: Evidence of the Dual Conquest?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316014918/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no157/080.shtml |date=16 March 2012 }}. ''The Hungarian Quarterly''. Vol. XLI. No. 157, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The key point of the critics has been that in traditional Hungarian scholarship, the existence of the Hungarian-speaking population dates from 896 (when the [[Magyars]] took over the [[History of Hungary#Middle Ages .28895.E2.80.931526.29|Carpathian Basin]] ), while the Szarvas needle case dates from the 8th century. Consequently, either the Szarvas inscription is not in Hungarian or Hungarians were in the Carpathian Basin much earlier than the late 9th century. Róna-Tas attempted to read the Szarvas relic in Turkic instead of Hungarian, but wrote that his transcription needed further improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[[András Róna-Tas|Róna-Tas, András]] (1996): A honfoglaló magyar nép [The landtaking Hungarian nation]. Bevezetés a korai Magyar történelem ismeretébe [Introduction to the knowledge of the early Hungarian history]. Budapest: Balassi Kiadó, pp. 108-110&lt;/ref&gt; The issue remains an open question amongst Hungarian scholars.

'''The Company of Chivalry''' is a [[living history]] group portraying a [[military company]] in the age of [[Edward III]] (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377), under the command of  Sir [[Thomas Hungerford (Speaker)|Thomas Hungerford]] (c. 1330 &amp;ndash; 3 December 1397), a vassal of [[John of Gaunt]], 1st Duke of Lancaster (March 6, 1340 &amp;ndash; February 3, 1399).

The group performs at [[medieval reenactment]] events; with civilian living history and military [[combat display]] aspects. The Company of Chivalry is known for its vivid display of daily life in a medieval camp especially in the Castles of Wales for [[Cadw]].  The Group has the only fully trained Medieval Siege Engine Crew in the United Kingdom, and regularly displays the use of four types of [[siege engine]] at [[Caerphilly Castle]] in South Wales.

The society has set its effective date as 1370, during the [[Hundred Years War]] at a time when the English were ascendant against the armies of France. Within the society, the military aspect consists of soldiers who are primarily made up of [[billmen]] with a gunner in charge of a small [[black powder cannon]], commanded by armoured [[knights]].

== Name ==

There is not a single correct spelling for the name of the company; the group usually uses “The Company of Chivalry” or the more Archaeic “Ye Compaynye of Cheualrye”

== Origins and History ==
The Company of Chivalry was formed in 1988 by a group of people with a love for [[medieval England]]. Over the years they have developed a system of operating that has caused them to evolve from a small group to a well structured society of over 50 active members. The aim of the society is to recreate the daily life, culture and technology of [[England|English]] society in the [[Plantagenet]] period of the late fourteenth century.

== Membership ==
[[Image:Hungerford Household.JPG|thumb|Household of Sir [Thomas Hungerford (Speaker)|]]]
There are around seventy five people involved with the group and about fifty of them are considered active. The active members live in the [[United Kingdom]]; the General Membership is mostly drawn from the [[West Country]] ([[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Devon]], [[Gloucestershire]]), and from [[Warwickshire]]. The society actively recruits and welcomes enquiries for membership and events from all over the UK and Europe, the society is happy to accept members with or without prior experience; and welcomes families to join.

== Events ==
The Company of Chivalry primarily works with [[Cadw]] and [[English Heritage]], and some privately owned properties such as [[Pembroke Caste]]; and carries out [[living history]] events in close cooperation with them. The Group usually carries out between twelve and fifteen events each year/season between Easter and September, in the UK.  The Society has developed strong links with [[Compagnia di Porta Giovia]] an Italian Reenactment Society Based in [[Milano]], [[Italy]], and travels to [[Morimondo]], [[Italy]] every year to participate in a reenactment of [[The Battle of Casorate]] (1352) between [[Carlo IV]] of [[Bohemia]] and the [[Duke Visconti]] of [[Milano]].  The Society also attends private events.

'''w3af''' ('''''w'''eb '''a'''pplication '''a'''ttack and '''a'''udit '''f'''ramework'') is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[web application security scanner]]. The project provides a [[vulnerability scanner]] and exploitation tool for Web applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3af.org www.w3af.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides information about [[vulnerability (computer science)|security vulnerabilities]] for use in [[penetration testing]] engagements. The scanner offers a [[graphical user interface]] and a [[command-line interface]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/p/w3af/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/readme/EN/w3af-users-guide.pdf?format=raw w3af documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
w3af is divided into two main parts, the '''core''' and the '''plug-ins'''.&lt;ref&gt;Part 1 of Andres Riancho’s presentation “w3af - A framework to 0wn the Web “at Sector 2009, [https://sector.ca/wp-content/uploads/presentations09/w3af%20in%20150%20minutes%20-%20part%201.pdf Download PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The core coordinates the process and provides features that are consumed by the plug-ins, which find the vulnerabilities and exploit them. The plug-ins are connected and share information with each other using a knowledge base.

Plug-ins can be categorized as Discovery, Audit, [[Grep]], Attack, Output, Mangle, Evasion or Bruteforce.

==History==
w3af was started by Andres Riancho in March 2007, after many years of development by the community. In July 2010, w3af announced its sponsorship and partnership with [[Rapid7]]. With Rapid7's sponsorship the project will be able to increase its development speed and keep growing in terms of users and contributors.

'''Yeghishe''' ({{Lang-hy|[[wikt:Եղիշե|Եղիշե]]}}, {{IPA-hy|jɛʁiˈʃɛ|pron}}, AD 410 &amp;ndash; 475; [[anglicized]] as ''Eliseus'', spelled alternatively ''Yeghisheh'', ''Yeghishé'', '''Eghishe''' or '''Ełišē''') was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] historian from the time of late antiquity. He was the author of a history documenting the successful revolt of the Armenians in the fifth century against the rule and religion of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]].

==Life==
According to ancient and medieval sources that have trickled down to historians, Yeghishe was one of the younger pupils of [[Sahak Partev]] and [[Mesrop Mashtots]], the inventor of the [[Armenian Alphabet]].&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;Khrlopyan, Gevorg. ''«Եղիշե»'' [Yeghishe]. [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1977, vol. 3, pp. 506-507.&lt;/ref&gt; In 434, he, along with several other students, were sent to [[Alexandria]] to study Greek, Syriac and the liberal arts.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"&gt;{{cite book

Following their defeat at the battle of Avarayr, he renounced military life, became a [[hermit]] and retired to the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] (Rshtunik'). In 464-465, he was asked to write the history of the events leading up to and after the battle of Avarayr by a priest named David Mamikonian.&lt;ref&gt;Nalbandyan, Vache. "Introduction" in Yeghishe's ''Վարդանի և Հայոց Պատերազմի Մասին'' [Vardan and the Armenian War]. Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1994, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, his remains were removed and taken to the Surb Astvatsatsin Monastery, located along Lake Van's shoreline.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; All ancient authorities speak of Yeghishe as a ''[[vardapet]]'' (church doctor). 

Beginning with Babgen Guleserian in 1909 and Father Nerses Akinian, a member of the [[Mechitarists|Mkhitarian Congregation]], in the 1930s, the dating of Yeghishe's work was cast into doubt and moved a century or two forward.&lt;ref name="Nersessian"&gt;[[Vrej Nersessian|Nersessian, Vrej]]. "Review of ''History of Vardan and the Armenian War'' (Translation and Commentary by R. W. Thomson; Cambridge, 1982)." ''[[Haigazian Armenological Review]]'' 10 (1984): pp. 309-315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed review of these works, see Ter-Minassian, Yervand. ''Պատմա-բանասիրական հետազոտություններ'' [Historical-Philological Researches]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1971, pp. 110-208.&lt;/ref&gt; One point from their argument was predicated on the assumption that the Armenian translation of [[Philo]]'s works, which Yeghishe uses, was not made until around 600 AD. However, the translation of Philo's works had taken place during the early "Hellenizing" period of the Golden Age of Armenian literature (the fifth century AD).&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Sen Arevshatyan|Arevshatyan, Sen]]. "Պլատոնի Երկերի թարգմանության Ժամանակը" [The Dating of the Translation of the Works of Plato], ''[[Matenadaran|Banber Matenadarani]]'' 10 (1971): pp. 7-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars argue that neither the dating of the Hellenizing phase nor the presence of Hellenizing vocabulary are necessarily dependent on Yeghishe’s dating.&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt; Furthermore, there are no verbal literal parallels between the two authors, since Yeghishe directly translated Philo's work from its original Greek into Armenian.&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt;

Another argument that was made to support the later dating was the assertion that, given the parallels, Yeghishe's ''History of Vardan'' is simply an adaptation of the late fifth century Armenian historian [[Ghazar Parpetsi]]'s ''History of Armenia''.  Ghazar, however, dispassionately and analytically recounts the history of Armenia from the late fourth century to his own times, the battle of Avarayr merely figuring as one episode among many in his work. Yeghishe's goal, on the other hand, was to immortalize the "heavenly valor" of the Armenians and "provide comfort to friends, hope to the hopeful, and encouragement to the brave."&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt; As opposed to Ghazar, Yeghishe is able to give the individual names of fortresses and demonstrates an expert knowledge in the military tactics used by the Armenians and the Persians during the battle, indicating that he was "standing closer to the events."&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt; His understanding of the customs of [[Zoroastrianism]] and the [[Zurvanism|Zurvanite]] doctrine is also far more detailed and superior than Ghazar's.&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R. C. Zaehner|Zaehner, R. C.]] ''Zurvan: A Zoroastrian Dilemma''. New York: Biblio and Tannen, 1972, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also R. C. Zaehner, ''The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1961, pp. 188ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeghishe's complete failure to mention the [[Council of Chalcedon]],&lt;ref&gt;The Council of Chalcedon was held several months after the battle of Avarayr, without any representative of the Armenian Church.&lt;/ref&gt; the theological conclusions of which led to the complete breakdown of relations between the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic Churches following the 506 Council of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], has also led scholars to reject the later dating.&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" | —Yeghishe, ''History of Vardan and the Armenian War''.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;
|}
Yeghishe’s most famous work is the ''History of Vardan and the Armenian War [written] at the request of David Mamikonian'', which he calls a "Hishatakaran" ("Յիշատակարան", a "Memorial" or "Recollection", rather than a standard history). In this he recounts the struggle of the Armenians, in union with the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]] and the [[Caucasian Albanians]], for their common faith, against the Persians (449-451). Both sides saw religion as a badge of national identity; the Armenians were determined to retain Christianity, while the Persians attempted to force a reintroduction of Zoroastrianism.  In his own words, Yeghishe wrote the work "in order to reprove his sins, so that everyone hears and knows they may cast curses on him and not lust after his deeds."&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt; The work is considered one of the masterpieces of classical [[Armenian literature]] and is almost entirely free from [[Greek language|Greek]] words and expressions.

A number of other works also exist by Eliseus.  There is an ''Exhortation to the monks''; ''On the transfiguration'', a ''Homily on the Passion of the Lord''.  The "Questions and Answers on Genesis" is probably not genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, Sever J. "Patristic Texts in Armenian (5th to 8th centuries)" in Angelo di Berardino (ed), ''Patrology: The Eastern Fathers from the Council of Chalcedon (451) to John of Damascus (+ 750)'', tr. Adrian Walford, Cambridge: James Clarke and co (2006). pp. 600-601.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The original text of Yeghishe's work, like all others written during this period, does not exist (all currently extant Armenian manuscripts date to the tenth century or later).&lt;ref name="Nersessian"/&gt; The oldest surviving manuscript of his ''History of Vardan'' dates to 1174.&lt;ref&gt;Nalbandyan. "Introduction", p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  

An excellent edition of it was published at [[Venice]] in 1826 by the [[Mechitarist]]s of [[San Lazzaro degli Armeni|San Lazzaro]]. One of the manuscripts on which it is based purports to be a faithful copy of another manuscript dated to 616. The text of that edition was further improved in subsequent editions at the same place (1828, 1838, 1859, and 1864). Among other editions of value are those of [[Feodosia|Theodosia]] in [[Crimea]] ([[Ukraine]]), 1861, and of [[Jerusalem]], 1865. Yeghishe is also the author of a commentary on Joshua and Judges, an explanation of the Our Father, a letter to the Armenian monks, etc., all found in the Venice editions of the ''History of Vartan''. A landmark study and critical edition of the text was prepared by philologist Yervand Ter-Minassian in 1957.&lt;ref&gt; Yeghishe. ''Վասն Վարդանայ և Հայոց Պատերազմին'' [For Vardan and the Armenian War]. A Study by Yervand Ter-Minassian. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
There are two English translations: an incomplete 1830 translation&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, C. F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ax0oAAAAYAAJ Elisaeus Bishop of the Amadunians: The History of Vartan and of the battle of the Armenians: Containing an account of the religious wars between the Persians and Armenians].'' London, 1830.&lt;/ref&gt; and a modern translation by [[Robert W. Thomson]] (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Ełišēi. ''History of Vardan and the Armenian War''. Translation and Commentary by R. W. Thomson. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-674-40335-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an old French translation (1869).&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, V. "Éłisee: Histoire de Vartan et de la guerre des Arméniens" in ''Collection des Historiens anciens et modernes de l'Arménie'' (Paris, 1869), II, 177 sqq. Online [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/elisee/vartan.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also one in Italian by G. Cappelletti (Venice, 1840).

In addition to the seven chapters mentioned by Yeghishe himself in his introductory remarks, all the editions contain an eighth chapter referring to the so-called [[Leontine martyrs]] and others. The authenticity of that chapter has been called into question.{{Who|date=August 2010}} It has been also remarked that in all the manuscripts the fifth chapter is missing, while in the editions the original sixth chapter is cut in two so as to make up for the missing chapter.&lt;ref&gt;On the first point see Langlois, op. cit., II, p. 180; on the second see {{de icon}} Neumann, C. F. ''Versuch einer Geschichte der armenischen Literatur, nach den Werken der Mechitaristen frei gearbeitet'' (Leipzig, 1836), pp. 64 sqq. See also Ter-Minassiantz, ''Die armenische Kirche in ihren Beziehungen zu der syrischen Kirche'' (Leipzig, 1904), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
