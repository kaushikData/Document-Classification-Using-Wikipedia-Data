It was the first DMC satellite to be launched of the five to seven that are planned. The DMC was the first satellite constellation designed for that objective. The launch took place on 28 November 2002 from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in northern Russia on a [[Kosmos-3M]] launcher in -20 degree Celsius weather. It completed its mission after seven years and nine months in August 2010. The satellite was designed to operate for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sstl.co.uk/Blog/August-2010/Algeria-s-first-satellite-mission-completed|title=Algeria’s first satellite mission completed|first1=Robin|last1=Wolstenholme|website=SSTL space blog|date=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AlSat-1 is built on the SSTL-100 platform. The onboard instrumentation consists of two banks with three Earth imaging cameras each that, in total, has a resolution of 32 meters in three spectral bands (NIR, red, and green). The imaging swath of the cameras is 600&amp;nbsp;km. The satellite was constructed in a fifteen-month time period by the British and Algerians, of which eleven Algerian engineers were trained by SSTL.&lt;ref name="sstl" /&gt; The satellite uses resistojets for propulsion, and butane as its propellant. The resistojets provide more than 20&amp;nbsp;m/s of delta velocity.&lt;ref name="a2003" /&gt;

== Operations ==

This satellite carried the first Slim 6 Line Imager. The imaging opportunities for Algeria is one per day, for two or three days out of five days. During the first three months of operations, more than 80 images were transmitted back to Earth.&lt;ref name="sstl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sstl.co.uk/Missions/AlSAT-1-Launched-2002/AlSAT-1/AlSAT-1-The-Mission|title=AlSAT-1: The Mission|access-date=November 2, 2016|website=Surrey Satellite Technology Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a2003" /&gt;

In [[geography]], an '''arm''' is a narrow extension, [[inlet]], or smaller [[reach (geography)|reach]], of water flowing out from a much larger body of water, such as an [[ocean]], a [[sea]], or a [[lake]]. Although different geographically, a [[sound (geography)|sound]] or [[bay]] may also be called an arm.

By extension, a ''canal arm'' is a subsidiary branch of a [[canal]] or inland [[waterway]].

The '''B1159''' is a road in [[Norfolk]], [[England]], running for about {{convert|32|mi|km}} between [[Cromer]] and [[Caister-on-Sea]], parallel to and at a short distance from the northeastern coast of Norfolk.

Made famous by Norfolk's modern English folk band, [https://www.facebook.com/addisonsuncle?fref=ts Addison's Uncle]. Their debut single, titled B1159, gained extensive regional press coverage and they filmed a music video along the B1159 which can be viewed here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgqQZoeJUcs B1159 Music Video]

From about halfway between Cromer and Overstrand to Mundesley, the road parallels the disused course of the [[Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway]], which can be glimpsed from time to time.

Between Paston and Bacton, "the road runs through acres of gasholders, pipes, control wheels and other gadgetry, all protected by formidable fences. This is the [[Bacton Gas Terminal|Bacton Natural Gas Terminal]], which receives gas through pipelines from the offshore wells.".&lt;ref name="IGBC"&gt;Illustrated Guide to Britain's Coast, Drive Publications Limited (for the [[The Automobile Association|AA]]), 1987, {{ISBN|0-903356-33-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is also one terminal of the [[Interconnector]] pipeline link with continental Europe.

A quarter-mile stretch at Walcott is a section of this "coast road" that runs within close proximity to the sea, although somewhat more distant sea views are available at numerous other points, such as at Sidestrand, Trimingham and Mundesley &lt;ref&gt;1:50,000 First Series Sheet 133 North East Norfolk, [[Ordnance Survey]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1:50,000 Landranger Sheet 134 Norwich &amp; The Broads (Great Yarmouth), Edition C1, [[Ordnance Survey]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry was born in [[Sedgley]], [[Staffordshire]], [[United Kingdom]].  He was educated at [[Queen Elizabeth's High School]], Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]] and [[Acton County Grammar School]], Acton, Middlesex. He graduated from [[University College, London]], with a [[B.Sc.]] ([[Economics]]) degree with first class honors in 1955. With a Fulbright scholarship he went on to the [[University of Washington]] where he completed an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1956, and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1958, studying under noted geographer and leader of the "[[quantitative revolution]]" [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]] in the [[Department of Geography, University of Washington|Department of Geography]].

Upon completing his Ph.D., Berry was appointed to the faculty at the [[University of Chicago]], rising to the position of Irving B.Harris Professor of Urban Geography, geography department chair and director of the Center for Urban Studies,  positions that he held until 1976. During this time his urban and regional research sparked geography’s social-scientific revolution and made him the most-cited geographer for more than 25 years, known for his refinement of [[central place theory]] and for laying the foundations of [[analytic urban geography]], of [[spatial analysis]], and of [[geospatial information science]].  Since 1990 his studies have focused on [[Kondratiev wave|long-wave theory]] and its relationships to [[macrohistorical]] phasing of [[economic development]] and political behavior.  He also has researched variations in the quality of life ("happiness") across and within nations.

From 1976 to 1981 Berry was the Frank Backus Williams Professor of City and Regional Planning in the Graduate School of Design, chair of the PhD Program in Urban Planning and professor in sociology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, director of the [[ Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis]] and a faculty fellow of the Institute for International Development at [[Harvard]], and following that was appointed University Professor of Urban Studies and Public Policy and dean of the [[Heinz College]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] for a period of 5 years.  In 1986 he joined the [[University of Texas at Dallas]], occupying the Lloyd Viel Berkner Regental Professorship, and becoming founding dean of the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences.  He has remained active there since.

Among his honors, Berry was elected a member the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1975 and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and [[University College, London]]. He was the 1978-79 President of the Association of American Geographere, and among many other awards and recognitions, in 1988 he was awarded the [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria Medal]] from the [[Royal Geographical Society]].  In 1999 he was elected a member of the Council of the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2004 was a founding member of the [[Texas Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science]] (TAMEST), later serving on its council. In 2005 he was named the [[Vautrin Lud Prize|Laureat Internationale de Geographie 'Vautrin Lud']] (the 'Nobel Prize of Geography') and became a Fellow on the [[American Institute of Certified Planners]], followed thereafter by Fellowship in the Regional Science Association International. In 2017 the [[International N.D. Kondratieff Foundation]] named him a Kondratieff Medal Laureate.

== Publications ==

Berry has authored over 550 books and articles, and attempts to bridge theory and practice via involvement in urban and regional development activities in both advanced and developing countries.  During his career he also has been advisor to more than 145 new PhDs and has served on an equal number of other doctoral committees.  Many of his students have gone on to successful academic and professional careers in their own right.  He also has been an active family historian and genealogist, with many additional publications to his name, most recently delving into genetic genealogy, where testing by FamilyTreeDNA documents his y-Dna to be the Bell-Beaker R-L21&gt;A5846&gt;A5840&gt;A5835&gt;Y18815&gt;Y42681, which he shares with descendants of John Berry of Honley in Yorkshire (1510-1569), and his mitochondrial DNA to be T2f1a1.

The '''Cape Flats''' ({{lang-af|Die Kaapse Vlakte}}) is an expansive, low-lying, flat area situated to the southeast of the central business district of [[Cape Town]]. To many people in Cape Town, the area is known simply as "The Flats".

[[File:Capeflats.jpg|thumb|400px|right| [[Landsat]] image of Cape Town and environs, looking roughly east. Cape Peninsula in the foreground; Table Bay with Robben Island to the left; False Bay with [[Seal Island, South Africa|Seal Island]] (small white dot) to the right. The mountains of the Boland to the rear. The oval (long axis about 25km) roughly encompasses the Cape Flats.]]

Described by some as "[[apartheid]]'s dumping ground", from the 1950s the area became home to people the [[apartheid]] government designated as non-White. Race-based legislation such as the [[Group Areas Act]] and [[pass laws]] either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government-built townships in the Flats, or made living in the area illegal, forcing many people designated as [[Black people#Former British colonies apply the label to anyone darker than Europeans|Black]] and Coloured into informal settlements elsewhere in the Flats. The Flats have since then been home to much of the population of Greater Cape Town.

==Geology and geography==
In geological terms, the area is essentially a vast sheet of aeolian sand, ultimately of marine origin, which has blown up from the adjacent beaches over a period on the order of a hundred thousand years. Below the sand, the bedrock is in general the [[Malmesbury Shale]], except on part of the western margin between [[Zeekoevlei]] to the south and [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]] and [[Wetton. Cape Town|Wetton]] to the north, where an intrusive mass of [[Cape Granite]] is to be found.

[[File:East view of Table Mountain labelled.jpg|thumb|700 px|left|The western boundary of the Cape Flats consisting of [[Constantia Nek]], the Back Table, [[Table Mountain]], and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]]. From the Cape Flats [[Table Mountain]] is seen "side on", and therefore does not resemble the flat-topped mountain depicted in most of the scenic views of this iconic massif. The continuation of the [[Cape Peninsula]] mountain chain southwards from Constantia Nek (i.e. beyond the left hand border of the photograph) as far as [[False Bay]], are Vlakkenberg, Constantiaberg (with its prominent TV mast), Steenberg and the Muizenberg. This view of Table Mountain is the one that greets a visitor to Cape Town arriving by road from the east (particularly along the N2). The distance from Constantia Nek to the lower slopes of Devil's Peak on the right hand side of the photograph is 9 km (as the crow flies).]]
To the west the expanse of the Cape Flats is limited by rising ground that slopes up to the steep cliffs of the [[Cape Peninsula]] mountain chain (see the photograph on the left), while in the east the land rises gradually towards the equally rugged cliffs of [[Hottentots Holland]] mountains and other elevated regions of the interior of the [[Cape Winelands|Boland]].

Most of the sand is unconsolidated; however, in some places near the False Bay coast the oldest sand dunes have been cemented into a soft sandstone. These formations contain important fossils of animals such as the extinct Cape lion and also provide evidence that stone-age people hunted here tens of thousands of years ago.

The area has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with warm dry summers and cool, damp winters. It is generally exposed to the wind, both from the NW (winter) and SE (summer). Flooding can be a problem, especially in July and August. Cold wet spells, especially in August and September, can make life very difficult for those living in sub-standard housing.

==History==

===Before 1950===
The noted English naturalist, [[William John Burchell]], remarked in 1811 that the deep sand of the Flats made travel by cart or wagon extremely difficult. The situation was aggravated by a widespread shortage of firewood, causing fuel collectors to cut the relatively few indigenous shrubs and trees that stabilised the sand.&lt;ref&gt;''Travels in the Interior of Southern Africa'' - William J. Burchell (1822).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, the area was completely overrun by alien vegetation, mainly of Australian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Stirton| first =C. H.| title =Plant invaders| publisher =Department of Nature and Environmental Conservation of the Cape Provincial Administration| year =1978| location =Cape Town| isbn =0-7984-0092-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants included [[hakea]]s and especially [[Cootamundra wattle|wattle]]s (genus [[Acacia]]). The principal reason for this infestation lay in decisions made by the colonial authorities. It was an era before the advent of modern technological methods for the construction of permanent roads and in those days the Cape Flats was a massive sea of unstabilised sand dunes that moved at will before the winds. This made travel between Cape Town and the interior very difficult, particularly for the large ox-drawn wagons of the time. The authorities decided to try to stabilise the sand with plants native to the British colonies of [[New South Wales]] and Western Australia.

The earliest importation of wattles was in 1827. Massive plantings were established in the 1840s and 1850s and the work continued until well after 1875.

At the time, the plan worked well enough: the march of the dunes was arrested. The price paid, in ecological terms, was that the Cape Flats was carpeted by [[invasive species]]. Serious efforts have in recent years been made to roll back this alien scourge.

===Since 1950===
The Cape Flats has undergone revolutionary change in the past half a century. In 1950 the area was practically uninhabited. There was a single, narrow road across the Flats from Cape Town to The [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] that ran between walls of alien [[rooikrans]] bushes and one could travel for miles without seeing any sign of habitation other that a few fences and a handful of farmhouses. Native antelope roamed at will between the dense thickets of wattles. The army used the area for military exercises and the few farmers who inhabited the Flats eked out a living by growing vegetables in pockets of relatively poor soil between the barren dunes. Modern amenities were unknown; telephones were unknown, drinking water was collected in tanks from roofs and at night the rooms were lit by oil lamps.

The era of sand and antelopes vanished completely in little more than a generation. Vegetable farming persisted, but to a much lesser extent, because urbanisation enveloped vast tracts of land in short order. During the [[apartheid]] era, large housing projects were built here, mostly as part of the Nationalist government's larger effort to force the so-called [[Coloured]] community out of the central and western areas of Cape Town, which the political theorists of the day had designated as whites-only areas. This meant that only whites could reside there permanently; people of colour could work in the city but could not live there. Additionally, other large townships of black people (such as [[Khayelitsha]] and [[Gugulethu]]) grew up on the flats as a product of both informal settlement and forced government relocations. Since many [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] people of the region—including people born and raised in the Cape Town area—were designated under apartheid as residents of [[Bantustans]], many were obliged to live in the area illegally, further contributing to the growth of informal settlements. These consisted in the main of shacks made of "tin" (in reality corrugated iron which, confusingly, is nowadays made from mild steel), cardboard and wood. In 1993, Cape Town had a housing backlog of approximately 40 000 houses and with the numbers of people migrating from the rural areas increasing each year, so the backlog increases. One of the major priorities of the RDP ([[Reconstruction and Development Programme|Reconstruction &amp; Development Programme]]) is to build houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capeflats.org.za/modules/home/townships.php "Townships of the Cape Flats"], Welcome to the Cape Flats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of apartheid, these communities are no longer legally bound by racial restrictions; but history, language, economics and ethnic politics still contribute to homogeneity of local areas. So, for example, most residents of [[Mitchell's Plain]] likely still speak a locally inflected version of [[Afrikaans]], along with English and either they or their parents were designated as Coloured by apartheid; most residents of Khayelitsha still speak [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and English and either they or their parents were designated as Black by apartheid. Nonetheless, some areas of the Cape Flats have an increasing diversity of residents, with Xhosa-speaking people an increasingly noticeable presence in some previously mainly Afrikaans-speaking areas.

==Culture and politics==
The Cape Flats is home to a remarkable cultural history.

Its music spans from the serious-minded jazz of [[Abdullah Ibrahim]] and [[Basil Coetzee]] and their anthem "[[Mannenberg]]" (named after a Cape Flats township), to the bubbly pop hits of [[Brenda Fassie]]; and continues in a new [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbansmarts.com/interviews/godessa.htm Urbansmarts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music.org.za/artist.asp?id=59 Music.org.za]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its religious communities include (to name only a few), Afrikaans-speaking congregations of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], [[Rastafarian]] communities, people who engage only in traditional Xhosa practices, [[syncretic]] Xhosa Christian churches, [[Evangelism|evangelical]] Christian churches, and southern Africa's largest [[Muslim]] community (drawing its oldest roots from the historic [[Cape Malay|Cape Muslim]] community, which dates back to the 17th century).

In the 1940s, a type of dental modification known as a ''[[passion gap]]'' became fashionable and remains popular today. The modification involves the removal of a person's [[maxillary incisor|top front teeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6268127/Cape-Towns-passion-gap-sexual-myth-or-fashion-victimhood.html|title=Cape Town's passion gap: sexual myth or fashion victimhood?|publisher=''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]''|author=Fran Blandy|date=2009-10-07|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its political history is complex and sometimes baffling even to insiders: for instance, the politics of the Coloured communities of the Cape Flats have included [[Trotskyist]] activism in earlier years, and mobilisation for the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] in the 80s; and then, widespread support for the historically white [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (which had presided over apartheid) in the early post-apartheid elections. More recently, the area has seen an expansion of [[African National Congress]] strength from its base in the black townships and into historically Coloured areas {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, as well as a particularly strong local growth of left-wing social movements like the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] which offer a critique of government policies{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Sometimes violent [[Islamist]] movements have emerged from Cape Flats communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No63/Chap2.html Institute of Security Studies.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217221419/http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No63/Chap2.html |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other notable figures within the [[Muslim]] community, such as Fareed Ishaq, who embody an ecumenical strain of religious progressivism.

Almost all of the communities of the Cape Flats remain, to one degree or another, poverty stricken. Serious social problems include a high rate of unemployment and disturbing levels of [[gang]] activity. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was significant armed conflict between various gangs and [[PAGAD]] (People Against Gangsterism and Drugs), a [[vigilante]] organisation. Post-apartheid development projects, such as the RDP, have also led to violent conflicts within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bähre, Erik. [http://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/gber/files/2012/05/Housing-the-Urban-Poor-in-Cape-Town-A-Post-Apartheid-Dream-or-Nightmare.pdf "Housing for the Urban Poor: A post-apartheid dream or nightmare?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181343/http://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/gber/files/2012/05/Housing-the-Urban-Poor-in-Cape-Town-A-Post-Apartheid-Dream-or-Nightmare.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }} ''Global Built Environment Review'' 1(1). 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, efforts to combat gangs include Hanover Park’s Ceasefire programme, where former gang members "use their experiences to mediate gang disputes and help young men and women quit gang life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of community empowerment organisations work non-violently to combat poverty, crime and health problems, and the role of [[civil society]] in many parts of the area is relatively strong.

The history of '''[[daylight saving time]] in [[Egypt]]''' is complicated. It was cancelled in both 2015 and 2016, after having been abolished and reinstated several times.

== History ==
The British first instituted [[summer time]] in Egypt in 1940, during the [[Second World War]]. The practice was stopped after 1945, but resumed 12 years later, in 1957.&lt;ref name="wapo2016" /&gt;

Before the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|revolution in January 2011]], the government was planning to take a decision to abolish summer time in 2011 before President [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s term expires in September 2011. The [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|transitional government]] did so on 20 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/407168 |title=Egypt to cancel daylight saving time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pretext that daylight saving time would save energy, the Egyptian government decided on 7 May 2014 to reinstate summer time with an exception for the holy month of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=dst2&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/101285.aspx |title=Daylight saving to be applied in Egypt starting Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April the next year, a poll was held on whether to apply summer time or not.

== Dates and times ==

When used, Egypt observes summer time between the last Friday in April and the last Thursday in September. The clocks are changed from [[UTC+2]] to [[UTC+3]]. The change occurs one second after 23:59:59 on Thursday to become 1:00:00 on the last Friday in April shortening the day to 23 hours. Summer time ends one second after 23:59:59 to become 23:00:00 on the last Thursday of September lengthening the day to 25 hours. The date does not change one second after the first 23:59:59 occurred; for all practical purposes, midnight does not occur until after the ''second'' 23:59:59.

=== Ramadan ===
The [[lunar calendar]] used by Islam is about eleven days shorter than the solar year, so its months shift every year relative to the seasons. To avoid having longer days during the holy month of fasting, [[Ramadan]], exceptions have been made to the DST schedule when the two overlap. Starting in 2006, the end of summer time has taken place on the Thursday before the start of Ramadan. This continued until 2010, when Ramadan was completely inside "summer". Since then, summer time has effectively been split into two periods: one before Ramadan, and one after.

'''East Prussia''' ({{lang-de|Ostpreußen}}, {{IPA-de|ˈɔstˌpʁɔʏsən|pron|De-Ostpreußen.ogg}}; {{lang-pl|Prusy Wschodnie}}; {{lang-lt|Rytų Prūsija}}; {{lang-la|Borussia orientalis}}; {{lang-ru|Восточная Пруссия}}) was a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] from 1773 to 1829 and again from 1878 (with the Kingdom itself being part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871); following World War I it formed part of the [[Weimar Republic]]'s [[Free State of Prussia]], until 1945. Its capital city was [[Königsberg]] (present-day [[Kaliningrad]]). East Prussia was the main part of the [[Prussia (region)|region of Prussia]] along the southeastern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], Sixth Edition (2008), [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/East_Prussia.aspx East Prussia]&lt;/ref&gt;

East Prussia enclosed the bulk of the ancestral lands of the Baltic [[Old Prussians]]. During the 13th century, the native Prussians were conquered by the crusading [[Teutonic Knights]]. After the [[Northern Crusades|conquest]] the indigenous Balts were gradually converted to [[Christianity]]. Because of [[Germanization]] and colonisation over the following centuries, [[Germans]] became the dominant ethnic group, while [[Masurians]] and [[Lithuanians]] formed minorities. From the 13th century, East Prussia was part of the [[monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]]. After the [[Second Peace of Thorn]] in 1466 it became a fief of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1525, with the [[Prussian Homage]], the province became the [[Duchy of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exulanten.com/preussen.html|title=Ostpreußen: The Great Trek|first=L|last=Schaitberger|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Prussian language]] had become extinct by the 17th or early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056977/Old-Prussian-language Old-Prussian-language]; Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.): Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 2005, [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=prg Prussian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the duchy was outside of the core [[Holy Roman Empire]], the prince-electors of Brandenburg were able to proclaim themselves [[List of monarchs of Prussia|King]] beginning in 1701. After the annexation of most of western [[Royal Prussia]] in the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, eastern (ducal) Prussia was connected by land with the rest of the Prussian state and was reorganized as a province the following year (1773). Between 1829 and 1878, the Province of East Prussia was joined with [[Province of West Prussia|West Prussia]] to form the [[Province of Prussia]].

The Kingdom of Prussia became the leading state of the [[German Empire]] after its creation in 1871. However, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following [[World War I]] granted West Prussia to Poland and made East Prussia an exclave of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]  (the new [[Polish Corridor]] separating East Prussia from the rest of Germany), while the [[Memel Territory]] was detached and was annexed by [[Lithuania]] in 1923. Following [[Nazi Germany]]'s defeat in World War II in 1945, war-torn East Prussia was divided at [[Joseph Stalin]]'s insistence between the [[Soviet Union]] (the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] in the [[Russian SFSR]] and the constituent counties of the [[Klaipėda Region]] in the [[Lithuanian SSR]]) and the [[People's Republic of Poland]] (the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/195/davies2.html|title=Sarmatian Review XV.1: Davies|first=|last=tenn@owlnet.rice.edu|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital city Königsberg was renamed [[Kaliningrad]] in 1946. The German population of the province was largely [[Evacuation of East Prussia|evacuated]] during the war or expelled shortly thereafter in the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]]. An estimated 300,000 (around one fifth of the population) died either in war time bombings raids, in the battles to defend the province or through mistreatment by the Red Army. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

== Background ==
[[File:Image-Prussia ethnicity.JPG|thumb|Ethnic settlement in East Prussia by the 14th century]]

At the instigation of Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] took possession of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] in the 13th century and created a [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state]] to administer the conquered [[Old Prussians]]. Local Old-Prussian (north) and Polish (south) toponyms were gradually Germanised. The Knights' expansionist policies, including occupation of Polish Pomerania with Gdańsk/Danzig and western Lithuania, brought them into conflict with the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and embroiled them in several wars, culminating in the [[Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War]], whereby the united armies of Poland and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], defeated the Teutonic Order at the [[Battle of Grunwald|Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg)]] in 1410. Its defeat was formalised in the [[Second Peace of Thorn|Second Treaty of Thorn]] in 1466 ending the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], and leaving the former Polish region Pomerania/[[Pomerelia]] under Polish control. Together with [[Warmia]] it formed the province of [[Royal Prussia]]. Eastern Prussia remained under the Knights, but as a [[fief]] of Poland. 1466 and 1525 arrangements by kings of Poland were not verified by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as the previous gains of the [[Teutonic Knights]] were not verified.

[[File:Panorama of Malbork Castle, part 4.jpg|thumb|left|The fortress ''[[Malbork Castle|Ordensburg Marienburg]]'' in [[Malbork]], [[Poland]]. Founded in 1274 by the [[Teutonic Order]] on the river [[Nogat]], it is the world’s largest brick castle]]

The Teutonic Order lost eastern Prussia when Grand Master [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] converted to [[Lutheranism]] and secularized the Prussian branch of the Teutonic Order in 1525. Albert established himself as the first duke of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] and a [[vassal]] of the Polish crown by the [[Prussian Homage]]. [[Walter von Cronberg]], the next Grand Master, was [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] with the title to Prussia after the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, but the Order never regained possession of the territory. In 1569 the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] [[prince-elector]]s of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] became co-regents with Albert's son, the feeble-minded [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]].

The Administrator of Prussia, the grandmaster of the Teutonic Order [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria|Maximilian III]], son of emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] died in 1618. When Maximilian died, Albert's line died out, and the Duchy of Prussia passed to the Electors of Brandenburg, forming [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. Taking advantage of the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1655, and instead of fulfilling his vassal's duties towards the Polish Kingdom, by joining forces with the Swedes and subsequent treaties of [[Treaty of Wehlau|Wehlau]], [[Treaty of Labiau|Labiau]], and [[Treaty of Oliva|Oliva]], Elector and Duke [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] succeeded in revoking the king of Poland's sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia in 1660. The [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] elector also subdued the noble estates of Prussia.

== History as a province ==
[[File:1799 Cary Map of Prussia and Lithuania - Geographicus - Prussia-cary-1799.jpg|thumb|''New Map of the Kingdom of Prussia'', [[John Cary]] 1799, split into the eastern regions of [[Lithuania Minor]] (green), [[Natangians|Natangia]] (yellow), [[Sambia]] and [[Warmia]] (pink), the western ''Oberland'' territories with [[Kwidzyn|Marienwerder]] (blue), West Prussian [[Malbork|Marienburg]] (yellow) and [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Danzig]] (green)]]

=== Kingdom of Prussia ===
Although Brandenburg was a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Prussian lands were not within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and were with the administration by the [[Teutonic Order]] grandmasters under jurisdiction of the Emperor. In return for supporting Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] was allowed to crown himself "[[King in Prussia]]" in 1701. The new kingdom ruled by the Hohenzollern dynasty became known as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The designation "[[Kingdom of Prussia]]" was gradually applied to the various lands of Brandenburg-Prussia. To differentiate from the larger entity, the former Duchy of Prussia became known as ''Altpreußen'' ("Old Prussia"), the province of Prussia, or "East Prussia".

Approximately [[The plague during the Great Northern War|one-third of East Prussia's population died in]] the [[Black Death|plague]] and [[famine]] of 1709–1711,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=274&amp;chapter=38099&amp;layout=html A Treatise on Political Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; including the last speakers of Old Prussian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/princip.htm|title=LINGUISTIC PRINCIPLES OF THE RECOVERY OF OLD PRUSSIAN|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plague, probably brought by foreign troops during the [[Great Northern War]], killed 250,000 East Prussians, especially in the province's eastern regions. Crown Prince [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] led the rebuilding of East Prussia, founding numerous towns. Thousands of Protestants expelled from the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] were allowed to settle in depleted East Prussia. The province was overrun by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] troops during the [[Seven Years' War]].

In the 1772 [[First Partition of Poland]], the Prussian king [[Frederick the Great]] annexed neighboring [[Royal Prussia]], i.e., the Polish voivodeships of [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1466–1772)|Pomerania]] ([[Gdańsk Pomerania]] or [[Pomerelia]]), [[Malbork Voivodeship|Malbork]], [[Chełmno Voivodeship|Chełmno]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia]], thereby connecting his Prussian and [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Farther Pomeranian]] lands and cutting the rest of Poland from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast. The territory of [[Warmia]] was incorporated into the lands of former Ducal Prussia, which, by administrative deed of 31 January 1773 were named ''East Prussia''. The former Polish Pomerelian lands beyond the [[Vistula]] River together with Malbork and [[Chełmno Land]] formed the Province of [[West Prussia]] with its capital at [[Kwidzyn|Marienwerder]] (Kwidzyn). The Polish [[Partition Sejm]] ratified the cession on 30 September 1773, whereafter Frederick officially went on to call himself a King "of" Prussia.

The former Ducal Prussian [[Districts of Prussia|districts]] of [[Iława|Eylau]] (Iława), Marienwerder, [[Prabuty|Riesenburg]] (Prabuty) and [[Szymbark, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Schönberg]] (Szymbark) passed to West Prussia. Until the [[Prussian reforms]] of 1808, the administration in East Prussia was transferred to the [[General War Commissariat|General War]] and Finance Directorate in [[Berlin]], represented by two local chamber departments:
* German chamber department at Königsberg with the districts of:
** [[Ushakovo, Kaliningrad Oblast|Brandenburg]]
** [[Nidzica|Neidenburg]]
** [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]]
** [[Sambia|Samland]]
** [[Gvardeysk|Tapiau]]
** [[Braniewo|Braunsberg]] (Ermland)
** [[Lidzbark Warmiński|Heilsberg]] (Ermland)
** [[Morąg|Mohrungen]] (Ermland)
* [[Lithuania Minor|Lithuanian]] chamber department at [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] (Gusev) with the districts of:
** [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]]
** [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]]
** [[Klaipėda|Memel]]
** [[Olecko]]
** [[Neman, Russia|Ragnit]]
** [[Czerniak, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Seehesten]] ([[Mrągowo|Sensburg]])
** [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]]

On 31 January 1773, King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] announced that the newly annexed lands were to be known as the Province of [[West Prussia]], while the former Duchy of Prussia and Warmia became the [[Province of East Prussia]].

===Napoleonic Wars===
After the disastrous defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806, [[Napoleon]] occupied Berlin and had the officials of the Prussian General Directorate swear an [[oath of allegiance]] to him, while King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and his consort [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Louise]] fled via Königsberg and the [[Curonian Spit]] to Memel. The [[First French Empire|French]] troops immediately took up pursuit but were delayed in the [[Battle of Eylau]] on 9 February 1807 by an East Prussian contingent under General [[Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq]]. Napoleon had to stay at the [[Finckenstein Palace]], but in May, after a siege of 75 days, his troops led by Marshal [[François Joseph Lefebvre]] were able to capture the city [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], which had been tenaciously defended by General Count [[Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth|Friedrich Adolf von Kalkreuth]]. On 14 June, Napoleon ended the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] with his victory at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. Frederick William and Queen Louise met with Napoleon for peace negotiations, and on 9 July the Prussian king signed the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]].

The succeeding Prussian reforms instigated by [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] included the implementation of an ''[[Oberlandesgericht]]'' appellation court at Königsberg, a [[municipal corporation]], [[economic freedom]] as well as [[emancipation]] of the [[serfdom|serfs]] and [[Jewish emancipation|Jews]]. In the course of the Prussian restoration by the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the East Prussian territories were re-arranged in the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]e'' of [[Gumbinnen (region)|Gumbinnen]] and [[Königsberg (region)|Königsberg]]. From 1905, the southern districts of East Prussia formed the separate ''Regierungsbezirk'' of [[Allenstein (region)|Allenstein]]. East and West Prussia were first united in [[personal union]] in 1824, and then merged in a [[real union]] in 1829 to form the [[Province of Prussia]]. The united province was again split into separate East and West Prussian provinces in 1878.

[[File:Ostpreussen.JPG|thumb|upright|Map of the province of East Prussia in 1881]]

=== German Empire ===
From 1824–1878, East Prussia was combined with West Prussia to form the [[Province of Prussia]], after which they were reestablished as separate provinces. Along with the rest of the Kingdom of Prussia, East Prussia became part of the [[German Empire]] during the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.

From 1885 to 1890 [[Berlin]]'s population grew by 20%, [[Brandenburg]] and the [[Rhineland]] gained 8.5%, [[Westphalia]] 10%, while East Prussia lost 0.07% and West Prussia 0.86%. This stagnancy in population despite a high birth surplus in eastern Germany was because many people from the East Prussian countryside moved westward to seek work in the expanding industrial centres of the [[Ruhr Area]] and Berlin (see ''[[Ostflucht]]'').

The population of the province in 1900 was 1,996,626 people, with a religious makeup of 1,698,465 [[Protestantism|Protestants]], 269,196 [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and 13,877 [[Jew]]s. The [[Low Prussian]] dialect predominated in East Prussia, although [[High Prussian]] was spoken in [[Warmia]]. The numbers of [[Masurians]], [[Kursenieki]] and [[Prussian Lithuanians]] decreased over time due to the process of [[Germanization]]. The Polish-speaking population concentrated in the south of the province ([[Masuria]] and Warmia) and all German geographic atlases at the start of 20th century showed the southern part of East Prussia as Polish with the number of Poles estimated at the time to be 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-Century Central-Eastern Europe: History, Data, and Analysis. Piotr Eberhardt,page 166, 2003 M E Sharpe Inc&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kursenieki]] inhabited the areas around the Curonian lagoon, while Lithuanian-speaking Prussians concentrated in the northeast in ([[Lithuania Minor]]). The [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian ethnic group]] became completely Germanized over time and the [[Old Prussian language]] died out in the 18th century.

=== World War I ===
At the beginning of World War I, East Prussia became a [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|theatre of war]] when the [[Russian Empire]] invaded the country. The [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] encountered at first little resistance because the bulk of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had been directed towards the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] according to the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. Despite early success and the capture of the towns of [[Rastenburg]] and [[Gumbinnen]], in the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] in 1914 and the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]] in 1915, the Russians were decisively defeated and forced to retreat. The Russians were followed by the German Army advancing into Russian territory.

After the Russian army's first invasion the majority of the civilian population fled westwards, while several thousand remaining civilians were deported to Russia. Treatment of civilians by both armies was mostly disciplined, although 74 civilians were killed by Russian troops in the [[Abschwangen massacre]]. The region had to be rebuilt because of damage caused by the war.

=== Weimar Republic ===
[[File:East Prussia 1923-1939.svg|thumb|Inter-war East Prussia (from 1923 to 1939)]]
With the forced abdication of Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in 1918, Germany became a [[Weimar Republic|republic]]. Most of West Prussia and the former Prussian [[Province of Posen]], territories annexed by Prussia in the 18th century [[Partitions of Poland]], were ceded to the [[Second Polish Republic]] according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. East Prussia became an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], being separated from mainland Germany. The [[Memelland]] was also separated from the province. Because most of West Prussia became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] as the [[Polish Corridor]], the formerly West Prussian [[Marienwerder (region)|Marienwerder region]] became part of East Prussia (as ''Regierungsbezirk Westpreußen''). Also [[Soldau]] district in Allenstein region was part of Second Polish Republic. The [[Seedienst Ostpreußen]] was established to provide an independent transport service to East Prussia.

On 11 July 1920, amidst the backdrop of the [[Polish-Soviet War]], the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] in eastern West Prussia and southern East Prussia was held under Allied supervision to determine if the areas should join the [[Second Polish Republic]] or remain in [[Weimar Germany]] Province of East Prussia. 96.7% of the people voted to remain within Germany (97.89% in the East Prussian plebiscite district).

The [[Klaipėda Region|Klaipėda Territory]], a [[League of Nations mandate]] since 1920, was occupied by [[Lithuania]]n troops in 1923 and was annexed without giving the inhabitants a choice by ballot.

=== Nazi Germany ===
[[File:EastPrussiaMap1944.png|thumb|upright|East Prussia in 1945]]
[[Erich Koch]] headed the East Prussian Nazi party from 1928. He led the district from 1932. This period was characterized by efforts to [[collectivization|collectivize]] the local agriculture and  ruthlessness in dealing with his critics inside and outside the Party.&lt;ref name="wistrich"&gt;Robert S. Wistrich, ''Who's who in Nazi Germany'', 2002, pp. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the largely agricultural province. These actions made him unpopular among the local peasants.&lt;ref name="wistrich"/&gt; In 1932 the local paramilitary [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] had already started to terrorise their political opponents. On the night of 31 July 1932 there was a bomb attack on the headquarters of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] in Königsberg, the [[Otto Braun|Otto-Braun-House]]. The Communist politician [[Gustav Sauf]] was killed; the executive editor of the Social Democratic newspaper ''"Königsberger Volkszeitung"'', [[Otto Wyrgatsch]]; and the [[German People's Party]] politician [[Max von Bahrfeldt]] were all severely injured. Members of the [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]] were assaulted while the local Reichsbanner Chairman of [[Lötzen]], [[Kurt Kotzan]], was murdered on 6 August 1932.&lt;ref name=Matull&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fes.de/breslau/pdf/a20715/a20715_06.pdf|title=Ostdeutschlands Arbeiterbewegung: Abriß ihrer Geschichte, Leistung und Opfer

Through publicly funded emergency relief programs concentrating on agricultural land-improvement projects and road construction, the "Erich Koch Plan" for East Prussia allegedly made the province free of [[unemployment]]: on August 16, 1933 Koch reported to [[Hitler]] that unemployment had been banished entirely from the province, a feat that gained admiration throughout the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Journal of Modern History |year=1993 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=113–151 |title= Fantasy and Reality in Nazi Work-Creation Programs, 1933-1936 |author= Dan P. Silverman |doi=10.1086/244609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch's industrialization plans provoked conflict with R. [[Walther Darré]], who held the office of the Reich Peasant Leader (''Reichsbauernführer'') and Minister of Agriculture. Darré, a [[Religious aspects of Nazism|neopaganist]] rural romantic, wanted to enforce his vision of an agricultural East Prussia.  When his "Land" representatives challenged Koch's plans, Koch arrested them.&lt;ref name="steigmann-gall"&gt;[[Richard Steigmann-Gall]], ''The Holy Reich - Nazi Conceptions of Christianity 1919-1945'', 2004, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Nazis took power in Germany, opposition politicians were persecuted and newspapers banned. The Otto-Braun-House was requisitioned to become the headquarters of the SA, which used the house to imprison and torture its opponents. [[Walter Schütz]], a communist member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], was murdered here.&lt;ref&gt;Matull, page 357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1938 the [[Nazis]] altered about one-third of the [[toponyms]] of the area, eliminating, Germanizing, or simplifying a number of [[Old Prussian]], as well as those Polish or Lithuanian names originating from [[Settler|colonists]] and [[refugees]] to Prussia during and after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. More than 1,500 places were ordered to be renamed by 16 July 1938 following a decree issued by [[Gauleiter]] and [[Oberpräsident]] [[Erich Koch]] and initiated by [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Wolfsschanze": Hitlers Machtzentrale im Zweiten Weltkrieg|first=Uwe|last=Neumärker|edition=3|publisher=Ch.

After the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] opening [[World War II]], the borders of East Prussia were revised. ''Regierungsbezirk Westpreußen'' became part of [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]], while [[Zichenau (region)|Regierungsbezirk Zichenau]] was added to East Prussia. Originally part of the Zichenau region, the Sudauen district in [[Suvalkija|Sudovia]] was later transferred to the Gumbinnen region.

=== World War II ===
In 1939 East Prussia had 2.49 million inhabitants, 85% of them ethnic Germans, the others [[Poles]] in the south who, according to Polish estimates numbered in the interwar period around 300,000-350,000,&lt;ref&gt;Szkolnictwo polskie w Niemczech 1919-1939, Henryk Chałupczak Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej,page9 1996&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Latvian Language|Latvian speaking]] [[Kursenieki]], and [[Lietuvininkai]] who spoke [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] in the northeast. Most German East Prussians, Masurians, Kursieniki, and Lietuvininkai were Lutheran, while the population of [[Ermland]] was mainly Roman Catholic due to the history of its bishopric. The East Prussian Jewish Congregation declined from about 9,000 in 1933 to 3,000 in 1939, as most fled from Nazi rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/p_ostpreussen.html#einwohnerzahl|title=Deutsche Verwaltungsgeschichte Preußen, Provinz Ostpreußen 1871 - 1945|first=Michael|last=Rademacher|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who remained were later deported and killed in the [[Holocaust]].

In 1939 the [[Zichenau (region)|Regierungsbezirk Zichenau]] was [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed by Germany]] and incorporated into East Prussia. Parts of it were transferred to other regions, e.g. [[Sudauen (district)|Suwałki]] to [[Gumbinnen (region)|Regierungsbezirk Gumbinnen]] and [[Soldau (district)|Soldau]] to [[Allenstein (region)|Regierungsbezirk Allenstein]]. Despite [[Nazi propaganda]] presenting all of the regions annexed as possessing significant German populations that wanted reunification with Germany, the Reich's statistics of late 1939 show that only 31,000 out of 994,092 people in this territory were ethnic Germans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

East Prussia was only slightly affected by the war until January 1945, when it was devastated during the [[East Prussian Offensive]]. Most of its inhabitants became refugees in bitterly cold weather during the [[Evacuation of East Prussia]].

=== Evacuation of East Prussia ===
{{main article|Evacuation of East Prussia}}

In 1944 the medieval city of [[Königsberg]], which had never been severely damaged by warfare in its 700 years of existence, [[Bombing of Königsberg in World War II|was almost completely destroyed]] by two [[RAF Bomber Command]] raids — the first on the night of 26/27 August 1944, with the second one three nights later, overnight on 29/30 August 1944. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Second World War'', Book XII) had erroneously believed it to be "a modernized heavily defended [[fortress]]" and ordered its destruction.

[[Gauleiter]] [[Erich Koch]] protracted the evacuation of the German civilian population until the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] approached the East Prussian border in 1944. The population had been systematically misinformed by ''[[Endsieg]]'' Nazi propaganda about the real state of military affairs. As a result, many civilians fleeing westward were overtaken by retreating [[Wehrmacht]] units and the rapidly advancing [[Red Army]].

Reports of Soviet atrocities in the [[Nemmersdorf massacre]] of October 1944 and organized [[rape]] spread fear and desperation among the civilians. Thousands lost their lives during the sinkings (by Soviet submarine) of the refugee ships ''[[Wilhelm Gustloff (ship)|Wilhelm Gustloff]]'', the ''[[Goya (ship)|Goya]]'', and the ''[[Dampfschiff General von Steuben|General von Steuben]]''. Königsberg surrendered on 9 April 1945, following the desperate four-day [[Battle of Königsberg]]. The number of civilians killed is estimated to be at least 300,000.

However, most of the German inhabitants, which then consisted primarily of women, children and old men, did manage to escape the Red Army as part of the largest exodus of people in human history: "A population which had stood at 2.2 million in 1940 was reduced to 193,000 at the end of May 1945."&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony, ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', Penguin Books (2002). {{ISBN|0-670-88695-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapters"&gt;Beevor, Antony, ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', chapters 1-8, Penguin Books (2002). {{ISBN|0-670-88695-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History after partition and annexation==
Following [[Nazi Germany]]'s defeat in [[World War II]] in 1945, East Prussia was partitioned between Poland and the [[Soviet Union]] according to the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Southern East Prussia was placed under Polish administration, while northern East Prussia was divided between the Soviet republics of [[Russian SFSR|Russia]] (the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]) and [[Lithuanian SSR|Lithuania]] (the constituent counties of the [[Klaipėda Region]]). The city of Königsberg was renamed [[Kaliningrad]] in 1946. Most of the German population of the province had left during the evacuation at the end of the war, but several hundreds of thousands died during the years 1944–46 and the remainder were subsequently [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]].

===Expulsion of Germans from East Prussia after World War II===
{{main article|Expulsion of Germans after World War II}}
Shortly after the end of the war in May 1945, Germans who had fled in early 1945 tried to return to their homes in East Prussia. An estimated number of 800,000 Germans were living in East Prussia during the summer of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert, Damals in Ostpreussen, p. 168, München 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-421-04366-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more were prevented from returning,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and the German population of East Prussia was almost completely [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] by the communist regimes. During the war and for some time thereafter 45 camps were established for about 200,000-250,000 forced labourers, the vast majority of whom were deported to the Soviet Union, including the [[Gulag]] camp system.&lt;ref name=Ther&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=oGmTs2SceAgC&amp;dq=polonization+masuria&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=masuria&amp;f=false|title=Redrawing nations: ethnic cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944-1948|first1=Philipp|last1=Ther|first2=Anna|last2=Siljak|publisher=Rowman&amp;Littlefield Publishers|year=2001|page=109|isbn=0-7425-1094-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest camp with about 48,000 inmates was established at [[Iława|Deutsch Eylau]] (Iława).&lt;ref name=Ther/&gt; Orphaned children who were left behind in the zone occupied by the Soviet Union were referred to as [[Wolf children]].

===Southern part to Poland===
{{main article|Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship}}
Representatives of the Polish government officially took over the civilian administration of the southern part of East Prussia on 23 May 1945.&lt;ref name=Ther/&gt;
Subsequently, Polish [[expatriate]]s from [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish lands annexed by the Soviet Union]] as well as [[Ukrainians]] and [[Lemkos]] from southern Poland, expelled in [[Operation Vistula]] in 1947, were settled in the southern part of East Prussia, now the Polish [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]. In 1950 the [[Olsztyn Voivodeship]] counted 689,000 inhabitants, 22.6% of them coming from areas annexed by the Soviet Union, 10% Ukrainians, and 18.5% of them pre-war inhabitants. The remaining pre-war population was treated as Germanized Poles and a policy of re-Polonization was pursued throughout the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stefanwolff.com/working-papers/EthnicGermansPolandandCzechRepublic.pdf Ethnic Germans in Poland and the Czech Republic:A Comparative Evaluation] by Karl Cordell and Stefan Wolff&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these "[[Autochthones]]" chose to emigrate to [[West Germany]] from the 1950s through 1970s (between 1970 and 1988 55,227&amp;nbsp;persons from Warmia and Masuria moved to Western Germany).&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert, Ostpreussen - Geschichte und Mythos, p.352, {{ISBN|3-88680-808-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern East Prussia to the Soviet Union===
{{main article|Kaliningrad Oblast}}
[[File:Königsberg Castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Königsberg Castle]], 1895]]

[[File:Ru-koenigsberg.jpg|thumb|right|"Königsberg" licence plate holder, 2009]]

In April 1946, northern East Prussia became an official province of the [[Russian SFSR]] as the "''Kyonigsbergskaya Oblast''", with the [[Klaipėda Region|Memel Territory]] becoming part of the [[Lithuanian SSR]]. In June 1946 114,070 German and 41,029 Soviet citizens were registered in the Oblast, with an unknown number of disregarded unregistered persons. In July of that year, the historic city of [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]] to honour [[Mikhail Kalinin]] and the area named the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. Between 24 August and 26 October 1948 21 transports with in total 42,094 Germans left the Oblast to the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]] (which became East Germany). The last remaining Germans left in November 1949 (1,401 persons) and January 1950 (7 persons).&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert, Damals in Ostpreussen, p. 179-183, München 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-421-04366-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prussian Lithuanians]] also experienced the same fate.

A similar fate befell the [[Kursenieki|Curonians]] who lived in the area around the [[Curonian Lagoon]]. While many  fled from the [[Red Army]] during the evacuation of East Prussia, Curonians that remained behind were subsequently expelled by the [[Soviet Union]]. Only 219 lived along the Curonian Spit in 1955. Many had German names such as Fritz or Hans, a cause for anti-German discrimination. The Soviet authorities considered the Curonians [[fascists]]. Because of this discrimination, many immigrated to [[West Germany]] in 1958, where the majority of Curonians now live.

After the expulsion of the German population ethnic [[Russians]], [[Belarusians]], and [[Ukrainians]] were settled in the northern part. In the Soviet part of the region, a policy of eliminating all remnants of German history was pursued. All German place names were replaced by new Russian names. The exclave was a [[closed city|military zone]], which was closed to foreigners; Soviet citizens could only enter with special permission. In 1967 the remnants of [[Königsberg Castle]] were demolished on the orders of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] to make way for a new "House of the Soviets".

===Modern status===
Since the [[Cold War (1985–1991)|fall of Communism in 1991]], some German groups have tried to help settle the [[Volga Germans]] from eastern parts of European Russia in the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. This effort was only a small success, however, as most impoverished Volga Germans preferred to emigrate to the richer [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], where they could become German citizens through the [[Right of return#Germany|right of return]].

Although the 1945–1949 expulsion of Germans from the northern part of former East Prussia was often conducted in a violent and aggressive way by Soviet officials, the present Russian inhabitants of the Kaliningrad Oblast have much less animosity towards Germans. German names have been revived in commercial Russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting Kaliningrad's name to its historic name of Königsberg. The city centre of Kaliningrad was completely rebuilt, as [[United Kingdom|British]] bombs in 1944 and the Soviet siege in 1945 had left it in nothing but ruins.

The borders of the present-day [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] in [[Poland]] correspond closely to those of southern East Prussia.

==Administration==
The Prussian central government appointed for every province an ''Oberpräsident'' ("Upper President") carrying out central prerogatives on the provincial level and supervising the implementation of central policy on the lower levels of administration.

Since 1875, with the strengthening of self-rule, the urban and rural [[Districts of Prussia|districts (''Kreise'')]] within each province (sometimes within each [[Regierungsbezirk|governorate]]) formed a corporation with common tasks and assets (schools, traffic installations, hospitals, cultural institutions, jails etc.) called the Provinzialverband (provincial association). Initially the assemblies of the urban and rural districts elected representatives for the [[Provinziallandtag|provincial diets]] (''Provinzial[[landtag]]e''), which were thus indirectly elected. As of 1919 the provincial diets (or as to governorate diets, the so-called Kommunallandtage) were directly elected by the citizens of the provinces (or governorates, respectively). These parliaments legislated within the competences transferred to the provincial associations. The provincial diet of East Prussia elected a provincial executive body (government), the provincial committee (''Provinzialausschuss''), and a head of province, the ''[[Landeshauptmann#Landeshauptmann and Landesdirektor (Prussia)|Landeshauptmann]]'' ("Land Captain"; till the 1880s titled Landdirektor, land director).&lt;ref&gt;In some Prussian provinces the same office continued to be called Landesdirektor also thereafter. Cf. article: "Landesdirektor", in: ''Der Große Brockhaus: Handbuch des Wissens in zwanzig Bänden'': 21 vols.; Leipzig: Brockhaus, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;1928–1935; vol. 11 (1932), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Karnataka}} 
'''[[Karnataka]]''' is an [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]]. Several [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka. The region was popularly referred to as 'Karnata desha' in Indian history. However, historically, the names ''Karnatak'' or ''Carnatic'' have been misapplied to refer to the regions in or beyond the [[Western Ghats]] ([[Kodagu]] and [[Kerala]]) as well as to a region in present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telangana]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V09_308.gif Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 9, page 302 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The other accepted derivative comes from the [[Kannada]] words ''karu'' and ''nādu'' meaning ''elevated land'', or from the  [[Kannada]] words ''kal'' and ''nādu'' meaning ''rock country'', referring to the rocky terrain of the state. One more derivative is "Karnad" meaning "land of Black soil" &lt;ref name="karnad"&gt;{{cite web |title=Karnataka Plateau |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Karnataka-Plateau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References from Hindu texts==
The earliest known references to ''Karnataka'' are found in the ''Sabha Parva'' and the ''Bhishma Parva'' of [[Mahabharata]], an [[History of India|ancient Indian]] [[Epic poetry|epic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/31/stories/2006103108870500.htm|title=Article from ''The Hindu'' national newspaper of India|accessdate=2007-03-10 | location=Chennai, India|date=2006-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka6.htm|title='Antiquity of Karnataka' - article from OurKarnataka.com Portal|accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Matsya Purana'', ''Skanda Purana'', ''Markandeya Purana'' and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' also make references to the name ''Karnata''.

In Canto 5 - Chapter 6 of the ''Bhagavata Purana'', ''Karnata'' is mentioned while narrating the life of [[Rishabhadeva]]. It is said in the ''Bhagavata'' that the Lord in [[Rishabhadeva]]'s form ended his ''avatara'' in the ''Kutakachala'' hill in ''Karnata'' province. Kutakchala is a hill in present-day Karnataka near [[Kollur, Udupi district|Kollur]] in the [[Western Ghats]].&lt;ref name="bhagavata1"&gt;[http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto5/chapter6.html SRIMAD BHAGAVATAM: CANTO 5- CHAPTER 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhagavata2"&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/sb/5/6/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 5 Chapter 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical references==
Scholars [[Pāṇini]] ( 520–460 BCE), [[Mrichchhakatika]] and [[Kathasaritsagara]] make references to ''Karnataka'' in their ancient works. Later, in the 5th century CE, the term ''Karnataka'' was used by the [[astrologer]] [[Varahamihira|Varaha Mihira]] in his work ''Brihatkatha'' and the [[Birur]] plates of [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] Vishnuvarma call Shantivarma ''The master of the entire Karnataka region''.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, ''Concise history of Karnataka'', 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th century CE, [[Rashtrakuta]] inscriptions refer to the armies of [[Chalukyas]] of [[Badami]] as ''Karnatakabala''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] classic ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' of the same time period calls the people of present-day Karnataka region as ''Karunatakars''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.The Kalingathu parani, a war poem written by jayangkondar in Tamil Literature calls a people of a region called 'Karunatiyar'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ta.wikibooks.org/wiki/2_%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%BF_%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%88_%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%81 |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229031340/http://ta.wikibooks.org/wiki/2_%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%BF_%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%88_%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%81 |archivedate=December 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th century CE, the Kannada classic ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' hails the entire region between the rivers [[Kaveri river|Kaveri]] and [[Godavari river|Godavari]] as ''Karnata''.&lt;ref name="Godavari"&gt;Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, ''History of South India'', Arthikaje, ''History of Karnataka''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century CE, Kannada poet [[Andayya]]'s works use the same terminology. In the late 16th century, a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] work ''Vasucharitamu'' refers to Tirumala Deva Raya (1570 CE), the first of the Aravidu (Aravithi) line of rulers of the late [[Vijayanagar Empire]] as the reviver of the ''[[Karnata Empire]]''.&lt;ref name="vasucharitamu"&gt;Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, ''History of South India'',Archaeological Survey of India, ''Telugu Inscriptions from Vijayanagar Empire [http://inscriptions.whatisindia.com/], vol.16&lt;/ref&gt; All this clearly shows that the name ''Karnataka'' has been in usage consistently since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, Concise history of Karnataka, 2001, MCC, Bengalooru (Reprinted 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate theories==
Karnataka's name may have originated from the two words ''Kabbu Nadu'', which means land of Sugarcane. This etymology might be possible as Karnataka is a huge Sugarcane-cultivating land. But, this theory might not be very factual as Sugarcane production boomed in South Karnataka only post the building of KRS Dam by Sir M Vishweshwarayya. Before that the very same region of Karnataka was known for Ragi production.

[[File:Visual-fix-by-three-bearings.png|thumb|right|Visual fix by three bearings plotted on a nautical chart]]In [[position fixing]] [[navigation]], a '''position fix''' (PF) or simply a '''fix''' is a position derived from measuring in relation to external reference points.

In nautical applications, the term is generally used with manual or visual techniques such as the use of intersecting visual or radio [[position line]]s rather than the use of more automated and accurate electronic methods such as [[GPS]]; in aviation, use of electronic navigation aids is more common. A visual fix can be made by using any sighting device with a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] indicator. Two or more objects of known position are sighted, and the bearings recorded. Bearing lines are then plotted on a chart through the locations of the sighted items. The intersection of these lines is the current position of the vessel.

Usually, a fix is where two or more position lines intersect at any given time. If three position lines can be obtained, the resulting "cocked hat", where the three lines do not intersect at the same point, but create a triangle, gives the navigator an indication of the accuracy.

The most accurate fixes occur when the position lines are at right angles to each other.

Fixes are a necessary part of navigation by [[dead reckoning]] because dead reckoning relies on estimates of [[speed]] and [[course (navigation)|course]]. The fix confirms the actual position during a journey. The fix itself can introduce inaccuracies if the reference point is not correctly identified or is inaccurately measured.

The '''geography of Antarctica''' is dominated by its [[polar region|south polar location]] and, thus, by [[ice]]. The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]], located in the [[Earth]]'s [[southern hemisphere]], is centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]]. It is washed by the [[Southern Ocean|Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean]] or, depending on definition, the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s. It has an area of more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km².

Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], the world's largest [[ice sheet]] and also its largest reservoir of [[fresh water]]. Averaging at least 1.6&amp;nbsp;km thick, the ice is so massive that it has [[post-glacial rebound|depressed the continental bedrock]] in some areas more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;km below sea level; [[Subglacial lake|subglacial lakes]] of liquid water also occur (e.g., [[Lake Vostok]]). [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] and [[ice rise|rises]] populate the ice sheet on the periphery.

In September 2018, researchers at the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] released a [https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/ high resolution terrain map] (detail down to the size of a car, and less in some areas) of Antarctica, named the "[[Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica]]" ([[REMA]]).&lt;ref name="NYT-20180907"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stirone |first=Shannon |title=New Antarctica Map Is Like ‘Putting on Glasses for the First Time and Seeing 20/20’ – A high resolution terrain map of Earth’s frozen continent will help researchers better track changes on the ice as the planet warms. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/science/antarctica-map-rema.html |date=7 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antarctica.A2010287.0140.250m.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Banzare, Sabrina, and Budd Law Dome Coasts]]
Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Western Antarctica]] and [[Eastern Antarctica]] correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]]. This usage has been regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.

Lesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this [[ice sheet]], because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.

==Volcanoes==
There are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are
considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or 
"recent" tephra deposits: 
[[Mount Melbourne]] (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano; 
[[Mount Berlin]] (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano; 
Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and 
[[Mount Hampton]] (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.
 
Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.
[[Mount Erebus]] (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on
[[Ross Island]] with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.
On the opposite side of the continent, 
[[Deception Island]]
(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known
and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.
[[Buckle Island]] in the [[Balleny Islands]] (66°50'S., 163°12'E.), 
[[Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands)|Penguin Island]] (62°06'S., 57°54'W.), 
[[Paulet Island]] (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and 
[[Lindenberg Island]] (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also 
considered to be active. In 2017, the researchers of [[Edinburgh University]] discovered 91 underwater volcanoes under [[West Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/scientists-discover-91-volcanos-antarctica|title=Scientists discover 91 volcanoes below Antarctic ice sheet|last=McKie|first=Robin|date=2017-08-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2017/student-s-idea-leads-to-antarctic-volcano-discover|title=Student’s idea leads to Antarctic volcano discovery|work=The University of Edinburgh|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan''' is an [[island nation]] comprising a [[stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] [[archipelago]] over {{convert|3000|km|mi|abbr=on}} along [[East Asia]]'s [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast.&lt;ref name="water-supply"/&gt; It consists of 6,852 islands.&lt;ref name = "離島"/&gt; The main islands are [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Hokkaido]]. The [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Nanpō Islands]] are south of the main islands. The territory extends {{convert|377,973.89|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Geospatial Information Authority of Japan 2018"/&gt; It is the largest [[island country]] in [[East Asia]] and fourth largest [[List_of_island_countries|island country]] in the world. Japan has the sixth longest [[List of countries by length of coastline|coastline]] {{convert|29751 |km|mi|abbr=on}} and the eight largest [[Exclusive economic zone of Japan|Exclusive Economic Zone]] of {{convert|4470000|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the world.&lt;ref name="kaiho"/&gt;

The terrain is mostly rugged and mountainous with 66% forest.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt; The [[Demography of Japan|population]] is clustered in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=地形分類 |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/archive/j-atlas-d_j_02.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |accessdate = 2015-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan is located in the northwestern [[Ring of Fire]] on multiple [[tectonic plates]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; East of the Japanese archipelago are three [[oceanic trenches]]. The [[Japan Trench]] is created as the oceanic [[Pacific Plate]] [[Subduction|subducts]] beneath the continental [[Okhotsk Plate]].&lt;ref name="revel"/&gt; The continuous subduction process causes frequent [[earthquakes]], [[tsunami]] and [[stratovolcanoes]].&lt;ref name="volcanoes-japan"/&gt; The islands are also affected by [[typhoons]]. The subduction plates have pulled the [[Japanese archipelago]] eastward, created the [[Sea of Japan]] and separated it from the [[Asian continent]] by [[back-arc spreading]] 15 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

The climate of the [[Japanese archipelago]] varies from [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] in the north ([[Hokkaido]]) to [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] in the south ([[Okinawa Prefecture]]). These differences in climate and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse [[flora]] and [[fauna]], with some rare [[endemic species]], especially in the [[Ogasawara Islands]].

Japan extends from 20° to 45° north longitude ([[Okinotorishima]] to [[Benten-jima (Wakkanai)|Benten-jima]]) and from 122° to 153° east latitude ([[Yonaguni]] to [[Minami Torishima]]).&lt;ref name="geohack"/&gt; [[Japan]] is surrounded by [[sea]]. To the north the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] separates it from the [[Russian Far East]], to the west the [[Sea of Japan]] separates it from the [[Korean Peninsula]], to the southwest the [[East China Sea]] separates the [[Ryukyu Islands]] from [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], to the east is the [[Pacific Ocean]].

In total, as of 2018, Japan's territory is {{convert|377,973.89|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|364543.89|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|13430|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} water.&lt;ref name="Geospatial Information Authority of Japan 2018"/&gt; Japan has the sixth longest [[List of countries by length of coastline|coastline]] in the world ({{convert|29751 |km|mi|abbr=on}}). It is the largest [[island country]] in [[East Asia]] and fourth largest [[List_of_island_countries|island country]] in the world. There are a wide range of climatic zones and ecosystems.

Due to Japan's many far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources. The [[Exclusive economic zone of Japan|Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan]] covers {{convert|4470000|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} and is the eighth largest in the world.

== Regions ==
[[File:Regions_and_Prefectures_Japan.png|thumb|upright=1.20|Regions and prefectures of Japan]]

{{main|Regions of Japan}}

Japan is informally divided into eight regions from north to south:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1001.html Regions of Japan on japan-guide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hokkaidō Prefecture|Hokkaidō]]
* [[Tōhoku region]]
* [[Kantō region]]
* [[Chūbu region]]
* [[Kansai region|Kansai (or Kinki) region]]
* [[Chūgoku region]]
* [[Shikoku]]
* [[Kyūshū]]

Each contains several [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], except the Hokkaido region, which covers only Hokkaido [[Prefecture]].

The regions are not official administrative units, but have been traditionally used as the regional division of Japan in a number of contexts. For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions, weather reports usually give the weather by region, and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name ([[Kinki Nippon Railway]], Chūgoku Bank, [[Tohoku University]], etc.). While Japan has eight High Courts, their jurisdictions do not correspond with the eight regions.

==Composition, topography and geography==
[[File:Japan topo en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A topographic map of Japan]]

About 73% of Japan is mountainous, with a mountain range running through each of the [[Japanese archipelago|main islands]]. Japan's highest mountain is [[Mount Fuji]], with an elevation of {{convert|3776|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |title = Forest area |url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc | publisher = The World Bank Group | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. [[Hot spring]]s are numerous and have been exploited as an [[economic capital]] by the leisure industry.

The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] measures Japan's territory annually in order to continuously grasp the state of the national land. As of January 31, 2018 (Heisei 30) Japan's territory is {{convert|377,973.89|km2|sqmi}}. It increased in area due to the volcanic eruption activity of [[Nishinoshima (Ogasawara)|Nishinoshima]] (西之島) and the natural expansion of the island.&lt;ref name="Geospatial Information Authority of Japan 2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/kihonjohochousa/kihonjohochousa61008.html|title=平成29年全国都道府県市区町村別の面積を公表| publisher=国土地理院 (Geospatial Information Authority of Japan)| accessdate=19 September 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919131533/http://www.gsi.go.jp/kihonjohochousa/kihonjohochousa61008.html |archivedate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]], this is the “Trends and Actual Condition of Land Use in Japan” in 2002 (Heisei 14). Japan's territory was {{convert|377,900|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2002.&lt;ref name="mlit-2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tochi.mlit.go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/16-02.pdf|title=土地総合情報ライブラリー　平成16年土地の動向に関する年次報告 第2章 土地に関する動向|publisher=国土交通省|language=ja|accessdate=2007-02-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120195343/http://tochi.mlit.go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/16-02.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mountains and volcanoes ===
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}
The mountainous islands of the [[Japanese archipelago]] form a crescent off the eastern coast of Asia. They are separated from the mainland by the [[Sea of Japan]], which historically served as a protective barrier. The country consists of four major islands: [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]]; with more than 6,500 adjacent smaller islands and islets ("island" defined as land more than 100 m in circumference),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 島とは何か |url = http://www.nijinet.or.jp/info/faq/tabid/65/Default.aspx | publisher = Center for Research and Promotion of Japanese Islands | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Izu Islands]] and [[Ogasawara Islands]] in the [[Nanpō Islands]], and the [[Satsunan Islands]], [[Okinawa Islands]], and [[Sakishima Islands]] of the [[Ryukyu Islands]].

The national territory also includes the [[Volcano Islands]] (Kazan Retto) such as [[Iwo Jima]], located some 1,200 kilometers south of mainland [[Tokyo]]. A territorial dispute with Russia, dating from the end of World War II, over the two southernmost of the [[Kuril Islands]], [[Iturup|Etorofu]] and [[Kunashir Island|Kunashiri]], and the smaller [[Shikotan]] Island and [[Habomai Islands]] northeast of [[Hokkaido]] remains a sensitive spot in [[Japanese–Russian relations]] ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}). Excluding disputed territory, the archipelago covers about 378,000 square kilometers. No point in Japan is more than 150 kilometers from the sea.

The four major islands are separated by narrow straits and form a natural entity. The [[Ryukyu Islands]] curve 970 kilometers southward from [[Kyūshū]].

The distance between Japan and the [[Korean Peninsula]], the nearest point on the Asian continent, is about 200 kilometers at the [[Korea Strait]]. Japan has always been linked with the continent through trade routes, stretching in the north toward [[Siberia]], in the west through the [[Tsushima Island]]s to the Korean Peninsula, and in the south to the ports on the south China coast.

The Japanese islands are the summits of mountain ridges uplifted near the outer edge of the [[continental shelf]]. About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent. A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the "face", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the "back", toward the Sea of Japan. On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.

Central Japan is marked by the convergence of the three mountain chains—the [[Hida Mountains|Hida]], [[Kiso Mountains|Kiso]], and [[Akaishi Mountains|Akaishi mountains]]—that form the [[Japanese Alps]] (Nihon Arupusu), several of whose peaks are higher than 3,000 meters. The highest point in the Japanese Alps is [[Mount Kita]] at 3,193 meters. The highest point in the country is [[Mount Fuji]] (Fujisan, also erroneously called Fujiyama), a volcano dormant since 1707 that rises to {{convert|3776|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. On the Sea of Japan side are plateaus and low mountain districts, with altitudes of 500 to 1,500 meters.

The populated plains or mountain basins are not extensive in area. The largest, the [[Kantō Plain]], where [[Tokyo]] is situated, covers only 13,000 square kilometers. Other important plains are the [[Nōbi Plain]] surrounding [[Nagoya]], the [[Kinai Plain]] in the [[Osaka]]–[[Kyoto]] area, the [[Sendai Plain]] around the city of [[Sendai]] in northeastern Honshū, and the [[Ishikari Plain]] on Hokkaidō. Many of these plains are along the coast, and their areas have been increased by land reclamation throughout recorded history.

===Rivers, lakes and coasts===
[[File:Seto_Inland_Sea.jpg|thumb|[[Seto Inland Sea]]]]
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
Rivers are generally steep and swift, and few are suitable for navigation except in their lower reaches. Although most rivers are less than 300 kilometers in length, their rapid flow from the mountains provides a valuable, renewable resource: [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation. Japan's hydroelectric power potential has been exploited almost to capacity. Seasonal variations in flow have led to extensive development of flood control measures. Most of the rivers are relatively short. The longest, the [[Shinano River]], which winds through [[Nagano Prefecture]] to [[Niigata Prefecture]] and flows into the Sea of Japan, is {{convert|367|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. The largest freshwater lake is [[Lake Biwa]] {{convert|671|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, northeast of [[Kyoto]].

Extensive coastal shipping, especially around the [[Seto Inland Sea]] (Seto Naikai), compensates for the lack of navigable rivers. The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors. The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaidō, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.

In November 2008, Japan filed a request to expand its claimed [[continental shelf]].&lt;ref name="Upi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/04/28/Japan-granted-more-continental-shelf/UPI-15731335656074/?spt=hs&amp;or=tn|title=Japan granted more continental shelf|publisher =Upi.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf recognized around {{convert|310000|km2|sqmi}} of seabed around [[Okinotorishima]], giving Japan priority over access to seabed resources in nearby areas. According to U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the approved expansion is equal to about 82% of Japan's total land area.&lt;ref name="Upi"/&gt; The [[People's Republic of China]] and [[South Korea]] have opposed Japan's claim because they view Okinotorishima not as an island, but as a group of rocks.

=== Land reclamation ===
[[File:151229_Kobe_Port_Japan02bs.jpg|thumb|[[Kobe Airport]] in [[Osaka Bay]]]]

The [[Japanese archipelago]] is mainly rugged and mountainous (73%) so the relatively small amount of habitable land has prompted significant terrain modification by humans over many centuries. 

Approximately 0.5% of Japan’s total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). It began in the 12th century. Land was reclaimed from the sea and from river deltas by building [[Levee|dikes]] and drainage and rice paddies on terraces carved into mountainsides. The majority of [[land reclamation]] projects occurred after [[World War II]] during Japan's economic miracle with high economic growth. Reclamation of 80% to 90% of all the tidal flatland was done. Big land reclamation projects with [[landfill]] were done in coastal areas for maritime and industrial factories. Such as [[Higashi Ogishima]] in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Osaka Bay]] and [[Nagasaki Airport]]. [[Port Island]], [[Rokko Island]] and [[Kobe Airport]] were built in [[Kobe]]. Late 20th and early 21st century projects include [[artificial islands]] such as [[Chubu Centrair International Airport]] in [[Ise Bay]], [[Kansai International Airport]] in the middle of [[Osaka Bay]], [[Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise]] and [[Wakayama Marina City]].&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/reclaimed-land-in-japan/ |title=Reclaimed Land in Japan |publisher=Japan Property Central |date= |accessdate=2018-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226211747/http://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/reclaimed-land-in-japan/ |archivedate=2018-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of [[Ōgata, Akita|Ogata]] in [[Akita, Japan]], was established on land reclaimed from [[Lake Hachirogata]] (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totaled {{convert|172.03|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/history.html |title=The History of Ogata-Mura &amp;#124; Ogata-mura |publisher=Ogata.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924055244/http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/history.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of land reclamation in Japan:

* Kyogashima, [[Kobe]] - first man-made island built by [[Taira no Kiyomori|Tairano Kyomori]] in 1173&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;
* The [[Hibiya]] Inlet, Tokyo - first large scale reclamation project started in 1592&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;
* [[Dejima]], Nagasaki -  built during Japan’s national isolation period in 1634. It was the sole trading post in Japan during the [[Sakoku]] period and was originally inhabited by Portuguese and then Dutch traders.&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;
* [[Tokyo Bay]], [[Japan]] – {{convert|249|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Japan Fact Sheet| publisher = Japan Reference| url = http://www.jref.com/society/japan_fact_sheet.shtml| accessdate = 2007-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[artificial island]] (2007). 
** This includes the entirety of [[Odaiba]], a series of island forts constructed to protect [[Tokyo]] from sea attacks (1853).&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;
* [[Kobe]], Japan – {{convert|23|km2}} (1995).&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;
* Isahaya Bay in the [[Ariake Sea]] - approximately {{convert|35|km2}} is reclaimed with tide embankment and sluice gates (2018). 

==== Composition ====

Much reclaimed land is made up of landfill from waste materials, dredged earth, sand, sediment, sluge and soil removed from construction sites. It is used to build man-made islands in harbors and embankments in inland areas.&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;

From November 8, 2011, [[Tokyo City]] began accepting rubble and waste from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] region. This rubble was processed and when it had the appropriate radiation levels it was used as landfill to build new artificial islands in Tokyo Bay. [[Yamashita Park]] in [[Yokohama City]] was made with rubble from the [[great Kantō earthquake]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt; 

There is a risk of contamination on artificial islands with landfill and reclaimed land if there was industry that spilled (toxic) chemicals into the ground. For example the artificial island [[Toyosu]] was once occupied by a Tokyo Gas factory. Toxic substances were discovered in the soil and groundwater at Toyosu. The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] spent an additional 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to pump out groundwater by digging hundreds of wells.&lt;ref name="historic-tsukiji"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/as-historic-tsukiji-market-closes-fishmongers-mourn |accessdate=October 4, 2018 |title=As Tokyo's historic Tsukiji market closes, fishmongers mourn |first=Issei|last= Kato|date= 29 September 2018|publisher=Reuters  |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003005402/https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/as-historic-tsukiji-market-closes-fishmongers-mourn |archivedate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, plans to move the [[Tsukiji fish market]] were restarted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osumi|first1=Magdalena|last2=Aoki|first2=Mizuho|title=Koike announces Tsukiji relocation, plans to retain its ‘cultural legacy’|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/06/20/national/tokyo-governor-announces-tsukiji-fish-markets-relocation-possible-plan-return-five-years/|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but delayed in July to the autumn of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tsukiji market relocation to Toyosu delayed till autumn 2018|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170721/p2a/00m/0na/016000c|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi]]|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the new site was declared safe following a cleanup operation, the opening date of [[Toyosu Market]] was set for 11 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/26/tokyo-tsukiji-fish-market-moves |title=Tokyo fears losing a part of its soul as world's biggest fish market moves |first=Justin|last= McCurry |date= 26 August 2018 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tectonic plates ===

The islands of Japan were created by [[tectonic plate]] movements over several 100 millions of years from the mid-[[Silurian]] (443.8 Mya) to the [[Pleistocene]] (11,700 years ago).

*[[Tohoku]] (upper half of [[Honshu]]), [[Hokkaido]], [[Kuril islands]] and [[Sakhalin]] (Karafuto) are located on the [[Okhotsk Plate]]. This is a minor tectonic plate bounded to the north by the [[North American Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;Seno et al., 1996 Journal of Geophysical Research; https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/96JB00532&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apel et al., 2006 Geophysical Research Letters; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1029/2006GL026077/full&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Okhotsk Plate]] is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Plate]] at the [[Kuril-Kamchatka Trench]] and the [[Japan Trench]]. It is bounded on the south by the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] at the [[Nankai Trough]]. On the west its bounded by the [[Eurasian Plate]], and possibly on the southwest by the [[Amurian Plate]]. The north-eastern boundary is a [[sinistral|left-lateral]] moving [[transform fault]] ([[Ulakhan Fault]]). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stephan-mueller-spec-publ-ser.net/4/147/2009/smsps-4-147-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*The southern half of [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]] and most of [[Kyushu]] are located on the [[Amurian Plate]]. 
*The southern tip of [[Kyushu]] and the [[Ryukyu islands]] are located on the [[Okinawa Plate]]. 
*The [[Nanpo Islands]] are on the [[Philippine Plate]]

The [[Pacific Plate]] and [[Philippine Plate]] are [[subduction]] plates. They are deeper than the [[Eurasian plate]]. The [[Philippine Sea Plate]] moves beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south. The [[Pacific Plate]] moves under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north. These subduction plates have pulled Japan eastward and opened the [[Sea of Japan]] by [[back-arc spreading]] around 15 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|author=Barnes, Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands: The New "Big Picture"|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|year=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Strait of Tartary]] and the [[Korea Strait]] opened much later. [[La Pérouse Strait]] formed about 60,000 to 11,000 years ago closing the path used by mammoths which had earlier moved to northern [[Hokkaido]].&lt;ref name=brit /&gt; 

The subduction zone is where the [[oceanic crust]] slides beneath the [[continental crust]] or other oceanic plates. This is because the oceanic plate's litosphere has a higher density.Subduction zones are sites that usually have a high rate of [[volcanism]] and [[earthquake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez-López, M.R., Mendoza, C.,|year=2016|title=Acoplamiento sismogénico en la zona de subducción de Michoacán-Colima-Jalisco,México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6802/(3)Martinez.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=2|pages=199–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, subduction zones develop [[orogen|belts]] of [[deformation (geology)|deformation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snl.no/orogenese |title=Orogenese |access-date=July 2, 2014 |last= |first= |date=February 14, 2009|website=[[Store norske leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |cita= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subduction zones on the east side of the [[Japanese archipelago]] cause frequent low intensity earth tremors.

Sugiyama, pp. 49–86, Tokai University Press, Tokyo, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of motion is consistent with the direction of the [[Nankai Trough]]'s oblique convergence. The rate of motion on the MTL is much less than the rate of convergence at the [[Nankai Trough|plate boundary]]. This makes it difficult to distinguish the motion on the MTL from interseismic elastic straining in GPS data.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, S. and Heki, K.

The [[Japan Trench]] is created as the oceanic [[Pacific Plate]] [[Subduction|subducts]] beneath the continental [[Okhotsk Plate]]. The subduction process causes bending of the down going plate, creating a deep trench. Continuous movement on the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench is one of the main causes of [[tsunamis]] and [[earthquakes]] in northern [[Japan]], including the [[Megathrust earthquake|megathrust]] [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. The rate of subduction associated with the Japan Trench has been recorded at about 7.9-9.2&amp;nbsp;cm/yr.&lt;ref name="revel"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sella|first=Giovanni F.|last2=Dixon|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Mao|first3=Ailin|date=2002|title=REVEL: A model for Recent plate velocities from space geodesy|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2000JB000033|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|language=en|volume=107|issue=B4|pages=ETG 11–1-ETG 11–30|doi=10.1029/2000jb000033|issn=0148-0227|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese archipelago]] is the result of several generations of subducting [[tectonic plates]]. Approximately {{convert|15000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese archipelago in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted. It is considered a mature [[island arc]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

=== Composition ===

The Japanese islands are formed of the mentioned geological units parallel to the subduction front. The parts of islands facing the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific Ocean's Plate]] are typically younger and display a larger proportion of volcanic products, while island parts facing the [[Sea of Japan]] are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In north-west Japan are thick [[Quaternary]] deposits. This makes determination of the geological history and composition difficult and it is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="gsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gsj.jp/en/education/geomap-e/geology-e.html|publisher=gsj.jp|title=Geology of Japan｜Geological Survey of Japan, AIST｜産総研地質調査総合センター / Geological Survey of Japan, AIST |accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing Archipelago ==

The [[Japanese Archipelago]] grows due to perpetual [[tectonic plate]] movements, [[earthquakes]], [[stratovolcanoes]] and [[land reclamation]] in the [[Ring of Fire]].

{{main|Sea of Japan}}

=== History ===

During the [[Pleistocene]] (2.58 million years BCE) glacial cycles, the [[Japanese islands]] may have occasionally been connected to the [[Eurasia|Eurasian Continent]] via the [[Korea Strait]] and the [[Korean Peninsula]] or [[Sakhalin]] (Karafuto). The [[Sea of Japan]] was considered to be a frozen inner lake due to the lack of warm [[Tsushima Current]]. Various plants and large animals, such as the ''[[Palaeoloxodon naumanni]]'' migrated into  the Japan archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=S.-C. |author2=Yoo, D.-G. |author3=Lee, C.-W. |author4=Lee, E.-I. |title=Last glacial sea-level changes and paleogeography of the Korea (Tsushima) Strait|journal=Geo-Marine Letters|date=26 September 2000|volume=20|issue=2|pages=64–71|doi=10.1007/s003670000039}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sea of Japan]] was a landlocked sea when the [[land bridge]] of [[East Asia]] existed circa 18,000 BCE. During the glacial maximum the marine elevation was 200 meters lower than 2018 CE. Thus [[Tsushima island]] in the [[Korea Strait]] was a land bridge that connected [[Kyushu]] and the southern tip of [[Honshu]] with the [[Korean peninsula]]. There was still several kilometers of sea to the west of the [[Ryukyu islands]] and most of the [[Sea of Japan]] was open sea due it having a mean depth of {{cvt|1,752|m|ft}}. Comparatively, most of the [[Yellow Sea]] (Yellow Plane) had a [[Semi-arid climate]] (dry steppe), due it being relatively shallow with a mean depth of {{convert|44|m|abbr=on}}. The [[Korean Peninsula]] was [[landlocked]] on the entire west and south side in the Yellow Plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W_Hdu9QrD9YC&amp;pg=PA16|title=Pre-Industrial Korea and Japan in Environmental Perspective|first=Conrad D.|last=Totman|year=2004|accessdate=2007-02-02|isbn=978-9004136267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of formation of the Japan Arc was in the [[Early Miocene]] (23 million years ago).&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"&gt;Kameda Y. &amp; Kato M.

The northern part of the Japanese archipelago was further fragmented until [[orogenesis]] of the northeastern Japanese archipelago began in the [[Late Miocene]]. The orogenesis of the high mountain ranges in northeastern Japan started in the Late Miocene and lasted in the [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; The south part of the Japanese archipelago remained as a relatively large landmass. The land area expanded northward during the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

[[File:Last_Glacial_Maximum_Vegetation_Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Vegetation during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] period 16,000 BCE]]

During the advance of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]] (115,000 BCE till 9682 BCE) the world sea level dropped. This dried and closed the exit straits of the Sea of Japan one by one. The deepest, and thus the last to close, is the western channel of the [[Korea Strait]]. There is controversy as to whether or not the Sea of Japan became a huge cold inland lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s003670000039|title = Last glacial sea-level changes and paleogeography of the Korea (Tsushima) Strait|journal = Geo-Marine Letters|volume = 20|issue = 2|pages = 64–71|year = 2000|last1 = Park|first1 = S.-C|last2 = Yoo|first2 = D.-G|last3 = Lee|first3 = C.-W|last4 = Lee|first4 = E.-I}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japanese archipelago]]'s [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], the [[Ryukyu islands]] and [[Nanpō Islands]] had a [[taiga]] biome (open boreal woodlands). It was characterized by [[coniferous]] [[forests]] consisting mostly of [[pine]]s, [[spruces]] and [[larches]]. [[Hokkaido]], [[Karafuto]] (Sakhalin) and the [[Kuril islands]] had [[mammoth steppe]] biome (steppe-tundra). The vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and willow shrubs.

The [[Sea of Japan]] has a surface area of {{cvt|978000|km2|sqmi}}, a mean depth of {{cvt|1,752|m|ft}} and a maximum depth of {{cvt|3742|m|ft}}. It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from southwest to northeast and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about {{cvt|7600|km|mi}} with the largest part ({{cvt|3240|km|mi|disp=or}}) belonging to Russia.

== Ocean currents ==
[[File:Japan%27s_ocean_currents.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|The ocean currents surrounding the Japanese archipelago: 1. [[Kuroshio Current|Kuroshio]] 2. Kuroshio extension 3. Kuroshio countercurrent 4. [[Tsushima Current]] 5. Tsugaru Current 6. Sōya Current 7. [[Oyashio Current|Oyashio]] 8. Liman Current]]

The [[Japanese archipelago]] is surrounded by 8 ocean currents. These are 1. Kuroshio 2. Kuroshio extension 3. Kuroshio countercurrent 4. Tsushima Current 5. Tsugaru Current 6. Sōya Current 7. Oyashio 8. Liman Current. 

The {{nihongo|'''Kuroshio'''|黒潮|, "くろしお"| "Black Tide"}} is a warm north-flowing [[ocean current]] on the west side of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and along the east coast of [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Honshu]]. It is a strong [[western boundary current]] and part of the North Pacific [[ocean gyre]]. 

The [[Kuroshio Current]] starts in the east coast of [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]] and flows northeastward past Japan, where it merges with the easterly drift of the [[North Pacific Current]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Kuro Siwo |volume=15 |page=953}}&lt;/ref&gt; It transports warm, tropical water northward toward the polar region. The Kuroshio extension is a northward continuation of the Kuroshio Current in the northwestern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Kuroshio countercurrent flows southward to the east of the Kuroshio current in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Philippine Sea]].

The winter spawning [[Japanese Flying Squid]] are associated with the [[Kuroshio Current]]. The eggs and larvae develop during winter in the [[East China Sea]] and the adults travel with minimum energy via the [[Kuroshio Current]] to the rich northern feeding grounds near northwestern Honshu and Hokkaido.&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;Mann, K.H. and J.R.N. Lazier. (2006). ''Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems''. Blackwell Scientific Publications, 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; 

The {{nihongo|'''Tsushima Current'''|対馬海流|Tsushima Kairyū}} is a branch of the [[Kuroshio Current]]. It flows along the west coast of [[Kyushu]] and [[Honshu]] into the [[Sea of Japan]].

The {{nihongo|'''Oyashio'''|親潮||"Parental Tide"}} current is a cold [[subarctic]] [[ocean current]] that flows southward and circulates counterclockwise along the east coast of [[Hokkaido]] and northeastern [[Honshu]] in the western North [[Pacific Ocean]]. The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and flow southward via the [[Bering Sea]], passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].  It collides with the [[Kuroshio Current]] off the eastern shore of [[Japan]] to form the [[North Pacific Current]]. The nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the {{nihongo|parent|親|''oya''}} that provides for and nurtures marine organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter= Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents|date=2001|last=Qiu|first=Bo|title=Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|page=1413–25| publisher=Academic Press | url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/bo/Q01.pdf |quote= The upwelled, nutrient-rich water feeds the Oyashio from the north and leads to its nomenclature, parent (''oya'') stream (''shio'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glattstein|first=Judy|title=Enhance Your Garden with Japanese Plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAhIAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-1-56836-137-6|page=16 |quote=[...] currents whirl around and ascend, and nourish microscopic plankton.

The Liman Current is a southward flowing cold ocean current that flows from the [[Strait of Tartary]] along the [[Asian continent]] in the [[Sea of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www3.pa.hrr.mlit.go.jp/hokurikukankyo/shizen/ryukyo/tsusima.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140308151146/http://www3.pa.hrr.mlit.go.jp/hokurikukankyo/shizen/ryukyo/tsusima.html| title = 海流| publisher = 北陸地方整備局 (Hokuriku Regional Development Bureau)| accessdate = 2014-03-08| archivedate = 2014-03-08| deadurl= yes| date = 2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Tsugaru Current'''|津軽暖流||"Tsugaru Kairyū"}} originates when the [[Tsushima Current]] is divided in two as it flows through the west entrance of the [[Tsugaru Strait]] and along the [[La Perouse Strait]] it becomes the {{nihongo|'''Sōya Current'''|宗谷暖流||"Sōya Kairyū"}} at the north coast of [[Hokkaido]]. The flow rate is 1 to 3 knots. There is a relatively stronger flow in the summer than in the winter.&lt;ref name="milt1"&gt;[http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/KAN1/soudan/kairyu.html 北海道周辺の海流 第一管区海上保安本部]&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants were taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsukimori|first=Osamu|title=Japan nuclear power-free as last reactor shuts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/05/us-nuclear-japan-idUSBRE84405820120505|accessdate=May 8, 2012|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shinzo Abe]]’s government seeks to restart the nuclear power plants that meet strict new safety standards and is emphasizing nuclear energy’s importance as a base-load electricity source.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook"/&gt; {{As of|November 2014}}, two reactors at Sendai are likely to restart in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29947564|title=Japan governor approves Sendai reactor restart|publisher=BBC News|date=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Japan successfully restarted one nuclear reactor at the [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Kagoshima prefecture]], and several other reactors around the country have since resumed operations.

Most regions of Japan, such as much of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, belong to the temperate zone with [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') characterized by four distinct seasons. However, its climate varies from cool [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Dfb'') in the north such as northern Hokkaido, to warm [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Af'') in the south such as [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki]] in the [[Yaeyama Islands]].

=== Climate zones ===

Japan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.

* {{nihongo|[[Hokkaido]]|北海道|Hokkaidō}}: Belonging to the [[humid continental climate]], Hokkaido has long, cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation is not great.
* {{nihongo|[[Sea of Japan]]|日本海|Nihonkai}}: The northwest seasonal wind in winter gives heavy snowfall, which south of [[Tohoku region|Tohoku]] mostly melts before the beginning of spring. In summer it is a little less rainy than the Pacific area but sometimes experiences extreme high temperatures due to the [[foehn wind]] phenomenon.
* {{nihongo|[[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]]|中央高地|Chūō-kōchi}}: A typical inland climate gives large temperature variations between summers and winters and between days and nights. Precipitation is lower than on the coast due to rain shadow effects.
* {{nihongo|[[Seto Inland Sea]]|瀬戸内海|Setonaikai}}: The mountains in the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions block the seasonal winds and bring mild climate and many fine days throughout the year.
* {{nihongo|[[Pacific Ocean]]|太平洋|Taiheiyō}}: The climate varies greatly between the north and the south but generally winters are significantly milder and sunnier than those of the side that faces the Sea of Japan. Summers are hot due to the southeast seasonal wind. Precipitation is very heavy in the south, and heavy in the summer in the north. The climate of the [[Ogasawara Islands|Ogasawara Island]] chain in the Pacific Ocean ranges from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification ''Cfa'') to [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Aw'') with temperatures being warm to hot all year round.
* {{nihongo|[[Ryukyu Islands]]|南西諸島|Nansei-shotō}}: The climate of these islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification ''Cfa'') in the north to tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification ''Af'') in the south with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very high, and is especially affected by the rainy season and typhoons.

=== Temperature and rainfall ===

As an [[island nation]], Japan has the 6th longest coastline in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The length of the coast for the countries of the world |url = http://world.bymap.org/Coastlines.html | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://world.bymap.org/Coastlines.html|title=Coastline Lengths / Countries of the World|website=world.bymap.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few prefectures are landlocked: [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], and [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]]. As [[Mt. Fuji]] and the coastal [[Japanese Alps]] provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds {{convert|900|mm|in|0}} annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where [[Okhotsk Subprefecture]] receives as little as {{convert|750|mm|in|0}} per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures—[[Hokkaido Prefecture|Hokkaido]] and [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]—are composed entirely of islands.

Japan is generally a rainy country with high humidity. Because of its wide range of latitude, seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents, Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24° to 46° north, which is comparable to the range between [[Nova Scotia]] and [[The Bahamas]] in the east coast of [[North America]]. [[Tokyo]] is at about 35 degrees north latitude, comparable to that of [[Tehran]], [[Athens]], or [[Las Vegas]].

Regional climatic variations range from [[humid continental]] in the northern island of [[Hokkaido]] extending down through northern Japan to the [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]], then blending with and eventually changing to a [[humid subtropical climate]] on the Pacific Coast and ultimately reaching [[tropical rainforest climate]] on the Yaeyama Islands of the Ryukyu Islands. Climate also varies dramatically with altitude and with location on the Pacific Ocean or on the Sea of Japan.

Northern Japan has warm summers but long, cold winters with heavy snow. Central Japan in its elevated position, has hot summers and moderate to short winters with some areas having very heavy snow, and southwestern Japan has long hot summer and short mild winters. The generally temperate climate exhibits marked seasonal variation such as the blooming of the spring cherry blossoms, the calls of the summer cicada and fall foliage colors that are celebrated in [[Japanese art|art]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]].

The hottest temperature ever measured in Japan, {{convert|41.1|°C|lk=on}}, occurred in Kumagaya on 23 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201308120105 Kochi Prefecture sees highest temperature ever recorded in Japan - 41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813031959/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201308120105 |date=2013-08-13 }} - [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201308120105 Asahi Shimbun] &lt;/ref&gt; and the coldest was {{convert|-41.0|°C|lk=on}} recorded at Asahikawa, Hokkaidō on 25 January 1902.

=== Summer ===

The climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. These airflows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land. There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month. It is followed by hot, sticky weather. Five or six [[Tropical cyclone|typhoon]]s pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, sometimes resulting in significant damage. Annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] averages between {{convert|1000|and|2500|mm|-1|abbr=on}} except for the areas such as [[Kii Peninsula]] and [[Yakushima Island]] which is Japan's wettest place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Japan Climate Charts Index |url = http://www.climate-charts.com/Countries/Japan.html | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the annual precipitation being one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Yakushima World Heritage property |url = http://www.env.go.jp/nature/isan/worldheritage/en/yakushima/area/index.html | publisher = Ministry of the Environment | accessdate = 2015-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above {{convert|25|mm|in|0}} of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above {{convert|100|mm|in|0}} per month throughout the year.

Mid June to mid July is generally the [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaidō since the seasonal rain front or {{nihongo|''baiu zensen''|梅雨前線|}} dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching [[Hokkaido]]. In [[Okinawa]], the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither everyday nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, [[typhoon]]s, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.

=== Winter ===

In winter, the [[Siberian High]] develops over the Eurasian land mass and the [[Aleutian Low]] develops over the northern Pacific Ocean. The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan, but clear skies to areas fronting on the Pacific.

The warmest winter temperatures are found in the [[Nanpō Islands|Nanpō]] and [[Bonin Islands]], which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian mainland, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24° N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaidō in [[Kushiro Subprefecture|Kushiro]] and [[Nemuro Subprefecture]]s.

=== Sunshine ===

Sunshine, in accordance with Japan’s uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the [[Sichuan Basin]] or [[Taipei]]. Amounts range from about six hours per day in the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kantō Plain to four hours per day on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast of Hokkaidō. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the [[Kuril Islands]] and [[Sakhalin]].

=== Geological hazards ===

==== Earthquakes and tsunami ====
{{see also|List of earthquakes in Japan}}

Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/30226-japan-tectonics-explosive-geology-ring-of-fire-110314.html |title=Japan's Explosive Geology Explained |publisher=Live Science |last=Israel |first=Brett |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the [[List of countries by natural disaster risk|15th highest natural disaster risk]] as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.&lt;ref name="2013 World Risk Report"&gt;[http://www.worldriskreport.com/uploads/media/WorldRiskReport_2013_online_01.pdf 2013 World Risk Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816173655/http://www.worldriskreport.com/uploads/media/WorldRiskReport_2013_online_01.pdf |date=August 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 7 are common. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing slight shaking of buildings. Major earthquakes occur infrequently; the most famous in the twentieth century was the [[great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923, in which 130,000 people died. [[Undersea earthquake]]s also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from {{nihongo|[[tsunami]]s|津波}}. 

Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in [[tsunami]], occur several times each century.&lt;ref name="volcanoes-japan" /&gt; The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|1923 Tokyo earthquake]] killed over 140,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James |first=C.D. |title=The 1923 Tokyo Earthquake and Fire |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/kanto/tokyo1923.pdf |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316050633/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/kanto/tokyo1923.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent major quakes are the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] and the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]], a 9.1-magnitude&lt;ref name="USGS9.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/official20110311054624120_30#executive |title=M 9.1 – near the east coast of Honshu, Japan |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |date=July 11, 2016 |accessdate=August 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011. It triggered a large tsunami and the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], one of the worst disasters in the history of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-tsunami"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fackler|first=Martin; Drew, Kevin|title=Devastation as Tsunami Crashes Into Japan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/world/asia/12japan.html?ref=world|accessdate=March 11, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was the largest ever recorded in Japan and is the world's fourth largest earthquake to strike since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Service. It struck offshore about {{convert|371|km|mi}} northeast of Tokyo and {{convert|130|km|mi}} east of the city of [[Sendai]], and created a massive tsunami that devastated Japan's northeastern coastal areas. At least 100 aftershocks registering a 6.0 magnitude or higher have followed the main shock. At least 15,000 people died as a result.

Reclaimed land and man-made islands are particularly susceptible to liquefaction during an earthquake. As a result, there are specific earthquake resistance standards and ground reform work that applies to all construction in these areas. In an area that was possibly reclaimed in the past, old maps and land condition drawings are checked and drilling is carried out to determine the strength of the ground. However this can be very costly, so for a private residential block of land, a swedish weight sounding test is more common.&lt;ref name="reclaimed-land"/&gt;

Japan has become a world leader in research on causes and prediction of earthquakes. The development of advanced technology has permitted the construction of [[skyscraper]]s even in earthquake-prone areas. Extensive civil defence efforts focus on training in protection against earthquakes, in particular against accompanying fire, which represents the greatest danger.

==== Volcanic eruptions ====
{{see also|List of volcanoes in Japan}}

Japan has 108 active [[volcano]]es. That's 10% of all active volcanoes in the world. Japan has stratovolcanoes near the [[subduction zones]] of the tectonic plates. During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including [[Shōwa-shinzan]] on Hokkaido and [[Myōjin-shō]] off the [[Bayonnaise Rocks]] in the Pacific.&lt;ref name="volcanoes-japan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/japan_tec.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204064754/http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/japan_tec.html |archivedate=February 4, 2007 |title=Tectonics and Volcanoes of Japan |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, Japan's [[Unzen Volcano]] on [[Kyushu]] about {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Nagasaki]], awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new [[lava dome]] at its summit. Beginning in June, repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain's slopes at speeds as high as {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}. [[Unzen Volcano|Unzen]] erupted in 1792 and killed more than 15,000 people. It is the worst volcanic disaster in the country's recorded history.&lt;ref name="dynearth"&gt;{{USGS|source={{cite web|title=Plate tectonics and people|last1=Kious|first1=W. Jacquelyne|last2=Tilling|first2=Robert I.|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/tectonics.html}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mount Fuji]] is a [[Dormant volcano|dormant]] [[stratovolcano]] that last erupted on 16 December 1707 till about 1 January 1708.&lt;ref name=GSJ_active&gt;{{cite web | title=Active Volcanoes of Japan | url=https://gbank.gsj.jp/volcano/Quat_Vol/act_map_e.html| publisher=Geological Survey of Japan |work = AIST | access-date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/221527/Mount-Fuji| title = Mount Fuji | publisher = Britannica Online | access-date = October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji]] didn't have a lava flow, but it did release some {{convert|800|e6m3}} of volcanic ash. It spread over vast areas around the volcano and reached [[Edo]] almost {{convert|100|km|-1}} away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in [[Izu province|Izu]], [[Kai province|Kai]], [[Sagami province|Sagami]], and [[Musashi province|Musashi]] provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834).

=== Meteorological hazards ===

==== Typhoons ====

Another common hazard are several [[typhoon]]s that reach Japan from the Pacific every year. Heavy snowfall during the winter in the [[Snow country (Japan)|snow country]] regions, cause [[landslide]]s, flooding, and [[avalanche]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5210">The territory of [[Vietnam]] is divided into five structural blocks : Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), [[Annamite Range|Truongson]], Kon Tum and Nambo. The NE block is a part of the [[Yangtze Plate|South China plate]], in which [[Stratum|strata]] and [[igneous]] rocks have been found dating from the Early [[Paleozoic]] to the [[Quaternary]]. The NW and Truongson blocks are regarded as NW-SE trending Paleozoic folded systems filled with thick (&gt;12000 m) Paleozoic formations. [[Precambrian]] strata are widespread in the [[Red River Fault]] zone and [[Fansipan]] range in the NW block, and in the Kon Tum block. [[Archean]] rocks are found only in the Kon Tum block, which is regarded as a stable massif without Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The Nambo block is covered with a very thick (&gt;6000 m) sequence of [[Cenozoic]] formations deposited in a continental rift. During the [[Mesozoic]] many such [[graben]] structures were formed and become basins for [[sedimentation]]. Igneous activity in Vietnam is divided into five episodes from the Archean to Quaternary. The most important impediments to the description and interpretation of [[geology]] in Vietnam are lack of reliable radiometric and structural data, and scarcity of good [[outcrop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110000413364 CiNii 論文 - The geology of Vietnam : A brief summary and problems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining==
Vietnam's mineral resources, apart from [[Offshore (hydrocarbons)|offshore]] [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]], include [[phosphate]], [[coal]], [[bauxite]], base and precious metals, and a variety of industrial minerals. More than 5,000 mineral occurrences have been identified. Five broadly-defined metallogenic epochs have been recognised and, in general, the younger the setting the more abundant the deposits. Only a few are hosted by [[Precambrian]] rocks, principally [[iron]], [[gold]] and [[graphite]]. The early to mid-[[Palaeozoic]] contains small deposits of iron ore, [[lead]]&amp;ndash;[[zinc]] and large deposits of [[potash]]. Larger deposits of iron ore, [[ilmenite]], gold, [[nickel]]&amp;ndash;[[copper]] and bauxite were formed during the early [[Carboniferous]]/late [[Triassic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbendi.com/indy/ming/as/vn/p0005.htm Mining in Viet Nam - Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geothermal energy==
In the territory of Vietnam, more than 300 natural [[geothermal]] sources have been recorded and six geothermal regions have been defined: Northwest, Northeast, Bac Bo plan, North central part, South central part, and Southern plain. Vietnam has a remarkable potential for geothermal resources. Especially, Northwestern Vietnam is the most prospective region for geothermal exploration and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/renewable-energy-resources/world/asia/geo-asia/geo-vietnam.shtml Renewable Energy Resources - Library - Index - Global Energy Network Institute - GENI is the highest priority objective of the World Game (R.

However, geothermal energy resources are available not just in one place, but throughout the country. Therefore, most localities can make use of this type of energy." &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.vietnamtourism.com/en/index.php/news/items/2060 Stone plateau may be declared world geological park - Vietnam National Administration of Tourism] Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, update: Sep 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volcanic activity==

Vietnam has 6 volcanoes, [[Bas Đồng Nai]], [[Cu-Lao Re Group]], [[Haut Đồng Nai]], [[Toroeng Prong]], [[Veteran (volcano)|Veteran]] and [[Ile des Cendres]] which had the most recent eruption in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041029073404/http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/region.cfm?rnum=0705 Volcanoes of the Philippines and Southeast Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological parks==

The Dong Van Highlands, encompassing total area of more than 574 square kilometers in [[Hà Giang Province]]'s [[Quản Bạ]], [[Yên Minh]], [[Đồng Văn District|Đồng Văn]] and [[Mèo Vạc District|Mèo Vạc]] districts, could eventually be recognized as a UNESCO Global [[Geopark|Geological Park]].

UNESCO Vietnam has sent an application based on a recent study which concluded that [[limestone]] can be found in 11 layers on 80 percent of the surface of the [[plateau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9925">'''Growing degree days''' (GDD), also called '''growing degree units''' (GDUs), are a [[heuristic]] tool in [[phenology]]. GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by [[horticulture|horticulturists]], [[gardener]]s, and [[farmer]]s to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a [[flower]] will bloom, an insect will emerge from dormancy, or a [[crop]] will reach maturity.

==Introduction==
In the absence of extreme conditions such as unseasonal [[drought]] or disease, plants grow in a cumulative stepwise manner which is strongly influenced by the ambient temperature. Growing degree days take aspects of local [[weather]] into account and allow gardeners to predict (or, in [[greenhouse]]s, even to control) the plants’ pace toward maturity.

Unless stressed by other environmental factors like moisture, the development rate from emergence to maturity for many plants depends upon the daily air temperature. Because many developmental events of plants and insects depend on the accumulation of specific quantities of heat, it is possible to predict when these events should occur during a growing season regardless of differences in temperatures from year to year. Growing degrees (GDs) is defined as the number of temperature degrees above a certain threshold base temperature, which varies among crop species. The base temperature is that temperature below which plant growth is zero. GDs are calculated each day as maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature divided by 2, minus the base temperature. GDUs are accumulated by adding each day’s GDs contribution as the season progresses.

GDUs can be used to: assess the suitability of a region for production of a particular crop; estimate the growth-stages of crops, weeds or even life stages of insects; predict maturity and cutting dates of forage crops; predict best timing of fertilizer or pesticide application; estimate the heat stress on crops; plan spacing of planting dates to produce separate harvest dates. Crop specific indices that employ separate equations for the influence of the daily minimum (nighttime) and the maximum (daytime) temperatures on growth are called crop heat units (CHUs).

==GDD calculation==
GDD are calculated by taking the integral of warmth above a base temperature,&lt;ref name="Prentice1992"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/2845499| issn = 0305-0270| volume = 19| issue = 2| pages = 117–134| last1 = Prentice| first1 = I. Colin| last2 = Cramer| first2 = Wolfgang| last3 = Harrison| first3 = Sandy P.| last4 = Leemans| first4 = Rik| last5 = Monserud| first5 = Robert A.| last6 = Solomon| first6 = Allen M.| title = Special Paper: A Global Biome Model Based on Plant Physiology and Dominance, Soil Properties and Climate| journal = Journal of Biogeography| date = 1992| jstor = 2845499}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; (usually 10&amp;nbsp;°C):

:&lt;math&gt;GDD = \int(T - T_\mathrm{base})dt.&lt;/math&gt;

A simpler, approximately equivalent formulation uses the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures compared to a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;. As an equation:

:&lt;math&gt;GDD = \max{\left(\frac{T_\mathrm{max}+T_\mathrm{min}}{2}-T_\mathrm{base},0\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the mean daily temperature is lower than the base temperature then GDD=0.

GDDs are typically measured from the winter low. Any temperature below ''T''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; is set to ''T''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; before calculating the average. Likewise, the maximum temperature is usually capped at 30&amp;nbsp;°C because most plants and insects do not grow any faster above that temperature. However, some warm temperate and tropical plants do have significant requirements for days above 30&amp;nbsp;°C to mature fruit or seeds.

For example, a day with a high of 23&amp;nbsp;°C and a low of 12&amp;nbsp;°C (and a base of 10&amp;nbsp;°C) would contribute 7.5 GDDs.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{23+12}{2}-10=7.5&lt;/math&gt;

A day with a high of 13&amp;nbsp;°C and a low of 5&amp;nbsp;°C (and a base of 10&amp;nbsp;°C) would contribute 1.5 GDDs. Note that the low temperature of 5&amp;nbsp;°C is clipped to the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; before calculating the average.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{13+10}{2} - 10=1.5&lt;/math&gt;

==Pest control==
[[Insect]] development and growing degree days are also used by some [[farmer]]s and [[horticulturalist]]s to time their use of organic or [[biological pest control]] or other [[pest control]] methods so they are applying the procedure or treatment at the point that the pest is most vulnerable.  For example:
* [[Black cutworm]] larvae have grown large enough to start causing economic damage at 165 GDD
* Azalea Lace Bug emerges at about 130 GDD
* Boxwood leaf miner emerges at about 250 GDD

==Honeybees==
Several [[beekeeper]]s are now researching the correlation between growing degree-days and the lifecycle of a [[honeybee]] colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beeculture.com/phenology-and-its-value-to-beekeepers/ |first=Denise |last=Ellsworth |title=Phenology and its value to beekeepers |website=Bee Culture |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baselines==
10&amp;nbsp;°C is the most common base for GDD calculations, however, the optimal base is often determined experimentally based on the lifecycle of the plant or insect in question.  
* 5.5&amp;nbsp;°C [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[oat]]s, [[flaxseed]], [[lettuce]], [[asparagus]]
* 6&amp;nbsp;°C [[Stalk Borer]]
* 7&amp;nbsp;°C [[Corn rootworm]]
* 8&amp;nbsp;°C [[sunflower]], [[potato]]
* 9&amp;nbsp;°C [[Alfalfa weevil]]
* 10&amp;nbsp;°C [[maize]] (including sweet corn), [[sorghum]], [[rice]], [[soybeans]], [[tomato]], [[Black cutworm]], [[European Corn Borer]], [[Coffee]] (Jaramillo-Robledo &amp; Guzman-Martinez published by [[Cenicafé]]), standard baseline for insect and mite pests of woody plants
* 11&amp;nbsp;°C [[Green Cloverworm]]
* 12&amp;nbsp;°C many other crop calculations &lt;!--specify--&gt;
* 30&amp;nbsp;°C the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] measure heat zones in GDD above 30&amp;nbsp;°C; for many plants this is significant for seed maturation, e.g. [[Phragmites|reed]] (''Phragmites'') requires at least some days reaching this temperature to mature viable seeds

GDDs may be calculated using either Celsius or Fahrenheit, though they must be converted appropriately; for every 9 GDD&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; there are 5 GDD&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, or in conversion calculation:

GDD&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = 5/9 * GDD&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;

In [[physical geography]] and [[geology]] the '''headwall''' of a [[glacier|glacial]] [[cirque (landform)|cirque]] is its highest [[cliff]]. The term has been more broadly used to describe similar geomorphic features of non-glacial origin consisting of a concave depression with convergent slopes typically of 65 percent or greater forming the upper end of a drainage valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fire.ca.gov/resource_mgt/downloads/CGS_THPWorkshopPowerPoint.pdf |title=Timber Harvest Plan Review Workshop |last=California Geological Survey |first= |website= |publisher=State of California |accessdate=6 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[civil engineering]], a headwall is a small [[retaining wall]] placed at the inlet or outlet of a stormwater pipe or [[culvert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgam.info/headwall Local Government &amp; Municipal Knowledge Base]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:HK''' is the entry for [[Hong Kong]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently no ISO 3166-2 codes are defined in the entry for Hong Kong.

Hong Kong, a [[special administrative regions of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] of [[People's Republic of China|China]], is officially assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code {{mono|HK}}. Moreover, it is also assigned the ISO 3166-2 code {{mono|CN-HK}} under the [[ISO 3166-2:CN|entry for China]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6650">'''International Networks''' is the name given by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) to [[List of country calling codes|country calling code]]s +882 and +883, and serves as a catch-all for telephone services not dedicated to a single country. [[Satellite telephone]] carriers, especially those with worldwide service, are allocated within the [[Global Mobile Satellite System]] (GMSS), country code +881, with the exception of non-terrestrial [[Inmarsat]], country code 870.

As in the other such shared country codes, carriers are allocated number space within this code space plus their identification code (two-digit number in 882 code space, three or four digit number in 883 code space). The phone number for a subscriber of such a service will start with '''+882'''/'''+883''' followed by the carrier code.

The cost to call such a number can be high; for example in the [[British Telecom]] price list rates for various 882 and 883 numbers ranged from £0.60 to £4.50 per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bt.com/pricing/current/Call_Charges_boo/0017_d0e5.htm |title=BT Price List |website=BT|date=  |author= |accessdate= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judarn''' is the name of a small lake in [[Bromma]], a western suburb in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  Surrounded by the forest and nature reserve [[Judarskogen]], it stretches between [[Åkeshov]] and [[Södra Ängby]].  Three other lakes are found nearby: [[Kyrksjön]], [[Lillsjön, Ulvsunda|Lillsjön]], and [[Råcksta Träsk]].  The name is [[Etymology|etymologically]] associated to ''ljuda'', the verb "to sound".&lt;ref name="sthlm-county"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
With an area of 74,000 square metres and an average depth of 2.7 metres (maximum 3.7 m), the lake contains 180,000 cubic metres of water and is supplied by a drainage area of 0.8&amp;nbsp;km².  Originally supplying lake [[Lillsjön, Ulvsunda|Lillsjön]], Judarn today discharges into lake [[Mälaren]].  Regarded as one of the least contaminated lakes in Stockholm, Judarn receives [[stormwater|storm water]] from a nearby traffic route which gives it considerable levels of [[lead]] resulting in a bathing ban, metal content otherwise being low and [[phosphorus]] levels moderate.&lt;ref name="Stockholm-vatten-site"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lake, considered as being of great recreational and natural value, is part of the nature reserve [[Judarskogen]] and has a rich flora and fauna with many [[aquatic plant]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[frog]]s.  Its isolated location combined with low levels of [[chlorophyll]] makes Judarn one of the clearest lakes in Stockholm, and notwithstanding low levels of [[oxygen]] nutrient content is low even during winters, with raised levels of [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] in deep sediments.&lt;ref name="Stockholm-vatten-pdf"&gt;{{cite web

== Geology ==
Geological traces of the [[ice sheet|inland ice]] which withdrew from the area some 11,000 years ago are found in the [[moraine]]s around the lake.  The huge square blocks of stone scattered in the area are the result of the earthquakes produced by the tension caused by the retiring ice.  The geologist [[Gerhard de Geer]] studied the surrounding moraine ridges, which were eventually given his name, and geological excursions are still common in the area.&lt;ref name="sthlm-county" /&gt;

== Flora ==
The flora in the lake itself is reduced to a few species, including [[Nymphaea alba|White Waterlily]], [[Utricularia vulgaris|Common Bladderwort]], and [[Myriophyllum verticillatum|Whorled Water-Milfoil]]; while others plants are found along the beaches, including [[Typha angustifolia|Narrow Leaf Cattail]], [[Carex acuta|Slender Tufted-sedge]], [[Carex riparia|Greater Pond-sedge]], [[Comarum palustre|Marsh Cinquefoil]], [[Lycopus europaeus|Gypsywort]], [[Lysimachia vulgaris|Yellow loosestrife]], [[Lythrum salicaria|Purple Loosestrife]], and [[Mentha arvensis|Corn Mint]].  An isolated [[biotope]] of [[Ranunculus lingua|Greater Spearwort]] is found on the southern end of the lake.  Among surrounding trees and bushes can be found [[Alnus glutinosa|Black Alder]], [[Rhamnus frangula|Buckthorn]], [[Salix cinerea|Grey Willow]], and [[Salix pentandra|Bay Willow]].&lt;ref name="Stockholm-vatten-pdf" /&gt;

== Fauna ==
The fauna is dominated by [[Gastropod]]s, [[Trichoptera|Caddisflies]] and [[Odonata|dragonflies]].  Fishes present in the lake include [[Perch]], [[Rutilus|Roach]], and [[Crucian carp]].  [[Common carp|Mirror Carp]] and [[Signal crayfish]] have been introduced in the lake, the crayfish forming a population allowing fishing.&lt;ref name="Stockholm-vatten-pdf" /&gt;  A population of [[Great Crested Newt]] has now vanished, but the City of Stockholm is planning to reintroduce them by constructing dams and ponds to recreate their natural habitat.&lt;ref name="sthlm-county" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sthlm-se-salamander"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Piketty top decile share national income en.png|thumb|319x319px|A measure of income inequality: top decile share in the US national income, 1910-2010.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Table TI.1 of the [http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/capital21c2 supplement] to Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Piketty|Piketty]] argues that Kuznets mistook the 1930-1950 decrease in inequality for the endpoint of its development. Since 1950, inequality has again reached pre-WW II levels. Similar trends are visible in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capital in the Twenty-First Century|last=Piketty|first=Thomas|publisher=Belknap|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[economics]], a '''Kuznets curve''' graphs the hypothesis that as an economy [[economic development|develops]], [[market forces]] first increase and then decrease [[economic inequality]]. The hypothesis was first advanced by  economist [[Simon Kuznets]] in the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/kuznets.htm Kuznets profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918075800/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/kuznets.htm |date=18 September 2009 }} at [[New School for Social Research]]: "...his discovery of the inverted U-shaped relation between income inequality and economic growth..."&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of such a progression suggests that early in [[economic development|development]], investment opportunities for those who have money multiply, while an influx of cheap rural labor to the cities holds down wages.  Whereas in mature economies, [[human capital]] accrual (an estimate of cost that has been incurred but not yet paid) takes the place of physical capital accrual as the main source of growth; and inequality slows growth by lowering education levels because poorer, disadvantaged people lack finance for their education in imperfect credit-markets.

The Kuznets curve implies that as a [[nation]] undergoes [[industrialization]] – and especially the mechanization of agriculture – the center of the nation’s economy will shift to the cities. As [[internal migration]] by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase. Inequality is then expected to decrease when a certain level of average income is reached and the processes of industrialization – democratization and the rise of the welfare state – allow for the benefits from rapid [[Economic growth|growth]], and increase the per-capita income. Kuznets believed that inequality would follow an inverted “U” shape as it rises and then falls again with the increase of income per-capita.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 587–607"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=James|title=Global inequality and global macroeconomics|journal=Journal of Policy Modeling|date=2007|volume=29|issue=4|pages=587–607|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893807000452|accessdate=2 February 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jpolmod.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuznets curve diagrams show an inverted U curve, although variables along the axes are often mixed and matched, with inequality or the [[Gini coefficient]] on the Y axis and economic development, time or per-capita incomes on the X axis. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Since 1991 the '''environmental Kuznets curve''' ('''EKC''') has become a standard feature in the technical literature of [[environmental policy]],&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"/&gt; though its application there has been strongly contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Roberts, J.T.  |author2=Thanos, N.D. | title = Trouble in Paradise: Globalization and Environmental Crises in Latin America | page = xiv | year = 2003 | publisher = Routledge: London &amp; New York
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kuznets ratio==
The '''Kuznets ratio''' is a measurement of the ratio of income going to the highest-earning households (usually defined by the upper 20%) and the income going to the lowest-earning households,&lt;ref name="Kuznets, Simon 1955"&gt;Kuznets, Simon. 1955. Economic Growth and Income Inequality. ''American Economic Review'' 45 (March): 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly measured by either the lowest 20% or lowest 40% of income. Comparing 20% to 20%, perfect equality is expressed as 1; 20% to 40% changes this value to 0.5.

Kuznets had two similar explanations for this historical phenomenon:
# workers migrated from agriculture to industry; and
# rural workers moved to urban jobs.
In both explanations, inequality will decrease after 50% of the shift force switches over to the higher paying sector.&lt;ref name="Kuznets, Simon 1955"/&gt;

==Criticisms==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Economics --&gt;

Critics of the Kuznets curve theory argue that its U-shape comes not from progression in the development of individual countries, but rather from historical differences between countries. For instance, many of the middle income countries used in Kuznets' data set were in Latin America, a region with historically high levels of inequality. When controlling for this variable, the U-shape of the curve tends to disappear (e.g. Deininger and Squire, 1998). Regarding the empirical evidence, based on large panels of countries or time series approaches, Fields (2001) considers the Kuznets hypothesis refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fields G |year=2001 |title=Distribution and Development, A New Look at the Developing World |publisher=Russel Sage Foundation, New York, and The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Asian miracle''' has been used to criticize the validity of the Kuznets curve theory. The rapid economic growth of eight East Asian countries—Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore ([[Four Asian Tigers]]), Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia—between 1965 and 1990, was called the East Asian miracle (EAM). Manufacturing and export grew quickly and powerfully. Yet simultaneously, life expectancy was found to increase and population levels living in absolute poverty decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=(course lectures)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development process was contrary to the Kuznets curve theory. Many studies have been done to identify how the EAM was able to ensure that the benefits of rapid economic growth were distributed broadly among the population, because Kuznets’ theory stated that rapid capital accumulation would lead to an initial increase in inequality.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1996 151–177"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|title=Some Lessons From The East Asian Miracle|journal=The World Bank Research Observer|date=August 1996|volume=11|issue=2|pages=151–177|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.2.151|url=http://wbro.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/151.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues the East Asian experience of an intensive and successful economic development process along with an immediate decrease in population inequality can be explained by the immediate re-investment of initial benefits into land reform (increasing rural productivity, income, and savings), universal education (providing greater equality and what Stiglitz calls an “intellectual infrastructure” for productivity&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1996 151–177"/&gt; ), and industrial policies that distributed income more equally through high and increasing wages and limited the price increases of commodities. These factors increased the average citizen’s ability to consume and invest within the economy, further contributing to economic growth. Stiglitz highlights that the high rates of growth provided the resources to promote equality, which acted as a positive-feedback loop to support the high rates of growth. The EAM defies the Kuznets curve, which insists growth produces inequality, and that inequality is a necessity for overall growth.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 587–607"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1996 151–177"/&gt;

[[Cambridge University]] Lecturer Gabriel Palma recently found no evidence for a ‘Kuznets curve’ in inequality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he statistical evidence for the ‘upwards’ side of the 'Inverted-U' between inequality and income per capita seems to have vanished, as many low and low-middle income countries now have a distribution of income similar to that of most middle-income countries (other than those of Latin America and Southern Africa). That is, half of Sub-Saharan Africa and many countries in Asian, including India, China and Vietnam, now have an income distribution similar to that found in North Africa, the Caribbean and the second-tier NICs. And this level is also similar to that of half of the first-tier NICs, the Mediterranean EU and the Anglophone OECD (excluding the US). As a result, about 80% of the world population now live in countries with a Gini around 40."&lt;ref name=Palma&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/cam/camdae/1111.html Palma, Gabriel. "Homogeneous middles vs. heterogeneous tails, and the end of the ‘Inverted-U’: the share of the rich is what it's all about."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Palma goes on to note that, among middle-income countries, only those in Latin America and Southern Africa live in an inequality league of their own. Instead of a Kuznets curve, he breaks income inequality into deciles which contain 10% of the population relating to income inequality. Palma then shows that there are two distributional trends taking place in inequality within a country:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One is ‘centrifugal’, and takes place at the two tails of the distribution—leading to an increased diversity across country in the shares appropriated by the top 10 percent and bottom forty percent. The other is ‘centripetal’, and takes place in the middle—leading to a remarkable uniformity across countries in the share of income going to the half of the population located between deciles 5 to 9."&lt;ref name=Palma /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, it is the share of the richest 10% of the population that affects the share of the poorest 40% of the population with the middle to upper-middle staying the same across all countries.

==Kuznets' own caveats==
In a biography about Simon Kuznets' scientific methods, economist [[Robert Fogel]] noted Kuznets' own reservations about the "fragility of the data" which underpinned the hypothesis. Fogel notes that most of Kuznets' paper was devoted to explicating the conflicting factors at play. Fogel emphasized Kuznets' opinion that "even if the data turned out to be valid, they pertained to an extremely limited period of time and to exceptional historical experiences." Fogel noted that despite these "repeated warnings", Kuznets' caveats were overlooked, and the Kuznets curve was "raised to the level of law" by other economists.&lt;ref name=Fogel-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogel|first1=Robert W.|title=Some Notes on the Scientific Methods of Simon Kuznets|date=December 1987|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|pages=26–7|doi=10.3386/w2461|ref=Fogel-1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inequality and trade liberalization ==
Dobson and Ramlogan’s research looked to identify the relationship between inequality and trade liberalization. There have been mixed findings with this idea – some developing countries have experienced greater inequality, less inequality, or no difference at all, due to trade liberalization. Because of this, Dobson and Ramlogan suggest that perhaps trade openness can be related to inequality through a Kuznets curve framework.&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobson|first=Stephen|author2=Carlyn Ramlogan |title=Is There An Openness Kuznets Curve?|journal=Kyklos|date=April 2009|volume=62|issue=2|pages=226–238|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00433.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph measures trade openness along the x-axis and inequality along the y-axis. Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by the ratio of exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary school enrolment rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization.&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"/&gt; By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented trade liberalization policies in the past 30 years, the Kuznets curve seems to apply to the relationship between trade liberalization and inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient).&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"/&gt; However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to trade liberalization, Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality.&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"/&gt;

== Environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmental_Kuznets_Curve.png|thumb|Hypothetical environmental Kuznets curve: a translation of the Kuznets curve to the use of natural resources.|alt=]]
The environmental Kuznets curve is a hypothesized relationship between environmental quality and economic development: various indicators of environmental degradation tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point over the course of development.&lt;ref&gt;Shafik, Nemat. 1994. Economic development and environmental quality: an econometric analysis. ''Oxford Economic Papers'' 46 (October): 757–773&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Gene Grossman|Grossman]]|first=G. M. |first2=A. B. |last2=[[Alan B.

Although the subject of continuing debate, there is considerable evidence to support the application of environmental Kuznets curve for various environmental health indicators, such as [[Water pollution|water]] and air pollution, which show the inverted U-shaped curve as per capita income and/or GDP rise .&lt;ref name=RIG&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/the-richer-is-greener-curve/ |title=The Richer-Is-Greener Curve |author=[[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] |work=New York Times |date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=As has been noted, this is a very controversial topic.

For example, between 1970 and 2006, the United States' inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 195%, the number of cars and trucks in the country more than doubled, and the total number of miles driven increased by 178%. However, during that same period certain regulatory changes and technological innovations led to decreases in annual emissions of carbon monoxide from 197 million tons to 89 million, nitrogen oxides emissions from 27 million tons to 19 million, sulfur dioxide emissions from 31 million tons to 15 million, particulate emissions by 80%, and lead emissions by more than 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pdupont/?id=110008416 |title=Don't Be Very Worried |publisher=The Wall St. Journal |date=23 May 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615222424/http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pdupont/?id=110008416 |archivedate=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deforestation]] may follow a Kuznets curve (cf. [[forest transition]] curve). Among countries with a per capita GDP of at least $4,600, net deforestation has ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17574.short Returning forests analyzed with the forest identity], 2006, by Pekka E.

Mather (Department of Geography and Environment, University of Aberdeen), Roger A. Sedjo (Resources for the Future), and Paul E. Waggoner (Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it has been argued that wealthier countries are able to maintain forests along with high consumption by ‘exporting’ deforestation.&lt;ref name="Outsourcing Deforestation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing countries often outsource deforestation, study finds|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2010/november/woods-outsource-deforestation-112410.html|website=Stanford News|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
However, the applicability of the EKC is debatable when it comes to other pollutants, some natural resource use, and biodiversity conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mills JH, Waite TA |year=2009 |title=Economic prosperity, biodiversity conservation, and the environmental Kuznets curve |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=2087–2095 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, energy, land and resource use (sometimes called the "[[ecological footprint]]") may not fall with rising income.&lt;ref name="US Energy Consumption 1960-2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Public Data US Energy|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=djha77o4u941j_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=consumption&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=state&amp;ifdim=state&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=-285267600000&amp;tend=1261033200000|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ratio of energy ''per [[real GDP]]'' has fallen, ''total'' energy use is still rising in most developed countries as are ''total'' emission of many [[greenhouse gases]]. Additionally, the status of many key "[[ecosystem services]]" provided by ecosystems, such as freshwater provision (Perman, ''et al''., 2003), soil fertility,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and fisheries,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} have continued to decline in developed countries. Proponents of the EKC argue that this varied relationship does not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis, but instead that the applicability of the Kuznets curves to various environmental indicators may differ when considering different ecosystems, economics, regulatory schemes, and technologies.

At least one critic argues that the US is still struggling to attain the income level necessary to prioritize certain environmental pollutants such as carbon emissions, which have yet to follow the EKC.&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Yandle B, Vijayaraghavan M, Bhattarai M |url=http://www.perc.org/articles/article688.php |title=The Environmental Kuznets Curve: A Primer |year=2002 |publisher=The Property and Environment Research Center |accessdate=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yandle ''et al.'' argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a [[tragedy of the commons]] where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"/&gt; However, there seems to be little consensus about whether EKC is formed with regard to CO2 emissions, as CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; is a global pollutant that has yet to prove its validity within Kuznet's Curve.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-4-431-55921-4|title=Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis and Carbon Dioxide Emissions - Springer|last=Uchiyama|first=Katsuhisa|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55921-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Yandle ''et al.'' also concluded that "policies that stimulate growth ([[trade liberalization]], [[economic restructuring]], and [[price reform]]) should be good for the environment".&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"/&gt;

Other critics points out that researchers also disagree about the shape of the curve when longer-term time scales are evaluated. For example, Millimet and Stengos regard the traditional "inverse U" shape as actually being an "N" shape, indicating that pollution increases as a country develops, decreases once the threshold GDP is reached, and then begins increasing as national income continues to increase.  While such findings are still being debated, it could prove to be important because it poses the concerning question of whether pollution actually begins to decline for good when an economic threshold is reached or whether the decrease is only in local pollutants and pollution is simply exported to poorer developing countries.  Levinson concludes that the environmental Kuznets curve is insufficient to support a pollution policy regardless whether it is [[laissez-faire]] or [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], although the literature has been used this way by the press.&lt;ref name="Levinson2000"&gt;{{cite web |author=Arik Levinson |citeseerx = 10.1.1.92.2062 |title=The Ups and Downs of the Environmental Kuznets Curve |year=2000 |accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=[[Georgetown University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrow ''et al.'' argue pollution-income progression of agrarian communities (clean) to industrial economies (pollution intensive) to service economies (cleaner) would appear to be false if pollution increases again at the end due to higher levels of income and consumption of the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Arrow K, Bolin B, Costanza R, Dasgupta P, Folke C, Holling CS, etal |year=1995 |title=Economic growth, carrying capacity, and the environment |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=91–95 |doi=10.1016/0921-8009(95)00059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty with this model is that it lacks predictive power because it is highly uncertain how the next phase of economic development will be characterized. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Suri and Chapman argue that the EKC is not applicable on the global scale, as a net pollution reduction may not actually be occurring globally. Wealthy nations have a trend of exporting the activities that create the most pollution, like manufacturing of clothing and furniture, to poorer nations that are still in the process of industrial development (Suri and Chapman, 1998). This could mean that as the world's poor nations develop, they will have nowhere to export their pollution. Thus, this progression of environmental clean-up occurring in conjunction with economic growth cannot be replicated indefinitely because there may be nowhere to export waste and pollution-intensive processes. However, [[Gene Grossman]] and [[Alan B. Krueger]], the authors who initially made the correlation between economic growth, environmental clean-up, and the Kuznets curve, conclude that there is "no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth."&lt;ref name="Levinson2000"/&gt; 

Stern warns "it is very easy to do bad [[econometrics]]", and says "the history of the EKC exemplifies what can go wrong". He finds that "little or no attention has been paid to the statistical properties of the data used such as serial dependence or stochastic trends in time series and few tests of model adequacy have been carried out or presented. However, one of the main purposes of doing econometrics is to test which [[Correlation does not imply causation|apparent relationships]] ... are valid and which are spurious [[correlation]]s". He states his unequivocal finding: "When we do take such statistics into account and use appropriate techniques we find that the EKC does not exist (Perman and Stern 2003). Instead, we get a more realistic view of the effect of economic growth and technological changes on environmental quality. It seems that most indicators of environmental degradation are monotonically rising in income though the '[[income elasticity]]' is less than one and is not a simple function of income alone. Time related effects reduce environmental impacts in countries at all levels of income. However, in rapidly growing middle income countries the scale effect, which increases pollution and other degradation, overwhelms the time effect. In wealthy countries, growth is slower, and pollution reduction efforts can overcome the scale effect. This is the origin of the apparent EKC effect".&lt;ref name = "Stern 2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=David I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3201">This is a '''list of Ghanaian [[Regions of Ghana|regions]] by population''', ranked according to the latest census, which took place on 26 September 2010. Past census data (1960, 1970, 1984, and 2000) is included for comparison. 

(Note: The current boundaries of Ghana's administrative regions were not fully established until 1983. As such, population figures for 1960 and 1970 reflect the analysis of subregional census data from those periods.)

This is a list of '''Ambassadors of the United States to [[Malta]]'''. Initially a part of the [[British Empire]], Malta was granted full independence as the [[State of Malta]] on September 21, 1964. The United States [[diplomatic recognition|recognized]] the new nation and established full [[diplomatic relations]] after its independence, and retained relations after Malta became a republic in 1974. [[Harrison Lewis]] was appointed as the first American diplomat in Malta as ''Chargé d'Affaires ad interim'' until an [[Ambassador of the United States|ambassador]] could be commissioned.

==Embassy==

The Embassy of the United States in Malta was first established in the capital [[Valletta]], on September 21, 1964. It eventually moved to [[Sliema]], and in 1974 it moved again to [[Floriana]], a suburb of the Maltese capital.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; On 4 July 2011, the embassy was moved once again to a larger complex in [[Ta' Qali]] National Park in [[Attard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zammit|first1=Rosanne|title=US embassy completed at Ta' Qali – no word on new ambassador|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110629/local/heralding-a-new-era-in-malta-us-relations.372864|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=29 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524150536/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110629/local/heralding-a-new-era-in-malta-us-relations.372864|archivedate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The embassy's website still lists its location as "Valletta".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy &amp; History|url=https://mt.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/|website=U.S. Embassy in Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515135706/https://mt.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/|archivedate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Glacier|List of glaciers}}
Africa, specifically [[East Africa]], has contained [[cryosphere|glacial]] regions, possibly as far back as the [[Quaternary glaciation#Description|last glacial maximum]] 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. Seasonal snow does exist on the highest peaks of East Africa as well as in the [[Drakensberg Range]] of South Africa, the [[Stormberg Mountains]], and the [[Atlas Mountains]] in Morocco. Currently, the only remaining glaciers on the continent exist on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], [[Mount Kenya]], and the [[Rwenzori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iccinet.org/east-african-highlands |title=East African Highlands &amp;#124; ICCI – International Cryosphere Climate Initiative |publisher=Iccinet.org |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LoJack''', also known as the '''LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System''' (LoJack SVR), is a stolen vehicle recovery system that is integrated with law enforcement, enabling vehicles and equipment to be tracked and recovered by police. The system uses a hidden mounted transceiver, and a tracking computer installed in police cars and aircraft, operating on a dedicated tracking frequency set aside by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name=twice1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twice.com/industry/lojack-founder-william-reagan-78-passes-away-7983 |title=LoJack Founder William Reagan, 78, Passes Away|website=twice.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system combines recovery technology from LoJack, with [[telematics]] products and services from parent company [[CalAmp]].

==History==
The LoJack system was created and patented in 1979 by William Reagan, who went on to found LoJack Corporation. The name "LoJack" was coined to be the "antithesis of [[Carjacking|hijack]]", wherein "hijack" refers to the theft of a vehicle through force.&lt;ref name=twice1/&gt; 

==Functionality==
The core of the LoJack system is a small, silent [[radio transceiver]] that is discreetly installed in a vehicle.  The vehicle is not marked as possessing a LoJack transceiver, and the location of the transceiver within the vehicle varies from one car to the next. Once installed, the unit and the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number|VIN]] are registered in a [[database]] that interfaces with the [[National Crime Information Center]] (NCIC) system used by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies throughout the [[United States|U.S]].  In the event of a theft, a customer reports the incident to the police, who make a routine entry into the state police crime computer, including the stolen vehicle's VIN.  This theft report is automatically processed by LoJack network computers, triggering a remote command to the specific LoJack unit in the stolen vehicle.&lt;ref name=lifewire1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lojack-534878 |title=What is LoJack, and How Does It Work?  |website=lifewire.com |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The command activates the LoJack unit to start sending out signals to LoJack police tracking computers on board some police cars. Every police car so equipped, that is within a 3–5 mile radius of the signal source, will be alerted. The tracking units will display an [[alphanumeric]] reply code and an indication of the approximate direction and distance to the stolen vehicle. Based on the reply code, the police can obtain a physical description of the vehicle, including make ([[brand]]), model, color, VIN and [[license plate]] number. Police aircraft can also be equipped with tracking computers; airborne units can receive the ([[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]]) signals from further away than ground-based units.  The signal is received in equipped police vehicles utilizing a phased array antenna system, hence the four distinctive antennas on the roof. This provides the directional location tracking capabilities of the system.&lt;ref name=lifewire1/&gt;

In addition to automobile theft recovery, LoJack systems are used to recover stolen construction equipment and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forconstructionpros.com/construction-technology/equipment-monitoring-logistics/news/12275748/lojack-2015-construction-equipment-theft-study-reveals-trends-in-heavy-equipment-theft |title=LoJack 2015 Construction Equipment Theft Study Reveals Trends in Heavy Equipment Theft|website=forconstructionpros.com |date=2016-11-02 |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cycleworld.com/2013/01/10/lojacks-top-theft-recovery-stories-of-2012 |title=LoJack’s Top Theft Recovery Stories of 2012|website=cycleworld.com |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency===
LoJack transmits on a [[radio]] ([[Radio frequency|RF]]) [[carrier wave|carrier frequency]] of 173.075&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]]. Vehicles with the system installed send a 200&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]] (ms) chirp every fifteen seconds on this frequency. When being tracked after reported stolen, the devices send out a 200&amp;nbsp;ms signal once per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5708">In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] the smallest administrative unit is the [[municipality]] ("''opština''/општина" or "''općina''/опћина" in the official languages and scripts of the country). Prior to the 1992–95 [[Bosnian War]] there were 109 municipalities in what was then [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Ten of these formed the area of the capital [[Sarajevo]]. 

After the war the number of municipalities was increased to 143, grouped in the following way:
*79 municipalities constitute the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH), which comprises 51% of the country's total territory. The municipalities within the Federation are grouped into [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ten cantons]].
*64 municipalities constitute the [[Republika Srpska]] (RS), which comprises 49% of the country's total territory.

In addition, [[Brčko District]] does not belong to either entity and is governed as a condominium of both FBiH and RS entities. The district corresponds to the pre-war Brčko municipality. Although technically not called a municipality, it is treated as such for statistic purposes.

Administratively each municipality has a municipality council and a municipality head, and they usually consist of an [[urban area]] with the surrounding villages and rural areas around it. Bosnia and Herzegovina also has twelve officially designated cities - [[Banja Luka]], [[Bihać]], [[Tuzla]], [[Mostar]], [[Zenica]], [[Doboj]], [[Prijedor]], [[Bijeljina]], [[Trebinje]] and [[Široki Brijeg]] each correspond to a single eponymous municipality. The cities of [[Sarajevo]] and [[Istočno Sarajevo]] consist of four and six municipalities respectively, which roughly correspond to the ten pre-war municipalities which constituted the capital city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">In [[Religion in Fiji#Ancient_religion | pre-Christian Fijian mythology]], '''Murimuria''' is part of the [[underworld]]. After a man dies, his soul is judged by the god called [[Degei]]. Those who had the favor of Degei are instructed not to try to cross the lake. These go to [[Burotu]]. The rest inevitably try cross the lake by a boat that always capsizes. They eventually sink to the bottom, Murimuria, and are rewarded and punished appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mackenzie |first1=Donald Alexander |title=Myths from Melanesia and Indonesia |date=1930 |publisher=Gresham Publishing Company |location=London |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murimuria is considered a place neither of happiness, nor of unhappiness. As such, residence in Murimuria is characterized by both punishment and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Thomas |last2=Calvert |first2=James |title=Fiji and the Fijians |date=1870 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |page=208 |edition=3rd |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the souls in Murimuria are punished for sins committed while alive. However, these sins do not necessarily correspond to [[Christian views on sin | Christian notions of sin]]. For example, those who did not kill in life are forced to pound muck with clubs. Those who did not have their ears pierced are forced to carry upon their shoulders large logs of wood upon which [[tapa cloth]] is beaten out. Women who were not tattooed are chased by ghosts who use sharp shells to tear at their skin. Anyone who has done an act which displeases the gods are laid prone and turned into beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frazer |first1=Sir James George |title=The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=466 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated as the [[Inuvialuktun]] word for a small hill. The plural form is "pingos". The term is also used for depressions, often water filled, formed by the melting of ice at the end of the last glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1003780.pdf|title=East Harling Common SSSI|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pingo is a [[periglacial]] landform, which is defined as a nonglacial landform or process linked to colder climates.
"Periglacial" suggests an environment located on the margin of past glaciers. However, freeze and thaw cycles influence landscapes outside areas of past glaciation. Therefore, periglacial environments are anywhere that freezing and thawing modify the landscape in a significant manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pidwirny|first=M|title=Periglacial Processes and Landforms|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/10ag.html|work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;    They are essentially formed by ground ice which develops during the winter months as temperatures fall.&lt;ref name=vinck&gt;[https://www.uregina.ca/geology/People/Dale/Student%20presentations/pingos.ppt Pingos Jennifer Vinck, Geology 495, University of Regina, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.tu-freiberg.de/studenten/Baikal_2004/baikalexcursion/hydrogeology/overview/hydrolaccolith.HTM Hydrogeology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/pages/education/alevel/coldenvirons/Lesson%2020.htm Periglacial Landforms 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106030702/http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/pages/education/alevel/coldenvirons/Lesson%2020.htm |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
{{Main|Permafrost}}
[[File:1-Steenwijk - De Eese - Pingo-001.JPG|thumb|Former Pingo, De Eese estate, [[Steenwijk]], Netherlands. Pingo ponds can be hard to distinguish from [[kettle lake]]s. ]]
Pingos can only form in a permafrost environment. Evidence of collapsed pingos in an area suggests that there was once permafrost.

Hydrostatic (closed-system) pingos form as a result of [[Fluid statics#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] on water from permafrost, and commonly form in drained lakes or river channels. Permafrost rises to the drained body's former floor. Pore water is expelled in front of the rising permafrost, and the resulting pressure causes the frozen ground to rise and an ice core to form. The shape and size of a hydrostatic or closed system pingo is often similar to the body of water that it originated from. They can vary from symmetrical conical domes to asymmetric, elongate hills.

Hydraulic (open-system) pingos result from groundwater flowing from an outside source, i.e. subpermafrost or intrapermafrost [[aquifer]]s. Hydrostatic pressure initializes the formation of the ice core as water is pushed up and subsequently freezes. Open-system pingos have no limitations to the amount of water available unless the aquifers freeze. They often occur at the base of slopes and are commonly known as Greenland type. The [[groundwater]] is put under [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] pressure and forces the ground up as it makes an expanding ice core. It is not the [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] pressure itself that forces the ground up, but rather the ice core that is being fed the water from the aquifer. These are often formed in a thin, discontinuous permafrost. These conditions allow an ice core to form, but also provide it with a supply of artesian ground water. If water pressure entering an artesian pingo is strong enough, it can lift the pingo up allowing a sub-pingo water lens to form underneath.  However, if the water lens starts to leak water it can cause subsidence which can compromise the structure.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackay|first=Ross|title=Pingos of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula Area, Northwest Territories|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/gpq/1979/v33/n1/1000322ar.html|publisher=Department of Geography University of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These pingos are often oval or oblong shaped. It is still not entirely understood why open system or hydraulic pingos normally occur in unglaciated terrain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Pingos usually grow only a couple centimetres per year, with Ibyuk Pingo growing at a rate of {{convert|2|cm}} a year,&lt;ref name=pcl/&gt; and the largest take decades or even centuries to form. The process that creates pingos is believed to be closely related to [[frost heaving]].  The base of the pingo tends to reach its maximum diameter in its early youth. This means pingos tend to grow higher rather than growing in diameter and height at the same time.&lt;ref name="Mackay"/&gt;

==Locations==
[[Tuktoyaktuk]] in the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] has one of the highest concentrations of pingos, with some 1,350 examples. [[Pingo National Landmark]] protects eight of these features.&lt;ref name=pcl&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/v-g/pingo/index_e.asp Pingo Canadian Landmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603210903/http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/v-g/pingo/index_e.asp |date=2007-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alaska]] is home to the [[Kadleroshilik Pingo]], the highest known pingo in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mackay |first=J.

Other places with pingos include [[Nunavut]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic38-3-244.pdf A Pingo in the Mala River Valley, Baffin Island,   Northwest  Territories, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yukon]] in [[Canada]], [[Greenland]], [[Siberia]], and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] island of [[Spitsbergen]].&lt;ref name="vinck"/&gt; Recent estimates indicate that more than 11,000 pingos exist on Earth, with more than 6,000 alone in northern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grosse, G. |author2=Jones, B.M. |title=Spatial distribution of pingos in northern Asia |journal=The Cryosphere |volume=5 |pages=13–33 |year=2011 |doi=10.5194/tc-5-13-2011 |url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/5/13/2011/tc-5-13-2011.html|bibcode = 2011TCry....5...13G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some old pingo holes can be found in [[Norfolk]], [[England]] (in the [[Breckland]]) and in the [[Netherlands]], in [[Dantumadeel]] and [[Opsterland]] in the province of [[Friesland]], and also in the provinces of [[Drenthe]]&lt;ref name=Lanting&gt;[http://ivem.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/ivempubs/dvrapp/EES-2009/EES-2009-85M/?pLanguage=nl A.H.

==Types==
===Land===
Rounded tops are common for smaller pingos, but larger ones often have breaks in the ice at the top. These larger pingos can have craters that have cones resembling those of [[volcano]]es. This is due to the ice breaking and to melting of the inner ice core. Beds will often dip outward from the center when they occur in stratified sand or silt, a lot like being adjacent to an intrusive body. Pingos that form in [[bedrock]] can show similar deformation. The ice in the core of pingos usually originates from segregation or injection of fluid water, and can be massive. Tension fractures are normal for the mound's summit, but pingo ice expansion is brief and rare. A small freshwater lake can occupy the summit where a crater has formed from the ice melting.

Pingos are generally classified as [[Fluid pressure|hydrostatic]] (closed-system) or hydraulic (open-system).  Relict hydrostatic (closed-system) and hydraulic (open-system) pingos may be distinguished from each other by determining whether lacustrine (lake) deposits are associated with the formation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  Pingos in northern  Alaska and  northwestern Canada have been found to form in two different environments.  Pingos that form on slopes are usually small, irregularly shaped, and fractured at the top. These usually form because of sub-surface hydraulic  pressure. Pingos in these areas also form in the more common way, on flat ground in old lake basins when the water is too shallow to prevent permafrost. These structures tend to be much larger than the pingos that form on slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=William|title=Pingos in Central Alaska|url=http://akmid.akgeology.info/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b1241h.PDF|publisher=United States Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean===
{{main|Gas hydrate pingo}}
So called [[Methane hydrate|gas hydrate]] pingos, have been discovered in the Arctic oceans [[Barents sea]], extending in width up to 500 meters. Methane is bubbling from these dome like structures, with some of these gas flares extending close to the sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-06-domes-frozen-methane-blow-outs.html|title=Domes of frozen methane may be warning signs for new blow-outs|publisher=Phys.org|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''pingo'' was first borrowed from the [[Inuvialuit]] by the Arctic botanist [[Erling Porsild|Alf Erling Porsild]] in 1938. Porsild Pingo in Tuktoyaktuk is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic41-4-267.pdf The Birth and Growth of Porsild 1  Pingo, Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, District of Mackenzie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Royal School of Military Survey (DCI RSMS)''' is a [[British Armed Forces|joint services]] [[Surveying|survey]] training facility associated with the Corps of [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) but attached to the United Kingdom [[Defence Intelligence and Security Centre]] (DISC).

==History==
The Royal School of Military Survey (RSMS) originates from 1833 when it was established at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] as a survey training branch. After a period of stability the school moved to a number of locations including [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Fort Southwick]], [[Ruabon]] and [[Longleat]] before finally settling at Hermitage, Berkshire in early 1949, when it was renamed the School of Military Survey. The Hermitage site (strictly speaking it is in [[Curridge]]) was home to 42 Survey Engineer Group (Royal Engineers) and maintained close links with the Survey Production Centres (Royal Engineers), abbreviated as SPC(RE), at Bushy Park, Teddington and [[Park Royal]] (which amalgamated at [[Feltham]] in the 1960s and went through changes of name to Mapping and Charting Establishment (Royal Engineers) - MCE(RE) - in the 1970s before becoming part of Military Survey, later absorbed into [[Defence Intelligence|The Intelligence Collection Group (ICG)]]. In 1979 a major rebuild at Hermitage provided the school with purpose-built facilities. As part of Military Survey’s 250th Anniversary celebrations in 1997, Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]] awarded the school the Royal accolade. In April 2006 the RSMS became one of four federated schools within the [[Defence Intelligence and Security Centre]] (DISC) along with the Defence Schools of Intelligence (DSI), Languages (DSL) and Photography (DSOP). To exploit the growing synergies between Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) all Geospatial and Imagery analysis training and education is now the responsibility of RSMS. The school consists of three Training Wings: Geospatial Information Management and Geospatial Exploitation, based at Hermitage, and Imagery Intelligence, based at Chicksands in Bedfordshire.&lt;ref name=rsms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsms.ac.uk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605152011/http://www.rsms.ac.uk/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 June 2007|title=Defence Intelligence Security Centre / Royal School of Military Survey|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
Courses taught at RSMS range in duration from three days to 14 months.  Geospatial education and training for Royal Engineer (RE) Geographic Officers, Defence personnel, and international students is provided through the [[MSc]] in Defence Geographic Information awarded by Cranfield University since 1993. From August 2009, this course has been developed into an MSc in Geospatial Intelligence to provide opportunities for Defence personnel to achieve an MSc through a variety of delivery modes including full-time at Hermitage, part-time, and distance learning.&lt;ref name=rsms/&gt; The change was in keeping with the evolution of defence survey and was very little more than a name change.
The premier course offered by RSMS is the 14 month resident Army Survey Course (ASC).  The ASC is designed to be a demanding program focusing on the various fields pertaining to geospatial information and its application within the defence community.  Successful completion of the ASC results in the conferment of an MSc  in Geospatial Intelligence from [[Cranfield University]].  In this relationship RSMS is responsible for course content, while Cranfield University is involved with oversight and program accreditation.  Cranfield University and RSMS faculty meet regularly to ensure that each student is attaining the high standards required for graduation.  Fully successful students graduate from Cranfield University, [[Defence College of Management and Technology|Cranfield Defence and Security]] (CDS), formerly the [[Defence College of Management and Technology]], based at [[Shrivenham]], [[Oxfordshire]], during the July following the course.

Trade training for RE Geographic Technicians is recognised through a Foundation Degree in Applied Computing (Defence Geographic Information) accredited by [[Sheffield Hallam University]] (SHU). A recent development has been the addition of a bachelor's degree in partnership with SHU to provide RE Geographic Technicians with the opportunity to further develop their technical and academic competencies. In addition to the accredited courses, RSMS also delivers a range of specialist courses to Defence personnel, including Imagery Analysis, Full Motion Video Interpretation, GPS, Map Reading, Land Navigation, Geographic Information Systems and Terrain Analysis.&lt;ref name=rsms/&gt; The school is based at [[Denison Barracks]] in [[Hermitage, Berkshire|Hermitage]], Royal County of [[Berkshire]].

'''Star Gazers' Stone''' located on '''Star Gazers' Farm''' near [[Embreeville, Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]], marks the site of a temporary observatory established in January 1764 by [[Charles Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Dixon]] which they used in their survey of the [[Mason-Dixon line]].  The stone was placed by Mason and Dixon about {{convert|700|ft|m|0}} north of the '''Harlan House''', which was used as a base of operations by Mason and Dixon through the four-and-a-half-year-long survey.  Selected to be about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} west of the [[Center City, Philadelphia|then southernmost point in Philadelphia]], the observatory was used to determine the precise latitude of its location.   The  latitude of the [[Maryland]]-[[Pennsylvania]]  border was then set to be {{convert|15|mi|km|1}} south of the point in Philadelphia. The farm, including the house and stone, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 9, 1985.

Built c. 1724 near the forks of the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine]], the Harlan House was enlarged c.1758, and is likely the first house built in [[Newlin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Newlin Township]].  The Harlan family lived in the house until 1956, and carefully preserved the location of the stone through the generations.&lt;ref name="Roby"&gt;Roby&lt;/ref&gt;

==The observatory==
[[File:StarGazersStonePlaque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Plaque on the Star Gazers' Stone near Embreeville, PA.]]Mason and Dixon's survey was the final step in the resolution of a border dispute between Pennsylvania and Maryland that lasted over 80 years.  From 1730-1738 a violent border conflict, known as [[Cresap's War]], was fought  between Pennsylvania and Maryland. In 1760 the Crown intervened, defining the border as the line of latitude {{convert|15|mi|km|1}} south of the southernmost house in Philadelphia.  The proprietors of the colonies, the Penns and Calverts, then commissioned  Mason and Dixon to [[surveying|survey]] the newly established boundary.&lt;ref name=hubbard&gt;{{cite book |last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason and Dixon used the finest instruments of their day in the survey, including a type of telescope, the [[zenith telescope|zenith sector]] built by [[John Bird (astronomer)|John Bird]], used for measuring latitude and an "[[Theodolite|equal altitude and transit]]" instrument for sighting survey lines, as well as a less accurate [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] for faster rough estimates of latitude, and a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] built by [[John Harrison]], used for measuring longitude.  Though Harrison's chronometers later became the standard instrument for measuring longitude, the surveyors' job was mainly to measure latitude, and Mason preferred the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|method of lunar distance]] of measuring longitude to the new method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/johnmack/mason_dixon/ A brief history of the Mason-Dixon survey line] John Mackenzie, College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources, University of Delaware&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 1763 soon after arriving in Philadelphia, the surveyors received their instructions from the joint border commission:

{{quote|1st to settle the Latitude of the southernmost point of the City of Philadelphia by the Sector.&lt;br/&gt;
2nd to find a point by the Sector, 30 or 35 miles west from this Place, having the same latitude as the southernmost point of this City.&lt;br/&gt;
3rd from this Point so found to measure horizontally due South, which done to observe the Latitude of the South End of the said line by the Sector, and to proceed to run the Parallel of Latitude thru this last Point, which is to be the North Boundary of Maryland and the South Boundary of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;from the copy of the instructions sent by Mason to [[Thomas Penn]] on December 14, 1763, quoted in Danson, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first instruction was completed by January 6, 1764 by constructing an observatory near the  Huddle-Plumstead House on Cedar Street (now named [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]]) in Philadelphia, and measuring the angle of the zenith of eight stars.  Rather than measure {{convert|15|mi|km}} directly south of Philadelphia to start the survey, a westward move was needed to avoid crossing the wide Delaware River twice, and to avoid beginning the survey of the Pennsylvania-Maryland border in New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Danson, p.93"&gt;Danson, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;
The surveyors fulfilled the second instruction by January 13, as recorded in their journal:

{{quote|January  7  Set out from Philadelphia with a Quadrant to find (nearby) a place in the Forks of Brandywine having the same Parallel as the Southernmost point of the City of Philadelphia.&lt;br/&gt; 
8  Sun. Fixed on the House of Mr. John Harland's (about 31 miles West of Philadelphia) to bring our Instruments to. &lt;br/&gt;
9  Returned to Philadelphia &lt;br/&gt;
10  Prepared for moving our Instruments &lt;br/&gt;
11 The Observatory taken down and put with the rest of our Instruments into the wagons, except the Telescope, etc., of the Sector which was carried on the Springs (with Feather bed under it) of a single Horse chair. &lt;br/&gt;
12	Left Philadelphia and reached [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] &lt;br/&gt;
13	Lodged at Esquire Worths Arrived at Mr. Harlands and set up the sector in his Garden (inclosed in a tent), and in the Evening brought the Instrument into the Meridian, and took the following observations&lt;ref&gt;From the Journal of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, available [http://www.mdlpp.org/pdf/library/JournalofMasonandDixon.pdf online], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Stargazers Farm.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Harlan House, built 1724]]
The new site of the observatory was near marks that had been made by surveyors from New Jersey in 1730 and 1736.&lt;ref name="Danson, p.93"/&gt;
By February 28  Mason and Dixon had determined the latitude at Star Gazers' Stone by observing the eight stars.  After making adjustments for the distance their observatory was south of Philadelphia, Mason and Dixon measured {{convert|15|mi|km|1}} south to a point in Delaware by April 21.  In the first mile measuring south from their observatory they crossed Brandywine Creek three times. They moved the observatory to this point where they measured the latitude again and remeasured back to the Star Gazers' Stone.  In May and June they again measured the latitude at Star Gazers' Stone. The southern point was named the "Post mark'd west" and the Maryland-Pennsylvania border was, after a delay, measured straight west from there.&lt;ref&gt;Danson, pp.96-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason and Dixon returned to the house many times during the four and one-half years of the survey, often spending the winters there.&lt;ref name="Ecenbarger, pp. 120-122"&gt;Ecenbarger, pp. 120-122&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 1, 1767, Mason recorded a temperature of minus 22 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] at the farm.  They returned to the observatory when they started the new task of measuring the distance of a degree of latitude in miles.  They were reputed to be heavy drinkers, and local lore says that a nearby tributary of the Brandywine, Punch Run Creek, was named to commemorate their drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Ecenbarger, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the survey, the Harlan house was one of the last places they visited before returning to Britain via Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Roby"/&gt;

==The Harlan house and farm==

Brothers George and Michael Harlan were [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] who were born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[England]] and immigrated to Pennsylvania about 1687 from [[County Down]], [[Ireland]].  Michael's son George Harlan built the house in the forks of the Brandywine c.1724.   In that year the Free Society of Traders sold {{convert|7000|acre|km2}} to [[Newlin Mill Complex|Nathaniel Newlin]], which became [[Newlin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Newlin Township]] in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]].  Newlin immediately sold some of the land, including {{convert|169|acre|km2}} in the forks of Brandywine Creek sold to George Harlan. A son, Joel, was born to George and Mary Harlan in 1724 in Newlin Township, presumably in their new house.  The house was probably the first in the township. Tax assessments in the township were first made in 1739, and until 1760, Joel's older brother  John Harlan paid the taxes on the house and farm. Sometime between 1758 and 1760  Joel returned to Newlin Township after living in other locations in Chester County, took ownership of the farm and built an addition to the house. Both John's and Joel's families apparently lived in the same house, but Mason and Dixon's Journal always refers to the "John Harland farm" or simply the "Harland farm." John Harlan died by drowning in the Brandywine in 1768. 
The original house is two stories measuring {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|16|ft|m|1}}, constructed of stone.  The c.1758 addition was also constructed of stone and measures {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|13|ft|m|1}}. A small frame addition was built in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Roby"/&gt;

The Harlan family lived on site until they sold the property in 1956.  In 1908 the Chester County Historical Society dug up the Star Gazers' Stone, set it in concrete, built a low stone wall around it, and placed a plaque on the new wall. At the dedication, Henry K. Harlan said that each generation of the family was taught that the Star Gazers'  Stone had an important place in American history and that they should not move the stone.&lt;ref name="Ecenbarger, pp. 120-122"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Society plaque near the stone is dated 1908, but Roby gives a 1931 date. Ecenbarger quotes the owner of the house giving the 1908 date.&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.natlands.org/ Natural Lands Trust], the region's foremost land conservation organization, now owns the stone as part of its ChesLen Preserve, which is open to the public.

Joshua Harlan, son of the immigrant George Harlan, built a log cabin known as the [[Harlan Log House]] about 1715, about {{convert|12|mi|km}} south in [[Kennett Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Kennett Township]] which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

'''''The Discoverers''''' is a non-fiction historical work by [[Daniel Boorstin]], published in 1983, and is the first in the '''Knowledge Trilogy''', which also includes ''[[The Creators]]'' and ''[[The Seekers (book)|The Seekers]]''. The book, subtitled ''A History of Man's Search to Know His World and Himself'', is a history of human discovery. Discovery in many forms is described: exploration, science, medicine, mathematics, and more-theoretical ones, such as time, evolution, plate tectonics, and relativity. Boorstin praises the inventive, human mind and its eternal quest to discover the universe and humanity's place in it.

In "A Personal Note to the Reader", Boorstin writes "My hero is Man, the Discoverer. The world we now view from the literate West ... had to be opened by countless Columbuses. In the deep recesses of the past, they remain anonymous." The structure of the book is topical and chronological, beginning in the prehistoric era in [[Babylon]] and [[Egypt]].

== Themes ==
''The Discoverers'' (as well as ''The Creators'' and ''The Seekers'') resonates with tales of individuals, their lives, beliefs and accomplishments.  They form the building blocks of his tale and from them flow descriptions and commentary on historical events. In this respect he is like other historians ([[David McCullough]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[Louis Hartz]] and [[Richard Hofstadter]], to name a few) who give prominence to the individual and the incremental approach to history. Thus, in the chapter "In Search of the Missing Link", he features [[Edward Tyson]] and his contributions in comparative anatomy. [[Tycho Brahe]], the Danish astronomer, is the guiding light in "The Witness of the Naked Eye" and [[Isaac Newton]] merits an entire chapter ("God said, Let Newton Be!") devoted to his life and accomplishments.

The role of religion and culture is another recurring theme. Boorstin, a reform Jew, has been described as a "secular, skeptical moderate Northeastern liberal of the New Deal rather than the New Left school." [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D9113CF935A3575AC0A96E958260] The purpose of religion (and God) was not personal salvation but establishing a societal anchor that inspired public morality.

He suggests that Jews and Christians, primarily from [[Western Europe]], came to believe that the Creator wished them to unravel the secrets of His universe. Scientific research, discovery and education became intertwined with the moral good and were elevated to lofty goals within Western societies.  Conversely, Hindus did not explore the seas due to the caste system (some were forbidden to travel over salt water), Muslims became satisfied with the Arabian status quo&lt;ref&gt;''The Discoverers'' - "Why Not the Arabs"&lt;/ref&gt; and China, with an increasingly weak central government, lost its drive for exploration and withdrew to its own borders.&lt;ref&gt;''The Discoverers'' - "The Chinese Reach Out"&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, the active public dissemination of scientific knowledge - geographical, cosmological, medical, mechanical, anthropological - never became common practice outside the Judeo-Christian world.  China, for example, only allowed the ruling class indulgence in scientific ventures.&lt;ref&gt;''The Discoverers'' - "Galileo in China"&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme is the role of tradition and experience in shaping mankind's history. Throughout the work he demonstrates how the discoveries of one individual are built upon the efforts of those who came before.  This long chain of incremental improvements - one generation improving or amplifying the results of previous generations - contrasts sharply with the idea of overthrowing the current order and replacing it with revolutionary ideas originating not in experience but in [[ideology]]. Once a member of the [[Communist Party]] in the 1930s he grew to distrust all forms of fanaticism and political ideology and sought to show how such fanaticism was always detrimental to human progress.

"I have observed that the world has suffered far less from ignorance than from pretensions to knowledge. It is not skeptics or explorers but fanatics and ideologues who menace decency and progress. No agnostic ever burned anyone at the stake or tortured a pagan, a heretic, or an unbeliever."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Boorstin. {{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/d/daniel_j_boorstin.html|title=Brainy Quote'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People, not movements, were the driving force of human progress. He became an exponent of tradition, wary of the implications of [[multiculturalism]] and along with [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr]] and [[Brian Barry]] wrote of potential dangers it posed to a continuing liberal society.

Despite the fact that he served as director of the Smithsonian [[National Museum of History and Technology]], he was a sharp critic of what he perceived as the institution's growing political correctness.  After viewing the controversial exhibit, ''The West as America: Reinterpreting Images of the Frontier, 1820-1920'' (1991) he left the following in the comment book:  "A perverse, historically inaccurate, destructive exhibit. No credit to the Smithsonian."&lt;ref&gt;John T. Correll. {{cite web|url=http://www.afa.org/media/enolagay/07-01.asp|title=''War Stories at Air and Space''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013133943/http://www.afa.org/media/enolagay/07-01.asp|archivedate=2006-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he resigned as President of the [[American Studies Association]] after an attempt was made to inject radical politics into the scholarly body.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Allen. {{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA95/guernsey/davis.html|title=''The Politics of American Studies''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Boorstin's book, particularly chapter 14, "A Flat Earth Returns", perpetuates [[Myth of the Flat Earth|the misconception that medieval intellectuals took the world to be flat]]. "In fact," writes Louise M. Bishop, "virtually every thinker and writer of the thousand year medieval period affirmed the spherical shape of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=The Myth of the Flat Earth | encyclopedia=Misconceptions about the Middle Ages | publisher=[[Routledge]] | accessdate=26 January 2014 | author=Louise M. Bishop | editor=Stephen Harris and Bryon L. Grigsby | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdCTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT149&amp;vq=boorstin&amp;dq=boorstin%20discoverers%20flat%20earth%20myth&amp;pg=PT149#v=snippet&amp;q=boorstin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boorstin's writing has been praised, but he has also had his critics. He has been called [[Conservatism|conservative]], biased toward [[Western culture]] to the exclusion of other cultures, nationalistic and even [[postmodern]].[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/3918.html] This latter term is surprising since Boorstin often railed against many postmodern impulses - [[multiculturalism]], [[political correctness]], [[reverse discrimination]] and ideological politics.  As a postmodern writer, he grasped the new reality created by media, what he called "image reality" in which the vehicle (newspaper, book, movie, television show, billboard) assumes more importance than the reality it portrays or describes.  This new reality can be described as a type of [[deconstructionism]], a movement Boorstin opposed for that very reason.  He continually praises "true" heroes like [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Madame Curie]] while questioning image-crafted politicians, entertainers, academics and sports "heroes". He exalts genuine discoveries (calendar, printing press, medicine) and bemoans media-driven ones of the modern age. His works, therefore, emphasize such "pre-image" concepts as the importance of the individuals, family, tradition, religion, capitalism and democracy.

Some people {{Who|date=December 2016}} have alleged that the book's cover which has a colorized version of an [[Flammarion engraving|image by Flammarion]] (made in the style of a woodcut), is used to promote the view that medieval Christianity was anti-scientific. The jacket credits the [[Bettman Archive]] for the picture, which describes it as "based on a 16th Century Woodcut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodcut of a Man Exploring the Meeting of the Earth and Sky|publisher=Corbis|accessdate=2010-07-23|url=http://www.corbisimages.com/Enlargement/Enlargement.aspx?id=BE023676&amp;tab=details&amp;caller=search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinidad and Tobago dry forests''' are [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forests]] located primarily in western and southern parts of the island of [[Trinidad]], in southern parts of the island of [[Tobago]] and on [[Islands of Trinidad and Tobago|smaller offshore islands]] including [[Chacachacare]], [[Monos]], [[Huevos]], [[Gaspar Grande]], [[Little Tobago]] and [[Saint Giles Island]].  

Tropical dry forests in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] include both '''deciduous''' and '''semi-evergreen''' forests.  A recent work by [[Howard Nelson (ecologist)|Howard Nelson]] suggests that areas which were formerly classified as '''evergreen''' forest also fit the criteria for dry forests.  The major areas of dry forest in Trinidad include the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] peninsula in the northwest, areas along the south coast of the island, from [[Cedros, Trinidad and Tobago|Cedros]] to [[Morne Diablo]], and areas along the east coast including parts of the [[Guayaguayare]], [[Mayaro Bay|Mayaro]] and [[Manzanilla, Trinidad and Tobago|Manzanilla]] coastline.  In addition, areas along the west coast including [[San Fernando Hill]] and much of the former ''[[Sugar]] Belt'' also would have originally supported dry forest.  In Tobago much of the southwest of the island originally supported dry forests.

The dominant paradigm in [[phytosociology]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] has been the work of [[John Stanley Beard]] carried out in the 1940s.  His description of forest associations was [[physiognomy|physiognomically]] based.  Many of his forest associations overlap modern ideas of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry]] and [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist]] forests.  Most work which seeks to classify dry forest in this country, ''e.g.'', [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] classification,&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Trinidad and Tobago dry forests|id=nt0231}}&lt;/ref&gt; underestimate the extent of dry forest in Trinidad and Tobago by restricting it to the driest category of forests that Beard came up with for Trinidad.

An '''underground lake''' or '''subterranean lake''' is a lake under the surface of the Earth. Such lakes may be associated with [[cave]]s, [[aquifer]]s, or [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. They are typically very low in [[salinity]].

The largest non-[[subglacial lake]] in the world is in [[Dragon's Breath Cave]] in [[Namibia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakescientist.com/dragons-breath-cave-holds-worlds-largest-underground-lake/ |title=Dragon’s Breath Cave Holds the World’s Largest Underground Lake |last=Kelly |first=Daniel |date=24 January 2014 |website=Lake Scientist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301130831/http://www.lakescientist.com/dragons-breath-cave-holds-worlds-largest-underground-lake/ |archive-date=1 March 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=31 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an area of almost {{convert|2|ha|acre|0|lk=on}},&lt;ref name=NationalGeographic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odyssei.com/travel-tips/6223.html|title=Dragon's Breath, Namibia|publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second largest is in [[Craighead Caverns]] in [[Tennessee]], [[United States]].

{{cleanup|reason=This article is supposed to cover urbanization in Africa, but since it is based on a paper about the relationship between urbanization and politics in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] its main focus lies there. Please update as needed and remove this notice when you find the article sufficiently balanced|date=February 2014}}}}

The urbanization of most of Africa is moving fast forward, especially [[Sub-Saharan Africa|south of the Sahara]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/place/Africa/People |accessdate= 25 October 2017 |work= Britannica.com |title= Africa: People: Settlement Patterns }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in 1900, about 89% of inhabitants lived from the primary occupations of farming, hunting &amp; gathering, cattle nomadism, and fishing (Aase, 2003:1) meaning that 11% or less were urban. At the start of the independence period in 1957, 14.7% of Africa's inhabitants were urban, in 2000 had it risen to 37.2% and it is expected to rise to 49.3% in 2015, in effect 3.76% to 3.35% per year (UN, 2002). In sub-Saharan Africa in 1960 "only one city, [[Johannesburg]], had a population of one million;...in 2009, there were fifty-two cities with such large populations."{{sfn|Heath|2010}} The [[Nigeria]]n city of [[Lagos]] that in 1963 had 665,000 inhabitants (Rakodi, 1997) and 8.7 million in 2000 is expected to become the worlds 11th biggest city by 2015 with 16 million inhabitants (UN, 2002).

==Pre-colonial times==
===Nile valley===
The earliest known cities of Africa emerged around the [[Nile Valley]]. [[Alexandria]] was founded in [[Egypt]] in 331 and is famous for the lighthouse Pharos, for a legendary library, and for the martyrdom of Hypatia of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/alexandria/ |title=Alexandria, Egypt - Ancient History Encyclopedia |website=Ancient.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While more Greek papyri were preserved in the sands of Egypt than anywhere else in the ancient world, relatively few from Alexandria still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcH6oWafBq8C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=alexandria+egypt+thoroughly+studied&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oXlyVYJgQc&amp;sig=uefcSWsF-BE3CLO2IS3PNLTHhJ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1nYvuy-bJAhWJKWMKHSJhDr8Q6AEIMjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=alexandria%20egypt%20thoroughly%20studied&amp;f=false |title=Women in Hellenistic Egypt: From Alexander to Cleopatra |author=Sarah B. Pomeroy |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many early cities in Africa south of the Sahara. [[Meroe]] (present-day [[Sudan]]) was one of the major cities in the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] [[monarchy|kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/ancient-kush-2nd-millennium-b-c-4th-century-d |title=Ancient Kush (2nd millennium B.C. – 4th century A.D.) &amp;#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several centuries after the sacking of Napata in 590 BC, the Meroitic kingdom developed independently of Egypt, reaching its height in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Sudan.html |title=Kush, Meroe and Nubia |website=Shsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121090442/http://www.shsu.edu/%7Ehis_ncp/Sudan.html |archive-date=2016-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meroe advanced in iron technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rauhn/ancient_africa.htm |title=Ancient Meroe: |website=Web.ics.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and building construction dates back to at least 900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jarus |first=Owen |url=http://www.livescience.com/15420-remains-ancient-palace-discovered-central-sudan.html |title=Remains of Ancient Palace Discovered |website=Livescience.com |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meroe was a great center of agriculture at its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Meroe/ |title=Meroe - Ancient History Encyclopedia |website=Ancient.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axum]], capital of the [[Ethiopia]]n kingdom lasted from the first century AD until about the 10th century AD. It had an extensive trade network with the [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[Mediterranean]], south [[Arabia]] and [[India]], trading [[ivory]], precious metals, clothing and spices. Axumian stone artwork ([[monolith]]s has been preserved, and bear proof of their advances in quarrying, [[stone carving]], terracing, building construction and irrigation.

===West Africa===
Between AD 700 to 1600, cities in the West African [[savanna]] emerged from the trans-Saharan trade. Some of the more prominent were [[Kumbi Saleh]], [[Timbuktu]], [[Djenné]] and [[Gao]]. Arabic scholars like [[Ibn Khaldun]] have been a very important source of historical accounts from this area and period. [[Gold mining]], [[iron]] technology, pottery making and [[textile]] production were the important technologies. In the commercial and capital center of [[Ghana Empire]] (not present [[Ghana]]) Kumbi Saleh an elaborate economic system including [[tax]]ation was developed.

In the West African forest region, cities developed among the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Fulani]], [[Hausa people]] as well as in the [[Ashanti Empire]] and [[Benin]] kingdom. As well as being commercial and political centers they worked as spiritual centers.

===Central Africa===
In the central African equatorial region cities could be found in what is today [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[DR Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Zambia]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. In what is now Zaire, [[Musumba]]  was the capitol city of [[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lunda.aspx |title=Lunda facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Lunda |website=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Important cities:'''

*[[M'banza-Kongo]], capital of the [[Kongo Empire]]
*[[Ryamurari]], capital of the [[Ndorwa]] kingdom ([[Rwanda]]
*[[Kiguba]], capital of the [[Buganda]] kingdom

===Coastal East Africa===
In this region a [[Swahili people|Swahili]] [[Angli Moslem]]ic culture emerged.

'''Important cities:'''
*[[Malindi]] (present [[Kenya]])
*[[Gede, Kenya|Gedi]] (present Kenya)
*[[Mombasa]] (present Kenya)
*[[Zanzibar]] (present [[Tanzania]])
*[[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]] (present Tanzania)

Technological developments included coin minting, copper works, building craftsmanship, boat building, cotton textile. External trade was very active and important with [[Asia]] and [[Arabia]].

===Southern Africa===
[[Great Zimbabwe]] is one of the more famous pre-colonial cities of Africa. Its Great Enclosure is considered the largest single prehistoric structure in Africa.

==Colonial times==
With the [[Berlin conference]] of 1884/85 as a foundation, Africa was apportioned among the [[Europe]]an powers. In 1914 only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were left as independent states, the remainder of the continent was under [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Germany|German]], [[Belgium|Belgian]], [[Italy|Italian]] or [[Spain|Spanish]] control. It was the interest of these powers that governed the borders. The continent had almost no urban population and the colonial powers had not started to invest much in its «pieces» (Hernæs, 2003a). A good example is [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] that in 1900 had a budget of £100,000, a military force of 2000 [[Hausa people|Hausa]]-soldiers and 120 British officers. With this they were to govern an enormous area with a population of about 10 million people.

The economic and administrative politics had the greatest effect on urbanization. The important export products [[cash crop]]s (including cotton, maize, tobacco, sugar, coffee, tea, palm oil, and groundnuts) and minerals had to be transported to the harbour towns for export. For this railway [[transport]] was needed, and to run the colony administration and personnel was needed. The central administration was often placed in harbour town, but there was not developed any network of small and middle-sized cities (Aase, 2003:3).

New cities were placed in an existing settlement or at a completely new site. Completely new cities were especially developed in the [[copper zone]] to house the [[Mining|mine]] workers. Examples include [[Johannesburg]] and [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] in [[South Africa]], [[Ndola]] and [[Kitwe]] in [[Zambia]] and [[Lubumbashi]] in [[DR Congo]].

A strong centralised political system was also important in the development of early urban centres for example in the ndebele kingdom under Mzilikazi and later on lobengula

Some cities were used and some were ignored. Close to the main lines of transportation the cities grew, while towns that were ignored by transportation and administration in effect disappeared, as for example [[Kukawa]] and [[Dahomey]].

It was in the cities of transportation and administration that contact with government and commerce was possible. As a consequence it was invested in these cities leading to the need of workforce. The commercial politics of [[raw inputs]] exporting to finance the colony and develop Africa governed the way what cities that should grow.

At the same time the colonial powers became aware of the problems that urbanization brought with it. The [[rural]]-urban [[Human migration|migration]] pulled labour away from the countryside where the important export products were made. The Africans usually lived in small spaces and under poor sanitary conditions. They were therefore prone to illnesses like [[malaria]]. The colonial governments' response was not to improve the Africans conditions, but rather to separate Europeans, Asians and Africans from each other and establish [[influx control]] laws. In South Africa this resulted in the official policy of [[apartheid]] from 1950. This was also a policy that was especially common in [[settler]] cities like [[Harare]], [[Lusaka]] and [[Nairobi]].

With the economic depression in the 1930s, prices of African export products dropped. This in turn led to an economic downturn and unemployment. The mining workforce before the depression had been mostly temporary or seasonal, often also forced labour. The workers therefore lived in mining cities away from home and their families in the countryside.

From the 1920s in [[Belgian Congo]] and from the 1940s in South Africa and South and North [[Rhodesia]] the mining companies started to prefer more permanent workers. The authorities changed their policies to facilitate the change, and after a while also moved the working men's families into the cities. The new policies tried to strengthen the authorities' control over land and city growth, and make life easier for the European administration.

The effect of the apartheid and similar policies can be illustrated by comparing urban growth rate in Southern Africa, with that of the rest of Africa in the 1950s. This also illustrates that the policy was not working or not effective in the other colonies: The urban growth rate of Southern Africa was about 3.3%, compared to about 4.6% for the whole of Africa.

As the economy grew, the cities also grew. The colonial authorities started to strengthen the development policies that had suffered because of the 1930s depression. Social services, especially primary schools, but also secondary schools, and in the end of the colonial period also a few universities were built. Important infrastructure such as harbours, electricity grid and roads was further developed. All this caused growing administration, growing exports and growing cities, that grew even more in the post colonial period.

==Postcolonial period==
Most of today's African countries gained their formal independence in the 1960s. The new countries seemed to have a great faith in [[planned economy]] regardless of how they gained their independence. The government should actively develop the country, not only by building infrastructure and developing social services; but also by developing industry and employment. Many parastatal companies are today left as 'white elephants' and demonstrate the great investments that were made in the cities at the beginning of the post-colonial period (Rakodi, 1997).

For many reasons it was thought that centralisation equalled a strong (powerful) state (government). The reasons could be
*the wish to induce a feeling of nationhood, which also led to the establishment of brand new capitals (to be mentioned later);
*a lack of qualified government officers; someone had to do the work that the colonial officers had done, but in some places these people simply did not exist;
*the fear that local authorities would turn against central authorities. (Rakodi, 1997).

Centralization meant that companies had even more reason to establish themselves in the already large capitals because this was closest to power. In effect this led to a huge concentration of investment in urban areas. For example, in Nigeria where 80% of investments not related to agriculture was spent in urban areas (Rakodi, 1997).

New cities were also established in the post-colonial period, but not for the same reasons as in the colonial period. The seaport [[Tema, Ghana|Tema]] in [[Ghana]] was built awaiting great industrial growth. Later, new capitals were built, inspired by the planned city of [[Brasília]] in [[Brazil]]. This happened in [[Malawi]] ([[Lilongwe]]), [[Côte d'Ivoire]] ([[Yamoussoukro]]) and Nigeria ([[Abuja]]) (Stock, 1995). The new capitals were meant to give the nation a 'fresh start', they were supposed to be the beginning of a new golden future promised by the liberation politicians.

As none of the new capitals have grown to more than about half a million inhabitants, they have probably not had much influence on the growth of the already established cities. Tema could be said to be a success as it is the most important port today, and together with [[Accra]] represent the biggest metropolitan area in Ghana (The World Bank Group, 2001; UN, 2003b; Obeng-Odoom, 2013).

At the same time as influx-control regulations were intensified in South Africa, this kind of regulation was weakened in the newly liberated countries. This led to more [[rural]]-[[urban area|urban]] [[Human migration|migration]] in the newly liberated countries (Rakodi, 1997), and a stable decline in urbanization growth from 1950 to 1990 in South Africa.
From figure 1 one can see that after the end of apartheid in 1990, the urbanization rate grow from 2.29% to 3.41%, while it continues to sink in the rest of Africa. The abandonment of the influx-control regulations in 1986 is a part of this picture. The city of [[Bloemfontein]] grew 51% between 1988 and 1996. (The Ministry of the Flemish Government, 2001).

Influx control regulation was active in South Africa until 1986/90, while in the rest of Africa they were more or less abandoned or without effect. However, even the remnants of these regulations could have an effect on how the cities grew, since they made it difficult to get hold of legally owned land. This again led to the illegitimate occupation of land.

One reason for people wanting to move from rual to urban areas is that they think living will be better there. A comparison between HDI rank and urbanization level in Africa could show that there might be some sense in this belief. The five African countries that in 2001 ranked highest on the [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]] was also some of the most urbanised, see figure 2.

In some countries rural inhabitants have been given even more reasons to migrate to the city by lower food prices in the cities, often because of pressure from [[trade union]]s. This in turn has led to lowered income in rural areas and therefore higher migration to urban areas. (Rakodi, 1997; Aase, 2003).

Finally it should be mentioned that [[war]] and economic misconduct have led to the dilution of rural resources and periodically very high rural-urban migration. At the end of the 1980s, there were only 18 African countries that had not experienced a military coup against their government (Rakodi, 1997).(Written by Josiah Naidoo).

==Summary==
The urbanization rate in Africa is slowing, but so is the population growth rate, much because of [[HIV]]/AIDS (UN, 2003a). The big cities of Africa will probably continue to grow, but the future is as always uncertain. In 1994 it was expected that [[Lagos]] would become the world's third biggest city with 24.4 million inhabitants by 2015 (Todaro, 1997), but in 2001 this was adjusted to the world's eleventh biggest city with 'only' 16 million inhabitants (UN, 2002). This shows how uncertain the numbers are, and how unpredictable the African population development is.

It is evident that like in the rest of the world, the African urbanization process has mainly been influenced by economy. The colonial powers placed ports, railways and mines to economically strategic places. The cities have both in colonial and post-colonial times been economically prioritized. People came to these places for nationalistic pride, work, administration, education and social services. The exception is South Africa who, with its strict influx control regime and apartheid policy, to a certain degree managed to control urban growth. It is nonetheless one of the most urbanized countries of Africa and now has a low urbanization growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6990">'''''Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites''''' is a series of [[DVDs]] by [[Walt Disney Home Video]]. Each release would feature around one hour of ''[[Disney]]'' [[animated]] [[short films]], grouped by a starring character or a theme. It is based on the original [[Walt Disney Cartoon Classics]] line of videotapes of the 1980s. As opposed to the chronological nature of the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' line, each release would feature various cartoons in no particular order. The series featured a total of four waves of releases, between January 11, 2005 and April 11, 2006. Another very similar line was ''[[Walt Disney's Funny Factory]]''.
