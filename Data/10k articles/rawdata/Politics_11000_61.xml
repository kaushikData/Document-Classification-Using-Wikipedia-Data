The '''Dharmapuri bus burning''' incident occurred on February 2, 2000 at Ilakiyampatti, on the outskirts of [[Dharmapuri]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Three students from the [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]], [[Coimbatore]] were burned to death.&lt;ref name="busburningincident"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/02/03/stories/01030005.htm |title=3 burnt alive |date=2000-02-03 |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=2009-08-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jXX7yBMw?url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/02/03/stories/01030005.htm |archivedate=2009-09-04 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of India]] initially convicted and sentenced the three main accused Muniappan, Nedunchezhian and Ravindran to death observing it was rarest of the rare and earlier the Salem District court had stated that crime was committed "only for the political career" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/Death-for-3-AIADMK-men-in-Dharmapuri-bus-burning-case/article14721821.ece | title=Death for 3 AIADMK men in Dharmapuri bus burning case | publisher=The Hindu | date=17 February 2007 | accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamil Government actually ruled by AIADMK tries to release the three persons involved in this case. Accordingly to prison sources, at least 1,500 prisoners will get the benefit of the general amnesty of the Tamil nadu government. And this list contained these three person (Muniappan, Nedunchezhian and Ravindran)  who seems to be AIADMK party members, a tactial and silent move by AIADMK to release their party members. On 19-11-2018, AIADMK men convicted in Dharmapuri college bus burning case set free. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-men-convicted-in-dharmapuri-college-bus-burning-case-set-free/article25537054.ece|title=AIADMK men convicted in Dharmapuri college bus burning case set free|date=2019-11-19|publisher=The Hindu India|accessdate=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tamil language]] film ''[[Kalloori]]'' was released in December 2007, just days before the Madras High court upheld the judgment of Salem court. The movie is about college life, and climaxed with a bus burning incident. Following public and media demands, the ending was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.movies.yahoo.com/news-detail/15327/Kalloori-different-climax.html|title=Kalloori, with a different climax!|date=2007-12-19|publisher=Yahoo Movies India|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communism sidebar|expanded=all}}
Communist and Marxist ideologies generally allow state-provided [[abortion]], although there is no consensus among Communist parties and governments about how far into the pregnancy abortion should be allowed.

== Marxist Feminist views on abortion ==
Marxist feminists support the right of free access to abortion for women from all classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publicseminar.org/2016/06/feminisms-of-the-left-politics-and-strategy/|title=FEMINISMS OF THE LEFT: Politics and Strategy|work=Public Seminar|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communist parties views on abortion ==
In the Western world, the majority of the supporters of Communism also support abortion on request. 

* The [[Communist Party USA]] supports the right of abortion and social services to provide access to it, arguing that unplanned pregnancy is prejudiced against poor women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpusa.org/interact_cpusa/what-is-the-cpusas-position-on-abortion/|title=What is the CPUSA's position on abortion rights?|first=Michelle|last=Kern|date=27 June 2016|website=Cpusa.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's Republic of China ===
The Chinese Penal Code does not criminalize abortion. Abortion is allowed until the 14th week of pregnancy, with abortions after the limit only permitted in special cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/3184/china|title=China|first=Marc|last=Worrell|website=Women on Waves|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoughts on abortions were influenced by the government's [[One-child policy]] and pressure from relatives, which led to a high number of sex-selective abortions and abortions after the legal time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11858723/China-Forced-abortion-late-term-to-avoid-one-child-policy.html|title=Forcing a woman to have an abortion at eight months: Welcome to 21st century China|first=Yuan|last=Ren|date=11 September 2015|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights activist [[Chen Guangcheng]] was arrested for reporting cases of forced abortions in the Shandong province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://internacional.estadao.com.br/blogs/claudia-trevisan/aborto-forcado-choca-a-china/|title=Aborto forçado choco a China|website=Internacional.estado.com.br|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the high number of sex-selective abortions, the Chinese government banned [[prenatal sex discernment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/world/new-chinese-law-prohibits-sex-screening-of-fetuses.html|title=New Chinese Law Prohibits Sex-Screening of Fetuses|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
The Law of Protection of People's Health passed in 1989 states that: "Women have the right to have an abortion, to receive gynecological diagnosis and treatment, health check-up during pregnancy, and medical service when giving birth at health facilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Abortion Policy|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/profiles.htm|journal=Viet Nam|volume=|pages=1|via=UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former Marxist-Leninist ==
Many historical Marxist-Leninist countries, primarily in Europe, chose to allow abortion on request or due to socioeconomic factors. The Soviet Union under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and Romania under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]], however, took action to further limit abortions, and other Communist countries retained prohibitive laws against them.

=== Soviet Union ===
During the Soviet regime in 1920, Russia legalized abortion, but in 1933, during the Stalinist era, views on it changed. In the Congress of Kiev in 1932, abortion was criticized for decreasing the country's birth rate. Abortion was finally banned in 1933. In her book, "[[Sexual Politics]]", the radical feminist [[Kate Millett]] criticized the Soviet regime for failing to support the social rights of women and homosexual people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seminariolecturasfeministas.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kate-millet-polc3adtica-sexual.pdf|format=PDF|author=Kate Millet|title=Politica Sexual|website=Seminariolecturasfeministas.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of officially recorded abortions dropped sharply from 1.9 million in 1935 to 570,000 in 1937, but began to climb just two years later, reaching 755,000 in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1936-2/abolition-of-legal-abortion/|title=Abolition of Legal Abortion|date=18 June 2015|website=Soviethistory.msu.edu|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, 1955, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], legalized abortion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Re-Legalization of Abortion in Soviet Russia|first=Mark G.|last=Field|date=30 August 1956|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=255|issue=9|pages=421–427|doi=10.1056/nejm195608302550905|pmid = 13358858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
Despite the protests of the Catholic Church, abortion in Poland was allowed on social grounds in 1956, and fully allowed in 1959 to protect the life and morality of women that had unsafe abortions. The abortions were provided by public hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxpolitics.org/frontlines/book/pdf/capitulo5_poland.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Struggle for Abortion Rights in Poland|website=Sxpolitics.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
Prior to 1953, abortion was only allowed to save the mother's life. In 1953 and 1956, the laws legalized abortion until 12 weeks of pregnancy, in cases of socioeconomic factors. In 1973, although abortion was still allowed for social reasons, the list of other acceptable reasons was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mEyfOKHDORsC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=ABORTION+HUNGARY+1953#v=onepage&amp;q=ABORTION+HUNGARY+1953&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of Hungary|first1=Oksana|last1=Buranbaeva|first2=Vanja|last2=Mladineo|date=30 September 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=22 August 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313383694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Germany ===
In East Germany, women under 16 years of age, women over 40, and mothers with at least four children were given the right to abortion after applying to a state commission. Abortion was fully legalized by parliament in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/10/archives/east-german-parliament-approves-free-abortion.html|title=East German Parliament Approves Free Abortion|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romania ===
Before 1966, Romania had the most liberal laws of abortion in Europe. However, after the rise of power of Nicolae Ceauşescu, [[Decree 770]] only allowed abortion to save the life of the mother. It was also allowed for women over 40 years old or with four or more children. In 1986, the age of tolerance was further raised to 45. The goal of the ban was a larger population that could drive a larger workforce and consumer-led growth, in order to achieve economic independence from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://searchinginhistory.blogspot.com/2014/01/decree-770-of-ceausescu.html|title=Decree 770 of Ceausescu - Searching in History|date=19 January 2014|website=Searchinghistory.blogspot.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the span of these 23 years, more than 2 million unwanted children, were born and at least 10,000 women died as a result. The 770 Decree was one of the first laws to be repealed right after Ceauşescu's trial and execution on the 25th of December, 1989; more than 1 million abortions were performed the year after, more than three times the number of children born that year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Czechoslovakia ===
An abortion law passed in 1957 allowed termination for, both medical (forming 10% of the cases) and other reasons (the remaining 90%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/659293|title=Legal Abortion in Czechoslovakia|first=Věra|last=Kőlblová|date=25 April 1966|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=196|issue=4|page=371|accessdate=24 August 2018|doi=10.1001/jama.1966.03100170113043}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was changed after 1957.{{clarify|reason=how it was changed|date=September 2018}} The birth ratio decreased, falling below number of abortions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Legalized abortion in Czechoslovakia|first1=J.|last1=Zidovsky|first2=A.|last2=Zwinger|date=24 August 1972|journal=Medical Gynaecology, Andrology, and Sociology|volume=8|issue=2|pages=7–9|pmid=12256872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
Abortion was legalized on April 27, 1956. It was only allowed once every 6 months, and no later than the 12th week of pregnancy except for health reasons. To increase the birth rate, the government restricted abortion for certain women in February 1968 by the Decree 188, which discouraged childless women and women with one or two children from having an abortion (although they could possibly have the procedure if they persisted). Only women with three or more children, or women over 45 years ago, had the right to an abortion on request. The time ceiling was also lowered to 10 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/bulgaria1.doc |title=Data |website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1973, women with just one child lost the right to abortion except in cases of rape, incest, medical emergency, if the woman was an unmarried person under the age of 18 with no living children, or if she was over 45 years old with a living child. By 1974, unmarried women were allowed to get an abortion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Yugoslavia ===
Abortion was legalized in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znajznanje.org/abortion-rights-in-the-former-ex-yugoslavia-abortion-as-a-human-right/|title=// Abortion rights in the former ex-Yugoslavia: abortion as a human right – znajznanje.org|website=Znajznanje.org|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 191 of the federal constitution states that "it is a human right to decide on the birth of children". All the republics of Yugoslavia passed laws between 1977 and 1979 that regulated abortion; in Croatia, for example, abortion was only allowed until 10 weeks of pregnancy, but in Slovenia it was allowed after the 10 weeks on request.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Albania ===
During [[Enver Hoxha|Enver Hoxha's]] rule, abortion was only legally allowed to save mother's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albanian-women-remember-fear-of-abortion-during-communism-11-06-2017|title=Albanian Women Remember Fear of Abortion During Communism|website=Balkaninsight.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice could be obtained for any reason. The punishment for a woman who had an abortion was social reprimand by re-education through work. By 1989, abortion was officially legalized in cases of rape, incest, and for women under 16 years old, among other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/albani1.doc |title=Data |website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Korea ===
The Penal Code from 1950 states that abortion is allowed for "important reasons" up to the seventh weeks of pregnancy, but that anyone who performs an abortion for no important reason is subject to up to three years' imprisonment. The lack of specification of "important reasons", though, has increased leeway for abortions on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/4290/north-korea|title=North Korea|first=Marc|last=Worrell|website=Women on Waves|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongolia ===
Induced abortion in socialist Mongolia was allowed since 1940 to preserve the mother's health, officially recorded in the penal code on July 6, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/mongolia.doc |title=Data |website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, the amendment authorized medical authorities to decide when to perform an abortion, and abortion was fully legalized in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Kampuchea ===
According to the French penal code, abortion in Kampuchea was prohibited, but the general criminal law principles of necessity allowed abortion to save mother's life. Due the period of extended turmoil during the Communist Regime, the laws about abortion then were unclear, and  untrained health workers accepted requests for abortions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Afghanistan ===
The criminal code from 7 October 1976 only allowed abortion to save the mother's life. The socialist government never changed this law. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/afghan1.doc |title=Data |website= |publisher=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Yemen ===
The law of South Yemen only allowed abortion to save the mother's life, as with North Yemen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/yemen.doc |title=Data |website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mozambique ===
Before 1981, abortion was only allowed to save the mother's life. In 1981, abortion was allowed in case of contraceptive failure. Since then, the law has been interpreted very liberally in some hospitals, leading them to accept women who sign a written statement requesting the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://laubeyrietechnology.com/c.php?cu=https%253A%252F%252Fr.search.yahoo.com%252Fcbclk%252FdWU9QjhDMUQ4NDZGNzcxNERBNSZ1dD0xNTM0OTg1NzY5MTgzJnVvPTcxMjYyMTM0Mjk2MzUyJmx0PTImZXM9UjYwQ09qd0dQUzljei5EVA--%252FRV%253D2%252FRE%253D1535014569%252FRO%253D10%252FRU%253Dhttps%25253a%25252f%25252fwww.bing.com%25252faclick%25253fld%25253dd36V2S9K9o3X4alvWPetevQTVUCUx51YoMctjLp2qjZgA0CnEbs5FQ4CsOK-7uuLuhJEMwaTCWpgPNdkBbu39qxsd8tiFLG5PF3Djw8TbuHUG91UG5R0YPGc5vUkXewcp4JeZV-TBAlibqei43nWXnwR00wMI%252526u%25253dhttps%2525253a%2525252f%2525252fwww.ibyte.com.br%2525252f%2525253futm_source%2525253dbingads%25252526utm_medium%2525253drededepesquisa%25252526utm_campaign%2525253dferias%252525252Btecnologia%25252526utm_term%2525253drededepesquisabinginstitucional%25252526utm_content%2525253djulho2018%25252526msclkid%2525253d%2525257bmsclkid%2525257d%252FRK%253D2%252FRS%253D7WwhoCRJGtngCCb93OHKkldB3V0-&amp;sh=www.ibyte.com.br&amp;l=BR&amp;po=1&amp;u=52345X0000XZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&amp;a=3453&amp;tr=5b7e062884cd4&amp;keyword=tv+led&amp;aid=5b7e06295fb8f&amp;b=&amp;uc=BR&amp;ut=52345X0000XZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&amp;rt=1534985769.3904&amp;bc=1&amp;e7d42=1&amp;t=1&amp;tbm=&amp;loc=pu ]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's Republic of the Congo ===
Abortion was prohibited, but the general principles of criminal law allowed abortions on grounds of medical necessity, with reports suggesting they were also permitted for less immediately dangerous complications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}  

=== Ethiopia ===
Abortion was only allowed to “save the pregnant woman from the grave and permanent danger to life or health that is impossible to avert in any other way”. Although the code does not accept broad health, judicial or socio-economic grounds, and doesn't specify whether a threat to health includes both physical and mental health, it does consider a “grave state of physical or mental distress, especially following rape or incest, or because of extreme poverty” a mitigating circumstance in sentencing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Other Communist areas ==

=== Democratic Federation of Northern Syria ===
Although Syria only allows abortion to save a mother's life, the [[de facto]] [[autonomous region]] of the DFNS legalizes abortion for all women. Barbara Anna, a member of the Turkish Communist Party, reflected more broadly on how limits to women’s bodily autonomy relate to the imposition of capitalism and imperialism. She compared the situations in the Middle East where women’s economic activity and sexual freedom is heavily restricted to the situation in the neoliberal capitalist centre, where women’s sexual freedom comes at the expense of constant objectification and commodification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lookleftonline.org/2018/05/kurdish-women-call-for-yes-vote/|title=Kurdish women call for YES vote|website=LookLeft|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia === 
The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] supported abortion, despite the laws of Colombia only allowing it in cases of rape, fetal defects, or a need to preserve the mother's health.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/noticias/2003/030310_colombiaguerrilheirasvr.shtml|title=Farc têm grande contingente de mulheres guerrilheiras - BBC Brasil - BBC World Service|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paris Commune ===
Article XII states that "The submission of the children and the mother to the authority of the father, who prepares the submission of each one to the authority of the chief, is pronounced dead. The couple consents freely to seek common pleasure. The Commune proclaims freedom of birth: the right to sexual information from childhood, the right to abortion, the right to contraception. As the products cease to be the property of their parents. They live together in their home and run their own lives." This was in sharp contrast to the French law at the time, which prohibited abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psolufmg.blogspot.com/p/ha-140-anos-comuna-de-paris.html|title=Núcleo Psol UFMG: Decretos da Comuna de Paris de 1871|website=Psolufmg.blogspot.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''Audit Act 1901''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act||Audit Act 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the fourth piece of legislation passed by the Parliament. The Audit Act provided a legislative basis for the financial management of Commonwealth finances and the audit of related accounts, it also provided a legal foundation for the appointment of an Auditor-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jcpaa/agact/report/fullreport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Report 419: Inquiry into the ''Auditor-General Act 1997'' |publisher=Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit |year=2010 |location=Canberra |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Auditor-General, John William Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anao.gov.au/About-Us/History-of-the-ANAO |title=History of the ANAO |publisher=Australian National Audit Office |year=2011 |location=Canberra |page=1 |access-date=16 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328061917/http://anao.gov.au/About-Us/History-of-the-ANAO |archive-date=28 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began establishing the Federal Audit Office in 1902 in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/3604/1/3604.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Reactive Administrative Culture? The Legacy of Australia's first Auditor-General on the Australian Audit Office |author=Wanna, John |author2=Ryan, Christine |publisher=[[Australian Journal of Politics and History]] |year=2003 |location=Canberra |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office moved to Canberra in 1935, in line with Government policy at that time.

The ''Audit Act 1901'' was amended in 1979 to allow the Audit Office to undertake performance audits ("efficiency reviews").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.anao.gov.au/~/media/Uploads/Speeches/2011/Senate%20Occasional%20Lecture%2014%20October%2011.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211204129/http://www.anao.gov.au/~/media/Uploads/Speeches/2011/Senate%20Occasional%20Lecture%2014%20October%2011.pdf|page=6|title=Senate Occasional Lecture: The Evolving Role and Mandate of the ANAO Since Federation|first=Ian|last=McPhee|date=14 October 2011|archivedate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency reviews, or [[performance audit]], concerns the efficiency and effectiveness of a particular government activity.

The ''Audit Act 1901'' was replaced with the ''Auditor-General Act 1997'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act||Auditor-General Act 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into effect on 1 January 1998. The main features of the new act included:
* provisions that strengthened the independence of the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office;
* the strengthening of the Auditor-General's role as an external auditor of Commonwealth agencies, authorities, companies and their subsidiaries, including a comprehensive mandate to conduct, with some limited exceptions, financial statement and performance audits of all government entities; and
* clarification of the Auditor-General's mandate and powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aph.gov.au/house/committee/jcpaa/Auditor-GeneralActReview/Frontpages.pdf |format=PDF |title=Report 386: Review of the Auditor-General Act 1997 |publisher=Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit |year=2001 |location=Canberra |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the ANAO hosted XII [[International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions|INCOSAI]], the twelfth triennial convention of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]].

The Australian National Audit Office also reviews Commonwealth Government agencies pursuant to the {{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act||Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997}} for the proper use and management of public money, public property and other Commonwealth resources; the {{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act||Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997}} that provides reporting, accountability and other rules for Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies; and the {{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act||Corporations Act 2001}} for general corporate law.

[[File:blackstones-ratio.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[William Blackstone]] with a quote of Blackstone's ratio.]]

In [[criminal law]], '''Blackstone's ratio''' (also known as '''the Blackstone ratio''' or '''Blackstone's formulation''') is the idea that:

{{quote|It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/blackstone-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-vol-2/simple|title=Commentaries on the laws of England|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As expressed by the English jurist [[William Blackstone]] in his seminal work, ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', published in the 1760s.

The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate. There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions. The message that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence has remained constant.{{Citation needed|reason=This is both a sweeping declaration unlimited in time and unsupported by the text below, and unclear|date=October 2018}}

==In Blackstone's ''Commentaries''==
The phrase, repeated widely and usually in isolation, comes from a longer passage, the fourth in a series of five discussions of policy by Blackstone:

{{quote|Fourthly, all presumptive evidence of felony should be admitted cautiously, for the law holds that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer. And Sir Matthew Hale in particular lays down two rules most prudent and necessary to be observed: 1. Never to convict a man for stealing the goods of a person unknown, merely because he will give no account how he came by them, unless an actual felony be proved of such goods; and, 2. Never to convict any person of murder or manslaughter till at least the body be found dead; on account of two instances he mentions where persons were executed for the murder of others who were then alive but missing.}}

The phrase was absorbed by the British legal system, becoming a maxim by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; Re Hobson, 1 Lew. C. C. 261, 168 Eng. Rep. 1034 (1831) (Holroyd, J.).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also absorbed into American common law, cited repeatedly by that country's Founding Fathers, later becoming a standard drilled into law students all the way into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;G. Tim Aynesworth, An illogical truism, Austin Am.-Statesman, April 18, 1996, at A14.  Specifically, it is "drilled into [first year law students'] head[s] over and over again."

Other commentators have echoed the principle; [[Benjamin Franklin]] stated it as, "it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer".&lt;ref&gt;9 Benjamin Franklin, Works 293 (1970), Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Vaughan (14 March 1785)&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending [[British Army|British soldiers]] charged with murder for their role in the [[Boston Massacre]], [[John Adams]] also expanded upon the rationale behind Blackstone's Ratio when he stated: 

{{quote|It is more important that innocence should be protected, than it is, that guilt be punished; for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world, that all of them cannot be punished.... when innocence itself, is brought to the bar and condemned, especially to die, the subject will exclaim, 'it is immaterial to me whether I behave well or ill, for virtue itself is no security.' And if such a sentiment as this were to take hold in the mind of the subject that would be the end of all security whatsoever}}

Given that Hale and Fortescue in English law had made similar statements previously, some kind of explanation is required for the enormous popularity and influence of the phrase across all the Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Cullerne Bown has argued that it "...can be seen as a new kind of buttress of the law that was required in a new kind of society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1365712718798387|title=Killing Kaplanism: Flawed methodologies, the standard of proof and modernity|publisher=The International Journal of Evidence &amp; Proof}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantitativejurisprudence.com|title="Quantitative Jurisprudence" blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic expressions of the principle==

The immediate precursors of Blackstone's Ratio in English law were articulations by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]] (about 100 years earlier) and [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] (about 200 years before that), both influential jurists in their time.

Hale wrote, "for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die." Fortescue's ''De Laudibus Legum Angliae'' (c. 1470) states that "one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally." &lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;Alexander Volokh, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 300 years before Fortescue, the Jewish legal theorist [[Maimonides]] wrote that "the Exalted One has shut this door" against the use of presumptive evidence, for "it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref name=Volokh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269-271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein(Rabbi.)2006"&gt;{{cite book

Maimonides argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would progressively lead to convictions merely "according to the judge's caprice" and was expounding on both [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:7 (''"the innocent and righteous slay thou not''") and an Islamic text, [Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi.

[Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as saying, "Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, and if there are any doubts in the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment".  Another similar expression reads, "Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadith.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=192&amp;TOCID=951&amp;BookID=37&amp;PID=2650 ''Exegesis of Sunan at-Tirmidhi - the Book of Punishments''],  Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi, 884 C.E.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other statements, some even older, which seem to express similar sentiments have been compiled by Volokh. A vaguely similar principle, echoing the number ten and the idea that it would be preferable that many guilty people escape consequences than a few innocents suffer them, appears as early as the narrative of the Cities of the Plain in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (at 18:23-32),&lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;Alexander Volokh, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
{{Biblesource | Genesis | 18:23 | WEB | text=Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?}} ... {{Biblesource | Genesis | 18:32 | WEB | text=What if ten are found there?" He [The Lord] said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."}}
}}

With respect to the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom,]] the text describes it as ultimately being destroyed, but only after the rescuing of most of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s family, the aforementioned "righteous" among a city or overwhelming wickedness who, despite the overwhelming guilt of their fellows, were sufficient by their mere presence to warrant a "stay of execution" of sorts for the entire region, slated to be destroyed for being uniformly a place of sin. The text continues, 

{{quote|
{{Biblesource | Genesis | 19:27-28 | WEB | text=27 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. 28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.}}

{{Biblesource | Genesis | 19:29 | WEB | text=29 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.}}
}}

Similarly, on 3 October 1692, while decrying the [[Salem witch trials]], [[Increase Mather]] adapted Fortescue's statement and wrote, "It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits |year=1693 |page= 66 |url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/mather/mather.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In current scholarship==

Particularly in the United States, Blackstone’s ratio continues to be an active source of debate in jurisprudence. For example Daniel Epps and Laura Appleman exchanged arguments against and in favour of its continuing influence in the Harvard Law Review in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Consequences of Error in Criminal Justice |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/02/the-consequences-of-error-in-criminal-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Tragedy of Errors: Blackstone, Procedural Asymmetry, and Criminal Justice |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/02/a-tragedy-of-errors-blackstone-procedural-asymmetry-and-criminal-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints in politics==
[[Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] personalities tend to take the opposite view; [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is believed to have stated that "it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape".&lt;ref name=Volokh /&gt;  [[Pol Pot]] made similar remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Locard, Henri. ''Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar''. Silkworm Books, 2004. pp. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] referenced this principle while saying that it is not applicable to the context of preventing terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub594835B672714A1DB1A121534F010EE1/Doc~E307DE59120324224ACCD7CA59A6F1C17~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Schäuble: Zur Not auch gegen Unschuldige vorgehen |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former American [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] said that his support of American use of "enhanced interrogation techniques"  against suspected terrorists was unchanged by the fact that 25% of CIA detainees subject to that treatment were later proven to be innocent, including one who died of hypothermia in [[CIA]] custody.  "I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that in fact were innocent."  Asked whether the 25% margin was too high, Cheney responded, "I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. ...  I'd do it again in a minute."&lt;ref&gt;  [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/cheney-alright-with-torture-of-innocent-people.html "Dick Cheney Simply Does Not Care That the CIA Tortured Innocent People"], ''[[New York Magazine]]''. December 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal columnist [[Ezra Klein]] supported California's SB 967 "Affirmative Consent" law with the same reasoning as Cheney's supported "enhanced interrogation techniques". While claiming the law was "terrible" and could be used to punish people who did not commit rape, Klein states "its overreach is precisely its value" and "ugly problems don't always have pretty solutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6966847/yes-means-yes-is-a-terrible-bill-and-i-completely-support-it|title="Yes Means Yes" is a terrible law, and I completely support it|first=Ezra|last=Klein|date=13 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Volokh cites an apparent questioning of the principle, with the tale of a Chinese professor who responds, "Better for whom?"&lt;ref name="Volokh"/&gt;

The '''Board of Deputies of British Jews''' (historically '''London Board of Deputies''' and '''London Committee of Deputies of British Jews'''), commonly referred to as the '''Board of Deputies''', is the main representative body of [[British Jews|the British Jewish community]]. Established in London in 1760, when seven Deputies were appointed by the elders of the [[Sephardi]] congregation of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] to form a standing committee and pay homage to [[King George III|George III]] on his accession to the throne;&lt;ref name="BODarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-ACC3121_2&amp;cid=0#0|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly thereafter the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish congregation from Central and Eastern Europe similarly appointed their own "Secret Committee for Public Affairs" to deal with any urgent political matters that might arise,&lt;ref name="RothEngl"&gt;[[Cecil Roth]], ''A History of the Jews in England'', [http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Cecil.Roth/A.History.of.the.Jews.in.England/P.10.The.Reign.of.George.III.1760-1815.htm Chapter 10, The Reign of George III, 1760–1815], 1941&lt;/ref&gt; and safeguard the interests of British Jews as a religious community, both in the British Isles, and in the colonies.&lt;ref name="JE'06"&gt;Joseph Jacobs, [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10099-london-committee-of-deputies-of-british-jews London Committee of Deputies of British Jews]&lt;/ref&gt; They soon began to meet together as occasions arose, and then on a more frequent basis; by the 1810s they appear to have united as one body.&lt;ref name="BOD-hist"&gt;[http://www.bod.org.uk/live/content.php?Category_ID=14 History of the Board] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155653/http://www.bod.org.uk/live/content.php?Category_ID=14 |date=23 October 2013 }}, Board of Deputies of British Jews&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board has since become a widely recognised forum for the views of the different sectors of the UK [[Jew]]ish community.

==Members and organisation==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
The Board is led by [[Marie van der Zyl]], who succeeded Jonathan Arkush as President in June 2018.&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/women-form-majority-of-board-of-deputies-leadership-for-the-first-time-1.464061 |title=Women form majority of Board of Deputies' leadership for the first time |last=Rocker |first=Simon |date=14 May 2018 |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief executive of the Board is [[Gillian Merron]], a former Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln from 1997 to 2010. From 2009 to 2010 she was Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health at the Department of Health. She leads a team of professional staff including Director of Public Affairs Philip Rosenberg (formerly of Faiths Forum for London).

The Board receives Deputies elected by affiliated individual synagogues, confederations of synagogues, and other organisations within the Jewish community such as charities and youth groups.  It serves as the principal reference point for government, the media and wider society.  All matters tending to impact on the life of Jews in Britain fall within the Board's remit, including an active interfaith programme. However some Jews have complained that the board speaks for Jews unaffiliated to synagogues without them being represented on the board. Some ultra-orthodox synagogues have chosen not to be affiliated.&lt;ref name=guardian-20120427&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/apr/27/board-of-deputies-british-jews-revolution |title=A weak 'revolution' at the Board of Deputies of British Jews |last=Kahn-Harris |first=Keith |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Deputies offices are co-located with the United Jewish Israel Appeal in Kentish Town.

The Board is the British affiliate of the [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organisation of Jewish communities and is the UK member of the [[European Jewish Congress]] (EJC).

===Past presidents===
[[File:Moses Montefiore 1881.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moses Montefiore]] and his family members dominated the presidency of the Board of Deputies during the 19th century. Sephardic Jews were prominent early on.]]
[[File:Walter Rothschild.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] was a president of the Board of Deputies during the early 20th century. The [[Balfour Declaration]] was addressed to him.]]
[[File:Lord janner.jpg|thumb|right|[[Greville Janner]] was a president of the Board of Deputies during the late 20th century. He was implicated in a high profile child sexual abuse scandal.]]
The most historically notable and longest-serving past president was the Victorian-era banker [[Moses Montefiore]], who in the nineteenth century travelled widely to assist Jewish communities in foreign countries, faced by persecution at the time.

===Interpal allegation===
In 2003, the Board, on its web site, reproduced an extract from a US State Department report that suggested that the aid organisation [[Palestinian Relief and Development Fund]] (Interpal) was helping to fund terrorist organisations. Interpal threatened to sue for [[libel]], whereupon the Board retracted and apologised for its comments.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Casciani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3135392.stm Islamic charity cleared of Hamas link], [[BBC News]], 24 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Casciani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4564784.stm Top Jewish group 'terror' apology], [[BBC News]], 29 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oliver Finegold affair===
The Board became involved in the [[Ken Livingstone#Oliver Finegold controversy|Oliver Finegold affair]] when the Mayor of London, [[Ken Livingstone]] made comments to a Jewish reporter, Oliver Finegold, comparing him or the newspaper he worked for, to a [[concentration camp]] guard. Many individuals and media commentators objected to the remark. Along with the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], the Board filed a complaint to the [[Standards Board for England]], calling for the Mayor to apologise to the reporter. The Mayor made a statement condemning the [[Holocaust]], but stood by his remarks to the journalist, mentioning in passing his belief that the Board of Jewish Deputies only represents a small section of the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Ros Taylor, [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/gla/story/0,,1720137,00.html "Livingstone Suspension Frozen by Judge,"] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 28 February 2006, accessed 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Statement with Muslim Council of Britain===
In 2014 at the height of the Israeli military operation in Gaza, the Board received widespread criticism in the Jewish community for a joint statement issued with the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] (MCB) condemning anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/123091/board-deputies-approves-controversial-muslim-council-britain-statement|title=Board of Deputies approves controversial Muslim Council of Britain statement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish News, 4 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The statement with its slogan ‘to export peace rather than import conflict’ proved controversial among some on the conservative wing of the Jewish community but was supported by others on the progressive wing and by groups in inter faith circles.&lt;ref&gt;Report of The Woolf Institute on Faith and Belief in Public Life, 7 December 2015 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of such a statement was approved by the Board by a majority of over 75% at a meeting of the Board on 21 September 2014. In December 2015, the new leadership of the Board distanced itself from the MCB over the latter’s alleged links to the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/board-distances-itself-from-muslim-council-of-britain-over-muslim-brotherhood-links/|title=Board distances itself from Muslim Council of Britain over Muslim Brotherhood ‘links’|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension of deputy===
In July 2018, the Board of Deputies suspended Roslyn Pine, deputy for [[Finchley United Synagogue]], for six years following comments described as Islamophobic and admitting to holding anti-Arab views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Welch |first1=Ben |title=Board suspends deputy for six years after investigation into 'Islamophobic' views |url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/board-of-deputies-suspends-roslyn-pine-1.466934 |accessdate=16 August 2018 |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Scotland's Jews==
After [[Scottish devolution]] in 1999, the [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]] was formed to give the Jewish Community of [[Scotland]] a single democratically accountable voice in dealings with the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Scottish Executive|Executive]], other communities, and other statutory and official bodies.  The intention, when it was established was for it to stand in the same relationship to the [[Scottish Government]] as the Board of Deputies of British Jews does to the UK Government.
Consequently, the Council is autonomous in matters devolved by the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]], such as justice, health and welfare, and community relations, whilst the Board of Deputies speaks for all Britain's Jews on reserved matters such as foreign affairs and equality legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8314">'''''Béarlachas''''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈbʲeːɾˠlˠəxəsˠ}}) is [[Irish language|Irish]] for "[[anglicism]]", or words and phrases used in Irish that are influenced by or stem from the [[English language|English]] language. The term comes from {{lang|ga|Béarla}}, the Irish word for the English language, and refers to both simple anglicisms and [[interlanguage]] forms. It is a result of [[bilingualism]] within a society where there is a dominant, [[Stratum (linguistics)#Superstratum|superstrate language]] (in this case, English) and a minority [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substrate language]] with few or no monolingual speakers and a perceived "lesser" status (in this case, Irish).

==Types==
''Béarlachas'' exists in many forms, from the direct translation of English phrases to the common form of creating verbal nouns from English words by adding the suffix ''-áil'' (this is also used to form verbs from native roots, such as ''trasnáil'', "cross over", from ''trasna'' "across", ''tuigeáil'' ([[Connacht]], [[Ulster]]) "understanding" ([[Munster]] ''tuiscint''), from ''tuig'' "understand", and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaeltacabac.com/7i.htm Gael-Taca website (Irish language promotion organisation) Examples of 'Béarlachas']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Táim ag runáil go dtí an siopa'' ("I'm running towards the shop") is an example of ''Béarlachas'' as "runáil" is a verb created from the English word "run" with the Irish suffix ''-áil'' attached; the traditional Irish for this would be ''Táim ag rith go dtí an siopa''.

[[Calque|Calquing]] also occurs: an English phrase is literally translated into Irish, even though an equivalent Irish phrase already exists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} An example of this is "Moilligh síos" ("slow down" – ''moill'' "delay" + ''síos'' "downwards", calqued from English), instead of the more traditional ''Maolaigh ar do luas'' ("reduce your velocity"), or simply ''Maolaigh!'' ("Slow down!").

==Old borrowings==
Many words that are commonly thought by "purists" to be ''béarlachas'' have been a part of the Irish language for a long time, and have become "nativised". True ''béarlachas'' is where the word or phrase is known to be English and is not felt to be native to the Irish language, just as in the English language certain French or Latin words and phrases are used with the speaker's full knowledge of their "non-English" status, such as ''status quo'', ''in situ'', ''plus ça change'', ''c'est la vie'' and ''coup d'état''. At the same time, certain words that are sometimes assumed to be from English are actually from [[Old Norse|Norse]] or [[Norman language|Norman French]], and as such are not ''Béarlachas''. For example:

* ''liosta'': "list" (Norman French ''liste'')
* ''aidhm'': "aim" (Norman French {{lang|nrf|aesmer}}; where ''cuspóir'' is considered by some to be the 'native' Irish word)
* ''halla'': "hall" (Norse {{lang|non|hǫll}}; the Irish word is ''áras'').
* ''véarsa'', ''béarsa'' [the ''b''- form considered to be uneducated dialect]: "verse" (Norman French ''verse'' {{IPA-xx|ˈβʲeːrsə|}}; the Irish word is ''rann'')

Other words are 'early Béarlachas', having entered the language in the 18th and 19th centuries:

* ''praghas'': "price" (also possibly from Norman French ''preis'', ''pris'')
* ''dabht'': "doubt" (the Irish words are: ''amhras'', ''gó'')

==Modern concepts==
{{Confusing|section|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- Without saying which words derive from which and what they meant originally, I can't get the point of this section. --&gt;

Words used for foreign inventions, imports, and so on, where a native Irish word does not exist, are often a [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] import as well. These are strictly speaking not ''béarlachas'', but examples of loans from foreign languages. In some cases an Irish word has been developed, and in others it has not. This has been a characteristic of word development in the language for as long as written records exist, and is not limited to ''béarlachas''. In some cases the original Irish word is no longer known, or has a different meaning within the same semantic field:

Modern forms:
* ''fón'', ''guthán'' "phone"
* ''carr'', ''gluaisteán'' "car" &lt;!--BTW, it's actually Romance "carre" that comes from Celtic "karros", not the other way round. --&gt;
* ''badhsuiceal'', ''rothar'' "bicycle"

Older forms:
* ''iarla'' (Norse ''jarl''), ''[[tiarna]]'' (Irish) "lord, earl"
* ''póg'' (Old Welsh ''pawg''&lt;!-- meaning "peace" or "kiss"? --&gt;, Latin ''(osculum) pacis'' "(kiss of) peace") "kiss"
* ''bád'' (Old Norse), ''currach'' (Irish) "boat"
* ''garsún'' (Munster), ''gasúr'' (Connacht, Ulster), from [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|garçon}} "small boy", ''buachaill'' (Irish) "teenager, youth"

==Variation==
In some cases, the foreign loan has an official pronunciation in Irish, and a colloquial one based on English; the colloquial form is ''Béarlachas'', while official form is a [[Gaelicisation]] of the foreign word:

* ''ceint'' ({{IPA-ga|kʲenʲtʲ, sˠɛnʲtʲ}}) "cent"
* ''bus'' ({{IPA-ga|bˠʊsˠ, bˠosˠ}}) "bus"
* ''stádas'' ({{IPA-ga|ˈsˠt̪ˠaːd̪ˠəsˠ, ˈsˠt̪ˠat̪ˠəs, ˈsˠt̪ˠeit̪ˠəsˠ}}, {{IPA-all|ˈsˠt̪ˠæt̪ˠəs, ˈʃt̪ˠæt̪ˠəsˠ|also}}) "status"

The most striking forms of ''Béarlachas'', however, are the names of the letters of the alphabet—the vast majority of which are normally said in the English way, except for {{angbr|a}}—as well as the use of words such as ''bhuel'' ("well"), ''dheas'' ("yes"), ''no'' ("no"), ''jost'' ("just"), ''dhiúnó'' ("you know" – for ''tá's agat'') and ''álraight'' ("all right" – for ''go maith''). Such words are used with their English syntax in Irish:

*'' ''Bhuel'', fanfa mé ''jost'' anseo, ''dhiúnó'', go dtioca tú ar ais.
*Well, I'll just wait here, you know, till you come back.
*''{{'}}bhFuil tú ''álraight'' ansan, a bhuachaill? - ''No'', nílim ''álraight'' anaonchor.''
* Are you all right there, lad? - No, I'm not all right at all.

Letters that are not traditionally used in [[Irish orthography]] occur (such as {{angbr|j, k, q, v, w, x, y, z}}, as well as {{angbr|h}} at the beginning of words), though in older ''Béarlachas'' words the foreign sounds have been [[Gaelicization|gaelicised]]:

* Jab: Job (beside ''post'' from French, ''obair'' from Latin)
* Zú, Sú: Zoo (where ''gairdín ainmhithe'' already exists)
* w &gt; bh / v: bhálcaereacht, válcaereacht "strolling, walking"

Most words that begin with {{angbr|p}} in the language are also foreign loans, as {{angbr|p}} did not exist in prehistoric or early Old Irish (such as ''póg'' "kiss" (Old Welsh ''pawg'', Latin ''pacem'' "peace"), ''peaca'' (Latin ''pecatum'' "sin").

==Use in Republicanism==
Between the 1970s and the 1990s, [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] prisoners in Long Kesh (now [[HM Prison Maze]]) spoke in Irish. They [[nickname]]d the place "An Gaoltacht", a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] replacing the first syllable of the Irish "[[Gaeltacht]]" (Irish-speaking region) with the English "gaol/jail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishlanguage.net/irish/history.asp IrishLanguage.net - History of the Irish Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought by some that the Republican slogan ''[[Tiocfaidh ár lá]]'' ("Our day will come") is a form of ''Béarlachas'', more idiomatic equivalents being ''Beidh ár lá linn'' ("Our day will be with us") or ''Beidh ár lá againn'' ("We will have our day"). However, the verb ''teacht'', meaning "come", is often used in a variety of phrases to express the "coming" of days, such as ''tháinig an lá go raibh orm an t-oileán d’fhágaint'' ("the day came when I had to leave the island)".

==Similar phenomenon in Scottish Gaelic==
The same concept also exists within [[Scottish Gaelic]], in which language it is referred to as {{lang|gd|[[Beurlachas]]}}. Some examples include:

* ''stòraidh'', "story" (instead of ''sgeulachd'')
* ''gèam'', "game" (instead of ''cluiche'')
* ''tidsear'', "teacher" (instead of the older ''mùin(t)ear'')
* ''nurs'', "nurse" (instead of ''banaltram'')

The '''Centrist Alliance''' ({{lang-fr|Alliance centriste}}) ('''AC''') is a [[centrism|centrist]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[list of political parties in France|political party]] in [[France]].

It was founded in June 2009 by [[Jean Arthuis]], a former member of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/2009-06-27/nouveau-parti-politique-jean-arthuis-elu-president-d-alliance-centriste/917/0/356408|title= Jean Arthuis élu président d'"Alliance centriste"|publisher= Le Point.fr|date= 27 June 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently Member of [[European parliament]], where he also serves as chair of the Committee on Budgets.

The party is seen as a successor to Arthuis' [[Rally the Centrists]] (''Rassembler les centristes'') political association, whose main tenet was to re-create the UDF which was dissolved upon creation of the [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] and the [[New Centre]].

Because of Arthuis' high standing within the [[Centrist and Republican Union|Centrist Union]] group in the French Senate, the AC has ten Senators but only two deputies.

'''''Confrontation at Concordia''''' is a documentary film by Martin Himel which documents the [[2002 Netanyahu protest at Concordia University|September 2002 protest]] at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7074/is_16/ai_n28249285/pg_2/?tag=content;col1|title=The debate on Canadian campuses: bringing back democracy and the spirit of scholarship|first=Howard|last=Stein|journal=Inroads: A Journal of Opinion|volume=Winter-Spring|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film chronicles how pro-[[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian]] student activists staged a [[direct action]] aimed to cancel the former [[Israel]]i [[Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s address on campus. The talk by the prime minister had been organized by [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]], a Jewish student organization.&lt;ref name="CAMERA_c46r9"&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=46&amp;x_review=9 Confrontation @ Concordia] ([[CAMERA]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="film_xscript"&gt;{{cite video| people =Martin Himmel| title =Confrontation at Concordia (documentary)}} [http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2004/040511appendixA.pdf Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711055139/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2004/040511appendixA.pdf |date=2012-07-11 }} (Appendix A to CIII-TV (Global Television) re Confrontation at Concordia (CBSC Decision 02/03-1340, -1368, -1514 and -1530, April 26, 2004))&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary portrays the events that took place in a negative light, and reportedly contributed to the ensuing media debate over them. The Concordia Student Union (CSU) responded by taking legal action against its producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcpa.org/article/anti-israeli-activity-at-concordia-university-2000-2003/ Anti-Israeli Activity at Concordia University 2000-2003] by Corinne Berzon, [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The documentary opens with scenes of the violence at the event, depicting fighting between protesters and Jewish students attempting to enter the venue. This is followed by an interview with student Samir Elitrosh, a leader of the Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and the leader of anti-Israel violence who was later suspended. It also features interviews with Concordia's Hillel president Yoni Petel and Concordia rector Frederick Lowy, and concludes with a discussion of what it sees as the growing trend of anti-Israel activities on North American campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/Aug03/archives03Aug22-03.html Film examines violence. Professor offers ways to counter hate on campuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162032/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/Aug03/archives03Aug22-03.html |date=2007-09-28 }} by Kyle Berger (Jewish Independent) August 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary presents footage of pro-Palestinian activists breaking windows and pushing and shoving to block the only entry to the lecture hall.&lt;ref name=CAMERA_c46r9/&gt; The pro-Palestinian students had objected strongly to Netanyahu's attempt to give scheduled speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=8166 Charges against Netanyahu protester dropped]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} By Janice Arnold (Canadian Jewish News)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a segment of the film [[Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] described the conduct of Concordia students:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... what you have is an implantation in North America of this same unforgiving fanaticism that says "we will not allow the engagement of a contest of ideas, we will not allow a free market of ideas," which is precisely a microcosm of the problem that we have in these societies that spawn and produce terrorism. They rigidly control what their people hear and see so that they can control what they think and feel. And this is the essence of the problem. If the real solution to this fanaticism is ventilation, the aeration of various ideas, then you got a whiff of the underlying root cause of terrorism in Concordia. That is the unwillingness to have a free exchange of ideas. The root cause of terrorism is [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref name=film_xscript/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the film, Thomas Hecht, a former member of the Board of Governors of Concordia University and a [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor, states:

{{quote|This was [[antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. I was the object of their hatred ... which expressed itself with placards; with a kind of venom which I have not seen on the streets of a city since the horrible days of occupied, Nazi-occupied Europe. What happened on the 9th of September was really a dark day for Concordia. And I think that the university will have to suffer the consequences of this. It will not come, the change will not come from one day to the other. The perception of Concordia will not be that of an institution where [[freedom of speech]] can be freely expressed. Because the way these thugs behaved was not any better than the people who were condemned for such behaviour in 1939 in Europe.

When I tried to enter, somebody approached me with a masked person. They had a hood or something, or a burka, or a shador on, I don't know if it was man or a woman and they kicked me in the groin. They spat on me. I felt as though I was in Bratislava in 1939 again, where they also spat on me because I was a Jew. But that was Czechoslovakia under German occupation and I was experiencing something which I thought would never happen again: that I was guilty of something because I was Jewish. I was guilty of wanting to hear a speech.&lt;ref name=film_xscript/&gt;}}

In response to allegations of [[antisemitism]], Elitrosh, leader of the Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, averred that one can be anti-Israel without being antisemitic. He stated that "Judaism existed before the state of Israel."&lt;ref name=CAMERA_c46r9/&gt;

==Controversy==
The film set off a series of debates regarding student politics and whether anti-Israeli/pro-Palestinian political rallies on campuses were anti-Semitic.

===Criticism===
Antonia Zebisias, media critic of the ''Toronto Star'' criticized the documentary for making hyperbolic comparisons between the riot and [[Kristallnacht]], for giving the president of Hillel more air time than was given to the Palestinian side, and for not supporting many of its contentions with facts. It also noted the potential conflict of interests due to the fact that the film was aired on [[Global TV]] which is owned by CanWest, the media outlet which in part helped organize the invitation of Netanyahu to speak.&lt;ref name="Global Documentary Seems Unfair"&gt;[http://friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles06290301.asp Global Documentary Seems Unfair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004072635/http://www.friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles06290301.asp |date=2006-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the documentary was broadcast on ''Global Television'', [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) received a number of complaints relating to the program. The complaints were considered under the provisions of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters' (CAB) Code of Ethics and the Radio and Television News Directors Association of Canada (RTNDA) Code of (Journalistic) Ethics.  The CBSC concluded that none of the provisions of the either the CAB Code of Ethics or the RTNDA Code of (Journalistic) Ethics were breached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/decisions/2004/040511.htm CIII-TV (Global Television) re Confrontation at Concordia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422193005/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/decisions/2004/040511.htm |date=2005-04-22 }} Canadian Broadcast Standards Council National Conventional Television Panel. (CBSC Decision 02/03-1340, -1368, -1514 and -1530). Decided April 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Himel has defended the film, arguing that "In my Concordia, we did interview the Arab student, as well as the Jewish student leader Patrick Amar. But [[Discordia (film)|Discordia]], besides interviewing Elatrash, interviewed a [[self-hating Jew]] who agreed with the Arabs. There was no interview with Amar or any other self-respecting Jewish spokesperson."&lt;ref name=bnaibrith1&gt;[http://www.bnaibrith.ca/article.php?id=590 Documentary Producer Martin Himel Keynote Speaker at Jabotinsky Memorial] by Rick Kardonne, B'nai Brith Canada, August 6, 2004, archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20101213193028/http://bnaibrith.ca/article.php?id=590 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constituencies in Singapore''' are electoral divisions which may be represented by single or multiple seats in the [[Parliament of Singapore]]. Constituencies are classified as either Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) or [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituencies]] (GRCs). SMCs are single-seat constituencies but GRCs have between four and six seats in Parliament.

==Group Representation Constituencies==
{{main|Group Representation Constituency}}

Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) are a type of electoral constituency unique to [[Singapore]]an politics. GRCs are multi-member constituencies which are contested by teams of candidates from one party - or from independents. In each GRC, at least one candidate or Member of Parliament must be from a [[demographics of Singapore|minority race]]: either a [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] or Other.&lt;ref name="HussinMutalib"&gt;Hussin Mutalib, 'Constituational-Electoral Reforms and Politics in Singapore', ''Legislative Studies Quarterly'' 21 (2) (2002), p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) amended the Parliamentary Elections Act&lt;ref&gt;Now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create GRCs. The current Act enables the [[President of Singapore|President]], acting on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], to create a GRC from three to six electoral wards. In creating GRCs the President is advised by the [[Elections Department]]. The initial maximum size for GRCs was three candidates, but this has subsequently been increased. In the 1991 Singaporean general election, the maximum number of candidates was raised from three to four. In 1997 the maximum number of candidates was further raised to six.&lt;ref name="HussinMutalib" /&gt;

GRCs operate with a [[plurality voting system]], voting by party slate, meaning that the party with the largest share of votes wins all seats in the GRC. (This means that even with a one-vote plurality or majority, the winning team gets to win the whole GRC.) All Singaporean GRCs have had a PAP base.

The official justification for GRCs is to allow minority representation. Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong argued that the introduction of GRCs was necessary to ensure that Singapore's Parliament would continue to be multiracial in its composition and representation.&lt;ref&gt;Hussin Mutalib, 'Constituational-Electoral Reforms and Politics in Singapore', ''Legislative Studies Quarterly'' 21 (2) (2002), p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposition parties have criticized GRCs as making it even more difficult for non-PAP candidates to be elected to Parliament. The money required to contest a GRC is considerable as each candidate is required to pay a S$16,000 deposit.&lt;ref name="HussinMutalib" /&gt;  This means that contesting a GRC is very costly for opposition parties. The presence of Cabinet Ministers in GRCs is often believed to give the PAP a considerable advantage in the contesting of a GRC. The PAP has used this tactic to its advantage on several occasions. Rather than stand in an uncontested GRC, in 1997, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong shifted his candidacy to where the PAP believed they were most vulnerable, which was the Cheng San GRC.&lt;ref&gt;Hussin Mutalib, 'Constituational-Electoral Reforms and Politics in Singapore', ''Legislative Studies Quarterly'' 21 (2) (2002), p. 666.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition has charged the government with [[gerrymandering]] due to the changing of GRC boundaries at very short notice (see below section on electoral boundaries).

Critics have noted that [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam]] won the 1981 Anson by-election in a Chinese-majority constituency, and that since the GRC system was implemented, minority representation in Parliament has actually declined.

==Boundaries and gerrymandering allegations==
The boundaries of electoral constituencies in Singapore are decided by the Elections Department, which is under the control of the Prime Minister's Office.&lt;ref name="AlexAu"&gt;Alex Au Waipang, 'The Ardour of Tokens: Opposition Parties' Struggle to Make a Difference', in T.Chong (eds), '' Management of Success: Singapore Revisited ''(Singapore, 2010), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  Electoral boundaries are generally announced close to elections, usually a few days before the election itself is announced.&lt;ref name="AlexAu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane K. Mauzy and R.S. Milne, '' Singapore Under the People's Action Party ''(London, 2002), p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been accusations of [[gerrymandering]] regarding the redrawing of electoral boundaries and the dissolving of constituencies that return a high percentage of votes for parties other than the ruling PAP.&lt;ref name="BilveerSingh"&gt;Bilveer Singh, ''Politics and Governance in Singapore: An Introduction ''(Singapore, 2007), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the cases that is often cited as evidence for gerrymandering in Singapore is the case of the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency (GRC). In the [[Singaporean general election, 1997|1997 Singaporean general election]], the [[Cheng San GRC]] was contested by the PAP and the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]] (WP). The final results were close, with the PAP winning by 53,553 votes (54.8%) to the WP's 44,132 votes (45.2%). Cheng San GRC had since dissolved thereafter following the [[Singapore general election, 2001|2001 General Elections]]. Despite the disadvantages assumed by the opposition party in Singapore, the Workers' Party of Singapore would later be successful in taking over a GRC ([[Aljunied GRC]]) during the [[Singapore general election, 2011|2011 General Elections]]&lt;ref name="BilveerSingh" /&gt;, and would later hold on for another term in the [[Singapore general election, 2015|subsequent election in 2015]] despite winning a tight margin of less than 2%.

{{Fascism sidebar}}

'''Crypto-fascism''' is the secret support for, or admiration of, [[fascism]].  The term is used to imply that an individual or group keeps this support or admiration hidden to avoid [[political persecution]] or [[political suicide]].  The common usage is "crypto-fascist", one who practices this support.

The term is sometimes credited{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} to [[Gore Vidal#Politics|Gore Vidal]], though the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites several earlier uses, including ''[[The Guardian]]'' using the term more than once in the 1920s. In an [[ABC Television|ABC]] television debate during the chaos of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], Vidal described [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] as a "crypto-[[Nazism|Nazi]]", later correcting himself as meaning to say "crypto-fascist". However, the term had appeared five years earlier in a German-language book by the sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno]], ''Der getreue Korrepetitor'' (The Faithful Répétiteur).&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol.&amp;nbsp;15, p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was famously used by German Nobel laureate [[Heinrich Böll]] in a 1972 essay (titled "{{Interlanguage link multi|Will Ulrike Gnade oder freies Geleit?|de}}")&lt;ref name=spiegelboell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43019376.html |title=Will Ulrike Gnade oder freies Geleit? Schriftsteller Heinrich Böll über die Baader-Meinhof-Gruppe und "Bild" |last1=Böll |first1=Heinrich |date=1972-01-10 |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |access-date=2016-02-03 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was sharply critical of the tabloid newspaper [[Bild]]'s coverage of the [[Baader-Meinhof Gang]] left-wing terrorist organization. In the essay, Böll stated that what ''Bild'' does "isn’t cryptofascist anymore, not fascistoid, but naked fascism. Agitation, lies, dirt."&lt;ref name=spiegelboell/&gt;

[[File:Shtokavian subdialects1988 incl Slovenia.png|thumb|right|250px|Shtokavian subdialects (Pavle Ivić, 1988). Yellow is the widespread Eastern Herzegovinian subdialect that forms the basis of all national standards, though it is not spoken natively in any of the capital cities.]]
The '''dialects of Serbo-Croatian''' include the regional [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]] as a whole or as part of its standard varieties: [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. They are part of the [[dialect continuum]] of [[South Slavic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Crystal|1998|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Alexander|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that joins the [[Dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialects]] to the south, [[Bulgarian dialects]] to the southeast and [[Slovene dialects]] to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Matasović 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary dialects are named after the most common question word for ''what'': [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian (''štokavski'')]] uses the pronoun ''što'' or ''šta'', [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian (''čakavski'')]] uses ''ča'' or ''ca'', [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian (''kajkavski'')]], ''kaj'' or ''kej''. The pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language and all four contemporary standard variants [[Ausbausprache#Interrelation of the abstand and ausbau statuses|are based]] on the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]] subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt| Brozović |1992|pp=347–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt| Blum |2002|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kordić|2010|pp=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other dialects are not taught in schools or used by the state media. The [[Torlakian dialect]] is often added to the list, though sources usually note that it is a transitional dialect between Shtokavian and the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects. [[Burgenland Croatian]] and [[Slavomolisano language|Molise Slavic]] are varieties of the Chakavian dialect spoken outside the South Slavic dialect continuum, which combine influences from other dialects of Serbo-Croatian as well as influences from the dominantly spoken local languages.

Another common distinction among the dialects is made through the reflex of the long [[Proto-Slavic language|Common Slavic]] vowel ''[[yat|jat]]'' and thus the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of ''jat'' being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively.

{{South Slavic languages sidebar}}

=== Shtokavian dialect ===
{{main|Shtokavian dialect}}

==== History ====
The Proto-Štokavian idiom appeared in the 12th century. In the following century or two, Štokavian was divided into two zones: western, which covered the major part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slavonia]] in [[Croatia]], and eastern, dominant in easternmost [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and greater parts of [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]]. Western Štokavian was principally characterized by three-accentual system, while eastern Štokavian was marked by two-accentual system. According to research of historical linguistics, the Old-Štokavian was well established by the mid-15th century. In this period it was still being mixed with Church Slavonic to varying degrees, as geographically transitory to Čakavian and Kajkavian dialects spoken on the territory of today's Croatia, with which it had constituted a natural [[dialectal continuum]].

==== Distributrion and subdialects ====
[[File:Dijalekti-Štokavskog-narečja.svg|thumb|right|230px|Map of Shtokavian dialects]]
Originally the dialect covered a significantly smaller area than it covers today, meaning that the Štokavian speech had spread for the last five centuries, overwhelmingly at the expense of Čakavian and Kajkavian idioms. Modern areal distribution of these three dialects as well as their internal stratification (Štokavian and Čakavian in particular) is primarily a result of the [[Human migration|migrations]] resulting from the spread of [[Ottoman Empire]] on the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Okuka|2008|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migratory waves were particularly strong in the 16th–18th century, bringing about large-scale linguistic and ethnic changes on the Central South Slavic area (See: [[Great Serb Migrations]]).

By far the most numerous, mobile and expansionist migrations were those of Ijekavian Štokavian speakers of eastern [[Herzegovina]], who have flooded most of Western Serbia, many areas of eastern and western [[Bosnia]], large swathes of Croatia ([[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Kordun]], [[Lika]], parts of [[Gorski kotar]], continental parts of northern [[Dalmatia]], some places north of [[Kupa]], parts of [[Slavonia]], southeastern [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Okuka|2008|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason why [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] is the most spoken Serbo-Croatian dialect today, and why it bears the name that is only descriptive of its area of origin. These migrations also played the pivotal role in the spread of Neo-Štokavian innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Okuka|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shtokavian dialect is divided into Old Shtokavian and Neo-Shtokavian subdialects. Subdialects grouped under Old-Shtokavian are the following:
* [[Slavonian dialect]] (also called ''Archaic Šćakavian'').
* [[East Bosnian dialect]] (also called ''Jekavian-šćakavian'');
* [[Zeta–South Raška dialect]] (also called ''Đekavian-Ijekavian'');
* [[Kosovo–Resava dialect]] (also called ''Older Ekavian'');
* [[Prizren-Timok dialect]] (also called ''Old-Serbian'')

Neo-Shtokavian dialects comprise the following subdialects:
* [[Bosnian–Dalmatian dialect]] (also called ''Western Ikavian'' or ''Younger Ikavian'');
** [[Bunjevac dialect]];
* [[Dubrovnik subdialect|Dubrovnik dialect]] (also called ''Western (I)jekavian'');
* [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] (also called ''Neo-Ijekavian'');
** [[Užican dialect]] (also called ''Zlatibor dialect'');
* [[Šumadija–Vojvodina dialect]] (also called ''Younger Ekavian'');
** [[Smederevo–Vršac dialect]].

==== Characteristics ====
Shtokavian is characterized by a number of characteristic historical [[sound change]]s, [[Accent (dialect)|accentual]] changes, changes in [[inflection]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]]. Some of these isoglosses are not exclusive and have also been shared by neighboring dialects, and some of them have only overwhelmingly but not completely been spread on the whole Štokavian area. The differences between Štokavian and the neighboring Eastern South Slavic dialects of [[Bulgaria]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] are clear and largely shared with other Western South Slavic dialects, while the differences to the neighboring Western South Slavic dialect of Čakavian and Kajkavian are much more fluid in character, and the mutual influence of various subdialects and idioms play a more prominent role.

General characteristics of Štokavian are the following:&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvcoltxt|Lisac|2003|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[wikt:što#Serbo-Croatian|što]]'' or ''[[wikt:šta#Serbo-Croatian|šta]]'' as the demonstrative/interrogative pronoun;
# differentiation between two short (in addition to two or three long) accents, rising and falling, though not in all Štokavian speakers;
# preservation of unaccented length, but not consistently across all speeches;
# ''/u/'' as the reflex of Common Slavic back nasal vowel ''/ǫ/'' as well as the syllabic ''/l/'' (with the exception of central Bosnia where a diphthongal ''/uo/'' is also recorded as a reflex);
# initial group of ''v-'' + [[Havlík's law|weak semivowel]] yields ''u-'' (e.g. ''[[wikt:unuk#Serbo-Croatian|unuk]]'' &lt; Common Slavic *vъnukъ);
# [[schwa]] resulting from the ''jer'' merger yields ''/a/'', with the exception of Zeta-South Sandžak dialect;
# [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] of ''vьse'' to ''sve'';
# ''čr-'' &gt; ''cr-'', with the exception of Slavonian, Molise and Vlachia (Gradišće) dialect;
# word-final ''-l'' changes to ''/o/'' or ''/a/''; the exception is verbal adjective in the Slavonian southwest;
# ''&lt;nowiki&gt;d'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' &gt; /dʑ/ (&lt;đ&gt;) with numerous exceptions
# ''cr'' &gt; ''tr'' in the word ''[[wikt:trešnja#Serbo-Croatian|trešnja]]'' "cherry"; some exceptions in Slavonia, Hungary and Romania;
# /ć/ and /đ/ from ''jt'', ''jd'' (e.g. ''[[wikt:poći#Serbo-Croatian|poći]]'', ''pođem''); exceptions in Slavonian and Eastern Bosnian dialect;
# so-called "new iotation" of dentals and labials, with many exceptions, especially in Slavonia and Bosnia;
# general loss of phoneme ''/x/'', with many exceptions;
# ending ''-ā'' in genitive plural of masculine and feminine nouns, with many exceptions;
# ending ''-u'' in locative singular of masculine and neuter nouns (e.g. ''u gradu'', ''u m(j)estu'');
# infix ''-ov-'' / ''-ev-'' in the plural of most monosyllabic masculine nouns, with many exceptions (e.g. in the area between Neretva and Dubrovnik);
# [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] of dative, locative and instrumental plural of nouns, with many exceptions;
# preservation of ending ''-og(a)'' in genitive and accusative singular of masculine and neuter gender if pronominal-adjectival declension (e.g. ''drugoga''), with exceptions on the area of Dubrovnik and Livno;
# special form with the ending ''-a'' for the neuter gender in nominative plural of pronominal-adjectival declension (e.g. ''ova m(j)esta'' and no ''ove m(j)esta'');
# preservation of [[aorist]], which is however missing in some areas (e.g. around Dubrovnik);
# special constructs reflecting old dual for numerals 2–4 (''dva, tri, četiri stola'');
# lots of so-called "Turkisms"  (''turcizmi'') or "Orientalisms", i.e. words borrowed from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].

As can be seen from the list, many of these isoglosses are missing from certain Štokavian idioms, just as many of them are shared with neighboring non-Štokavian dialects.

Chakavian is the oldest written Serbo-Croatian dialect that had made a visible appearance in legal documents - as early as 1275 ("Istrian land survey") and 1288 ("Vinodol codex"), the predominantly vernacular Chakavian is recorded, mixed with elements of Church Slavic. Archaic Chakavian can be traced back to 1105 in the [[Baška tablet]]. All these and other early Chakavian texts up to 17th century are mostly written in [[Glagolitic alphabet]].

==== Distribution and subdialects ====
[[File:Croatia Dialects Cakavian.svg|thumb|right|180px|Distribution of the Chakavian dialect at the end of the 20th century]]
Initially, the Chakavian dialect covered a much wider area than today including about two thirds of medieval [[Croatia]]: the major part of central and southern Croatia southwards of [[Kupa]] and westwards of [[Una (Sava)|Una river]], as well as western and southwestern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. During and after the Ottoman intrusion and subsequent warfare (15th–18th centuries), the Chakavian area has become greatly reduced and in the Croatian mainland it has recently been almost entirely replaced by Shtokavian, so it is now spoken in a much smaller coastal area than indicated above.

Chakavian is now mostly reduced in southwestern Croatia along the eastern Adriatic: Adriatic islands, and sporadically in the mainland coast, with rare inland enclaves up to central Croatia, and minor enclaves in Austria and Montenegro.
* The majority of Adriatic islands are Chakavian, except the easternmost ones ([[Mljet]] and [[Elafiti]]); and easternmost areas of [[Hvar]] and [[Brač]], as well as the area around the city of [[Korčula (town)|Korčula]] on the island of [[Korčula]].
* Its largest mainland area is the subentire [[Istria]] peninsula, and Kvarner littoral and islands; minor coastal enclaves occur sporadically in the Dalmatian mainland around [[Zadar]], [[Biograd]], [[Split (city)|Split]], and in [[Pelješac]] peninsula.
* Within the Croatian inland, its major area is the Gacka valley, and minor enclaves occur in Pokupje valley and [[Žumberak]] hills, northwards around [[Karlovac]].
* Chakavians outside Croatia: minor enclave of [[Bigova]] (Trašte) at [[Boka Kotorska]] in Montenegro, the mixed [[Čičarija dialect]] in Slovenia, refugees from the Turks in [[Burgenland]] (eastern Austria) and SW Slovakia, and recent emigrants in North America (chiefly in [[New Orleans]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Vancouver]]).

The Chakavian dialect comprises the following subdialects:
* [[Buzet dialect]];
* [[Middle Chakavian]];
* [[Northern Chakavian]];
* [[Southern Chakavian]];
* [[Southeastern Chakavian]];
* [[Southwest Istrian]].

==== Characteristics ====
There is no generally accepted opinion on the set of characteristics a dialect has to possess to be classified as Chakavian (rather than its admixture with Shtokavian or Kajkavian), but the following characteristics are most commonly proposed:

* interrogatory pronoun is ''"ča"'' or ''"zač"'' (in some islands also ''"ca"'' or ''"zace''");
* old accentuation and 3 accents (mostly in ultima or penultima);
* phonological features that yield /a/ for Old Slavic phonemes in characteristic positions: "language" is ''jazik'' (or zajik) in Chakavian and ''jezik'' in Shtokavian;
* "j" replacing the Shtokavian "đ" (dj): for "between", Chakavian ''meju'', Shtokavian ''među'';
* "m" shifts to "n" at the end of words: standard Croatian ''volim'' ("I love"), ''sam'' ("I am"), ''selom'' ("village" - Instrumental case) become Chakavian ''volin'', ''san'', ''selon''.
* in conditional occur specific prefixes: ''bin-, biš-, bimo-, bite-'', ''bis''
* contracted or lacking aorist tense;
* some subdialects on island of Pag have kept the archaic form of imperfect

Besides the usual Chakavian (with typical pronoun "ča"), in some Adriatic islands and in eastern Istra another special variant is also spoken which lacks most palatals, with other parallel deviations called ''"tsakavism"'' (cakavizam):
* palatal "č" is replaced by the sibilant "ts" (c): pronouns '''ca''' and ''zac'' (or ''ce'' and ''zace'');
* palatals ''š'' (sh) and ''ž'' (zh) are replaced by sibilants ''s'' and ''z'' (or transitive sj and zj);
* ''đ'' (dj), ''lj'' and ''nj'' are replaced by the simple ''d, l'' and ''n'' (without [[iotation]]);
* frequent ''diphthongs'' instead of simple vowels: o &gt; ''uo,'' a &gt; ''oa,'' e &gt; ''{{not a typo|ie}}'', etc.;
* ''Yat'' (jat): longer ''y'' (= ue) exists in addition to the usual short ''i'' (or e);
* appurtenance is often noted by possessive ''dative'' (rarely adjective nor genitive);
* vocative is mostly lacking and replaced by a nominative in appellating construction;
* auxiliary particles are always before the main verb: ''se-'' (self), ''bi-'' (if), ''će-'' (be).

The largest area of tsakavism is in eastern Istra at Labin, Rabac and a dozen nearby villages; minor mainland enclaves are the towns Bakar and Trogir. Tsakavism is also frequent in Adriatic islands: part of Lošinj and nearby islets, Baška in Krk, Pag town, the western parts of Brač ([[Milna]]), Hvar town, and subentire Vis with adjacent islets.

=== Kajkavian dialect ===
{{main|Kajkavian dialect}}

==== History ====
Dialectogical investigations of the Kajkavian dialect had begun at the end of the 19th century: the first comprehensive monograph was written in Russian by Ukrainian philologist A. M. Lukjanenko in 1905 (''Kajkavskoe narečie''). Kajkavian is not only a folk dialect, but in the course of history of Serbo-Croatian it has been the written public language (along with the corpus written in Čakavian and Štokavian). Kajkavian was the last to appear on the scene, mainly due to economic and political reasons. Although the first truly vernacular Serbo-Croatian texts (i.e. not mixed with Church Slavonic) go back to the 13th century (Chakavian) and to the 14th century (Shtokavian), the first Kajkavian published work was ''Pergošić'''s "Decretum" from 1574. After that, numerous works appeared in Serbo-Croatian Kajkavian literary language in the following centuries.

Kajkavian literary language gradually fell into disuse since [[Croatian National Revival]], ca. 1830–1850, when leaders of the Croatian National Unification Movement (the majority of them being Kajkavian native speakers themselves) adopted the most widespread and developed Serbo-Croatian Shtokavian literary language as the basis for the Croatian standard language. However, after a period of lethargy, the 20th century has witnessed new flourishing of literature in Kajkavian dialect&amp;nbsp;– this time as Croatian dialectal poetry, main authors being [[Antun Gustav Matoš]], [[Miroslav Krleža]], [[Ivan Goran Kovačić]], [[Dragutin Domjanić]], [[Nikola Pavić]] etc. Nowadays, Kajkavian lexical treasure is being published by the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in "Rječnik hrvatskoga kajkavskoga književnoga jezika"/''Dictionary of the Croatian Kajkavian Literary Language'', 8 volumes (1999).

==== Distribution and subdialects ====
Kajkavian is spoken in [[North Croatia]], including the capital [[Zagreb]], as well as in a few enclaves in [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Though its speakers are ethnic Croats and Kajkavian is thus generally considered a dialect of Serbo-Croatian, it is closer to neighboring [[Slovene language|Slovene]] than it is to Chakavian or Shtokavian.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Greenberg, 1996, ''The Role of Language in the Creation of Identity: Myths in Linguistics among the Peoples of the Former Yugoslavia''. [http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/969/1/yugoslav_myths96.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kajkavian area of Croatia is bordered on the northwest by [[Slovene language]] territory. It is bordered on the east and southeast by Shtokavian dialects roughly along a line that was the former division between [[Civil Croatia]] and the [[Habsburg]] [[Military Frontier]]; in southwest along Kupa and Dobra rivers, it persisted in ancient (medieval) contact with Chakavian dialects.

The major cities in northern Croatia with prevailing urban Kajkavians are chiefly Zagreb (old central city, Sesvete and V. Gorica), Koprivnica, Krapina, Križevci, Varaždin, Čakovec, etc. The typical and archaic Kajkavian is today spoken chiefly in [[Zagorje]] hills and [[Medjimurje]] plain, and in adjacent areas of northwestern Croatia where other immigrants and Štokavian standard had much less influence. The most peculiar Kajkavian archidiom ''(Baegnunski)'' is spoken at [[Bednja]] in northernmost Croatia. The mixed half-Kajkavian towns along the eastern and southern edge of Kajkavian speaking area are [[Pitomača]], [[Čazma]], [[Kutina]], [[Popovača]], [[Sunja, Sisak-Moslavina County|Sunja]], [[Petrinja]], [[Ozalj]], [[Ogulin]], [[Fužine, Croatia|Fužine]], and [[Čabar]], with included newer Štokavian enclaves of [[Bjelovar]], [[Sisak]], [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]], [[Dubrava, Zagreb]] and [[Novi Zagreb]]. The southernmost Kajkavian villages are [[Krapje, Croatia|Krapje]] at [[Jasenovac, Sisak-Moslavina County|Jasenovac]]; and [[Pavušek]], [[Dvorišče]] and [[Hrvatsko selo]] in Zrinska Gora.&lt;ref&gt;R. Fureš &amp; A. Jembrih: ''Kajkavski u povijesnom i sadašnjem obzorju'' p.&amp;nbsp;548, Zabok 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Kajkavian dialects have been classified along various criteria: Serbian philologist [[Aleksandar Belić]] had divided (1927) the Kajkavian dialect according to the reflexes of Proto-Slavic phonemes /tj/ and /DJ/ into three subdialects: eastern, northwestern and southwestern. However, later investigations have not corroborated Belić's division. Contemporary Kajkavian dialectology originates mainly from Croatian philologist [[Stjepan Ivšić]]'s work "Jezik Hrvata kajkavaca"/The Language of Kajkavian Croats, 1936, which is based on accentuation characteristics. Due to great diversity of Kajkavian speech, primarily in phonetics, phonology and morphology – the Kajkavian dialectological atlas is notable for its bewildering proliferation of subdialects: from four identified by Ivšić, up to six proposed by Croatian linguist [[Dalibor Brozović|Brozović]] (formerly accepted division) and even as many as fifteen, according to a monograph authored by Croatian linguist [[Mijo Lončarić]] (1995).

The most commonly accepted division of Kajkavian dialect lists the following subdialects:
* [[Zagorje–Međimurje dialect|Zagorje–Međimurje]];
* [[Turopolje-Posavina dialect|Turopolje-Posavina]];
* [[Križevci-Podravina dialect|Križevci-Podravina]];
* [[Prigorje dialect|Prigorje]];
* [[Lower Sutlan dialect|Lower Sutlan]];
* [[Gorna dialect (Kajkavian)|Goran]].

==== Characteristics ====
Kajkavian is closely related to Slovene and to the [[Prekmurje dialect]] in particular. The speakers of Prekmurje dialect are [[Slovenes]] and [[Hungarian Slovenes]] who belonged to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Archdiocese of Zagreb]] during the Habsburg era. Higher amounts of correspondences between the two exist in inflection and vocabulary. Some Kajkavian words also bear a closer resemblance to other Slavic languages (such as [[Russian language|Russian]]) than they do to Shtokavian or Chakavian. For instance ''gda'' seems (at first glance) to be unrelated to ''kada'', however, when compared to the Russian ''когда'', the relationship becomes more apparent, at the same time in Slovene: ''kdaj,'' in Prekmurje Slovene ''gda, kda''. Kajkavian ''kak'' (''how'') and ''tak'' (''so'') are exactly like their Russian cognates, as compared to Shtokavian and Chakavian ''kako'' and ''tako,'' in Prekmurje Slovene in turn ''tak, kak'' (in Slovene like Chakavian: ''tako, kako''). (This vowel loss occurred in most other Slavic languages; Shtokavian is a notable exception, whereas the same feature of [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] is probably not a Serbian influence, because the word is preserved in the same form in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], to which Macedonian is much more closely related than to Serbian.). Another distinctive feature of Kajkavian is the use of another [[future tense]]. Instead of Shtokavian and Chakavian future I ("ću", "ćeš", and "će" + infinitive), Kajkavian speakers use future II ("bum", "buš" and "bu" + active verbal adjective). Future II in Standard Croatian can only be used in subordinate clauses to refer to a condition or an action which will occur before other future action. For example, the phrase ''"I'll show you"'' is ''"Ti bum pokazal"'' in Kajkavian whereas in standard Croatian it is ''"Pokazat ću ti"''. This is a feature shared with Slovene: ''bom'', ''boš'', ''bo''.

=== Comparative analysis ===
The Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have subsequently been replaced by Štokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th century. These migrations caused the koinéisation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, Štokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where subliterary dialects are still being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., big coastal Croatian cities [[Rijeka]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] together with their hinterland become basically completely Štokavianised during the 20th century, formerly being Čakavian-speaking urban centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main bundle of isoglosses separates Kajkavian and Slovenian dialects on the one hand from Štokavian and Čakavian on the other. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvcoltxt|Okuka|2008|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# long falling accent of newer origin (neocircumflex);
# development of the consonant group ''rj'' (as opposed to consonant ''/r/'') from former soft ''/r'/'' before a vowel (e.g. ''morjem'', ''zorja'');
# reflexes of ''/o/'' or ''/ọ/'' of the old [[Common Slavic]] [[nasal vowel]] ''/ǫ/'', and not ''/u/'';
# inflectional morpheme ''-o'' (as opposed to ''-ojo'') in the instrumental singular of a-declension.

Other characteristics distinguishing Kajkavian from Štokavian, beside the demonstrative/interrogatory pronoun ''kaj'' (as opposed to ''što/šta'' used in Štokavian), are:&lt;ref name="Okuka 2008 21"&gt;Cited after {{harvcoltxt|Okuka|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a reflex of old [[Yer|semivowels]] of ''/ẹ/'' (e.g. ''dẹn'' &lt; Common Slavic *dьnь, ''pẹs'' &lt; Common Slavic *pьsъ); closed ''/ẹ/'' appearing also as a ''[[yat|jat]]'' reflex;
# retention of word-final ''-l'' (e.g. ''došel'', as opposed to Štokavian ''došao'');
# word-initial ''u-'' becoming ''v-'' (e.g. ''vuho'', ''vuzel'', ''vozek'');
# dephonemicization of [[affricate]]s /č/ and /ć/ to some form of middle value;
# genitive plural of masculine nouns has the morpheme ''-of'' / ''-ef'';
# [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretized]] dative, locative and instrumental plural has the ending ''-ami'';
# the ending ''-me'' in the first-person plural present (e.g. ''vidime'');
# affix ''š'' in the formation of adjectival [[comparative]]s (e.g. ''debleši'', ''slabeši'');
# [[supine]];
# future tense formation in the form of ''bom/bum došel, došla, došlo''.

Characteristics distinguishing Čakavian from Štokavian, beside the demonstrative/interrogatory pronoun ''ča'', are:&lt;ref name="Okuka 2008 21"/&gt;
# preservation of polytonic three-accent system;
# vocalization of [[Havlík's law|weak jers]] (e.g. ''malin/melin'' &lt; Common Slavic *mъlinъ; cf. Štokavian ''mlin'');
# vowel ''/a/'' as opposed to ''/e/'' after [[palatals|palatal consonants]] ''/j/'', ''/č/'', ''/ž/'' (e.g. Čk. ''jazik/zajik'' : Št. ''[[wikt:jezik#Serbo-Croatian|jezik]]'', Čk. ''počati'' : Št. ''[[wikt:početi#Serbo-Croatian|početi]]'', Čk. ''žaja'' : Št. ''[[wikt:želja#Serbo-Croatian|želja]]'');
# the appearance of extremely palatal ''/t'/'' or ''/ć'/'' (&lt; earlier ''/t'/'') and ''/j/'' (&lt; earlier ''/d'/'') either in free positions or in groups ''&lt;nowiki&gt;št'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''&lt;nowiki&gt;žd'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'';
# depalatalization of ''/n'/'' and ''/l'/'';
# ''/ž/'' instead of ''/dʒ/'' (c.f. Čk. ''žep'' : Št. ''[[wikt:džep#Serbo-Croatian|džep]]'');
# ''/č/'' &gt; ''/š/'' (c.f. Čk. ''maška'' : Št. ''[[wikt:mačka#Serbo-Croatian|mačka]]'');
# word-initial consonant groups ''čr-'', ''čri-'', ''čre-'' (c.f. Čk. ''črivo/črevo'' : Št. ''[[wikt:crijevo#Serbo-Croatian|cr(ij)evo]]'', Čk. ''črn'' : Št. ''[[wikt:crn#Serbo-Croatian|crn]]'');
# [[conditional mood]] with ''biš'' in the 2nd-person singular;
# non-[[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretized]] dative, locative and instrumental plural.

The differences among the dialects can be illustrated on the example of [[Schleicher's fable]]. Diacritic signs are used to show the difference in accents and prosody, which are often quite significant, but which are not reflected in the usual orthography.

== Torlakian dialect ==
{{main|Torlakian dialect}}
[[File:Torlak dialects map en.png|thumb|right|150px|Distribution of the Torlakian dialects]]
The Torlakian dialects are intermediate between the Eastern and Western branches of South Slavic, and have been variously described, in whole or in parts, as belonging to either group. In the 19th century, their classification was hotly contested between Serbian and Bulgarian writers.&lt;ref name="ConcEnc"/&gt;

Most Serbian linguists (like [[Pavle Ivić]] and Asim Peco) classify Torlakian as an [[Shtokavian dialect#Old Shtokavian dialects|Old-Shtokavian dialect]], referring to it as [[Prizren-Timok dialect]].&lt;ref name=PI&gt;[http://www.srpskidespot.org.rs/Mape/dijalektiStokavskogNarecja.htm Pavle Ivić, Dijalektološka karta štokavskog narečja]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PI2&gt;Ivić Pavle, Dijalektologija srpskohtrvatskog jezika, 2001, 25 (also published in German)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this opinion was not shared by the Croatian linguists and thus [[Milan Rešetar]] classified the Torlak dialects (which he called ''Svrlijg'') as a different group from Shtokavian.&lt;ref&gt;The Čakavian Dialect of Orbanići Near Žminj in Istria, Volume 25, Janneke Kalsbeek, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ExIm5OHoO4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=brozovi%C4%87+torlak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IJyjT_KEIND14QTUya2lCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=%22later%20investigators%2C%20beginning%20with%20Re%C5%A1etar%22&amp;f=false p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

All old Bulgarian scientists as Benyo Tsonev, Gavril Zanetov and [[Krste Misirkov]]&lt;ref&gt;Мисирков, Кръстьо (1898). Значението на моравското или ресавското наречие за съвременната и историческа етнография на Балканския полуостров. Български преглед, година V, книга І, стр. 121–127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Мисирков, Кръстьо (1910, 1911). Бележки по южно-славянска филология и история  - Към въпроса за пограничната линия между българския и сръбско-хърватски езици и народи, Одеса, 30.XII.1909 г. Българска сбирка.&lt;/ref&gt; classified Torlakian as dialect of Bulgarian language. They noted the manner of the articles, the loss of most of the cases, etc. Today Bulgarian linguists ([[Stoyko Stoykov]], Rangel Bozhkov) also classify Torlakian as a "[[Belogradchik]]-[[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]]" dialect of Bulgarian, and claim that it should be classified outside the Shtokavian area. Stoykov further argued that the Torlak dialects having a grammar that is closer to Bulgarian was indicative of them being originally Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgarian dialectology, Stoyko Stoykov, 2002, [http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/jchorb/st/st_2_b_zap_3.htm p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Macedonian dialectology, the Torlakian varieties spoken on Macedonian territory ([[Kumanovo dialect|Kumanovo]], [[Kratovo dialect|Kratovo]] and [[Kriva Palanka dialect|Kriva Palanka]] dialects) are classified as part of a North-Eastern group of Macedonian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;K. Koneski, ''Pravopisen rečnik na makedonskiot literaturen jazik.'' Skopje: Prosvetno delo 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torlakian dialects, together with Bulgarian and Macedonian, display many properties of the [[Balkan linguistic area]], a set of structural convergence features shared also with other languages of the Balkans such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]. In terms of areal linguistics, they have therefore been described as part of a prototypical "Balkan Slavic" area, as opposed to other parts of Serbo-Croatian, which are only peripherally involved in the convergence area.&lt;ref name="ConcEnc"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=torlak |title=Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world, Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie, Elsevier, 2008, ISBN 0-08-087774-5, p.120 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itlREOzLnM0C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=balkan+linguistic+union+torlak&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_sdCK-Qbc3&amp;sig=57O5qZHKrIcNIGqf8sm4azWLO9M&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=balkan%20linguistic%20union%20torlak&amp;f=false |title=Papers from the 6-th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Current issues in linguistic theory, Jacek Fisiak, John Benjamins Publishing, 1985 ISBN 9027235287, p. 17 - Henrik Birnbaum: Divergence and convergence in linguistic evolution |publisher=Books.google.bg |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGZedef70zAC&amp;pg=PA620&amp;lpg=PA620&amp;dq=balkan+linguistic+union+torlak&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A7ZekMnz2k&amp;sig=yJ3dTgDlHGW2iZdiOUcBTwzcTpo&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=%20torlak&amp;f=false |title=The handbook of language contact, Blackwell handbooks in Linguistics, Raymond Hickey, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, ISBN 140517580X, p. 620 |publisher=Books.google.bg |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=balkan+linguistic+union+torlak&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SPmCuaEIU9&amp;sig=KebR2wB0wapdCQOJQqmDPD_uwTs&amp;hl=bg#v=snippet&amp;q=balkan%20sprachbund&amp;f=false |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World, Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie, Elsevier, 2009, ISBN 0080877745, pp. 119-120 |publisher=Books.google.bg |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgenland Croatian (''gradišćanskohrvatski jezik'') is a regional variety of the [[Chakavian dialect]] spoken in Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is recognized as a [[minority language]] in the Austrian [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Burgenland]] where it is spoken by 19,412 people according to official reports (2001).

This variety was the language of [[Croats|Croatian]] refugees who fled Croatia during the [[Croatia in the Habsburg Empire|Turkish Wars]] and settled in the western part of what was then Hungary, the area where they still live. Burgenland Croats included speakers of all three dialects of the [[Croatian language]] ([[Shtokavian]], [[Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian]]), with the majority being the Chakavians who originally came from the northern [[Adriatic]] coast. Burgenland Croats did not take part in the shaping of the present Croatian standard language in the 19th century. Instead, they constructed their own written standard based mainly on the local Chakavian speech and adopted the [[Croatian alphabet]], a modified Latin alphabet, as their script.

It is still a matter of debate whether Burgenland Croatian should be classified as a Slavic micro-language of its own. Burgenland Croatian dialects are mostly viewed as isolated dialects of the [[Croatian language]]. Burgenland Croatian and the [[Prekmurje dialect]] of Slovene (spoken in [[Prekmurje]] and Hungary) was to press with interact. The first Prekmurje Slovene works (for example [[Old hymn-book of Martjanci]]) was applied to the Burgenland Croatian books. A few writers of the Prekmurje dialect were of Burgenland Croatian descent (for example [[Jakab Szabár]]) and also the Burgenland Croatian language ([[József Ficzkó]]).

The variety uses the [[Latin alphabet]] with the same diacritical modifiers as the [[Croatian alphabet]]. In the course of language development it acquired some of its own specialised vocabulary, sometimes different from that used in standard Croatian. Sampled differences from standard Croatian are presented in the table in turn.

Burgenland Croatian written language is based mainly on the local [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] speech with some influences from the other Croatian dialects spoken in Burgenland. These dialects include:
* Dolinci dialect: dialect of the Dolinci in [[Unterpullendorf]], [[Frankenau]], [[Kleinmutschen]], etc. is a Chakavian dialect;
* Grob dialect: a Kajkavian dialect;
* Hac dialect: Chakavian dialect of Haci near Neusiedl;
* Poljan dialect: dialect of the Poljanci near [[Lake Neusiedl]], is a Chakavian dialect;
* Štoj dialect: dialect of the Croatian folklore group Štoji ([[Güttenbach]], [[Stinatz]], [[Neuberg im Burgenland|Neuberg]]), is a Shtokavian–Chakavian mixed dialect;
* Vlah dialect: dialect of the Vlahi, is a Shtokavian dialect in [[Weiden bei Rechnitz]], Zuberbach, Althodis, [[Schandorf]], Dürnbach, Allersdorf, etc.

=== Molise Slavic ===
{{main|Slavomolisano dialect}}
Molise Slavic or ''Slavomolisano'' is a variety of the Shtokavian dialect with some Chakavian influences spoken in the [[province of Campobasso]], in the [[Molise]] Region of southern [[Italy]], in the villages of [[Montemitro]] (''Mundimitar''), [[Acquaviva Collecroce]] (''Živavoda Kruč'') and [[San Felice del Molise]] (''Štifilić''). There are fewer than 1,000 active speakers, and fewer than 2,000 passive speakers.&lt;ref name="SIL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2012-068_svm.pdf | first = Walter | last = Breu | publisher = ISO 639-3 Registration Authority | title = Request for New Language Code Element in ISO 639-3 | date = 2012-03-06 | accessdate = 2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been preserved since a group of [[Croats]] emigrated from [[Dalmatia]] abreast of advancing [[Ottoman Turks]]. The residents of these villages speak a [[Chakavian dialect]] with [[Ikavian accent]]. The [[Molise Croats]], however, consider themselves to be Italians who speak a Slavic language, rather than ethnic Slavs.&lt;ref name="SIL" /&gt; Some speakers call themselves ''Zlavi'' or ''Harvati'' and call their language simply ''na našo'' ("our language").

The language was preserved until today only in the aforementioned three villages, although several villages in Molise and Abruzzo region are aware of their [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Croat]] [[ancestry]]. The existence of this Croat [[colony]] was unknown outside Italy until 1855 when [[Medo Pucić]], a linguist from [[Dubrovnik]], during one of his journeys in Italy overheard a tailor in [[Naples]] speaking with his wife in a language very similar to Pucić's own. The tailor then told him that he came from the village of Kruč, then part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Subsequently, the ''Gajica'', the modern [[Croatian alphabet]], was adopted to the language.

The language is highly Italianized and also retains many [[Archaism|archaic]] features. Because the colony was established before the discovery of the [[Americas]], all the names of animals and plants introduced from the Americas are borrowed from Italian or created from whole cloth. Along with these, Molise Slavic features the following characteristics:
# The analytic ''do'' + genitive replaces the synthetic independent genitive. In Italian it is ''del-'' + noun, since Italian has lost all its cases.
# ''do'' superseded ''od''.
# Slavic [[verb aspect]] is preserved, except in the past tense imperfective verbs are attested only in the Slavic [[imperfect]] (''bihu'', they were), and perfective verbs only in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] (''je izaša'', he has come out). There is no colloquial imperfect in the modern West South Slavic languages. Italian has aspect in the past tense that works in a similar fashion (impf. ''portava'', "he was carrying", versus perf. ''ha portato'', "he has carried").
# Slavic conjunctions superseded by Italian or local ones: ''ke'', "what" (Cr. ''što'', also ''ke'' - Cr. ''da'', "that", It. ''che''); ''e'', ''oš'', "and" (Cr ''i'', It. ''e''); ''ma'', "but" (Cr. ''ali'', ''no'', It. ''ma''); ''se', "if" (Cr. ''ako'', It. ''se'').
# An indefinite article is in regular use: ''na'', often written 'na, possibly derived from earlier ''jedna'', "one", via Italian ''una''.
# Structural changes in genders.  Notably, ''njevog'' does not agree with the possessor's gender (Cr. ''njegov'' or ''njezin'', his or her). Italian ''suo'' and its forms likewise does not, but with the object's gender instead.
# As in Italian, the perfective enclitic is tightly bound to the verb and always stands before it: ''je izaša'', "is let loose" (Cr. facul. ''je izašao'' or ''izašao je''), Italian ''è rilasciato''.

== Division by ''jat'' reflex ==
{{main|yat}}
A basic distinction among the dialects is in the reflex of the long [[Proto-Slavic language|Common Slavic]] vowel ''[[yat|jat]]'', usually transcribed as *ě. Depending on the reflex, the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of ''jat'' being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively. The long and short ''jat'' is reflected as long or short */i/ and /e/ in Ikavian and Ekavian, but Ijekavian dialects introduce a ''ije''/''je'' alternation to retain a distinction.

Standard Croatian and Bosnian are based on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Montenegrin, Croatian and Bosnian Serbs; Ekavian for most of Serbia). Influence of standard language through state media and education has caused non-standard varieties to lose ground to the literary forms.

The jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short ''jat'' is preceded by ''r'', in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix ''prě-'' ("trans-, over-") when long became ''pre-'' in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to ''prije-'' in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into ''pre-'' or ''prije-'' due to potential ambiguity with ''pri-'' ("approach, come close to"). For verbs that had ''-ěti '' in their infinitive, the past participle ending ''-ěl'' evolved into ''-io'' in Ijekavian Neoštokavian.

''Ecocentric''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|t|r|ɪ|z|əm}}; from Greek: οἶκος ''oikos'', "house" and κέντρον ''kentron'', "center") is a term used in [[ecological]] [[political philosophy]] to denote a nature-centered, as opposed to human-centered (i.e. [[anthropocentric]]), system of values. The justification for ecocentrism usually consists in an [[ontology|ontological belief]] and subsequent [[ethical]] claim. The ontological belief denies that there are any [[Existentialism|existential]] divisions between human and non-human nature sufficient to claim that humans are either (a) the sole bearers of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] or (b) possess greater intrinsic value than non-human nature. Thus the subsequent ethical claim is for an equality of intrinsic value across human and non-human nature, or '[[biosphere|biospherical]] [[egalitarianism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ecocentrism Answers.com]. Retrieved 13 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

According to Stan Rowe:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/aboutauthors.html#rowe Stan Rowe, biographic profile.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|''The ecocentric argument is grounded in the belief that, compared to the undoubted importance of the human part, the whole [[Earth's spheres|ecosphere]] is even more significant and consequential: more inclusive, more complex, more integrated, more creative, more beautiful, more mysterious, and older than time. The "environment" that [[anthropocentrism]] misperceives as materials designed to be used exclusively by humans, to serve the needs of humanity, is in the profoundest sense humanity's source and support: its ingenious, inventive life-giving matrix. Ecocentrism goes beyond [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] with its fixation on organisms, for in the ecocentric view people are inseparable from the inorganic/organic nature that encapsulates them. They are particles and waves, body and spirit, in the context of Earth's ambient energy.''&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Stan J. (1994).[http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/RoweEcocentrism.html  "Ecocentrism: the Chord that Harmonizes Humans and Earth."] ''The Trumpeter'' '''11(2)''': 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and:

{{Cquote|''To switch Western culture from its present track to a saving ecopolitical route means finding a new and compelling belief-system to redirect our way-of-living. It must be a vital outgrowth from our science-based culture. It seems to me that the only promising universal belief-system is ecocentrism, defined as a value-shift from ''Homo sapiens'' to planet earth. A scientific rationale backs the value-shift. All organisms are evolved from Earth, sustained by Earth. Thus Earth, not organism, is the metaphor for Life. Earth not humanity is the Life-center, the creativity-center. Earth is the whole of which we are subservient parts. Such a fundamental philosophy gives ecological awareness and sensitivity an enfolding, material focus''.

''Ecocentrism is not an argument that all organisms have equivalent value. It  is not an anti-human argument nor a put-down of those seeking social justice.  It does not deny that myriad important homocentric problems exist. But it  stands aside from these smaller, short-term issues in order to consider  Ecological Reality. Reflecting on the ecological status of all organisms, it  comprehends the Ecosphere as a Being that transcends in importance any one  single species, even the self-named sapient one''.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe Stan J. [http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/Ro993tek_1.html  "Ecocentrism and Traditional Ecological Knowledge."]&lt;/ref&gt; (1994)}}

==Origin of term==
{{Main article|Aldo Leopold}}
The ecocentric ethic was conceived by [[Aldo Leopold]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Aldo Leopold|Leopold, A.]] 1949. ''A sand county almanac''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and recognizes that all species, including humans, are the product of a long evolutionary process and are inter-related in their life processes.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, D. &amp; Burgman, M. 2005. ''Practical conservation biology''. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Australia. {{ISBN|0-643-09089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Aldo Leopold]] and his idea of the [[land ethic]] and good environmental management are a key element to this philosophy.
Ecocentrism focuses on the biotic community as a whole and strives to maintain ecosystem composition and ecological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, D.E. 1992. The economics and ethics of old growth forests. ''Environmental Ethics'' 14: 43-62.&lt;/ref&gt; The term also finds expression in the first principle of the [[deep ecology]] movement, as formulated by [[Arne Næss]] and George Sessions in 1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Arne Næss]]|Naess, Arne &amp; Sessions, George 1984. "A Deep Ecology Eight Point Platform" cited in ''Deep Ecology for the 21st Century'', Readings on the Philosophy and Practice of the New Environmentalism, ed. George Sessions, Shambhala, Boston and London, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
which points out that [[anthropocentrism]], which considers humans as the center of the universe and the pinnacle of all creation, is a difficult opponent for ecocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academon.com/lib/paper/102996.html "Ecocentrism and the Deep Ecology Platform".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Environmentalism}}
Environmental thought and the various branches of the environmental movement are often classified into two intellectual camps: those that are considered anthropocentric, or "human-centred," in orientation and those considered biocentric, or "life-centred". This division has been described in other terminology as "shallow" ecology versus "deep" ecology and as "technocentrism" versus "ecocentrism". Ecocentrism can be seen as one stream of thought within [[environmentalism]], the political and ethical movement that seeks to protect and improve the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities by adopting environmentally benign forms of political, economic, and social organization and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature. In various ways, environmentalism claims that non-human organisms  and the natural environment as a whole deserve consideration when appraising the morality of political, economic, and social policies.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2009|title = environmentalism|encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/765710/environmentalism|accessdate= 13 June 2009|edition= |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other similar philosophies==

===Anthropocentrism===
{{Main article|Anthropocentrism}}
Ecocentrism is taken by its proponents to constitute a radical challenge to long-standing and deeply rooted [[anthropocentric]] attitudes in Western culture, science, and politics. Anthropocentrism is alleged to leave the case for the protection of non-human nature subject to the demands of human utility, and thus never more than contingent on the demands of human welfare. An ecocentric ethic, by contrast, is believed to be necessary in order to develop a non-contingent basis for protecting the natural world. Critics of ecocentrism have argued that it opens the doors to an anti-humanist morality that risks sacrificing human well-being for the sake of an ill-defined ‘greater good’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ecocentrism Ecocentrism at answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep ecology|Deep ecologist]] [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] has identified anthropocentrism as a root cause of the [[ecology|ecological]] crisis, [[human overpopulation]], and the [[extinction]]s of many non-human species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arne Næss|Naess, Arne]] 1973. "The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement". ''Inquiry'' '''16''': 95-100&lt;/ref&gt;  Others point to the gradual historical realization that humans are not the centre of all things, that "A few hundred years ago, with some reluctance, Western people admitted that the planets, Sun and stars did not circle around their abode. In short, our thoughts and concepts though irreducibly anthropomorphic need not be anthropocentric."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/RoweEcocentrism.html see Rowe]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrocentrism ===
Industrocentrism is an ideology that goes hand in hand with today's industrial neoliberal capitalist agenda.  It sees all things on earth as resources to be utilized by humans or to be commodified.  This view is the opposite of anthropocentrism and ecocentrism.  It negatively affects humans, nonhumans, and the environment in the long run in that it only focuses on short term economic gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|first=Eleanor|last2=Kopnina|first2=Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315858630|location=Oxon|pages=8–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technocentrism===
{{Main article|Technocentrism}}
Ecocentrism   is also contrasted with [[technocentrism]] (meaning values centred on technology) as two opposing perspectives on attitudes towards human technology and its ability to affect, control and even protect the environment. Ecocentrics, including "deep green" ecologists, see themselves as being subject to nature, rather than in control of it. They lack faith in modern technology and the bureaucracy attached to it. Ecocentrics will argue that the natural world should be respected for its processes and products, and that low impact technology and self-reliance is more desirable than technological control of nature.&lt;ref name=E&gt;[http://www.sustainable-environment.org.uk/Earth/Ecocentrism_and_Technocentrism.php "Earth, ecocentrism and Technocentrism".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Technocentrics, including imperialists, have absolute faith in technology and industry and firmly believe that humans have control over nature. Although technocentrics may accept that environmental problems do exist, they do not see them as problems to be solved by a reduction in industry. Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using science. Indeed, technocentrics see that the way forward for developed and developing countries and the solutions to our environmental problems today lie in scientific and technological advancement.&lt;ref name=E /&gt;

===Biocentrism===
{{Main article|Biocentrism (ethics)}}
The distinction between biocentrism and ecocentrism is ill-defined. Ecocentrism recognizes Earth's interactive living and non-living systems rather than just the Earth's organisms (biocentrism) as central in importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com "Ecocentrism". The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English. 2009. Encyclopedia.com.]. Retrieved 13 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has been used by those advocating "left biocentrism", combining deep ecology with an "anti-industrial and anti-capitalist" position (David Orton et al.).

The '''England First Party''' ('''EFP''') was an [[English nationalism|English nationalist]] [[UK political parties|political party]]. It had two councillors on [[Blackburn with Darwen]] council between 2006 and 2007.

==Formation and policies==
They were formed in 2004 by [[Mark Cotterill]] who had been the founder and chairman of American Friends of the [[British National Party]] (BNP). However, he began to disagree with the BNP politically, and so formed the EFP, after a spell in the [[White Nationalist Party]].

The EFP differed from the BNP in its analysis of the [[United Kingdom]]. It criticised [[British nationalism]] and supported [[English nationalism]] instead. Most members of the EFP were former BNP members like their chairman, Cotterill.

The EFP campaigned against the creation of [[English regional assemblies|regional assemblies]] across England. They also campaigned on issues such as opposing [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] in England and opposing the UK's continued membership of the [[European Union]].

On the economy, the EFP supported the gradual [[nationalisation]] of most national and [[public services]] in attempts to achieve [[autarky]]. While not aiming to abolish [[capitalism|capitalist]] ownership, the EFP claimed the interests of workers to be paramount and subsequently supported [[Worker cooperative|worker co-operatives]]. The EFP also aimed to end the connections between [[trade union]]s and the Labour Party while encouraging trade union membership and re-nationalising and re-opening coalmines which had a "reasonable working life".

According to the accounts filed with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] the party had 27 full members at year-end 2004 and 85 'supporters'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/12624 |title= England First Party, The Statement of Accounts for 2004 |website=The Electoral Commission |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928034337/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/12624 |archivedate=28 September 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2005 this had increased to 39 paid members and 97 registered supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/16309 |title= England First Party, The Statement of Accounts for 2005 |website=The Electoral Commission |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928034337/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/16309 |archivedate=28 September 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the year end 2007 the party recognised "100 supporters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/49390/England-First-Party-Statement-of-Accounts-2007_29180-21651__E__N__S__W__.pdf |title=EFP Statement of Accounts for 2007 |website=The Electoral Commission }}{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By year end 2010, England First had 42 full members and recognised 111 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/party-finance/database-of-registers/statements-of-accounts/soa/pdfs/soa_25-05-11_10-46-30.pdf The England First Party statement of accounts] Electoral Commission ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sold a magazine ''Heritage and Destiny'', which ran issues every year from July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efp.org.uk/page17.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804073138/http://www.efp.org.uk/page17.html |archivedate=4 August 2008 |title=England First Party - Heritage &amp; Destiny |website=www.efp.org.uk |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided news on the progress of racial nationalism in Britain, Europe and America.

=== Policies on religion ===
The EFP was criticised for a section of its manifesto that promised "the abolition of all non-European faiths and religions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Story - Immigration, race and the British election |url=http://inside.org.au/immigration-race-and-the-british-election/ |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2010 Mark Cotterill issued a statement that "[f]ar from wishing to ‘abolish’ any religion (from the East or West!), the EFP is committed to traditional English values of religious freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England First - The England First Party, Religion and the Holocaust |url=http://efp.org.uk/the-england-first-party-religion-and-the-holocaust/ |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later version of the party manifesto, last edited 28 April 2010, did not contain the call for abolition of non-European religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England First - Brief Manifesto |url=http://efp.org.uk/manifesto/brief-manifesto/ |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125194914/http://efp.org.uk/manifesto/brief-manifesto/ |archivedate=25 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
In their first electoral test, a local government by-election in February 2004 for the [[Heysham]] South ward in [[Lancaster, England|Lancaster]], the EFP polled 14%. In the May 2004 local elections, the EFP contested three seats in [[Blackburn]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Macclesfield]], polling an average of 18% of the vote.

Two candidates contested the May 2006 local elections in Blackburn, polling an average of 37% of the vote and both were elected as councillors. In a by-election in the East Rural ward of Blackburn in September 2006, they polled 13%. They also contested a by-election in the Danehouse and Stoneyholme ward in [[Burnley]] in February 2007, polling 7%. Despite the party campaigning for a ban on mixed-race marriages it was revealed that one of the two elected councillors was reported to have a grandfather from [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2006/5/9/901326.html|title=African grandad of 'racist' party councillor] from Lancashire Telegraph|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080103072041/http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2006/5/9/901326.html|archivedate=3 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Smith and Simon Bennett stood in the Cliviger with Worsthorne and Queensgate wards respectively, at the [[Burnley Council election, 2007|2007 Burnley council elections]]. Smith came a very distant second with Bennett third in a closer vote.

=== 2010 elections ===
The EFP fielded seven candidates for the 2010 local elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efp.org.uk/2010-local-council-elections,/|title=2010 Local Council Elections : Heritage and Destiny|website=efp.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; three of them to compete against the BNP in Stoke, but it did not stand in the general election and they had encouraged EFP supporters to vote for the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efp.org.uk/statement-on-steven-smith-and-the-national-front-by-england-first-party-chairman-mark-cotterill/|title=Statement on Steven Smith and the National Front by England First Party Chairman Mark Cotterill : Heritage and Destiny|website=efp.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It came fourth place with 606 votes in the Longton North ward,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/ce/elections_team/election-results/Longton-North-elections-results.en |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506082407/https://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/ce/elections_team/election-results/Longton-North-elections-results.en |archivedate=6 May 2008 |title=Longton North Election Results |date=2008 |website=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; fifth place with 117 votes in the Weston and Meir ward&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/ce/elections_team/election-results/Weston-and-meir-north-elections-results.en |title=Weston and Meir North Election Results |website=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |date=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506082422/http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/ce/elections_team/election-results/Weston-and-meir-north-elections-results.en |archivedate=6 May 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sixth place in the Fenton ward with 236 votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/ce/elections_team/election-results/Fenton-elections-results.en |title=Fenton Elections Results |website=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |date=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506082422/http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/ce/elections_team/election-results/Fenton-elections-results.en |archivedate=6 May 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Stoke-on-Trent local elections.

In the Preston Ribbleton ward, [[Mark Cotterill]] came fourth place with 315 votes; it came fourth place in the St James ward in Oldham with 425 votes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldham.gov.uk/council/elections/local_elections_6th_may/2010_may_election_results/2010_local_election_results.htm |title=2010 Local Election Results |website=Oldham Council |date=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510074759/https://www.oldham.gov.uk/council/elections/local_elections_6th_may/2010_may_election_results/2010_local_election_results.htm |archivedate=10 May 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Bradley ward of Pendle it received 279 coming fourth place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pendle.gov.uk/site/custom_scripts/viewelection.php?pollid=4 |title=Election Results for Bradley Ward |website=Pendle Council |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612202150/http://www.pendle.gov.uk/site/custom_scripts/viewelection.php?pollid=4 |archivedate=12 June 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sixth place in the Ince ward of Wigan with 134 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinnear.wigan.gov.uk/electionresults/ShowWard.asp?WardID=144&amp;ElectionDate=06+May+2010|title=Local Election Results|website=kinnear.wigan.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignations==
In March 2007 the EFP's two councillors announced their intentions to quit. Michael Johnson stated that he would be joining a new party created by himself and Tony Melia [[For Darwen]], while Mark Cotterill signalled his intention to stand down as a councillor and party leader at the 3 May local elections. Johnson's move followed a rift with the party after he objected to an [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] cartoon of [[Jesus]] on [[YouTube]], while Cotterill&amp;mdash;who remained a leading EFP activist&amp;mdash;has put his decision down to a work-related move to Preston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancashireeveningtelegraph.co.uk/display.var.1236399.0.england_first_pair_quit_party.php England First pair quit party] ''[[Lancashire Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defection to England First Party==
On 1 May 2009, a former [[British National Party]] councillor, John Gamble, confirmed that he had defected to the EFP, after criticising the BNP. In the preceding months, he had become increasingly disillusioned with the BNP’s national and local leadership, this resulted in him being expelled from the BNP. He sat as an independent for a few days and then he decided to "join a party that offers a serious, radical challenge to the corrupt political establishment".

On 12 March 2010, John Gamble defected from the EFP to the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.national-front.org.uk/johngamble.htm |title=John Gamble |website=National Front |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317154115/http://www.national-front.org.uk/johngamble.htm |archivedate=17 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was after he told ''The Star'' newspaper in Sheffield he had 'jumped ship' to the NF because he wanted to join a 'more active' organisation than England First.

On 1 April 2010, Gamble defected back to England First because he stated to ''The Star'', "I am not aware of the severity of these opinions" when some of the NF's recorded views were put to him. On 5 April 2010 England First refused to take him back. England First's chairman, Mark Cotterill, said: "While we have nothing against Cllr. Gamble, the fact is that despite his various and contradictory public statements he has had no involvement with the EFP – and is no longer an EFP member." Mr Cotterill went on to release a statement to ''The Sheffield Star'' saying, "We don't want anything to do with Councillor Gamble. He has done nothing for the party, and when he left we washed our hands of him."

==Support to the English Democrats==
In May 2009, the England First Party decided to stand a candidate in the County council elections in Lancashire but did not stand any European candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efp.org.uk/page67a.html|title=England First Election Results|website=England First |date=5 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609112716/http://www.efp.org.uk/page67a.html |archivedate=9 June 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the European Parliament, the England First Party worked with the [[English Democrats]] and attended and spoke at the English Democrats' conference in Darwen. Cotterill stated that the parties had differences on race, immigration and independence but they had in common withdrawal from EU and putting England first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efp.org.uk/page57.html|title=England First party speaks at English Democrats' conference in Darwen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515114457/http://www.efp.org.uk/page57.html|archivedate=15 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was de-registered on 14 June 2012, and as such the name "England First Party" cannot be used on ballot papers by candidates at elections.

'''Export-oriented employment''' refers to [[employment]] in [[multinational corporation]]s' international industrial factories, usually located in [[developing countries]].  Such factories produce goods and services for sale in other countries. While these multinational producers have globally expanded women’s access to employment, evidence suggests they do so by reinforcing traditional [[gender role]]s or creating new [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Seguino | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Grown | first2 = Caren | author-link1 = Stephanie Seguino | title = Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries | journal = Journal of International Development | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 1081–1104 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1002/jid.1295 | date = November 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jid.1295 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version - via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Dom" /&gt;  Such gender inequities allow multinational firms to greater exploit profits per worker than they would otherwise due to the decreased labor cost.  This decrease in the cost of labor comes as a result of the relegation of women to certain occupations.  Studies show that in the quest for lower unit labor costs, export-oriented facilities create poor working conditions.&lt;ref name="Pun" /&gt;

==History==

Work in international factories has become an option for women in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Elson"&gt;Elson, D. &amp; Pearson, R. (1981). "The Subordination of Women and Internationalization of Factory Production" in K. Young et al. Of Marriage and the Market, CSE 214&amp;ndash;216; 219&amp;ndash;221&lt;/ref&gt;  This opportunity, which has increased since the latter part of the 1960s, represents the production of goods to be sold explicitly to more developed countries.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, developing countries emerged as the sites to relocate labor-intensive manufacturing industries, as they were moved away from developed countries.&lt;ref name="Ka"&gt;Kabeer, N. (2004). "Globalization, Labor Standards, and Women’s Rights: Dilemmas of Collective (In)action in an Interdependent World."  Feminist Economics. 10(1): 3&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expansionism has forced developing countries to create and sell assembled products and other goods to more developed countries.  Upon greater enhancement, developing countries were able to bolster their industrialized processes by swapping imported goods in favor of goods produced domestically.  However, within the last 40 years this process eroded due in part to technological development, changes in regulation, and higher employment costs in more developed countries.  Additionally, international trade has expanded in a distinct manner that is linked to manufacturing processes.

From the 1970s forward, the global marketplace and the makeup of the labor force has had transformations by way of technological innovation, work structure, and new forms of controlling labor.&lt;ref&gt;Standing, G. (1999). "Global Feminization through Flexible Labor: A Theme Revisited." World Development 27 (3): 583&amp;ndash;586.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of changes in the wider [[labor market]], women have joined the labor force in greater numbers and tended to remain a part of the force.  Moreover, many male employees have often been moved to less desirable jobs, if not placed outside of the labor market entirely.  Additionally, those characteristics commonly related to female employment such as temporary arrangements, low wages, and job instability have risen.  Moreover, these patterns have increased vis-a-vis characteristics identified with male labor, such as unionization and job security.  Consequently, the expansion of export-oriented employment is a major contributor to what some have called, "the global feminization of labor" in the post-1980 period.

Currently one of the most significant examples of export-oriented employment is the [[Bangladesh textile industry]]. By 2013, about 4 million people, mostly women, worked in Bangladesh's $19 billion-a-year industry, export-oriented ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Sixty percent of the export contracts of western brands are with European buyers and about forty percent with American buyers.&lt;ref name=reuters4may2013&gt;

==Women as the preferred labor force==

Gender roles vary by society, but are often based in social ideas that women have different natural abilities and a more suitable temperament for certain work as compared to men.&lt;ref name="Elson"/&gt;  Typically, women have been the preferred labor force in export-oriented factories because they allow for lower unit labor costs.  Additionally, women are often deemed more physically dexterous and are regarded as more tempered in reference to their personality.  As a result of which, some have argued that women are stereotyped as being better able to complete tasks that are mundane.

There is evidence to support the argument that women receive such perceived traits or skills in a non-formal and independent setting.&lt;ref name="Elson"/&gt;  However, as a result of which, women's skills employed in a factory setting are likely to be viewed as less valuable compared to other skill sets.  Thus, women can be described as being relegated to an inferior status because their abilities are not equally valued.  Finally, while women in factory settings are often unfairly demoted and forced into submissive roles, they are aware of their perceived lower status and do not accept it.

Dominguez et al. (2010) note that in processing centers located in Mexico, employers favored hiring married females.&lt;ref name="Dom"&gt;Domínguez, E., Icaza, R., Quintero, C., López, S., &amp; Stenman, Å. (2010). Women Workers in the Maquiladoras and the Debate on Global Labor Standards. Feminist Economics, 16(4), 185&amp;ndash;209. doi:10.1080/13545701.2010.530603&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, Dominguez et al. note that married women were seen as more dependable and as a result of which, better employees.  The same authors also note that employers put forth that such a system allowed the families of those hired to be better supported.  However, Dominguez et al. claim such a stance by employers is a decision that relegates women to a specific role based on gender and allows for greater control of the given workers.

In a 2003 analysis of a Chinese electronics producer, Pun Ngai found that surveyed workers sought employment by migrating from a variety of areas across the country and generally were employed for a period that was less than 36 months.&lt;ref name="Pun"/&gt;  The workers surveyed by Ngai were largely in their early 20s and nearly three-quarters were female.

==Working conditions==

===Wage levels===

In an examination of Chinese factories producing electronic goods for the west, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Microsoft]], reporting indicates that workers are often paid less than 2 USD per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R. (2013, January 25). Inside apple's chinese 'sweatshop' factory where workers are paid just £1.12 per hour to produce iphones and ipads for the west. The Daily Mail.

In the latter part of 2011, weekly payments for minimum wage workers in Cambodia's garment industry totaled 8117 Riel.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic, Stanford Law School &amp; Workers Rights Consortium. (2013, February) "Monitoring in the dark."  Retrieved from http://humanrightsclinic.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Monitoring-in-the-Dark-Stanford-WRC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that workers have others who rely upon their wages, manufacturing entities are well aware that they do not provide sustainable wages.  Moreover, for Cambodian garment manufacturers to remain competitive, factory owners must keep wages low.  Creating higher wages poses risks for factory owners that other countries accepting export orders will usurp their place.  However, despite the allure that factory jobs provide for rural workers, rapidly falling wages risk alienating this mass of people.

Beginning in the at the start of the millennium and ending in 2010, workers in [[Cambodia]]'s garment sector have seen their [[inflation]] adjusted wages decrease by nearly 17%.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;  These wages are expected to continue to fall almost twofold through the year of 2014.

===Hours===

In 2012, evidence that workers in Cambodia's garment sector were burdened by unreasonable overtime hours was found to be common place in factories monitored by "Better Factories Cambodia," a group originally designated to oversee and improve factory conditions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; As product orders often ebb and flow, managers require extended hours from their employees.  Additionally, managers can eliminate additional costs by imposing excessive overtime on fewer workers, versus giving a greater share of benefits to a larger population with less overtime.

In discussions with Cambodia's garment sector workers, many have noted that burdensome overtime was particularly strenuous, but also necessary because of falling wages.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;  Moreover, workers in the industry have called for the option to choose when to engage in overtime hours, versus required overtime work delegated to them.

===Control===

Pun Ngai has analyzed labor systems in Chinese dormitories that are intertwined with production sites and labor.&lt;ref name="Pun"&gt;Pun, N. (2007) "Gendering the Dormitory Labor System: Production, Reproduction and Migrant Labor in south China." Feminist Economics. 13 (3&amp;ndash;4): 239&amp;ndash;258.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this analysis, evidence is put forth that details how migrant laborers in export-processing areas have been forced into such residences that allow for complete worker control.  This control comes from the dormitory grounds being secured by security guards that prevent worker exits.  This structure is often rationalized as a benefit to the workers, whom the factory owners view as being in need of security and extra discipline.

Additionally, dormitories of this kind can house hundreds of workers, where as many as twenty workers may share a room.&lt;ref name="Pun"/&gt; While such conditions can be detrimental to workers, it can also be a shared source of discomfort through which workers may more easily unite for common causes.

===Safety concerns===
In 2012, a fire erupted in a garment factory in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] that killed approximately 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, S. S. (2012, September 12). Deadly karachi blaze was "waiting to happen". BBC News Asia . Retrieved from https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19577450&lt;/ref&gt; Facing imminent death, many workers leapt from upper levels of the factory, leading to many injuries as they landed.  Furthermore, tools to fight fires at the factory were lacking, and fire exits had been tampered with or were non-existent. 
  
In 2013, 2013 [[Savar building collapse|a garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed]], killing at least 1000 people and injuring approximately 2500 others.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan , C. (2013, May 10).

In a report released in 2013, researchers found that industrial Cambodian facilities overseen by "Better Factories Cambodia" had numerous issues related to workers' health and safety.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;  Of the factories assessed, the majority had a lack of restroom sanitizing products, excessively high temperature levels, and no access to safe water for drinking.

Kalpona Akter, a former Bangladeshi child garment worker and industry activist, has described conditions where garment factory managers lock exit doors while workers are engaging in tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Labour Activist sheds light on working conditions in Bangladeshi sweatshops . Public Service Alliance of Canada. (2013, December 16). Retrieved from http://psacunion.ca/labour-activist-sheds-light-working-conditions-bangladeshi-sweatshops&lt;/ref&gt;  Akter notes that factory managers value the goods that are being produced instead of worker well-being.

==Activism==

In 2005, students at a variety of universities in the [[United States]] engaged in protests against colleges that purchase goods created in the industrial apparel sector in order to sell with their personal namesakes.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, R., &amp; Dreier, P. (2005). Students Confront Sweatshops. Nation, 281(18), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their quest for better outcomes, some of the students in protest have urged universities to create special independent contracts with international apparel factories that require stringent oversight, as well as a promise to refrain from producing goods other than those created for the noted educational institution.  Protesters also argue that because these industrial workers receive payments that are less than or equal to two percent of an item's selling price, the earnings for industrial workers should allotted based on prices in the area of which they work.  While activists note that there is an increased cost for consumers, they set forth that in one example that this price change can be under one U.S. dollar in retail price.

Rachel Silvey has noted that efforts by college activists force local college administrators to make changes that have international effects.&lt;ref&gt;Silvey, R. (2004). A Wrench in the Global Works: Anti-Sweatshop Activism on Campus. Antipode, 36(2), 191&amp;ndash;197. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8330.2004.00398.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Such university protests challenge global neoliberal policies that are explicitly intertwined with current university policies.

In the [[export-oriented]] industry in [[Thailand]], women make up the majority of those employed, and are often the most vitriolic objectors to workplace injustices.&lt;ref&gt;From Nimble Fingers to Raised Fists: Women and Labor Activism in Globalizing Thailand. Mary Beth Mills. Signs, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Autumn 2005), pp. 117&amp;ndash;144. Published by: The University of Chicago Press. Article DOI: 10.1086/431370. Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/431370&lt;/ref&gt;  In defying conventional norms that portray women as passive, Mill describes incidents where Thai activists shaved their heads and threaten to write protest letters in their own blood.

In 2012 [[Aminul Islam (trade unionist)|Aminul Islam]], a Bangladeshi labor supporter, was found murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Manik, J., &amp; Bajaj, V. (2012, April 9). Killing of Bangladeshi labor organizer signals an escalation in violence. The New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/world/asia/bangladeshi-labor-organizer-is-found-killed.html?_r=1&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Highlighting the intensity of the struggle between laborers and owners, reports indicate that Islam was tortured prior to his death.

In 2014, workers employed in Cambodia's garment industry, who are predominantly female, protested against the government's current minimum wage level.&lt;ref&gt;Narin, S., &amp; Wong, C. H. (2014 January 2). Cambodian Garment Workers return to streets. ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants in Cambodia's Garment Manufacturing Association responded to protests by noting that products manufactured in Cambodia would move elsewhere.

===Unions and workers' rights===

In Cambodian export factories, workers often face hardship in regards to participating in unionization efforts that differ from that of management philosophy.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;  Workers have noted deliberate efforts by managers to dismantle union activities, that have often included threats or the initiation of violence.

Among other Asian countries, Bangladesh has extremely poor rights regarding unionization.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Berik, G., &amp; Van Der Meulen Rodgers, Y. (2008). Options for Enforcing Labour Standards: Lessons from Bangladesh and Cambodia. ''Journal of International Development'', (22), 56–85. doi: 10.1002/jid&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence{{cn|date=May 2016}} that this problem may be connected to, and exacerbated by, Bangladesh's reliance on exporting apparel goods in the past three decades.  Highlighting the lack of collectivity, a mere 2 percent of employees were active in unions.

==Policies==

In light of deteriorating labor market standards abroad, widespread attention and criticism has been leveled at overseas manufacturers in hopes of creating a minimum standard for labor practices that would afford workers rights related to unionization and freedom from workplace discrimination.&lt;ref name="Ka" /&gt;  Intertwined in this attention, critics have looked to connect such minimum standards to broader global trading treaties.  This pairing, known as a "[[social clause]]", aims to force international trade bodies such as the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) to integrate seven core [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) [[labour rights]] conventions into trade agreements and attach penalties to those that do not.

Advocacy on behalf of labour rights can often come via governments and private groups from the global north.&lt;ref name="Ka" /&gt;  In this regard, many entities may support such a theme because of personal economic interest or indignation toward unfair labor practices.  Comparatively, lesser developed countries and private groups in those countries are often skeptical of such trade agreements as they view the implementation of labor rights policies as being designed to further enrich the global north.

Despite the precariousness found in export-oriented factories, research has indicated that women in developing countries are satisfied by the opportunity to have a formal factory job, compared to the limited informal ways of making money.&lt;ref name="Ka" /&gt;   This contentment on the part of women is created via the ability to garner greater independence as well as having increasing oversight within their homes.

In 1999, Cambodia and the United States entered into a trade agreement known as the U.S./Cambodia Bilateral Textile Trade Agreement.&lt;ref name="Y"&gt;Trade, Monitoring, and the ILO: Working to Improve Conditions in Cambodia's Garment Factories, Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal Vol. 7, 2004, pp. 79&amp;ndash;107 (7 Yale Hum. Rts. &amp; Dev. L. J. 79) (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  This agreement would initiate a program now known as "Better Factories Cambodia."&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; With initial funding totaling $1.4 million, the program aimed to increase oversight by way of ILO employees in conjunction with bolstering the administrative abilities of the Cambodian government.  While the program has yielded positive results in regard to minimum wages and equitable timely payments, there are recurrent problems in regards to safety and excessive overtime.

'''Food Not Lawns''' is a de-centralized [[social movement]] focused on replacing urban [[lawns]] with food-producing [[Organic gardening|organic gardens]]. The first group to use the name "Food Not Lawns" was founded in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drsusanrubin.com/case-lawns-stronger-day/ Dr. Susan Rubin, The Case Against Lawns]&lt;/ref&gt; by Tobias Policha, Nick Routledge, and Heather Jo Flores.  In 2006, Flores published the book ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flores |first=Heather |title=Food Not Lawns, How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community |date=2006 |location=White River Junction, Vermont |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing  |url= http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/foodnotlawns}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-described "avant-gardening collective",&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.scribble.com/ Food Not Lawns original website]&lt;/ref&gt; FNL's basic premise was to garner surplus resources, whether food, seeds, plants, tools, garden space, publications, or volunteer time, and channel them toward building better [[food security]] for the [[community]] at hand.

Born of Eugene's radical political organizing community in the late 1990s, Food Not Lawns evolved directly out of the local chapter of [[Food Not Bombs]], a free food-sharing [[collective]] having a common concern with food justice issues, and a similar stewardship and democratic approach. Neither Food Not Lawns nor Food Not Bombs chapters answer to a central decision-making body. Rather, they are examples of movements that operate on a premise of [[anarchism]], [[autonomy]] and [[self-organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/home/Eat-the-Lawn-Simran-Sethi Food Not Lawns interview from Oprah.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone is free to start a Food Not Lawns group.

Food Not Lawns chapters have common activities. They organize local [[seed swap]] events. They build [[community gardens]]. They generate publications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.scribble.com/weedloverfive.html Copy of the FNL Weed Lover zine, June 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; whether on the web or in print. And they host work parties to help community members turn their lawns into gardens. 

According to the Food Not Lawns International Website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnotlawns.com Food Not Lawns International Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Food Not Lawns currently has more than 50 chapters worldwide. Similar movements have also started up, with names including Grow Food Not Lawns and Plant Food Not Lawns; merchandise can be found bearing any of the three slogans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19419">{{Distinguish|The Freedom Association}}
'''Freedom of association''' encompasses both an individual's right to join or leave groups voluntarily, the right of the group to take [[collective action]] to pursue the interests of its members, and the right of an [[club (organization)|association]] to accept or decline membership based on certain criteria. ''Freedom of Association, The Essentials of Human Rights''{{Clarify|reason=What is this publication? Why is it notable enough to be in the lead? And why is there no citation for it?|date=February 2018}} describes the right as coming together with other individuals to collectively express, promote, pursue and/or defend common interests. Freedom of Association is both an [[individual right]] and a [[collective right]], guaranteed by all modern and democratic legal systems, including the [[United States Bill of Rights]], [[Article 11 ECHR|article 11]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and [[international law]], including articles 20 and 23 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  The [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] by the [[International Labour Organization]] also ensures these rights.

Freedom of association is manifested through the right to join a [[trade union]], to engage in [[free speech]] or to participate in [[debating societies]], [[political parties]], or any other club or association, including [[religious denominations]] and [[religious organizations|organizations]], [[fraternities]], and [[sport clubs]]. It is closely linked with [[freedom of assembly]], particularly under the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]]. Freedom of assembly is typically associated with political contexts. However, (e.g. [[the U.S. Constitution]], [[human rights instruments]], etc.) the right to freedom of association may include the right to [[freedom of assembly]].

The courts and delegated officers of local jurisdictions may, however, impose restrictions on any of the rights of a convicted criminal as a condition of a legal stipulation. Rights to freedom of association and freedom of assembly are waived under certain circumstances, such as a guilty plea or conviction, restraining orders and probationer's [[search and seizure]] procedures.

==History==
The general freedom to associate with groups according to the choice of the individual, and for the groups to take action to promote their interests, has been a necessary feature of every democratic society. Because freedom of association necessarily recognizes pluralistic sources of power and organisation, aside from the government, it has been a primary target for repression by all dictatorial societies. In the [[United Kingdom]], all forms of "combination" were prohibited and criminal, particularly worker organisations, until the [[Combination Act 1825]]. After this, it was still not until the [[Companies Act 1856]], the [[Trade Union Act 1871]] and the [[Criminal Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]] that companies and then trade unions became generally lawful. In Germany, a similar set of repressive laws were put in place against both trade unions and social democrat organisations by the [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] government under the ''[[Sozialistengesetze]]'' (the "Socialist Acts") in 1878. These remained in force until 1890. In 1933, trade unions were once again prohibited by the [[Fascist]] dictatorship of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialist]] party, and the existing unions were nationalized and combined into a single government controlled [[German Labor Front]]. After [[World War II]], free trade unions were quickly resurrected and guaranteed by the German ''[[Grundgesetz]]''. In the [[United States]], trade unions were classified by various state courts, at various times, as being in [[restraint of trade]]. Under the [[Clayton Act of 1914]], trade unions were given a general freedom to organize and to act collectively to secure collective agreements, however further hurdles were put in place until the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] created a comprehensive labor code.

==Law==

===European Convention===
{{Main article|Article 11 ECHR}}

===Italian Constitution===
In [[Italy]] the freedom of association is established in Article 18 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Citizens have the right to form associations freely and without authorization for those ends that are not forbidden by criminal law.
Secret associations and associations that, even indirectly, pursue political aims by means of organisations having a military character shall be forbidden.}}

===South African Bill of Rights===
{{Main article|Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights}}

The [[South African Constitution]]'s Bill of Rights establishes the right to freedom of association in Section 18, which states "Everyone has the right to freedom of association." Furthermore, Section 17 states "Everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions", thus establishing the right to [[freedom of assembly]]. Workers' right to freedom of association in terms of the right to form trade unions and collective bargaining is recognized separately, in Section 23.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Constitution===
While the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] identifies the rights to assemble and to petition the [[government]], the text of the First Amendment does not make specific mention of a right to association.  Nevertheless, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[NAACP v. Alabama]]'' (1958) that freedom of association is an essential part of [[freedom of speech]] because, in many cases, people can engage in effective speech only when they join with others.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Batchis, Citizens United and the Paradox of "Corporate Speech": From Freedom of Association to Freedom of The Association, [http://socialchangenyu.com/2013/02/01/citizens-united-and-the-paradox-of-corporate-speech/ 36 N.Y.U. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Change 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513015149/http://socialchangenyu.com/2013/02/01/citizens-united-and-the-paradox-of-corporate-speech/ |date=2013-05-13 }} (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Intimate association===
A fundamental element of [[personal liberty]] is the right to choose to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships.  These intimate human relationships are considered forms of "intimate association."  The paradigmatic example of "intimate association" is the family.  Depending on the jurisdiction it may also extend to abortion, birth control and private, adult, non-commercial and consensual sexual relationships.

===Expressive association===
In the United States, expressive associations are groups that engage in activities protected by the First Amendment – [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], press, petitioning government for a redress of grievances, and the free exercise of [[religion]].  In ''[[Roberts v. United States Jaycees]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group's expression.  However, in the subsequent decisions of ''[[Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston]]'', the Court ruled that a group may exclude people from membership if their presence would affect the group's ability to advocate a particular point of view.  The government cannot, through the use of anti-discrimination laws, force groups to include a message that they do not wish to convey.

However, this concept does not now apply in the University setting due to the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Christian Legal Society v. Martinez]]'' (2010), which upheld Hastings College of Law policy that the school's conditions on recognizing student groups were viewpoint neutral and reasonable. The policy requires student organizations to allow "any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of their status or beliefs" and so, can be used to deny the group recognition as an official student organization because it had required its members to attest in writing that "I believe in: The Bible as the inspired word of God; The Deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ, God's son; The vicarious death of Jesus Christ for our sins; His bodily resurrection and His personal return; The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the work of regeneration; [and] Jesus Christ, God's son, is Lord of my life." The Court reasoned that because this constitutional inquiry occurs in the education context the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums applies. Thus, the college's all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student organization forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2009/08-1371|title=Christian Legal Society Chapter v. Martinez|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|publisher=Chicago-Kent College of Law at Illinois Tech|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Limitation====
The implicit First Amendment right of association in the [[U.S. Constitution]] has been limited by court rulings.  For example, it is illegal in the United States to consider race in the making and enforcement of private contracts other than marriage. This limit on freedom of association results from Section 1981 of Title 42 of the [[United States Code]], as balanced against the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in the 1976 decision of ''[[Runyon v. McCrary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|427|160|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The holding of ''Runyon'' is that the defendant private schools were free to ''express'' and teach their views, such as [[white separatism]], but could not discriminate on the basis of race in the ''provision'' of services to the general public.  So, if the plaintiff [[African-American]] children wished to attend such [[private school]]s, ''and'' were clearly qualified in all respects (but race) and were able to pay the fees, ''and'' were willing to attend ''despite'' the fact that the school's professed principles were inconsistent with admitting them, then the schools were required by Section 1981 to admit them.  This doctrine rests on the interpretation of a private contract as a "badge" of [[slavery]] when either party considers race in choosing the other.

Governments often require [[contracts of adhesion]] with private entities for licensing purposes, such as with [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] for [[stock market]] trading in the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934#Self-regulatory organizations (SRO)|1938 Maloney Act amendments]] to the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]. These contracts often bar association with banned members, as can be seen in ''United States v. Merriam'', 108 F.3d 1162.

===Organized labor===
{{see also|UK labour law|US labor law|European labour law|International labour law}}
The organization of labor was commonly resisted during the 19th century, with even relatively liberal countries such as the United Kingdom banning it for various periods (in the UK's case, between 1820 and 1824).&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle = Right of Voluntary Association | short = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the international labour movement, the freedom of association is a right identified under international labour standards as the right of workers to organize and [[collective bargaining|collectively bargain]].  Freedom of association, in this sense, is recognized as a fundamental human right by a number of documents including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and [[International Labour Organization]] [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948|Convention C87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949|Convention C98]] – two of the eight fundamental, core international labour standards. 'Freedom of association' can also refer to legal bans on private contracts negotiated between a private employer and their employees requiring workers at a particular workplace to join a union as a term and condition of employment. Supporters of this sort of private freedom of association claim that the right to join a union incorporates a right not to join a union. In the [[United States]], the term 'right to work' is more common for this type of law.

"The Supreme Court today (1-21-1997) sharply limited the ability of labor union organizers to go onto an employer's property to distribute literature or urge workers to join the union. 
In a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court said that the National Labor Relations Board had failed to give adequate protection to employers' property rights when it adopted a rule four years ago that gave union organizers greater access to areas like the parking lots of shopping centers or factories." -New York Times&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/28/us/supreme-court-roundup-limits-placed-on-union-organizers-on-employers-property.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Democracy and civil society===
Jeremy McBride argues that respect for the freedom of association by all public authorities and the exercising of this freedom by all sections of society are essential both to establish a "genuine [[democracy]]" and to ensure that, once achieved, it remains "healthy and flourishing". In this regard he sees the formation of political parties as a significant manifestation of the freedom of association.

The freedom of association is however not only exercised in the political sense, but also for a vast array of interests – such as culture, recreation, sport and social and humanitarian assistance. Jeremy McBride argues that the formation of [[non-governmental organizations]] ([[NGOs]]), which he equates with [[civil society]], is the "fruit of associational activity".&lt;ref name="Association1"&gt;Jeremy McBride, Freedom of Association, The Essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, London, 2005, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertarian===
{{Libertarianism sidebar &lt;!--|Concepts--&gt;}}
Freedom of association is a term popular in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] literature. It is used to describe the concept of absolute freedom to live in a community or be part of an organization whose [[values]] or [[culture]] are closely related to one's preferences; or, on a more basic level, to associate with any individual or group of one's choosing.

Under laws in such a system, business owners could refuse service to anyone for whatever reason. Opponents argue that such practices are regressive and would lead to greater [[prejudice]] within [[society]]. [[Right-libertarianism|Right-libertarians]] sympathetic to freedom of association, such as [[Richard Allen Epstein]], respond that in a case of refusing service (which thus is a case of the [[freedom of contract]]) unjustified discrimination incurs a cost and therefore a competitive disadvantage. [[Left-libertarianism|Left-libertarians]] argue that such refusal would place those businesses at an economic disadvantage to those that provide services to all, making them less profitable and eventually leading them to close down.

Libertarians also argue that freedom of association, in a political context, is merely the extension of the right to determine with whom to associate in one's personal life. For example, somebody who valued good manners or [[etiquette]] may not relish associating with someone who was not decent or was uncouth. Or, those opposed to homosexuality may not enjoy associating with [[gay]] people. In both instances, a person is voluntarily deciding with whom to associate, based on volition. Libertarians believe that freedom of association, in the political sphere, is not such a fanciful or unrealistic notion{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, since individual [[human being]]s already choose with whom they would like to associate based on a variety of reasons.

Libertarians also hold a strong opinion{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} on labour unions, and some support the workers right to choose in an election whether to join a labour union or not. Right to work legislation has been a hot topic of debate within the party, with a majority of Libertarians opposing the legislation {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Among libertarians there is no fixed view of unions beyond the principle of freedom of association. Gary Johnson, who won the Libertarian presidential nomination in 2012, presents this principle one way when he is quoted as saying in a 2014 Reddit interview {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} "No worker is forced to take a job in a union shop. If the workers who came before them made the decision to organize into a labour union, they did it for a reason. It might be unfair working conditions, unfair wages, favoritism, or general inequality in the workplace." Johnson went on to say "Libertarians love history, but we don't like to see it repeat itself, and the previous decision to organize must be respected by any new hire wishing to seek employment within that shop, or utilize his or her right to seek employment in a non-union shop. Otherwise, the conditions which have been corrected by the presence of a Union will deteriorate." Conversely libertarians also believe that while freedom of association includes the right for workers to organise as unions and to withdraw their labour it also recognises the right of an employer to replace that labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/a-free-market-in-labour-libertarians-employment-and-the-unions/|title=A free market in labour: libertarians, employment and the unions|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarians also believe that where unions employ coercive or violent tactics such behaviours would be in breach of libertarian principles. Some critics allege that such breaches have frequently been the case with union activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/myth-voluntary-unions|title=The Myth of Voluntary Unions|first=|last=anne|date=14 September 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Galápagos syndrome'''|ガラパゴス化|Garapagosu-ka|/ Galápagos effect}} is a term of Japanese origin, which refers to an isolated development branch of a globally available product. The term is used as an analogy to a part of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.  Darwin encountered in the [[Galápagos Islands]] isolated flora and fauna, which had undergone evolutionary changes independently from the mainland. This phenomenon was a key to the development of [[evolutionary theory]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Darwin stated that in the biological isolation species have evolved to develop different characteristics, allowing adaptation making them more viable in the local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Darwin in Galapagos |publisher=Galapagos Islands |url = http://www.galapagosislands.com/galapagos-history/galapagos-charles-darwin.html|website = www.galapagosislands.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a development of goods "in relative isolation from the rest of the world because of a focus on the local market"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Because of "Galapagos syndrome," most of Japan’s cash machines are useless to foreigners|url = http://qz.com/411905/because-of-galapagos-syndrome-most-of-japans-cash-machines-are-useless-to-foreigners/|website = Quartz|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to similarly differing products.

The term "Galápagos syndrome" has been used as a [[metaphor]] outside the field of business jargon. The term "Galápagosization", referring to the process of the isolation of Japanese "Galápagos-thinking", links this process to the Japanese [[island mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hugh Ashton "Japan’s Galapagos Effect" {{!}} ACCJ Journal (Journal of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan) on January 15, 2011|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/2013/10/07/galapagos/|website = ACCJ Journal, reproduced by kind permission of ACCJ at: Eurotechnology Japan KK|accessdate =2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is 'Galapagos-thinking' Japan back at its evolutionary dead end?|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2011/01/23/commentary/is-galapagos-thinking-japan-back-at-its-evolutionary-dead-end/#.VjevCK4vdE4|website = The Japan Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = island mentality - The Japan Times|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/island-mentality/|website = The Japan Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in Japan ==

=== Technology ===

==== Mobile phones ====
The term "Galápagos syndrome" was originally coined to refer to Japanese 3G [[mobile phones]], which had developed a large number of specialized [[Japanese mobile phone culture#Features|features]] that were widely adopted in the Japanese market, but were unsuccessful abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Jargon Watch |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/st_jw/ |quote=Galápagos syndrome n. The scourge of Japanese mobile companies, whose superadvanced 3G handsets won't work on foreign cell networks. It's named for the birds of the Galápagos, whose specialized beaks don't cut it on the mainland. |work=[[Wired magazine]] |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Devin Stewart]] |coauthors= |title=Slowing Japan's Galapagos Syndrome |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-stewart/slowing-japans-galapagos_b_557446.html |quote='Galapagos syndrome', a phrase originally coined to describe Japanese cell phones that were so advanced they had little in common with devices used in the rest of the world, could potentially spread to other parts of society. Indeed signs suggest it is happening already. |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the original usage of the term was to describe highly advanced phones that were incompatible outside of Japanese networks, as the mobile phone industry underwent drastic changes globally, the term was used to emphasize the associated anxiety about how the development of Japanese mobile phones and those in the worldwide economy went along different paths. A derived term is {{nihongo|Gara-phone|ガラケー|gara-kei}}, blending with {{nihongo|"mobile phone"|携帯|keitai}}, used to refer to Japanese [[feature phone]]s, by contrast with newer [[smart phone]]s.

* The term has since been used for similar phenomena in other markets.{{examples|date=August 2016}}

==== Cash machines ====
Across Japan, the majority of the 190,000 [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] do not accept bank and credit cards that have been issued outside of the country. Currently, only about 20,000 post offices and convenience stores allow retrieving cash using non-Japanese bank cards. Due to pressure from the Japanese government concerning this issue, by 2020 the number of ATMs that accept cards issued outside Japan is estimated to increase from 48,000 to 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ATMs in Japan|url = http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html|website = www.japan-guide.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing numbers of international tourists in Japan, the country still attracts relatively few tourists according to the [[United Nations World Tourism Organization]], which ranked Japan 27th in the list of most visited countries 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Japanese Banks to Ease Tourists’ ATM Frustrations|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/japanese-banks-to-link-more-atms-to-global-grid-1426218340|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-02|issn = 0099-9660|first = Atsuko|last = Fukase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wallet phone ====
In 2004 the wallet phone was introduced in Japan as a means to allow [[mobile payment]] alongside numerous other applications. In some ways the wallet phone can be seen as a predecessor of mobile payment tools that were later released on the global market such as [[Apple Pay]] or [[Google Wallet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wallet phone Japan and the mobile payment ecosystem|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/store/walletphone/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete integration of multiple tools served to make the classical wallet redundant as the phone allows all types of payments, having train tickets or other everyday needs to be organized on the phone. In many ways the Japanese contactless infrastructure has been and is superior as compared to the current state in rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Apple Pay?

=== The Japanese car market ===

==== Kei cars (軽自動車) ====
[[Kei car|Kei Cars]] ("light cars") are small four-wheeled vehicles/cars that have an engine of less than 660cc and enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax advantages and lower insurance cost. Originally the Japanese government encouraged the use of those "light cars". This category of cars features a number of different car types including sport cars, minivans and commercial vehicles. However, Kei cars are not seen as profitable in export markets and therefore are only part of the Japanese automobile market.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Chris (1995). ''Microcar Mania''. Minster Lovell &amp; New Yatt, Oxfordshire, UK: Bookmarque Publishing. {{ISBN|1-870519-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite no significant global success, major Japanese car manufacturers such as Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu and Honda still produce models belonging into the Kei car category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Galapagos effect – how can Japan capture global value?|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/insights/galapagos/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Kei car has a significant portion of Japanese car market, Japanese auto makers cannot ignore them.  Although the regulatory differences between Kei cars and 1L cars are quite small, the tax benefit of Kei cars is considerable. Until the tax reform in 2013, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate was a quarter of that of 1L cars (¥7200 to ¥29500). This significantly lower tax rate gathered much criticism from European and US auto makers, and as such the EU, the US and Toyota do not make Kei cars. In 2013, the Japanese government revised the vehicle tax law. The new vehicle tax law became effective in 2015. With new vehicle tax law, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate is about 36% of that of 1L cars (¥10800 to ¥29500).

== Handling the Japanese Galápagos syndrome ==
There are many associated issues with the inability to compete on the international export market. In order to revive the parts of the Japanese economy that have suffered from the "Galápagosization", affected businesses had to find the reasons responsible for the development.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Galápagosization of Japan continues. According to a survey released today, a shocking two-thirds of the country’s white-collar workers said they didn’t want to work abroad ... ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mariko | last = Sanchanta | title = Japan’s Workers: Please Don’t Send Me Abroad. Ever. | date = 2010-09-16 | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/09/16/japans-workers-please-dont-send-me-abroad-ever/ | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Reasons for the issue and associated implications for businesses ===
Furthermore, this has led a number of Japanese companies to adapt their business strategies. [[Hiroshi Mikitani]], CEO of e-commerce company [[Rakuten]], sees the exclusive use of Japanese in workplaces at the centre of the problem. Following his belief that "a language will open your eyes to the 'global', and you will break free from this conventional wisdom of a pure Japan",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hiroshi Mikitani|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/724b144e-b538-11e1-ad93-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0307-1766|first = David|last = Pilling}}&lt;/ref&gt; the co-founder and CEO of [[Rakuten]] made English the main language to be spoken in the company. Dr. Gerhard Fasol, the only European member of Euro Technology Japan's "Galapagos study group", stated that another reason for the non-success of some innovative Japanese products is Europe's conservative standpoint when it comes to certain standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan Galapagos effect. How to capture global value for Japan|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/2013/10/07/galapagos/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the belief that it will improve international competitiveness [[Tadashi Yanai]], the founder and president of [[Fast Retailing]], has decided to change the way the firm works against classical Japanese business methods. A shift of the production of some textiles out of Japan to Southeast Asia was a move to the low-wage-labour market, that aimed to enable to price compete on the international textile market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globalisierung: Tabubruch|url = http://www.wiwo.de/erfolg/trends/globalisierung-tabubruch/6957128-2.html|website = www.wiwo.de|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor which [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] points out is the need for Japanese companies to adapt to stronger competition when entering global markets. This should be done by accepting to think in "new and unfamiliar ways about organization, marketing, and strategy", whilst the traditional practices that helped the companies to become a big player in the Japanese market shall be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan’s globalization imperative|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/japans_globalization_imperative|website = www.mckinsey.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that companies have started to address the issue, which ''could'' have a link to the total value of exports increasing over the past five years, there are concerns about the future Galápagosization of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trade Statistics of Japan  Ministry of Finance|url = http://www.customs.go.jp/toukei/suii/html/nenbet_e.htm|website = www.customs.go.jp|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future threats ===
With the aging and shrinking Japanese population, the fact that fewer and fewer students study abroad to acquire a more internationally oriented university education is reason for concerns over the future of the Japanese economy. Furthermore, there is a conception that the younger generation could enhance the Galápagos effect due to a lack of interest in international education and work placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who will look after Japan's elderly?|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31901943|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Mariko Oi BBC|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiyoshi Takeuchi, sociology professor at the Sophia university, describes the young generation to have less "ambition and motivation" as a result from the fear that a wrong move could have negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Children fear that in a society with a widening gap between the rich and the poor, making a big mistake will prevent them from moving up in the world, which diminishes their ambition and motivation.|url = http://www.japantoday.com/category/quote-of-the-day/view/children-fear-that-in-a-society-with-a-widening-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-making-a-big-mistake-will-prevent-them-from-moving-up-in-the-world-which-diminishes-their-ambition-and-motivation|website = Japan Today|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term referring to instances outside Japan==

=== China ===
* Stephen Ezell and [[Robert D. Atkinson]] describe a similar phenomenon pointing out associated threats this could mean for the Chinese economy. The selling of a product in China could become more expensive for foreign producers due to the fact that they now have to incorporate the Chinese technology standards into their firm. In theory, this could be beneficial for domestic producers. However, this could also lead to an isolation of the respective domestic producers due to less international competitiveness. "China has made the development of indigenous technology standards ... a core component of its industrial development strategy. ... But, by using indigenous rather than global technology standards for ICT products, China risks engendering a 'Galapagos Island' effect that isolates Chinese ICT products, technologies, and markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Middle Kingdom Galapagos Island Syndrome: The Cul-De-Sac of Chinese Technology Standards {{!}} ITIF|url = https://itif.org/publications/2014/12/15/middle-kingdom-galapagos-island-syndrome-cul-de-sac-chinese-technology|website = itif.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese tech firms can avoid the Galapagos effect that got Japan{{!}}Chris Davis{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2014-12/17/content_19111144.htm|website = usa.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
* [[Mark Leonard (director)|Mark Leonard]] describes threats of how, against the predictions he made in 2005 in his book ''Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century'', the political development of the [[European Union]] happened isolated and differently than in any other political system in the world. "Europe might now be facing its own 'Galápagos moment.' ...  It may be that Europe’s postmodern order has become so advanced and particular to its environment that it is impossible for others to follow. It evolved in a protective ecosystem, shielded from the more muscular, "modern" world where most people live."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Europe’s Galápagos moment|url = http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europes_galapagos_moment|website = www.ecfr.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
* The United States was slow to adopt the [[EMV]] standard for credit and debit cards (as opposed to swiped [[magnetic stripe card]]s), which have been widely-adopted elsewhere, with merchants citing the cost of upgrading hardware and other systems to support it. Work to encourage transition began in 2015 following a series of high-profile retail data breaches involving credit card data. Payment providers implemented deadlines under which liability for fraud would shift to merchants if they did not begin accepting EMV payments by a specific date. As of April 2016, 70% of U.S. consumers had EMV cards, and around half of merchants were EMV compliant as of December 2016. However, the rollout has faced challenges, including merchants with EMV-compatible hardware that do not support EMV transactions due to a lack of certification or software support, and complaints that chip-based transactions took more time to process than swipe cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3182785/retail/is-the-rocky-road-to-emv-retail-adoption-getting-smoother.html|title=Is the rocky road to EMV retail adoption getting smoother?|first=Sharon|last=Goldman|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/in-2015-chip-cards-were-rare-in-the-us-three-years-later-slow-progress/|title=What happened after the US moved to chip-embedded payment cards?|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/717876/the-chip-card-transition-in-the-us-has-been-a-disaster/|title=The EMV chip credit card transition in the US has been a disaster|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/the-plan-to-make-chip-credit-cards-less-annoying|title=The Plan to Make Chip Credit Cards Less Annoying|date=2017-07-17|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerrard Winstanley''' (19 October 1609&amp;nbsp;– 10 September 1676) was an English [[Protestant]] religious reformer, political philosopher, and activist during [[The Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Winstanley was the leader and one of the founders of the English group known as the True Levellers or [[Diggers]] for their beliefs, and for their actions. The group occupied public lands that had been privatised by [[enclosures]] and dug them over, pulling down hedges and filling in ditches, to plant crops. True Levellers was the name they used to describe themselves, whereas the term Diggers was coined by contemporaries.

==Biography==
Gerrard Winstanley was born on 19 October 1609 and was baptised in the [[Wigan|parish of Wigan]], then part of the [[West Derby (hundred)|West Derby hundred]] of [[Lancashire]]. He was the son of an Edward Winstanley, [[mercer (occupation)|mercer]]. His mother's identity remains unknown and he could have been born anywhere in the parish of Wigan.&lt;ref&gt;Bradstock, Andrew (2000) ''Winstanley and the Diggers 1649–1999'' Frank Cass, London p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; The parish of Wigan contained the townships of [[Abram, Greater Manchester|Abram]], [[Aspull, Greater Manchester|Aspull]], [[Billinge and Winstanley Urban District|Billinge-and-Winstanley]], Dalton, [[Haigh, Greater Manchester|Haigh]], [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]], [[Ince-in-Makerfield]], [[Orrell, Greater Manchester|Orrell]], [[Pemberton, Greater Manchester|Pemberton]], and [[Upholland]], as well as Wigan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Wigan|title=Wigan|website=GENUKI: UK &amp; Ireland Genealogy|access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved in 1630 to London, where he became an apprentice and ultimately, in 1638, a freeman of the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Tailors' Company]] or [[guild]]. He married Susan King, the daughter of London surgeon William King, in 1639. The [[English Civil War]], however, disrupted his business, and in 1643 he was made bankrupt. His father-in-law helped Winstanley move to [[Cobham, Surrey]], where he initially worked as a cowherd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alsop|first=J. D.|year=1989|title=Ethics in the Marketplace: Gerrard Winstanley's London Bankruptcy, 1643|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=28|issue=2|pages=97–119|jstor=175591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In 1657 Winstanley and his wife Susan received a gift of property in Ham Manor in Cobham, from his father-in-law William King. This marked Winstanley's renovation in social status locally and he became [[waywarden]] of the parish in 1659, [[overseer of the poor]] in 1660 and [[churchwarden]] in 1667–68. He was elected Chief Constable of [[Elmbridge (hundred)|Elmbridge]], Surrey in October 1671. These offices on the face of it conflicted with Winstanley's apparent [[Quakerism]], a religion which later became more [[quietist]].

When Susan died about 1664 Winstanley was paid £50 for the land in Cobham by King. Winstanley returned to London trade, whilst retaining his connections in Surrey. In about 1665 he married his second wife Elizabeth Stanley and re-entered commerce as a corn chandler. Winstanley died in 1676, aged 66, vexed by legal disputes concerning a small legacy owed to him in a will.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal|first=James|last=Alsop|title=Gerrard Winstanley's Later Life|journal=Past &amp; Present|issue=82|year=1979|pages=73–81|jstor=650593|postscript=none}} and {{cite journal|first=J. D.|last=Alsop|title=Gerrard Winstanley: Religion and Respectability|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=28|issue=3|year=1985|pages=705–709|jstor=2639146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Civil Wars==
There were many factions at work during the period of the three related English civil wars. They included the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] who supported [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]; the [[Parliamentary]] forces led by Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] who would later emerge under the name of the [[New Model Army]]; the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who believed in the establishment of a heavenly [[theocracy]] on earth to be led by a returning Jesus as king of kings and lord of lords; the Agitators for political egalitarian reform of government, who were branded "[[Levellers]]" by their foes and who were led by [[John Lilburne]]; and the True Levellers, who were branded "Diggers" because of their actions. The latter were led by Gerrard Winstanley. Whereas Lilburne sought to level the laws and maintain the right to the ownership of real property, Winstanley sought to level the ownership of real property itself, which is why Winstanley's followers called themselves "True Levellers".

==The New Law of Righteousness==
Gerrard Winstanley published a [[pamphlet]] called ''The New Law of Righteousness''. The basis of this work came from the [[Book of Acts]], chapter two, verses 44 and 45: "All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need."  Winstanley argued that "in the beginning of time God made the earth. Not one word was spoken at the beginning that one branch of mankind should rule over another, but selfish imaginations did set up one man to teach and rule over another."

Winstanley took as his basic texts the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[sacred history]], with its affirmation that all men were descended from a common stock, and with its scepticism about the rulership of kings, voiced in the [[Books of Samuel]]; and the [[New Testament]]'s affirmations that God was no respecter of persons, that there were no masters or slaves under the [[New Covenant]]. From these and similar texts, he interpreted Christian teaching as calling for the abolition of property [in land] and aristocracy.

Winstanley wrote: "Seeing the common people of England by joynt consent of person and purse have caste out Charles our Norman oppressour, wee have by this victory recovered ourselves from under his [[Norman Yoke|Norman yoake]]."

His theme was rooted in ancient English radical thought. It went back at least to the days of the [[Peasants' Revolt]] (1381) led by [[Wat Tyler]], because that is when a verse of the [[Lollard]] priest [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] was circulated:
:When [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] delved and Eve span,
:Who was then the gentleman?

==The Diggers==
On 1st April 1649, Winstanley and his followers took over vacant or common lands on St George's Hill in [[Surrey]]. Other Digger colonies followed in Buckinghamshire, [[Kent]], and [[Northamptonshire]]. Their action was to cultivate the land and distribute food without charge to any who would join them in the work. Local landowners took fright from the Diggers' activities and in 1650 sent hired armed men to beat the Diggers and destroy their colony. Winstanley protested to the government, but to no avail, and eventually the colony was abandoned.

After the failure of the Digger experiment in Surrey in 1650 Winstanley temporarily fled to [[Pirton, Hertfordshire]], where he took up employment as an estate steward for the mystic aristocrat [[Lady Eleanor Davies]]. This employment lasted less than a year after Davies accused Winstanley of mismanaging her property and Winstanley returned to Cobham.

Winstanley continued to advocate the redistribution of land. In 1652 he published another [[pamphlet]] called ''[[The Law of Freedom in a Platform]]'', in which he argued that the Christian basis for society is where property and wages are abolished. In keeping with Winstanley's adherence to biblical models, the tract envisages a communistic society structured on patriarchal lines.

==Quakers==
By 1654 Winstanley was possibly assisting [[Edward Burrough]], an early leader of the Quakers, later called the [[Society of Friends]].&lt;ref&gt;See Friends House Library, London, William Caton MS 3 p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Winstanley remained a Quaker for the rest of his life, since his death was noted in Quaker records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. T.|last=Vann|title=From Radicalism to Quakerism: Gerrard Winstanley and Friends|journal=Journal of the Friends Historical Society|volume=XLIX|year=1959|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his Quakerism may not have been very strong as he was involved in the government of his local parish church from 1659 onwards&amp;nbsp;– though it should be noted that it is not unknown for committed Quakers to retain strong ties to other religious traditions, even including priesthood. He may have been buried in a Quaker cemetery.

Winstanley believed in [[Christian Universalism]], the doctrine that everyone, however sinful, will [[universal reconciliation|eventually be reconciled]] to God; he wrote that "in the end every man shall be saved, though some at the last hour."  His book ''The Mysterie of God'' is apparently the first theological work in the English language to state this universalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boulton |first=David |title=Militant Seedbeds of Early Quakerism: Winstanley and Friends |date=March 2005|url=http://www.universalistfriends.org/boulton.html |website=Quaker Universalist Voice|accessdate=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Soviet-era [[Alexander Garden Obelisk]] in Moscow, Russia, in 1918 included his name among a list of outstanding thinkers and personalities of the struggle for the liberation of workers. 

In 1999, the British activist group [[The Land is Ours]] celebrated the Digger movement's 350th anniversary with a march and reoccupation of [[St George's Hill]], the site of the first Digger colony. Like the original colony, this settlement was quickly disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlio.org.uk/campaigns/diggers/d350pr.html |deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328075506/http://www.tlio.org.uk/campaigns/diggers/d350pr.html|archive-date=28 March 2014|title=In 1649 to St Georges Hill |publisher=

Since 2011 a Wigan Diggers Festival has been held annually in Winstanley's birth town of Wigan attracting support across the North of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyland |first=Bernadette |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/31/unite-labour |title=Wigan stakes its claim to be the home of Socialism |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collected works===
''The Complete Works of Gerrard Winstanley'', edited jointly by Thomas N. Corns, Ann Hughes and David Loewenstein, were published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in December 2009 at £229 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-957606-7}}).

A shorter and less comprehensive volume containing all the major works, ''Gerrard Winstanley: A Common Treasury'' edited by Andrew Hopton, was published in 1989 by Aporia ({{ISBN|978-0-948518-45-4}}) and reprinted several times since, most recently in 2011 (paperback) by [[Verso Books]] (UK) with an introduction by [[Tony Benn]] ({{ISBN|978-1-84467-595-1}}).

In 2009 [[UKA Press]] released ''Winstanley: Warts and all'' ({{ISBN|978-1-905796-22-9}}), the story of the making of the film "Winstanley", written by film director and film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]].

The song, "The World Turned Upside Down," by English folksinger [[Leon Rosselson]], weaves many of Winstanley's own words into the lyrics. An older song, the "[[Diggers' Song]]", said to be written by Winstanley was recorded by the English group [[Chumbawamba]] on their ''[[English Rebel Songs 1381–1984|English Rebel Songs 1381–1914]]'' in 1988.

==Quotations==
From ''A Declaration from the Poor Oppressed People of England'':
*"The power of enclosing land and owning property was brought into the creation by your ancestors by the sword; which first did murder their fellow creatures, men, and after plunder or steal away their land, and left this land successively to you, their children. And therefore, though you did not kill or thieve, yet you hold that cursed thing in your hand by the power of the sword; and so you justify the wicked deeds of your fathers, and that sin of your fathers shall be visited upon the head of you and your children to the third and fourth generation, and longer too, till your bloody and thieving power be rooted out of the land."

From ''A Watch-word to the City of London, and Army'':
*"Alas! you poor blind earth-moles, you strive to take away my livelihood and the liberty of this poor weak frame my body of flesh, which is my house I dwell in for a time; but I strive to cast down your kingdom of darkness, and to open hell gates, and to break the devil's bonds asunder wherewith you are tied, and that you my enemies may live in peace; and that is all the harm I would have you to have."

From ''A New-year's Gift for the Parliament and Army'':
*"The life of this dark kingly power, which you have made an act of Parliament and oath to cast out, if you search it to the bottom, you shall see it lies within the iron chest of cursed covetousness, who gives the earth to some part of mankind and denies it to another part of mankind: and that part that hath the earth, hath no right from the law of creation to take it to himself and shut out others; but he took it away violently by theft and murder in conquest."

From ''The Law of Freedom in a Platform'':
*"if they prove desperate, wanton or idle, and will not quietly submit to the law, the task-master is to feed them with short diet, and to whip them, for a rod is prepared for the fool's back, till such time as their proud hearts do bend to the law&amp;nbsp;... If any have so highly broke the laws as they come within the compass of whipping, imprisoning and death, the executioner shall cut off the head, hang or shoot to death, or whip the offender according to the sentence of law. Thus you may see what the work of every officer in a town or city is."

== Protestant Reformation ==
Winstanley and German Protestant revolutionary [[Thomas Müntzer]] both supported anarchism. [[Libertarian socialist]] scholar [[Murray Bookchin]]: "In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was Thomas Müntzer; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the [[Diggers|Digger movement]]. The concepts held by Müntzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Müntzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Lewis_Herber__Murray_Bookchin___Ecology_and_Revolutionary_Thought.html Lewis Herber.

The '''Great Eastern Crisis''' of 1875–78 began in the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Rumelia|territories on the Balkan peninsula]] in 1875, with the outbreak of several uprisings and wars that resulted in the meddling of international powers, and was ended with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in July 1878.

It is also called {{lang-sh|Velika istočna kriza}}; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Şark Buhranı'' ("Eastern Crisis", for the crisis in general), ''Ramazan Kararnamesi'' ("Decree of Ramadan", for the [[sovereign default]] declared on 30 October 1875) and ''93 Harbi'' ("War of 93", for the wars on the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] between 1877–78, referring in particular to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], the year 1293 on the Islamic [[Rumi calendar]] corresponding to the year 1877 on the [[Gregorian calendar]])

==Background==
{{further|Eastern Question}}
[[File:Fred. W. Rose The Avenger An Allegorical War Map for 1877 1877 Cornell CUL PJM 1080 01.jpg|thumb|The Avenger: An Allegorical War Map for 1877 by Fred. W. Rose, 1872: This map reflects the "Great Eastern Crisis" and the subsequent Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78.]]
The state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while at the same time managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia]] suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Austria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and [[irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents.

===Ottoman economic crisis and default===
On 24 August 1854,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunyabulteni.net/haberler/223872/osmanli-devleti-ilk-kez-dis-borc-aldi Dünya Bülteni: "Osmanlı Devleti ilk kez dış borç aldı"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=derinstrateji&gt;[http://derinstrateji.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/tarih-osmanli-borclari-ve-duyun-u-umumiye-idaresi/ Derin Strateji: "Osmanlı Borçları ve Düyun-u Umumiye İdaresi"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yazarport.com/Yazi/Oku/385 Yazarport: "Kırım Savaşı ve İlk Dış Borçlanma (1854-1855)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ottomandebthistory&gt;[http://gberis.e-monsite.com/categorie,osmanli-borclanma-tarihi-ottoman-debt-history,3219214.html History of the Ottoman public debt]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Crimean War]], the Ottoman Empire took its first [[Ottoman public debt|foreign loans]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Arthur Howard: "The History of Turkey", page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mevzuat&gt;[http://www.mevzuatdergisi.com/2006/04a/03.htm Mevzuat Dergisi, Yıl: 9, Sayı: 100, Nisan 2006: "Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nda ve Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Borçlanma Politikaları ve Sonuçları"]&lt;/ref&gt; The empire entered into subsequent loans, partly to finance the construction of railways and telegraph lines, and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditures of the imperial court, such as the construction of new palaces on the [[Bosphorus]] [[strait]] in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6667a18a-b888-11dc-893b-0000779fd2ac.html|title=An Ottoman warning for indebted America|author=[[Niall Ferguson]]|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2 January 2008|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Second French Empire|French]] banks (owned by the [[Rothschild family]]) which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gold for the Sultan: Western Bankers and Ottoman Finance, 1856–1881'', by Christopher Clay, London, 2001, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of money was also spent for building new ships for the [[Ottoman Navy]] during the reign of Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (r. 1861–1876). In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 [[battleship]]s and 173 warships of other types, which formed the third largest naval fleet in the world after those of the British and French navies. All of these expenditures, however, put a huge strain on the Ottoman treasury. In the meantime, a severe drought in [[Anatolia]] in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare a [[sovereign default]] on its foreign loan repayments on 30 October 1875 and increase taxes in all of its provinces, including the Balkans.&lt;ref name=mevzuat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;

===Uprisings and wars in the Balkans===
The decision to increase taxes for paying the Ottoman Empire's [[Ottoman public debt|debts to foreign creditors]] sparked an [[#Chronology of the Great Eastern Crisis and its aftermath|outrage in the Balkan provinces]], which culminated in the Great Eastern Crisis and ultimately the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] that provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire's Balkan territories, with the subsequent [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878. The war, however, was disastrous for the already struggling Ottoman economy and the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] was established in 1881, which gave the control of the Ottoman state revenues to foreign creditors.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sovereignty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krasner|first1=Stephen D.|title=Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=tHJ5m56sBX4C |page=135 }} |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|OPDA]] for collecting various types of tax and customs revenues.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serb army]] from the [[Sanjak of Niš|Sanjak of Niș]] and fled to the [[Kosovo Vilayet]].&lt;ref&gt;Pllana, Emin (1985).

==Aftermath==
After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878, [[Austria-Hungary]] stationed military garrisons in the [[Bosnia Vilayet|Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia]] and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which formally ([[de jure]]) continued to be Ottoman territories. Taking advantage of the chaos that occurred during the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|Bulgaria declared its formal independence]] on 5 October 1908. The following day, [[Bosnian crisis|Austria-Hungary unilaterally annexed Bosnia]] on 6 October 1908, but pulled its military forces out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise with the Ottoman government and avoid a war (the Ottoman Empire lost the Sanjak of Novi Pazar with the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913.)

In 1881, [[France]] [[Beylik of Tunis|occupied the Ottoman Beylik of Tunisia]], with the excuse that Tunisian troops had crossed the border into [[French Algeria|their colony of Algeria]], which also [[Ottoman Algeria|formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire]] until 1830. A year later, in 1882, the [[British Empire]] [[Khedivate of Egypt|occupied the Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt]], with the pretext of giving military assistance to the Ottomans for putting down the [[Urabi Revolt]] (Britain later declared Egypt [[Sultanate of Egypt|a British protectorate]] on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman government's decision to join [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Articles 17, 18 and 19 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]&lt;/ref&gt;) It is worth noting that the Ottoman government had frequently declared the tax revenues from Egypt as a [[surety]] for borrowing loans from British and French banks.&lt;ref name=derinstrateji/&gt;&lt;ref name=mevzuat/&gt; The Ottoman government had earlier [[Cyprus Convention|leased Cyprus to Britain]] in 1878, in exchange for British support at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in the same year (Cyprus was later annexed by Britain on 5 November 1914, for the same aforementioned reason regarding the Ottoman participation in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Articles 20 and 21 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]&lt;/ref&gt;) By obtaining Cyprus and Egypt, Britain gained an important foothold in the East Mediterranean and control over the [[Suez Canal]]; while France increased its lands in the West Mediterranean coast of [[North Africa]] by adding Tunisia to its empire [[French protectorate of Tunisia|as a French protectorate]].

'''Hilde Lindemann''' (also ''Hilde Lindemann Nelson'') is an American philosophy professor and bioethicist currently teaching at [[Michigan State University]]. Lindemann earned her B.A. in German language and literature in 1969 at the [[University of Georgia]]. Lindemann also earned her M.A. in theatre history and dramatic literature, in 1972, at the [[University of Georgia]]. Lindemann began her career as a copyeditor for several universities ([http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/ Interview at 3AM Magazine]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/|title=No ethics without feminism|website=3:AM Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;). She then moved on to a job at the Hastings Center in New York City, an institute focused on bioethics research, and co-authored book ''The Patient in the Family'' before deciding to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Fordham University]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Previously, she taught at the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Vassar College]] and served as the associate editor of the [[Hastings Center Report]] (1990–95). Lindemann currently teaches courses on [[feminist philosophy]], identity and agency, naturalized bioethics, and narrative approaches to bioethics at Michigan State University.

==Contributions to philosophy==
Lindemann's work primarily focuses on feminist bioethics, the ethics of families, feminist ethics, and the social construction of identities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is the former editor of ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'' and was also coeditor, with [[Sara Ruddick]] and [[Margaret Urban Walker]], of the Feminist Constructions series for Rowman &amp; Littlefield. In addition, she coedited, with James Lindemann Nelson, a series on Reflective Bioethics for Routledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lindemann is a [[Hastings Center]] Fellow, a member of the advisory board for the Women’s Bioethics Project (2006–), and was the president of the [[American Society for Bioethics and Humanities]] (2008–2009).

Hilde Lindemann is a narrative [[ethicist]]. A narrative approach uses stories and relationships between people in specific cases, as well as generalizable examples, for moral contexts and discussion (Gotlib&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-e-n/|title=Feminist Ethics and Narrative Ethics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Two of her books, ''Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities'' and ''Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families,'' co-authored by her partner James Lindemann Nelson, have various reviews that summarize philosophical theories and ethics demonstrated in her works.

The review of ''Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities'' and ''Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families'' explains that Lindemann adopts a non-obscure, story-related approach to make readers think about realistic situations: "Only when we see ethical lives as diachronically and interpersonally structured and as embedded in narratively rich contexts can ethical reflection take hold in actual persons' lives" (Christman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/57247-holding-and-letting-go-the-social-practice-of-personal-identities/|title=Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame|last=Dame|first=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre|website=ndpr.nd.edu|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The review of the co-authored book, ''Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families'', also demonstrates that Lindemann employs case studies and life experiences for the patients and caregivers to convey ideas in her work (Moody&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moody|first=Harry|date=Jun 1, 1998|title=James Lindemann Nelson and Hilde Lindemann Nelson, "Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families" (Book Review)|url=http://search.proquest/docview/1303258761|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This method of provoking thought is aimed at a wide general audience of people who are not necessarily ethics scholars.

==Quotes on philosophy==
* "I think it’s a great mistake to see feminism as a war on men. Men aren’t responsible for the subordination of women – they just benefit from it. It’s not politically useful to set men up as the enemy, because that alienates people whom we need as allies. And it perpetuates the victor/vanquished, master/slave relation that’s the whole problem in the first place. If the gender system is ever to be dismantled, it won’t be by declaring war on men. It’s much better to affirm lots of differences among people without insisting that differences have to be ordered into power hierarchies"([http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/ Interview at 3AM Magazine] 2012&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).
* "Narrativists have claimed, among other things, that stories of one kind or another are required: (1) to teach us our duties, (2) to guide morally good action, (3) to motivate morally good action, (4) to justify action on moral grounds, (5) to cultivate our moral sensibilities, (6) to enhance our moral perception, (7) to make actions of persons morally intelligible, and (8) to reinvent ourselves as better persons (Nelson 2001, 36)." (Gotlib&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

'''''Incredibles 2''''' is a 2018 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[superhero film]] produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.

Following the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.

''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX]] and [[IMAX 3D]].

&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
The [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]], a family of superheroes, pursue the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]]. Although he escapes with stolen bank money, they stop his drill tank from destroying Metroville's City Hall with help from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Lucius Best]]. The government, concerned by the collateral damage, shuts down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs without financial assistance from agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]]. After [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s date [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] discovers her superhero identity, Dicker erases her from Tony's memory. Lucius informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Bob]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Helen]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], the owner of DevTech, a telecommunications corporation. Winston and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; propose a publicity stunt to regain public trust in superheroes.

Winston chooses Helen to spearhead the stunt under her old identity, Elastigirl, as she causes less property damage than Bob, and provides the Parr family with a new home. While Helen is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[List of The Incredibles characters#Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony stands her up, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. Bob brings Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that controls his abilities. Meanwhile, Elastigirl captures the Screenslaver, a supervillain who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images using television screens. She unmasks him as a deliveryman with no recollection of his actions.

At a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury ship. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself as the mastermind and true villain behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to rescue her father from being killed by burglars. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using a hypnotized Elastigirl, she lures Mr. Incredible into a trap, then sends other hypnotized superheroes to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.

Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by Bob during his time as Mr. Incredible, and reach Winston's ship. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship crew, aim the ship at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles, and she frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Parrs and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles. With Mr. Incredible swimming underwater to turn the rudder and Frozone creating layers of ice, they slow the ship and prevent it crashing into the city. Evelyn escapes in a jet, but is captured by Elastigirl. Superheroes around the world regain legal status.

Later, Tony accompanies Violet and her family to a movie. Outside the theater, the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit between [[police]] and gunmen. Violet leaves Tony at the theater and promises to return in time for the film, before the Parrs give chase in a refurbished Incredibile.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Following ''The Incredibles'', [[Brad Bird]] directed his next film for Pixar, ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', which was released in June 2007. Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to ''The Incredibles'', but only if it could be better than the original. He stated, "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=21218 |title=Bird on Toy Story 3 and The Incredibles 2 |date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have—because I love those characters, and love that world ... I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another ''Incredibles'' film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/brad-bird-incredibles-sequel-i-523427 |title=Brad Bird on 'Incredibles' Sequel: 'I Would Probably Wanna Do That' (Q&amp;A) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=May 16, 2013 |accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While publicizing the first film, Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles, and Jack-Jack would develop multiple powers unknown to the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-et-me-incredibles-2-premiere-20180606-story.html |title='Incredibles 2' team on the sequel's 14-year gap, and putting Elastigirl center stage |first=Christina |last=Schoellkopf |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 8, 2018 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Disney shareholder meeting in March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman [[Bob Iger]] confirmed that Pixar was working on an ''Incredibles'' sequel, and that Bird would return as writer.&lt;ref name=VarietyThirdCars&gt;{{cite news |last=Graser |first=Marc |title=Disney Plans Third 'Cars,' 'The Incredibles 2' |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/disney-plans-third-cars-the-incredibles-2-movies-1201137824/ |accessdate=March 18, 2014 |newspaper=Variety |date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird started the script around April 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pixar's Brad Bird Talks French Food, Animated Rats And New Film 'Tomorrowland' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=398343037 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=April 12, 2015 |date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that the ''Incredibles'' sequel would be his next film after ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chitwood |first=Adam |url=http://collider.com/incredibles-2-is-brad-birds-next-movie-talks-directing-star-wars-movie/ |title=The Incredibles 2 Is Brad Bird's Next Movie; Talks Star Wars Franchise |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] | accessdate=May 10, 2015 |date=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One challenge in writing ''Incredibles 2'' was how to deal with the large number of superhero films and television series that had been released since the first film, such as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-a-post-avengers-world-making-incredibles-2-was-/1100-6458282/ |title=In A Post-Avengers World, Making Incredibles 2 Was A Challenge |first=Michael |last=Rougeau |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To try to differentiate the sequel, Bird wanted to avoid tropes related to the superhero genre: "I don't think that kind of idea stays interesting for very long. For me, the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it. It was more the family dynamic, and how do superhero things play into that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |title=Why The Incredibles 2 Won't Comment On Modern Superhero Movies |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Incredibles-2-Won-t-Comment-Modern-Superhero-Movies-71400.html |website=Cinema Blend |accessdate=May 12, 2015 |date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he wanted to include some unused ideas from the first film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/unused-ideas-from-the-incredibles-will-finally-find-a-home-in-its-sequel-258 |title=Unused ideas from The Incredibles will finally find a home in its sequel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/brad-bird-says-incredibles-2-will-include-unused-ideas-first-film/ |title=The Incredibles 2 will include ideas that 'didn't fit' into the first film}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the new story would focus on Helen Parr / Elastigirl.&lt;ref name="polygon jul2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/14/15930920/incredibles-2-pixar-disney-elastigirl |title=The Incredibles 2 will focus on Elastigirl, include some noticeable upgrades |first=Julia |last=Alexander |date=July 14, 2017 |website=Polygon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the sequel was released fourteen years after the first, Bird did not want to use a narrative element like a [[timeskip]] or to come up with new characters, and instead continued from where the first film left off. This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones, nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults. This also allowed him to keep Jack-Jack as an infant with an array of powers, which Bird likened to how [[Language acquisition|infants are able to understand numerous languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-incredibles-2-starts-exactly-where-the-origina/1100-6458277/ |title=Why Incredibles 2 Starts Exactly Where The Original Ended |first=Michael |last=Rougeau |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the plot of the 2005 follow-up video game to ''The Incredibles'', ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer]]'', begins at that same point of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/14/15973580/the-incredibles-2-opening-pixar-d23 |title=The Incredibles 2 picks up right where the original left off |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=July 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film discards the game's continuity.  The film was produced with a production budget of $200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Tom Brueggemann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/pixar-incredibles-2-breaks-records-summer-box-office-1201975423/ |title=Pixar to the Rescue!

One advantage that Pixar had with ''Incredibles 2'' was the advancement of technology the company had seen since the original film and a team of much more experienced animators. Producer John Walker said, "I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it. It's just now about doing it quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vfxvoice.com/producers-and-animator-face-fresh-challenges-on-incredibles-2/ |title=Producers and Animator Face Fresh Challenges on INCREDIBLES 2 |first=Ian |last=Failes |date=June 25, 2018 |accessdate=June 25, 2018 |work=VFX Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Pixar no longer used the same systems from the first movie, all the characters had to be created from scratch on the computer again. The studio also used physically-based human eye models for the characters for the first time, even if the eyes are larger and more stylized than in real humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/incredibles-2-pixar-brad-bird-sequel-tech-1201976858/ |title='Incredibles 2': Pixar Improved its Toolbox to Meet the Superhero Demands of Brad Bird's Sequel |first=Bill |last=Desowitz |date=June 20, 2018 |website=''Indiewire.com'' |accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then asked theaters to warn audiences about the scene in a memo that read, "''Incredibles 2'' contains a sequence of flashing lights, which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/06/17/disney-issues-epilepsy-seizure-warning-incredibles-2/708879002/ |title=Disney issues seizure warning about 'Incredibles 2' for fans with epilepsy |work=USA Today |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
Following the release of ''Incredibles 2'', director [[Brad Bird]] acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. "There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else." Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles. Producer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] would not "rule [a third film] out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/17/incredibles-3-potential-brad-bird/ |title=Could there be an Incredibles 3?

In law, '''intervention''' is a procedure to allow a [[Party (law)|nonparty]], called '''intervenor''' (also spelled '''intervener''') to join ongoing [[litigation]], either as a matter of right or at the discretion of the court, without the permission of the original litigants. The basic rationale for intervention is that a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] in a particular [[Legal case|case]] may affect the rights of nonparties, who ideally should have the right to be heard.

==Canadian practice==
Intervenors are most common in [[appeal|appellate]] proceedings, but can also appear at other types of legal proceeding such as a [[trial (law)|trial]].

In general, it is within the discretion of the court to allow or refuse an application to intervene. There are exceptions to this however (for example, under subrule 61(4) of the Rules of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], if the court has stated a constitutional question then the attorney general of any province or territory, or of the federal government, may intervene "as of right", i.e. without the need to be granted leave to intervene).

Courts will tend to allow an application to intervene if the applicant will provide a ''different perspective'' on the issues before the court, without ''expanding'' those issues.

Intervenors are permitted in criminal matters as well as civil matters. However, courts sometimes express concern in allowing applications for intervention in criminal matters where the applicant will make arguments against the position of the accused. It sometimes is seen as unfair that the accused in a criminal matter be required to meet arguments from sources other than the prosecution.

There are several distinct reasons why someone might wish to intervene in a proceeding:

*if the proposed intervenor is currently a litigant in a case with legal issues similar or identical to the case at hand;
*if the proposed intervenor represents a group of people who have a direct concern in the legal issues raised in a case (for example, if the case involves deportation of a particular individual, an application for leave to intervene might be made by an interest group for the rights of refugee claimants);
*if the proposed intervenor is concerned that the court's decision in a particular case might be so broad as to affect the proposed intervenor's interests; in other words it would be an intervention to ensure that the court's ruling does not have "accidental" unintended effects.

It is often said that the role of intervenors is to "assist" the court in making a just decision on the dispute at hand. While it is true that judges sometimes do indicate that intervenors have been of aid to the court in reaching a decision, the use of the word "assist" can be seen as misleading in that it implies the intervenor is acting altruistically. In general, the goal of the intervenor is to influence the court in making its decision, not just to "assist" the court.

Canadian courts (also courts in UK) use the term "[[amicus curiae]]" in a more limited sense. Generally, in Canada, an amicus curiae is someone who has been specifically commissioned by the court to provide a viewpoint which the court believes is necessary and otherwise lacking. By contrast, an intervenor is someone who has applied to the court to be heard on a matter. For example, the ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec|Quebec Secession Reference]]'' (a case in the Supreme Court of Canada) had one amicus curiae and several intervenors.

==United Kingdom==
The [[Attorney General of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)|Attorney-General]] has the right to intervene in a private lawsuit if the lawsuit may affect "the [[Royal prerogative|prerogatives of the Crown]], including its relations with foreign states". Furthermore, the Attorney-General may intervene with leave of the court where "the suit raises any question of [[public policy (law)|public policy]] on which the executive may have a view which it may desire to bring to the notice of the court".&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v Adams'' [1970] 3 All ER 572; [http://uniset.ca/other/cs2/1971P188.html [1971&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; P 188]; [1970] 3 WLR 934.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States federal courts]], intervention is governed by [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_02000024----000-.html Rule 24] of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

* Rule 24(a) governs intervention of right. A potential party (called the applicant) has the right to intervene in a case either (1) when a federal statute explicitly confers upon the applicant an unconditional right to intervene or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the [[lawsuit]]. In the second situation, in order to be admitted as an intervenor, the applicant must show that its ability to protect its interest would be impeded by disposition of the case and that its interest is not adequately represented by the current parties to the case.
* Rule 24(b) provides for permissive intervention, which is subject to the discretion of the judge hearing the case. An applicant may be permitted by the court to intervene (1) when a federal statute confers upon the applicant a conditional right to intervene or (2) when the applicant's claim or defense shares a common question of law or fact with the main action. Agents of the federal or [[U.S. state|state]] government may be permitted by the court to intervene when a party to a case relies on a federal or state statute or [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]], or any [[regulation]] promulgated thereunder, for its claim or defense.

In both intervention of right and permissive intervention, the applicant must make a timely application to be heard. The applicant cannot sit on its rights; it must intervene as soon as it has reason to know that its interest may be adversely affected by the outcome of the pending litigation. The applicant must [[Service of process|serve]] its [[Motion (legal)|motion]] to intervene on the parties to the case and explain its reasons for intervening in the motion papers. In addition, U.S. federal law does not allow the procedure of intervention to violate the requirements of [[diversity jurisdiction]]. The court must have either diversity jurisdiction or [[federal question jurisdiction]] over the intervenor's claim. [[Supplemental jurisdiction]] is not permitted for intervention claims under {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1367}}(b) when the original claim's federal jurisdiction was based solely on diversity and exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the intervening claim would be inconsistent with the diversity requirements of {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1332}}.  However, [[supplemental jurisdiction]] is permitted when the claims are so related that they form the same case or controversy.

In the courts of the State of Texas, a jurisdiction whose rules of civil procedure &lt;ref&gt;http://www.txcourts.gov/media/1435952/trcp-all-updated-with-amendments-effective-january-1-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; differ considerably from the rules of civil procedure in federal court, a nonparty may intervene in a pending lawsuit by filing a pleading, which is typically called “plea in intervention” or “petition in intervention” without leave of the court, but any party in the pending lawsuit may object and ask for the intervention to be struck for cause. TEX. R. CIV. P. 60 ("Any party may intervene by filing a pleading, subject to being stricken out by the court for sufficient cause on the motion of any party."). While the Texas rules of civil procedure require no judicial permission and impose no intervention deadline, the common law dictates that a party may not intervene post-judgment unless the trial court first sets aside the judgment. See State v. Naylor, 466 S.W.3d 783, 788 (Tex. 2015).&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8002939656385522269&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,44&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, an intervenor must enter the lawsuit before final judgment to have standing to bring an appeal.

{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
An '''intrusion detection system''' ('''IDS''') is a device or [[software application]] that monitors a [[Computer network|network]] or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a [[security information and event management]] (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses [[alarm filtering]] techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks.&lt;ref&gt; Axelsson, S (2000). [http://neuro.bstu.by/ai/To-dom/My_research/Paper-0-again/For-research/D-mining/Anomaly-D/Intrusion-detection/taxonomy.pdf "Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey and Taxonomy"] (retrieved 21 May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The most common classifications are '''network intrusion detection systems''' ('''NIDS''') and '''[[host-based intrusion detection system]]s''' ('''HIDS'''). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as [[malware]]); and [[Anomaly-based intrusion detection system|anomaly-based detection]] (detecting deviations from a model of "good" traffic, which often relies on [[machine learning]]). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an '''intrusion prevention system'''.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Comparison with firewalls ==
Although they both relate to network security, an IDS differs from a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] in that a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. Firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system.  This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators.  A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system, and is another form of an [[application layer firewall]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

IDS can be classified by where detection takes place (network or [[Host (network)|host]]) and the detection method that is employed.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

=== Analyzed activity ===

====Network intrusion detection systems====
Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network. It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire [[Subnetwork|subnet]], and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behavior is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator. An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall. Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network. [[OPNET]] and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems. NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS.
When we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property, there are two types: on-line and off-line NIDS, often referred to as inline and tap mode, respectively. On-line NIDS deals with the network in real time. It analyses the [[Ethernet frame|Ethernet packets]] and applies some rules, to decide if it is an attack or not. Off-line NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not.

NIDS can also combined with other technologies to increase detection, and prediction, rates. [[Artificial neural network|Artificial Neural Network]] based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data, in a smart way, due to the self-organizing structure that allows INS IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Fabio|last2=Lombardi|first2=Mara|last3=Ramalingam|first3=Soodamani|date=2017|title=An integrated internet of everything — Genetic algorithms controller — Artificial neural networks framework for security/safety systems management and support|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167863|journal=2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1109/ccst.2017.8167863|isbn=9781538615850|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes; INN IDS help develop an early warning system, based on two layers. The first layer accepts single values, while the second layer takes the first's layers output as input; the cycle repeats and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen patterns in the network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vilela|first=Douglas W.

====Host intrusion detection systems====
{{Main article|Host-based intrusion detection system}}
Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected. It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot. If the critical system files were modified or deleted, an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate. An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines, which are not expected to change their configurations.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Intrusion detection systems can also be system-specific using custom tools and [[honeypot (computing)|honeypots]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

=== Detection method ===

====Signature-based====
Signature-based IDS refers to the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iup.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=81109 |website=www.iup.edu |format=[[Microsoft PowerPoint|PPT]] |author=Brandon Lokesak |date=December 4, 2008 |title=A Comparison Between Signature Based and Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology originates from [[anti-virus software]], which refers to these detected patterns as signatures. Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks, it is difficult to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}

In Signature-based IDS, the signatures are released by a vendor for its all products. On-time updation of the IDS with the signature is a key aspect

====Anomaly-based====
[[Anomaly-based intrusion detection system]]s were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks, in part due to the rapid development of malware. The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this model. Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it may suffer from [[false positives]]: previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious. Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the time-consuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs. Efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowayda|first=A.

New types of what could be called anomaly-based intrusion detection systems are being viewed by [[Gartner]] as User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3134524?ref=SiteSearch&amp;sthkw=avivah%20litan&amp;fnl=search&amp;srcId=1-3478922254|title=Gartner report: Market Guide for User and Entity Behavior Analytics|last=|first=|date=September 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an evolution of the [[user behavior analytics]] category) and network traffic analysis (NTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3367417?ref=SiteSearch&amp;sthkw=hype%20cycle%20for%20infrastructure&amp;fnl=search&amp;srcId=1-3478922254|title=Gartner: Hype Cycle for Infrastructure Protection, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, NTA deals with malicious insiders as well as targeted external attacks that have compromised a user machine or account.

== Intrusion prevention ==

Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts.  In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.&lt;ref name="nist80094"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-94/SP800-94.pdf |title=Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) |first1=Karen |last1=Scarfone |first2=Peter |last2=Mell |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |work=Computer Security Resource Center |issue=800–94 |accessdate=1 January 2010 |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack's content.&lt;ref name="nist80094" /&gt;

'''Intrusion prevention systems''' ('''IPS'''), also known as '''intrusion detection and prevention systems''' ('''IDPS'''), are [[network security]] appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it.{{r|GIDPS}}.

Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected.{{r|Newman2009|page1=273|WhitmanMattord2009|page2=289}} IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address.{{r|Boyles2010}} An IPS also can correct {{nobr|[[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC)}} errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted [[Transport layer|transport]] and [[network layer]] options.{{r|Newman2009|page1=278|TiptonKrause2007}}.

=== Classification ===
Intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types:{{r|GIDPS|Vacca2010}}

# '''Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS)''':  monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity.
# '''Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS)''': monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols.
# '''Network behavior analysis (NBA)''': examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain forms of malware and policy violations.
# '''Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS)''': an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host.

=== Detection methods ===
The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.{{r|WhitmanMattord2009|page1=301|KirdaJha2009}}

# '''Signature-based detection''': Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the Network and compares with pre-configured and pre-determined attack patterns known as signatures.
# '''Statistical anomaly-based detection''': An IDS which is anomaly-based will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline. The baseline will identify what is "normal" for that network – what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used. It may however, raise a False Positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Stateful protocol analysis detection''': This method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with "pre-determined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity".{{r|WhitmanMattord2009}}

== Limitations ==
* [[noise (signal processing)|Noise]] can severely limit an intrusion detection system's effectiveness.  Bad packets generated from  software bugs, corrupt [[DNS]] data, and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high false-alarm rate.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book

 |year = 2001
 |pages = 387–388
 |isbn = 978-0-471-38922-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the number of false-alarms. Number of real attacks is often so far below the number of false-alarms that the real attacks are often missed and ignored.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2017}}
* Many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated.  A constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats. Outdated signature databases can leave the IDS vulnerable to newer strategies.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;
* For signature-based IDS, there will be lag between a new threat discovery and its signature being applied to the IDS. During this lag time, the IDS will be unable to identify the threat.&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt;
* It cannot compensate for weak identification and [[authentication]] mechanisms or for weaknesses in [[network protocol]]s. When an attacker gains access due to weak authentication mechanisms then IDS cannot prevent the adversary from any malpractice.
* Encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices. Therefore, the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusions have occurred.
* Intrusion detection software provides information based on the [[network address]] that is associated with the IP packet that is sent into the network. This is beneficial if the network address contained in the IP packet is accurate. However, the address that is contained in the IP packet could be faked or scrambled.
* Due to the nature of NIDS systems, and the need for them to analyse protocols as they are captured, NIDS systems can be susceptible to the same protocol-based attacks to which network hosts may be vulnerable. Invalid data and [[TCP/IP stack]] attacks may cause an NIDS to crash.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/235/limitations-network-intrusion-detection/100739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evasion techniques ==
{{main article|Intrusion detection system evasion techniques}}
There are a number of techniques which attackers are using, the following are considered 'simple' measures which can be taken to evade IDS:
* Fragmentation: by sending fragmented packets, the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the  detection system's ability to detect the attack signature.
* Avoiding defaults: The TCP port utilised by a protocol does not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported. For example, an IDS may expect to detect a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] on port 12345. If an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port, the IDS may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan.
* Coordinated, low-bandwidth attacks: coordinating a scan among numerous attackers (or agents) and allocating different ports or hosts to different attackers makes it difficult for the IDS to correlate the captured packets and deduce that a network scan is in progress.
* Address [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]]/proxying: attackers can increase the difficulty of the Security Administrators ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy servers to bounce an attack. If the source is spoofed and bounced by a server, it makes it very difficult for IDS to detect the origin of the attack.
* Pattern change evasion: IDS generally rely on 'pattern matching' to detect an attack. By changing the data used in the attack slightly, it may be possible to evade detection. For example, an {{nobr|[[Internet Message Access Protocol]]}} (IMAP) server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow, and an IDS is able to detect the attack signature of 10 common attack tools. By modifying the payload sent by the tool, so that it does not resemble the data that the IDS expects, it may be possible to evade detection.

== Development ==
The earliest preliminary IDS concept was delineated in 1980 by James Anderson at the [[National Security Agency]] and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James P., "Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance," Washing, PA, James P. Anderson Co., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  User access logs, file access logs, and system event logs are examples of audit trails.

[[Fred Cohen]] noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case, and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David M. Chess |author2=Steve R. White |work=Proceedings of Virus Bulletin Conference |title=An Undetectable Computer Virus |date=2000 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorothy E. Denning]], assisted by [[Peter G. Neumann]], published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Dorothy E., "An Intrusion Detection Model," Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Her model used statistics for [[anomaly detection]], and resulted in an early IDS at [[SRI International]] named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations and could consider both user and network level data.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., "IDES:  An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders," Proceedings of the Symposium on Computer Security; Threats, and Countermeasures; Rome, Italy, November 22–23, 1990, pages 110–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  IDES had a dual approach with a rule-based [[Expert System]] to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems. The author of "IDES: An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders," Teresa F. Lunt, proposed adding an [[Artificial neural network]] as a third component.  She said all three components could then report to a resolver.  SRI followed IDES  in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., "Detecting Intruders in Computer Systems," 1993 Conference on Auditing and Computer Technology, SRI International&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Multics]] intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS), an expert system using P-BEST and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;Sebring, Michael M., and Whitehurst, R. Alan., "Expert Systems in Intrusion Detection:  A Case Study," The 11th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Haystack was also developed in that year using statistics to reduce audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Smaha, Stephen E., "Haystack:  An Intrusion Detection System," The Fourth Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference, Orlando, FL, December, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the [[National Security Agency]] started an IDS research transfer program under [[Rebecca Bace]]. Bace later published the seminal text on the subject, ''Intrusion Detection'', in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGraw|first1=Gary|title=Silver Bullet Talks with Becky Bace|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine|date=May 2007|volume=5|issue=3|pages=6–9|doi=10.1109/MSP.2007.70|url=https://www.cigital.com/silver-bullet-files/shows/silverbullet-012-bbace.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom &amp; Sense (W&amp;S) was a statistics-based anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccaro, H.S., and Liepins, G.E., "Detection of Anomalous Computer Session Activity," The 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  W&amp;S created rules based on statistical analysis, and then used those rules for anomaly detection.

In 1990, the Time-based Inductive Machine (TIM) did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in [[Common Lisp]] on a [[VAX]] 3500 computer.&lt;ref&gt;Teng, Henry S., Chen, Kaihu, and Lu, Stephen C-Y, "Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection Using Inductively Generated Sequential Patterns," 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Security Monitor (NSM) performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun-3/50 workstation.&lt;ref&gt;Heberlein, L. Todd, Dias, Gihan V., Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Wood, Jeff, and Wolber, David, "A Network Security Monitor," 1990 Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, Oakland, CA, pages 296–304&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Security Officer's Assistant (ISOA) was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics, a profile checker, and an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Winkeler, J.R., "A UNIX Prototype for Intrusion and Anomaly Detection in Secure Networks," The Thirteenth National Computer Security Conference, Washington, DC., pages 115–124, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  ComputerWatch at [[AT&amp;T Bell Labs]] used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detection.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Cheri, and Ramstedt, Paul, "The ComputerWatch Data Reduction Tool," Proceedings of the 13th National Computer Security Conference, Washington, D.C., 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1991, researchers at the [[University of California, Davis]] created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS), which was also an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Snapp, Steven R, Brentano, James, Dias, Gihan V., Goan, Terrance L., Heberlein, L. Todd, Ho, Che-Lin, Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Smaha, Stephen E., Grance, Tim, Teal, Daniel M. and Mansur, Doug, "DIDS (Distributed Intrusion Detection System) -- Motivation, Architecture, and An Early Prototype," The 14th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1991, pages 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter (NADIR), also in 1991, was a prototype IDS developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Integrated Computing Network (ICN), and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kathleen, DuBois, David H., and Stallings, Cathy A., "A Phased Approach to Network Intrusion Detection," 14th National Computing Security Conference, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  NADIR used a statistics-based anomaly detector and an expert system.

The [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] announced [[Bro (software)|Bro]] in 1998, which used its own rule language for packet analysis from [[libpcap]] data.&lt;ref&gt;Paxson, Vern, "Bro:  A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time," Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Security Symposium, San Antonio, TX, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Network Flight Recorder (NFR) in 1999 also used libpcap.&lt;ref&gt;Amoroso, Edward, "Intrusion Detection:  An Introduction to Internet Surveillance, Correlation, Trace Back, Traps, and Response," Intrusion.Net Books, Sparta, New Jersey, 1999, {{ISBN|0-9666700-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APE was developed as a packet sniffer, also using libpcap, in November, 1998, and was renamed [[Snort (software)|Snort]] one month later. Snort has since become the world's largest used IDS/IPS system with over 300,000 active users.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, Toby (Ed.), Alder, Raven, Carter, Dr. Everett F. (Skip), Jr., Esler, Joel., Foster, James C., Jonkman Marty, Raffael, and Poor, Mike, "Snort IDS and IPS Toolkit," Syngress, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59749-099-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can monitor both local systems, and remote capture points using the [[TZSP]] protocol.

The Audit Data Analysis and Mining (ADAM) IDS in 2001 used [[tcpdump]] to build profiles of rules for classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara, Daniel, Couto, Julia, Jajodia, Sushil, Popyack, Leonard, and Wu, Ningning, "ADAM:  Detecting Intrusions by Data Mining," Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Information Assurance and Security, West Point, NY, June 5–6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Yongguang Zhang]] and Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Intrusion Detection Techniques for Mobile Wireless Networks, ACM WINET 2003 &lt;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~wenke/papers/winet03.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Viegas and his colleagues &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Viegas|first=E.|last2=Santin|first2=A. O.|last3=Fran?a|first3=A.|last4=Jasinski|first4=R.|last5=Pedroni|first5=V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">The '''Iraq leak''' (also '''Iraq-gate''', or the '''[[Iraq]] scandal''') is a series of events that began on 6 March 2003 from a statement given by [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]], leader of the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], in a televised election debate prior to the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|2003 parliamentary election]]. Jäätteenmäki accused [[Paavo Lipponen]], the then [[Prime Minister of Finland]], of attaching Finland to [[George W. Bush]]'s '[[coalition of the willing]]' that was in preparation for the [[2003 war in Iraq]].{{ref|hs}} Lipponen had visited [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on 9 December 2002.

According to Jäätteenmäki, Finland had taken part in a meeting where 'those countries that had promised cooperation and aid' had been invited. It was later discovered that Jäätteenmäki had acquired the information from secret foreign ministry documents, which she had received from [[Martti Manninen]], an advisor to the [[President of Finland]] and a member of Jäätteenmäki's party.

Prime Minister Lipponen's actions were suggested to be influenced by the fact that Finland was about to sell [[AMOS]] mortars to the U.S. military as part of its [[Land Warrior]] program.

The [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] member of parliament [[Jaakko Laakso]], together with other representatives, had posted a public question on Lipponen's statements in Washington already on 19 December 2002.{{ref|laakso}} There was no public inquiry on the matter, even though the documents cast doubt on the legality of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] deals during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 war in Afghanistan]]. The [[Green League|Green]] member [[Ulla Anttila]] and others questioned an authorisation to export arms that was granted to [[Patria (company)|Patria]]-[[Land Systems Hägglunds|Hägglunds]] shortly before the war started.{{ref|anttila}}

The Centre Party won the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary election]] and became the largest party in the [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]]. Jäätteenmäki was [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki's Cabinet|appointed]] Prime Minister of Finland by President [[Tarja Halonen]] on 17 April 2003.{{ref|cabinet}} However, the lack of confidence in Jäätteenmäki caused by her use of secret documents in the campaign and her flat-out denial before the Parliament of having solicited them, despite incriminating evidence, forced her to resign as Prime Minister on 24 June. Jäätteenmäki claimed to have received the documents unexpectedly and without solicitation, which Manninen denied. A new cabinet was formed by [[Matti Vanhanen]], who also became the leader of the Centre Party.{{ref|vanhanen}} Manninen was also sacked from his job as advisor to the president.

On 19 December 2003, criminal charges were pressed against Martti Manninen for leaking secret documents and against Anneli Jäätteenmäki for incitement and aid to the same. Manninen was found guilty, and had to pay 80 [[day fine]]s, but Jäätteenmäki was not found guilty, as she did not specifically request the documents.

[[David Schlaefer]], spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, denied in 2003 after Jäätteenmäki's resignation that there was ever any understanding on cooperation or assistance between Finland and the U.S. during Lipponen's meetings in Washington, stating at a conference at University of Helsinki that "it is simply not true, it did not happen." 

== Catchphrases originated from the scandal ==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
A number of comments made by Prime Minister Jäätteenmäki during the unfolding of her part of the scandal remain as popular phrases in Finland. Among the most memorable are:
* "I have two ears and I have heard all kinds of things." Jäätteenmäki's explanation for how she got hold of the secret information. Now used in the shortened form "I have two ears."
* "I try to speak as truthfully as I can." Jäätteenmäki to reporters at Helsinki airport in early June 2003. Became a popular example of "politician's ethics".
* "I hadn't asked for them and they came to me as a surprise." Jäätteenmäki defending herself before Parliament on the charges that she had asked for the secret documents from Manninen or somebody else. This is often alluded to with ''pyytämättä ja yllätyksenä'', "unrequested and as a surprise".

The '''Jewish National Council''' ('''JNC''') ({{lang-he|ועד לאומי}}, ''Va'ad Le'umi''), also known as the '''Jewish People's Council''' was the main national executive institution of the Jewish community ([[Yishuv]]) within [[Mandatory Palestine]].

==History==
The JNC was established in 1920, the same year as the [[Histadrut]] and the [[Haganah]] were founded, in order to conduct Jewish communal affairs. Its first chairman was [[Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Jewish communal affairs were generally conducted through a hierarchy of representative organizations, including the JNC. Another of these organizations was the National Assembly, which had three hundred members. These three hundred delegates selected from among themselves the members of the National Council, which was also known as the Va'ad Leumi.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L., and Martin P. Bunton. A History of the Modern Middle East. Boulder: Westview, 2013. 232. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the JNC also participated in meetings of the Zionist General Council. The organization represented almost all major Jewish factions, however a few smaller groups at first objected to the creation of centralized leadership. Notably, [[Agudat Israel]] joined only in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} It was announce only in 1946 that the Sephardic Jews and the Zionist Revisionists, would stop refusing to participate in the JNC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1946/04/22/archive/arab-mayor-of-hebron-submits-petition-to-transjordan-ruler-asking-anschluss JTA.org. Arab Mayor of Hebron Submits Petition to Transjordan Ruler Asking “anschluss” April 22, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=February 2017}}

===Role in the establishment of Israel===
The Political Department of the JNC was responsible for relations with the Arabs, ties with the [[Jewish Agency]] and negotiations with the British government. As the yishuv grew, the JNC adopted more functions, such as education, health care and welfare services, internal defense and security matters, and organized recruitment to the British forces during [[World War II]]. In the 1940s, departments for physical training, culture and press and information were added. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The report of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] issued in 1946, stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Jews have developed, under the aegis of the Jewish Agency and the JNC, a strong and tightly-woven community. There thus exists a virtual Jewish nonterritorial State with its own executive and legislative organs..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/angloamerican.htm The report of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry] Ch. VIII. The State Within the State.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the [[Israel|State of Israel]] was established in 1948, this departmental structure served as a basis for the government ministries. On March 2, 1948, the New Jewish Council: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;" begins work on organization of Jewish provisional government"  &lt;ref name="Palestine Israel US State Department Records"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/37211825/Palestine-Israel-US-State-Department-Records | title=Palestine Israel US State Department Records | publisher=University Publications of America | year=1987 | accessdate=October 25, 2011 | author=Nanette Dobrosky | pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 14, 1948, (the expiration day of the British Mandate), its members gathered at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] and ratified the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|proclamation declaring the establishment of the State of Israel]]. The members of the JNC formed the [[Provisional government of Israel|provisional government]] of the nascent State of Israel.

[[John Edwards]] is a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[North Carolina]] and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] vice-presidential and presidential candidate who, in August 2008, admitted to having had an extramarital affair. The affair was initially reported in late-2007 by ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' (a U.S. [[supermarket tabloid]] newspaper), but was given little attention outside the tabloid press and political [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where's HuffPo on Edwards?|url=http://media.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTkxNDRmN2NjMmVmODM4YmFkOWNmZGZkZThlNzdjNjk=|work=NRO Weekend|publisher=National Review Online |accessdate=December 15, 2012|author=Greg Pollowitz|date=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Edwards' Chutzpah Plus--Obama, from Cling to Ping!|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2189635/#mrsechutzpah|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group, a Division of the Washington Post Company |accessdate=December 15, 2012|author=Mickey Kaus|date=28 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sometimes, There's News in the Gutter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/opinion/10pubed.html|accessdate=December 15, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 August 2008|author=Clark Hoyt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enquirer'' cited claims from an anonymous source that Edwards had engaged in an affair with [[Rielle Hunter]], a [[filmmaker]] hired to work for his presidential campaign, and that Hunter had a child from the relationship. [[ABC News]] reported that [[Andrew Young (political operative)|Andrew Young]], a member of Edwards' campaign team, stated that Edwards asked him to "Get a doctor to fake the DNA results ... and to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/john-edwards-admits-fathered-child-affair/story?id=9620812 |title=John Edwards Admits He Fathered Rielle Hunter's Child During Affair |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations were initially published in late-2007 and were denied by both Edwards and Hunter. Young claimed paternity of Hunter's daughter, although no father is listed on the child's birth certificate, and Young has subsequently denied it.

In July 2008, several U.S. [[mainstream media]] news outlets cited the allegations in relation to Edwards' future political career, as well as in relation to his chances of being selected as a [[running mate]] in [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential bid]]. Then, on August 7, 2008, Edwards admitted to ABC News correspondent, [[Bob Woodruff]], that he did have an extended affair with Hunter, but denied that he was the father of Hunter's baby girl.&lt;ref name=ABC8Aug&gt;{{cite news |first1=Rhonda |last1=Schwarz |author2=Woodruff, Brian |title=Edwards Admits Sexual Affair; Lied as Presidential Candidate |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5441195&amp;page=1 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=August 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter's sister claimed that Edwards was the father and publicly asked Edwards to take a paternity test to determine whether the child was his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Rhonda |last1=Schwartz |authorlink= |author2=Brian Ross |title=Mistress' Family Challenges Edwards to Take DNA Test |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5546813&amp;page=1 |work=ABC News |date=August 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2010, Edwards issued a statement admitting that he was the father of Hunter's child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/34963767/ns/today-today_people/ |title=Edwards admits fathering child with mistress |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the admission from Edwards that he fathered a child with Hunter, Edwards' wife, [[Elizabeth Edwards]], announced a separation from her husband, with an intention to file for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Edwards and wife separate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/27/us-usa-politics-edwards-idUSTRE60Q65P20100127 |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |newspaper=Reuters|date=27 January 2010|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elizabeth Edwards tells her sister: 'I've had it.' |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/01/elizabeth-edwards-tells-her-sister-ive-had-it-/1#.UMx2xnNes-s |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |newspaper=USA Today|date=27 January 2010|author=Ann Oldenburg|agency=USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Co. Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 2010, the existence of an explicit sex tape, featuring Edwards and Hunter, was publicly reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/John_Edwards_Scandal/john-edwards-made-sex-tape-abortion-plea-aide/story?id=9680626 |title=John Edwards Made Sex Tape, Abortion Plea, Aide Says |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Edwards first admitted to the affair, he stated that Elizabeth was in remission from [[breast cancer]]. However, it became clear that the affair was still ongoing, even after he and his wife made a joint announcement that her cancer had returned and was found to be incurable. Elizabeth Edwards died on December 7, 2010.

==Rielle Hunter and the Edwards campaign==

In December 2006, ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that Hunter had been hired by the Edwards campaign to produce a series of [[webisode]]s that portrayed behind-the-scenes life on the campaign trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = John Edwards Webisode 1: Plane Truths | medium = internet video | publisher = Webcastr.com | year = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/edwards-webisode-1-plane-truths.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080808022222/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/edwards-webisode-1-plane-truths.html | archivedate = August 8, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = John Edwards Webisode 2: The Golden Rule | medium = internet video | publisher = Webcastr.com | year = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/john-edwards-missing-webisode-2.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080914072859/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/john-edwards-missing-webisode-2.html | archivedate = September 14, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = John Edwards Webisode 3: Plight of Uganda | medium = internet video | publisher = Webcastr.com | year = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/missing-edwards-webisode-3-plight-of-uganda.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080809135138/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/missing-edwards-webisode-3-plight-of-uganda.html | archivedate = August 9, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = John Edwards Webisode 4: Plugs | medium = internet video | publisher = Webcastr.com | year = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/missing-edwards-webisode-4-plugs.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080809135143/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/politics/missing-edwards-webisode-4-plugs.html | archivedate = August 9, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the idea of creating the series to Edwards when she met him at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] in [[New York City|New York]], where the politician was attending a business meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Darman |title=Politics 2008: John Edwards, Untucked |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/44245 |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=December 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign paid Hunter's production company, Midline Groove, over [[United States dollar|USD]]$100,000 for the short documentaries&lt;ref name=WCNC1Aug&gt;{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Watson |title=No father on alleged love child's birth certificate |url=http://www.wcnc.com/news/topstories/stories/wcnc-073108-krg-birthcertificate.1f42367b.html |publisher=[[WCNC-TV]] |date=August 1, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; that were uploaded to [[YouTube]] upon completion.

The first apparent mention, in print form, of a possible Edwards/Hunter affair, appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'' on August 27, 2007. The page-six feature published a [[blind gossip]] item&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Just Asking|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/08272007/gossip/pagesix/just_asking.htm |work=[[New York Post]] |date=August 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that asked: "Which political candidate enjoys visiting New York because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown? The poll tells her he'll marry her when his current wife is out of the picture." The mention in the ''Post'' started a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] and [[blogosphere]] investigation that eventually led to accusations against Hunter and Edwards.&lt;ref name=NY11Oct/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Cockburn |authorlink=Alexander Cockburn |title=The Edwards scandal in full |url=http://eurekareporter.com/article/080808-the-edwards-scandal-in-full |work=The Eureka Reporter |date=August 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811011746/http://eurekareporter.com/article/080808-the-edwards-scandal-in-full |archivedate=August 11, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Sam Stein, a political reporter for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', reported that the Hunter web documentaries had been removed from the internet and were no longer accessible. Representatives from the Edwards campaign stated that the material could not be used due to [[campaign finance]] law.&lt;ref name=HuffPo26Sep&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Stein |title=Edwards Mystery: Innocuous Videos Suddenly Shrouded In Secrecy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/26/edwards-mystery-innocuou_n_66070.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=York/&gt; Several days later, ''The Huffington Post'' reported that the videos had been reposted to YouTube by an anonymous user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mystery Edwards Videos Reappear On Web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/30/mystery-edwards-videos-re_n_66484.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 30, 2007 |first=Nico |last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial ''National Enquirer'' allegations==
On October 10, 2007, the ''[[The National Enquirer|Enquirer]]'' published an article claiming that Edwards had engaged in an extramarital [[affair]] with an unnamed female campaign worker. On the same day, Stein published another article in ''The Huffington Post'' that contained additional details about Hunter, including Hunter's name and the web videos that she had produced.&lt;ref name=HuffPo10Oct&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Stein |title=Scrubbed: Edwards Filmmaker's Deleted Website Raises Questions |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/10/scrubbed-edwards-filmmak_n_67868.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, October 11, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine published a piece linking Hunter to the ''Enquirer'' allegations.&lt;ref name=NY11Oct&gt;{{cite news |title=John Edwards's Docudrama: The Anatomy of Innuendo |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2007/10/john_edwards_docudrama_the_ana.html |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Edwards and Hunter denied the relationship claims. Edwards said the ''Enquirer'' story was "made up", further stating, "I've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years," referring to his wife [[Elizabeth Edwards|Elizabeth]], "and as anybody who's been around us knows, she's an extraordinary human being, warm, loving, beautiful, sexy and as good a person as I have ever known.

The ''Enquirer'' published a follow-up story that included a photograph of a visibly [[pregnant]] Hunter on December 19, 2007. The ''Enquirer'' alleged that, according to its anonymous source, Hunter was claiming that Edwards was the father of her child. The article also claimed that Hunter had relocated to a [[gated community]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], near Andrew Young, a former official with the Edwards campaign, who had claimed paternity of Hunter's child. As with Hunter's initial denial of the affair, Young's paternity claim had been issued to Armstrong and published on MyDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mydd.com/story/2007/12/19/153027/87 |title=Is this really happening? |author=[[Jerome Armstrong|Armstrong, Jerome]] |date=December 19, 2007 |work=[[MyDD]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Zvb84CP3?url=http://www.mydd.com/story/2007/12/19/153027/87 |archivedate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National Enquirer Enters The 2008 Presidential Race With Edwards Love-Child Story |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/12/19/national-enquirerem_n_77603.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=December 19, 2007 |first=Danny |last=Shea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS News]] journalist, [[Bob Schieffer]], asked about the allegations on ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'', stating, "I believe that's a story that we will be avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely nothing to it ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child.

Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a "wait-and-see" attitude, pending the results of the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa caucuses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Mickey |last1=Kaus |title=Undernews Underanalysis |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/kausfiles/2007/12/hillary_stunsfour_theories.html#undernewsanalysis|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hotel encounter with reporters==
[[Image:BeverlyHilton01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly]] [[Hilton Hotel]], where Edwards encountered the [[The National Enquirer|''Enquirer'']] reporters]]
According to Perel, the ''Enquirer'' had received information stating that Edwards would be visiting Hunter and her child at the [[The Beverly Hilton|Beverly Hilton Hotel]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], on the evening of July 21, 2008, and the paper dispatched several reporters to the hotel. The team of ''Enquirer'' reporters encountered Edwards on the hotel premises sometime after 2 a.m. on the morning of July 22. According to Perel, Edwards, who was not a registered guest of the hotel, retreated from the reporters to a [[washroom]], where he remained until being escorted from the premises by hotel security. The encounter between Edwards and the ''Enquirer'' reporters was later confirmed by a hotel guard interviewed by [[Fox News]]. Edwards' spokespeople did not respond to Fox's request for comment on the incident.&lt;ref name=Fox25Jul&gt;{{cite news |title=Guard Confirms Late-Night Hotel Encounter Between Ex-Sen. John Edwards, Tabloid Reporters |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,391426,00.html |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In articles published immediately after the hotel encounter, the ''Enquirer'' claimed to be in possession of evidence showing that Edwards had visited Hunter and her child in the Hilton for several hours, including a videotape of Hunter entering the room, where she allegedly met Edwards, and one of Edwards leaving the same room. However, the paper declined a request from Fox News to release photos or videotape of the incident.&lt;ref name=Fox25Jul/&gt; In an interview with ''[[Radar (magazine)|Radar]]'', Perel said that the ''Enquirer'' would release the photos when "the time is right."&lt;ref name=Radar29Jul&gt;{{cite news |first=Neel |last=Shah |title=Where Are the John Edwards Photos? |url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/07/where-are-the-john-edwards-photos.php |work=[[Radar (magazine)|Radar]] |date=July 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enquirer'' later stated that it had filed a "criminal complaint" against the hotel's security over its conduct during the encounter, but the [[Beverly Hills Police Department]] said that there was no criminal complaint and that only an "incident report" was under investigation.&lt;ref name=Fox25Jul/&gt;

When Edwards was questioned at a [[New Orleans]] event on July 23, 2008, he stated, "I have no idea what you're asking about. I've responded, consistently, to these tabloid allegations by saying I don't respond to these lies and you know that ... and I stand by that."&lt;ref name=Fox25Jul/&gt; On the same day, Hunter appeared on the television program, ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'', describing the ''Enquirer'' story as "completely unfounded and ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Edwards' Alleged Mistress Speaks! |url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2008/07/john_edwards_alleged_mistress.php |publisher=''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'' |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2008, the ''Enquirer'' published a blurry photo that allegedly portrayed Edwards holding Hunter's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Annette|last=Witheridge|title=John Edwards love child rumours threaten the Barack Obama presidential campaign |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1042662/John-Edwards-love-child-rumours-threaten-Barack-Obama-presidential-campaign.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=August 7, 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==

===Coverage of the allegations===
Aside from the Fox News story on July 25, mainstream news sources did not immediately report the story.

Lots of juicy details—enough so Edwards may feel he has to address the issue, especially if it's not true and there's an innocent explanation. Or not.

On July 25, in response to a question as to whether ''The Washington Post'' was investigating the claims, political reporter, Jonathan Weisman, stated, "Yes, and to be quite honest, we're waiting to see the pictures the ''Enquirer'' says it will publish this weekend. That said, Edwards is no longer an elected official and is not running for any office now.

It was sent to the ''Times''' in-house bloggers, and, referring to the Edwards allegations, stated, "I am asking you all not to blog about this topic until further notified." Kaus portrayed the email as a "[[gag order|gag]]" order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mickey |last=Kaus |authorlink=Mickey Kaus |title=LAT Gags Blogs |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2195914/#latedict |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online interview, Pierce defended the e-mail, stating that it was the result of a decision by senior editors at the ''Times'' to allow time for the newspaper's Metro Desk to investigate the allegations.

Several pundits stated that Edwards was "fair game" for reporting on the allegations because he had been recently identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Thomas |title=Edwards, Nunn on Obama's Veep List |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1816620,00.html |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a potential candidate for vice president or [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] for Obama,&lt;ref name=Shafer23Jul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sklar30Jul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams4Aug/&gt; and that Edwards himself had made his marital fidelity an issue in his campaign.&lt;ref name=Sklar30Jul/&gt;

Blogosphere claims of a media "blackout" extended to the online reference site, [[Wikipedia]], and its [[John Edwards|biographical article]] on Edwards.

On July 31, 2008, a late-night talk program played part of a [[David Letterman]] "Top 10" list that alluded to the charges. On the same night, ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' played a clip of a [[Jay Leno]] monologue from the [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|''Tonight Show'']] that mentioned it.

===Edwards admits the affair===
On August 8, 2008, in a statement that coincided with the Opening Ceremonies of the [[2008 Olympic Games]],&lt;ref name="cnn 11.11.2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/11/john.edwards/?iref=mpstoryview| title=Can John Edwards make a comeback? | publisher=CNN | date=November 11, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards admitted to the affair but denied he was the father of the child, expressing his willingness to take a paternity test.&lt;ref name=ABC8Aug/&gt;&lt;ref name=Statement8Aug&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/08/edwards.statement/index.html| title=John Edwards' statement of August 8, 2008 | publisher=CNN | date=August 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His statement included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2006, I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough ...&lt;ref name=Statement8Aug/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the same day, Elizabeth Edwards released a statement that first appeared on the liberal blog, ''[[The Daily Kos]]''. The statement said that, in 2006, "John had made a terrible mistake," though she went on to praise her husband for "courage in the face of shame." She also said that she hoped people would watch the interview that aired later that night on the ABC News late-night program, ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', in which her husband admitted the affair to Woodruff. She did, in her statement, criticize the claims that her husband fathered a child as an "absurd lie in a tabloid publication." Elizabeth Edwards' seemingly willing participation in the efforts to cover up the affair have also been called into question. "I think she's complicit," said Brad Crone, a Raleigh-based Democratic consultant. "Obviously, she knew. While she's the victim, she clearly didn't stand in the way of the cover-up."&lt;ref name="cnn20080826"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wife blasted for keeping Edwards affair secret |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/08/26/elizabeth.edwards.ap/index.html |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2008 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828205932/http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/08/26/elizabeth.edwards.ap/index.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2008, a friend of Hunter's, Pigeon O'Brien, informed [[CBS]] News that Edwards had lied about the timeline of the affair. She claimed the affair began in February 2006, six months earlier than the time Edwards had hired Hunter to start working on his political action committee and when he had claimed that the affair had begun. O'Brien also stated that the affair was not a brief liaison, but a mutual, committed relationship based on love; or so Edwards had led Hunter to believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Edwards Account Challenged | medium = internet video | publisher = CBS News | year = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/Edwards-Account-Challanged-Webcastr.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080815013744/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/Edwards-Account-Challanged-Webcastr.html | archivedate = August 15, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, participated in an interview with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, in the days after the story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Edwards' Ex-Mistress' Sister Pans Both: Says Her Family Is "Very Upset," And She Feels Most For Edwards' Cancer-Stricken Wife | medium = internet video | publisher = CBS News |year=2008 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/13/earlyshow/main4347468.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that same day, an article from [[CBS News]] was published saying, "CBS News legal analyst, [[Mickey Sherman]], told ''Early Show'' co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for. "If you raise money to run for (office)", Sherman explained, "and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate, and you give it to a girlfriend of a God-knows-what ... that's a crime.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: $$ Still Flows To Edwards' Ex|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/13/earlyshow/main4347059.shtml|accessdate=December 15, 2012 |newspaper=CBS News|date=11 February 2009|author=CBSNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' also reported on that same day that, when questioned about the affair by reporters, Mimi Hockman, Hunter's partner in the Midline Groove video production company, "said the contract they signed with John Edwards had a 'hefty' confidentiality clause that bars her from talking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=John Edwards is the daddy, Rielle Hunter pal sez |author=Celeste Katz, Soo Youn and Helen Kennedy | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/08/12/2008-08-12_john_edwards_is_the_daddy_rielle_hunter_.html | work=New York daily News | date=August 13, 2008 | accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days earlier, on August 11, 2008, Hockman had been questioned by reporters from the ''[[Star-Ledger]]'' at her home.

On August 18, 2008, [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]], news media columnist for ''The New York Times'', wrote that while the ''Enquirer'' can be inaccurate, its revelations about the Edwards affair were a service to the public:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are some stories, especially ones that occur in the bedroom, where mainstream media outlets sometimes can't venture—or at least they can't find it in themselves to lead the charge. But it would be hard to argue that the body politic is not enriched by the recent revelations that Mr. Edwards is not who we thought he was, even balanced against the many stories the Enquirer gets wrong." (Even in his confession, Mr. Edwards wrinkled his nose and suggested that the allegations had originated with "supermarket tabloids", as if the method of conveyance absolved him of the deeds described.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/business/media/18carr.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=business&amp;pagewanted=print |title=The Enquirer: Even Scandal Can Be News |author=Carr, David |publisher=[[The New York Times]]; The Media Equation" column, Business section |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Birth certificate==
On August 1, 2008, the ''Enquirer'' published an article naming Hunter's child and mainstream news organizations subsequently obtained a copy of the birth certificate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/content/media/2008/7/31/birth%20certificate.pdf |title=Birth Certificate, Frances Quinn Hunter |author=[[California|State of California]] |date=March 4, 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052648/http://www.newsobserver.com/content/media/2008/7/31/birth%20certificate.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; confirming that a girl had been born at [[Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital]] on February 27, 2008. The birth certificate listed the mother's name as "Rielle Jaya James Druck," while the child was given the surname "Hunter"; no father's name was listed. Media reports linked the Druck and Hunter surnames on the birth certificate to conclude that the mother was Rielle Hunter; the reports also noted that the child was born approximately two months after Young's claimed paternity had been announced by Hunter and Young.&lt;ref name=WCNC1Aug/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charlotte Paper Obtains Birth Certificate for Alleged Edwards 'Love Child' |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003834282 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |date=July 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809050538/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003834282 |archivedate=August 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mainstream Media Reports On Edwards Sex Scandal |url=http://www.raleigh3.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=1078&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=2724&amp;hn=raleigh3&amp;he=.com |work=The Raleigh Telegram |date=August 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917182837/http://www.raleigh3.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=1078&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=2724&amp;hn=raleigh3&amp;he=.com |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned about the omission of the father's name from the birth certificate, Hunter's attorney stated, "A lot of women do that", and that the issue was "a personal matter" between Hunter and Young, before declining to comment further.&lt;ref name=Zagaroli31Jul&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Zagaroli |title=Birth certificate of child linked to Edwards lists no father |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/46066.html |publisher=[[McClatchy News Service]] |date=July 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806082234/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/46066.html |archivedate=August 6, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Lisa |last1=Zagaroli |author2=Perez, Lorenzo |title=Birth record for child lists no father |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1160737.html |work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] |publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]] |date=July 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806031157/http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1160737.html |archivedate=August 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-July and early-August 2008, news outlets reported that Edwards was avoiding further questions from reporters about the ''Enquirer'' claims.&lt;ref name=WCNC1Aug/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Zagaroli |title=Why isn't John Edwards answering reporters' questions? |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/46030.html |publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]] |date=July 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806101748/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/46030.html |archivedate=August 6, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WCNC-TV]], a North Carolina television station, reported that Edwards' political career was "effectively frozen", pending resolution of the allegations.&lt;ref name=WCNC1Aug/&gt;

==Payments to Hunter and Young==
In August 2008, [[Fred Baron (lawyer)|Fred Baron]], Edwards' [[campaign finance]] chairman, told [[NBC News]] that he had been providing financial assistance to both Hunter and Young without Edwards' knowledge; he further stated that no campaign funds had been used.&lt;ref name=NBCBaron&gt;{{cite news |first1=Chuck |last1=Todd |author2=Popkin, Jim |title=Edwards Finance Chair Denies Hush Money |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/08/08/1257224.aspx |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Young had also successfully solicited funds from [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]], also known as "Bunny" Mellon, a 99-year-old heiress to the Mellon fortune.&lt;ref name=nyt09/&gt; Baron passed away two months later.

==Reactions==
In August 2008, senior figures in the Democratic Party warned that Edwards' failure to respond to the allegations could affect his role at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|2008 Democratic convention]]. According to [[Donald Fowler|Don Fowler]], former [[Democratic National Committee]] chair, "If there is not an explanation that's satisfactory, acceptable and meets high moral standards, the answer is 'no,' [Edwards] would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention." Gary Pearce, who ran Edwards' 1998 Senate race, said, "It's a very damaging thing. ... If it's not true, [Edwards] has got to stand up and say, 'This is not true. That is not my child and I'm going to take legal action against the people who are spreading these lies.' It's not enough to say, 'That's tabloid trash.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="McClatchy20080806"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Johnson |title=Tabloid's claims threaten Edwards' role at party's convention |publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/104/story/46637.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810024221/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/104/story/46637.html |archivedate=August 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards' admission that he engaged in an affair came less than a day after these warnings were published.

Former congressman, [[David Bonior]], Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign manager, stated: "Thousands of friends of the senator and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him, and he's let them down. They've been betrayed by his action." When asked about Edwards' future in public service, Bonior further stated, "You can't lie in politics and expect to have people's confidence."&lt;ref name=AP8Aug&gt;{{cite news |last=Yost|first=Pete|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-08-08-96541326_x.htm| title=Edwards admits he had affair after heated denials| agency=Associated Press | date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=January 27, 2010| work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged campaign staffers "doomsday" plan==
In May 2009, ABC News political correspondent, [[George Stephanopoulos]], reported that campaign staff members became cognizant of the affair in early-2008. Staff members said that if it appeared Edwards was on his way to winning the Democratic Party nomination, they intended to sabotage it for the benefit of the party.&lt;ref name="ABCDoomsday"&gt;{{cite news |title=Edwards Staff had Affair 'Doomsday' strategy |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/05/edwards-staff-h.html |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date= May 10, 2009| author=[[George Stephanopoulos|Stephanopoulos, George]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards' senior adviser, [[Joe Trippi]], said this report was "complete bullshit". He added, "No one that I know had such a plan. I wasn't involved in a plan like that, it didn't exist, it's a fantasy."&lt;ref name="CNNdoomsday"&gt;{{cite news |title=Trippi refutes claim Edwards staffers knew of affair |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/11/trippi-refutes-claim-edwards-staffers-knew-of-affair/ |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=May 11, 2009| author=Mooney, Alexander|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2006, several staffers—including Josh Brumberger, Kim Rubey, and David Ginsberg—had strong suspicions about the affair and left the campaign over concerns about Hunter. Rubey and Ginsberg later discussed their obligation to the party to come forward with what they knew, after finding Young's paternity claim unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saint Elizabeth and the Ego Monster |url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/63045/index4.html |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |newspaper=New York |date=18 January 2010 |author=John Heilemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
A federal [[Grand jury#United States|grand jury]] investigated whether any of Edwards' campaign funds were misspent on covering up the affair and, on August 6, 2009, Hunter testified before a federal grand jury in Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;ref name=nyt09&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/us/politics/20edwards.html?_r=3&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|title=For Edwards, Drama Builds Toward a Denouement|first=Neil|last=Lewis|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2010, John Edwards admitted that he was, indeed, Quinn's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Lisa Myers and Michael Austin | title=Edwards admits fathering child with mistress | url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/34963767/ns/today-today_people/ | work=NBC News | date=January 21, 2010 | accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late January 2010, John and Elizabeth separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/27/johnelizabeth-edwards-spl_n_438853.html|title=John-Elizabeth Edwards SPLIT: Legally Separated|date=January 27, 2010 | work=Huffington Post|first=Lila|last=Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, ''The National Enquirer'' reported that Edwards had proposed to Hunter, but that report was categorically denied by an Edwards spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/10/john-edwards-proposes-ask_n_457045.html|title=Rielle Hunter To Marry Him, National Enquirer Reports|date=February 10, 2010 | work=Huffington Post|first=Lila|last=Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Young had previously stated he was the father, he recanted in a book proposal.&lt;ref name=nyt09/&gt; In a pre-release copy of Young's book, obtained by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Young revealed that after Edwards and Hunter returned from a trip to [[Uganda]] in 2006, Elizabeth answered Edward's mobile to hear Hunter "launch into a romantic monologue." Edwards confessed to having had a one-night stand but did not say with whom. He returned the call in front of his wife to end the affair, but later called Hunter back to say he did not mean it. Young also revealed that Edwards had confided in him about wanting to leave "crazy Elizabeth", but could not, as she engaged with American voters better than he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='It's an extraordinarily sad moment': John Edwards tells of pain over separation from terminally ill wife after his affair|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1246691/John-Edwards-splits-wife-Elizabeth-just-days-admitting-fathered-love-child.html|accessdate=December 15, 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=29 January 2010|author=Mail Foreign Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rielle Hunter also released a book about the relationship and announced her breakup with Edwards on the day of the book's release in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/356563/20120626/rielle-hunter-john-edwards-book-breakup.htm |title=Rielle Hunter, John Edwards Breakup Announced Same Day As Book Release |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2016, Hunter spoke on ''[[Steve Harvey (TV series)|Steve Harvey]]'' in her first televised interview in almost five years, Hunter, 51, said that the couple were actually still together up until February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3438212/I-ve-forgiven-Rielle-Hunter-says-finally-disgraced-presidential-hopeful-John-Edwards-reveals-great-dad-did-not-mean-hurt-terminally-ill-wife.html#ixzz40W5X7DK1 |title='I've forgiven myself': Rielle Hunter says she broke up with the disgraced John Edwards only last year and still 'loves him' - but regrets hurting his terminally ill wife |publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal proceedings===
On June 3, 2011, Edwards was indicted by a North Carolina grand jury on six felony charges. Edwards faced a maximum sentence of thirty years in prison and a [[United States dollar|$]]1.5 million fine, or a USD250,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment per charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43260386/ns/politics-more_politics/?GT1=43001| title = Edwards arrives in NC court to face felony charges | date = June 3, 2011 | accessdate=June 3, 2011 | agency = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment came after the failure of intensive negotiations for a plea bargain agreement. The agreement would have meant that Edwards would have been required to plead guilty to three misdemeanor [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance law]] violations, in addition to a six-month prison sentence, but would have allowed Edwards to keep his law license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prison sentence doomed Edwards plea deal|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/06/05/1249318/plea-falls-over-prison-deal.html#ixzz1OV1uTYvm|accessdate=December 15, 2012|newspaper=newsobserver.com|date=5 June 2011|author=J.

The trial was criticized by Republicans, such as [[Michael Steele]] and [[Joe Scarborough]], who referred to the procedure as "an absolute waste of resources."&lt;ref name="Republican Criticism"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13601">'''John C. Salvi III''' (March 2, 1972 – November 29, 1996) was a Catholic abortion opponent who carried out fatal shootings at two reproductive health clinics in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], on December 30, 1994, killing two and wounding five. He later died in 1996 of an apparent suicide.

==Brookline MA Clinic Shootings==
In the mid-morning of December 30, 1994, John Salvi walked into the Planned Parenthood clinic on Beacon Street in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], carrying a black duffle bag. In the waiting room, he took a modified semiautomatic .22 rifle from the bag and wordlessly opened fire.  A clinic assistant, Arjana Agrawal, was hit in the abdomen. Salvi then shot Shannon Lowney, the receptionist who had greeted him, in the neck, killing her instantly. Approximately forty people were in the room during the assault; of these, three were wounded. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGrory|first1=Brian|last2=Cullen|first2=Kevin|title=Abortion Violence Hits Home Gunman Opens Fire in Brookline Clinics, Kills 2 and Wounds 5|agency=ProQuest|publisher=Boston Globe|date=December 31, 1994|ref=Boston Globe (pre-1997 Fulltext), Boston, Mass., 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kifner|first1=John|title=ANTI-ABORTION KILLINGS: THE OVERVIEW; Gunman Kills 2 at Abortion Clinics in Boston Suburb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/31/us/anti-abortion-killings-overview-gunman-kills-2-abortion-clinics-boston-suburb.html|accessdate=18 October 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=December 31, 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817180553/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/31/us/anti-abortion-killings-overview-gunman-kills-2-abortion-clinics-boston-suburb.html#|archive-date=2016-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvi left Planned Parenthood, and drove west on Beacon Street to the Preterm Health Services office. He asked receptionist Leeann Nichols, "Is this Preterm?" When she said yes, witnesses report that Salvi responded,"This is what you get! You should pray the rosary!" before he shot her multiple times. As he had at Planned Parenthood, Salvi continued to fire. Among those injured was part-time security guard, Richard J. Seron. Seron returned fire while protecting injured clinic worker Jane Sauer, who had been hit and was on the floor. Seron himself was shot four times in the arms, and once in the left hand.  Salvi then dropped the black duffle bag, which contained a gun, receipts from a gun dealer in New Hampshire, and 700 rounds of ammunition. He fled in his Audi. Police were able to identify him from the gun shop receipt in the abandoned bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982287,00.html | work=Time | title=An Armed Fanatic Raises the Stakes | date=January 9, 1995 | access-date=2010-09-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008031644/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982287,00.html# | archive-date=2010-10-08 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrum|first1=Barry|last2=Seron|first2=Richard|last3=Bungard|first3=Chad|title=JOHN SALVI III'S REVENGE FROM THE GRAVE: HOW THE ABATEMENT DOCTRINE UNDERCUTS THE ABILITY OF ABORTION PROVIDERS TO STOP CLINIC VIOLENCE|journal=[[CUNY Law Review]]|date=Fall 2002|volume=5|issue=2|pages=141-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daly|first1=Christopher|title=Salvi Convicted of Murder in Shootings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/salvi021996.htm|accessdate=18 October 2016|date=March 19, 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811123735/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/salvi021996.htm#|archive-date=2016-08-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Salvi was captured in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], after firing over a dozen bullets into the Hillcrest Clinic. The clinic was open at the time, however, Salvi was captured before making his way up to the second floor where Hillcrest was located. 

On March 19, 1996, he was found guilty of murdering receptionists Lee Ann Nichols and Shannon Lowney. After an unsuccessful defense strategy related to Salvi's mental state, he was convicted in both killings.

==Examining the Causes for Salvi's Violence in the Immediate Aftermath==
Salvi had long shown signs of mental illness. Despite erratic outbursts, difficulty living alone, earlier threats of violence, and the possibility that he was involved in an arson in Florida, neither the anti-abortion protestors who saw Salvi become distraught at their vigils, nor his family who had witnessed glaring signs of his illness, took steps to prevent Salvi from hurting himself or others. Salvi's parents were concerned that he was troubled, but they did not seek professional psychiatric assistance with their son, as they thought that the stigma of mental illness could impair Salvi's ability to live on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaritsky|first1=John|last2=Storring|first2=Virginia|title=FRONTLINE: Murder on Abortion Row|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/salvi/|website=pbs.org|publisher=WGBH Boston|accessdate=18 October 2016|ref=FRONTLINE Show #1411  Air Date: February 6, 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025030409/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/salvi/#|archive-date=2016-10-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-Cardinal of the Archdiocese of Massachusetts, [[Bernard Law]], called for a moratorium on clinic protests following the shooting. Part of his reasoning was that other disturbed individuals could be inspired to commit violence during the protests. However, the moratorium was ignored by aggressive anti-abortionists in the archdiocese, including Catholic members of the local Operation Rescue group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ibid.|title=FRONTLINE: Murder on Abortion Row|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/salvi/salviscript.html|accessdate=18 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220642/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/salvi/salviscript.html#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillcrest Clinic, in Virginia, had been a target of pickets by [[Donald Spitz]], a known supporter of anti-abortion violence, before Salvi attacked it. The Boston Globe reported that Salvi had Spitz's name and unlisted phone number on his person at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;''Wrath of Angels'', James Risen, p.368, {{ISBN|978-0465092734}}, 1999, Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/salvi021996.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Salvi Convicted of Murder in Shootings|author=Christopher B.

Spitz held a rally in support of Salvi outside of Norfolk City Jail.&lt;ref&gt;Extremist groups: information for students, Volume 1 - Thomson/Gale, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Massachusetts Citizens for Life requested that Spitz not attend Salvi's trial, because of his outspoken endorsement of anti-abortion violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armyofgod.com/JohnSalviMassachusetts.html |title=Don Spitz unwelcomed in Massachusetts |website=Armyofgod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714175259/http://www.armyofgod.com/JohnSalviMassachusetts.html# |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
At Salvi's trial, the defense argued that Salvi suffered from schizophrenia. Several expert witnesses, including noted forensic psychiatrist Phillip J. Resnick, M.D., testified that Salvi exhibited schizophrenic behavior and was not competent to stand trial.&lt;ref name="courttranscript"&gt;PBS Frontline. (1995).

The prosecution used the testimony of Bridgewater State Hospital psychologist Joel Haycock, who spent eleven days with Salvi out of his sixty days under observation. Haycock determined that during the time of his observation of Salvi in a hospital setting, Salvi had no hallucinations, could speak in a non-digressive linear way, and was capable of understanding guilt. Haycock observed no signs of psychotic disorder during his time with Salvi. Haycock also asserted that Salvi had no mental disease at the time of the crime and was competent to stand trial. &lt;ref name="haycocktestimonycourttranscript"&gt;PBS Frontline. (1995).

On March 19, 1996, Salvi was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of armed assault with intent to murder.

John Salvi believed in a number of farfetched conspiracy theories. While considered by his defense as evidence of severe mental illness, many elements of his conspiracy beliefs reflected those of others on the extreme end of anti-abortion activism : "Shortly after his arrest he released a handwritten note alleging conspiracies of Freemasons, conspiracies to manipulate paper currency, and conspiracies against Catholics. ... He has talked about the Vatican printing its own currency and a specific conspiracy of the Ku Klux Klan, the Freemasons, and the Mob."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/salvi.html |title=The Website of Political Research Associates |website=PublicEye.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511232922/http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/salvi.html# |archive-date=2016-05-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and Vacation of conviction==
Salvi was found dead in his prison cell at [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Cedar Junction|MCI Cedar Junction]] in [[Walpole, Massachusetts]] with a garbage bag over his head tied around his neck on November 29, 1996.  The official report states that Salvi's death was a [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-11-30/news/1996335001_1_john-salvi-ann-nichols-abortion-clinics | title=Abortion clinic gunman dies John Salvi, who killed two at Mass. facilities, commits suicide in cell | work=Baltimore Sun | date=30 November 1996 | accessdate=25 July 2015 | 6= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725153238/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-11-30/news/1996335001_1_john-salvi-ann-nichols-abortion-clinics# | archive-date=2015-07-25 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Salvi's suicide, his conviction was overturned by the sentencing judge. Judge Barbara Dortch-Okara invoked the legal principle of [[abatement ab initio]], which says that a conviction may not stand if the accused dies before his appeals are exhausted.&lt;ref name="okara"&gt;''[[The New York Times]]''.

The '''Junior State of America''' (formerly, the '''Junior Statesmen of America''', or '''JSA''') is an [[United States|American]] [[non-partisan]] [[youth organization]]. The purpose of JSA is to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants.  JSA is sponsored by the Junior State of America Foundation Inc. (JSAF, a [[501c]](3) non-profit corporation), which also operates the JSA Summer Schools.

== Overview ==

Students organize every aspect of the organization, from the local chapter level to the regional level.  The members elect local, regional, and state leaders to organize JSA conventions, conferences, and political awareness events.

JSA is both a local and a national organization.  The JSA is organized by regions, somewhat congruous with the real geographic United States regions. At the high school chapter level, chapter presidents organize local activities and meetings. On the regional level, mayors and vice mayors organize regional one-day conferences.  On the state level, [[Governor (United States)|governors]] and [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governors]] organize overnight conventions and other activities.  On the national level, governors are in communication with each other planning convention themes and steering the direction of the organization.

The JSA program includes debates, "thought talks", problem solving, and a variety of simulations designed to provide members with an informed viewpoint and the ability to analyse important issues.  Simulations include, for example, [[Model United Nations]], [[Model Congress]] (with a [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]), crisis simulations, and other activities.  JSA provides an opportunity to meet other students from outside their home communities who share similar interests; furthermore, debate conventions usually include various evening activities like dining downtown or [[impromptu debate]].

In addition to sponsoring the JSA, the JSF sponsors three- and four-week Summer School sessions for JSA members and other high school students.  These are held at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and week-long symposium on state and local politics are held in several states.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, William J., New Jersey Eminent Domain Law Blog, Aug. 15, 2007, "Junior Statesmen hear eminent domain talk," http://www.njeminentdomain.com/state-of-new-jersey-junior-statesmen-hear-eminent-domain-talk.html&lt;/ref&gt; (In years past, JSF has held Summer School sessions at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[University of California, Davis]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]). Sessions include college-level courses on political science, economics, history and public speaking. Students from all over the world, (most notably England, France, Turkey, Micronesia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hong Kong) attend Summer School.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown, Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, June 5, 1997, "Six FSM High School Students Selected for 1997 DOI Junior Statesmen Summer School," http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr06059a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue from these programs help fund the school-year JSA program.

== History ==
JSA was founded in 1934 by Professor E. A. Rogers at the Montezuma Mountain School in [[Los Gatos, California]], as an experiment in self-government.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown, Los Gatos Weekly Times, Aug. 16, 2000, "Junior Statesmen alumni gather," http://www.svcn.com/archives/lgwt/08.16.00/jrstatesmen-0033.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Students at the Montezuma Mountain School set up their own tree-branch government, complete with a student court, police force, executive officer, and legislative branch.  The students would draft, pass, and enforce their own rules.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown, "Junior Statesmen," Time Magazine, Sept. 14, 1942, http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802465,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The JSA has had liaisons with other similar organizations outside of the United States. For example, throughout the 1980s the Pacific-Northwest State developed close ties with the [[British Columbia Youth Parliament]] (BCYP).  "Ambassadors" were invited from the Pacific-Northwest State to attend the December BCYP legislative session in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], as well a number of BCYP sponsored events, including the "[[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]] Conference" held in 1985, a project to celebrate the [[United Nations]] [[International Youth Year|International Year of the Youth]], involving the BCYP, the [[TUXIS Parliament of Alberta]], and the JSA.  In turn, the BCYP would send delegates to attend Pacific-Northwest Spring and Fall State.  The Southern California state also added the American School in Honduras as a chapter in 2006 and the school's chapter attended the annual Congress convention.  There are two active chapters in [[St. Kitts]] and [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands|St. Thomas, USVI]].  [[Puerto Rico]] has traditionally one or two chapters.  All Caribbean chapters attend either the Northeast State or Mid-Atlantic State conventions.

Since its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have participated in the JSA.

== Structure ==
The JSA consists of 10 states which correspond roughly to the geographic territories in the United States: the Arizona State, Mid-Atlantic State, Midwest State, Northeast State, Northern California State, Ohio River Valley State, Pacific Northwest State, Southeast State, Southern California State, and the Texas State. Each state is broken into one or more regions. If a state contracts below a certain operational level, the Council of Governors may vote to make the state a territory. The Council may also break states into multiple territories if they become too large to be effectively managed.

The current Council of Governors has ten members:

Joshua Garay: Arizona State

Dev Patel: Mid-Atlantic State

Max Zhang: Midwest State

Oliver Soglin: Northern California

Jenny Wang: Northeast

Gene Kim: Ohio River Valley

Mia Barkenaes: Pacific Northwest

Katelin Zhou: Southern California

Matt Jenkins: Southeast

Dominic Beck: Texas

The sponsoring JSF is a [[non-profit organization]] with an adult [[board of directors]], [[trustees]] and paid staff.  The JSA receives administrative and programming support from the JSF.

== JSA events ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}

=== Fall and spring state conventions ===
Fall and Spring State are statewide overnight conventions at regional hotels and convention centers.  Both consist of debates, thought talks, and special activities, including political fairs and a casual dance. Fall State is one night, students typically arrive at the hotel on a Saturday and return home the following day.  Spring State, by comparison, usually takes place over three days, students arriving at the hotel on a Friday and returning on Sunday.  At this longer spring convention JSA members in attendance elect regional leaders for the upcoming year.  Both Fall and Spring State conventions are highlighted by prestigious keynote speakers, with past speakers including [[Pat Robertson]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Colin Powell]], and [[Joe Trippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jsa.org/school-year/conventions/convention-activities/|title=Convention Activities – JSA|website=www.jsa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winter Congress convention ===
Winter Congress is structured more like an actual Congress: students are divided into Senate and House of Representative committees. They pass bills in committees and then in floor sessions of the Senate and House. If a bill passes both houses, it becomes JSA law.

=== Regional conferences ===
There are also smaller, regional conferences and chapter-conferences ("chapter-cons") which occur on a local level.  Regionals are run by the Mayors and Vice-Mayors of Regions along with the Regional Cabinet members that they appoint.  Chapter-cons are usually hosted by chapters at individual schools and are not officially JSA-sponsored events.

== Elected positions and cabinet ==
As a student-run organization, each JSA state holds elections yearly at the Spring State conventions to elect student elected officials who serve one-year terms. Each state elects a Governor and Lieutenant Governor, as well as various other offices that differ from state to state. These officials each appoint a small cabinet that helps them run the organization by completing tasks such as organizing convention logistics, writing debates, producing publicity materials, founding new chapters, and running websites. There is also a National Cabinet appointed by the Council of Governors. JSA officials and cabinet members are typically extremely dedicated to JSA, and often spend many hours per week doing their jobs.

== Summer programs ==
After the school year is over, JSA and JSF offer numerous summer programs. The biggest programs, which are held at major universities, are Summer Schools, which are conducted by the Junior Statesmen Foundation and offer students an opportunity to study local, state, or national government at an advanced level. These programs are meant to prepare young leaders for active participation in public affairs.

These programs, at which students take a full semester of two courses over three or four weeks, for which they can receive high school credit, take place at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Peking University|Beijing]]. Along with debate and regular classes (including Advanced Placement and Law Classes), students participate in a vigorous Speaker's Program in which notable speakers talk about current issues to the students. Past speakers have included [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]], [[Andy Card]], [[Ben Bernanke]], [[Lee H. Hamilton]], [[Norman Mineta]], [[Joe Trippi]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], [[Chuck Hagel]], [[Katie Couric]], [[Brian Williams]], [[Geraldine Ferraro]], [[John Kerry]], [[Harry Reid]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Ted Rall]], [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Ed Meese]], [[William Perry]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Brian Williams]], [[Karl Rove]], [[Sebastian Gorka]], and [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]].

Summer institutes are also held in different regions, such as the summer symposium of [[Arizona State]], [[Stanford]], [[UCLA]], [[Princeton University]]  and [[University of Texas]].  These events are four- to five-days long and venture into politics, world studies, history, national security and discussions of current events. Princeton's event is nicknamed "Princetitute." These events used to be known as [[symposium|symposia]].

Every summer, the newly elected governors each choose a select few from their states or territories to attend the Montezuma National Leadership Summit (affectionately known as "Zuma").  The summit is held in early-to-mid August at Presentation Center in [[Los Gatos, California]], the former site of the Montezuma Mountain School where JSA was founded in 1934.  Students who are selected to attend this summit learn more about the history and national dynamics of JSA. Being selected for attendance is considered one of the ultimate JSA honors, and many of the students that attend lead future years of the Junior State.  Subsequently, two or three students are selected out of class to become a National Montezuma Foundation Student Advisor, working with the Junior State Foundation to preside over budget and funding allocations for the National Montezuma Summit.

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ([[LGBT]]) people in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Brazil enjoy many of the same legal protections available to non-LGBT people. Homosexuality is legal in the state.

==Same-sex marriage==
In 2004, the first case of recognition of [[same-sex union]]s in Brazil occurred with a binational [[English people|Englishman]] and a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]]. This [[legal precedent]] encouraged other couples to marry around the country. At the time of the ceremony, in the form of [[common-law marriage]], this was a status that, until then, was only granted to opposite-sex couples. The couple had lived together for fourteen years, in the Brazilian city of [[Curitiba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornalcomunicacao.ufpr.br/node/7987 The first registered same-sex union in a Brazilian notary public] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317055941/http://www.jornalcomunicacao.ufpr.br/node/7987 |date=2012-03-17 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2013, the Corregedor Geral de Justiça of Paraná ruled that [[same-sex marriage]] and conversion of the stable unions to marriage should be possible using the normal marriage procedures. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parana-online.com.br/editoria/cidades/news/660511/?noticia=CASAMENTO+GAY+ESTA+VALENDO+EM+TODO+O+PARANA] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT adoption==
'''May 14, 2009''' − a gay couple was the first to win in court the right of [[adoption]] in the Brazilian State of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. A decision of the 2nd Court of Childhood, Youth and Adoption, changed the life of a homosexual couple who live in [[Curitiba]]. Two years previously, the gay couple had attempted to adopt a child.

The '''Majority Labor Party''', sometimes called the '''Majority Australian Labor Party''', was an [[Australia]]n political party formed by federal [[Australian Labor Party]] MP [[James Catts]] in 1922. It did not win any seats in parliament.

Catts resigned from the Labor Party in 1922, blaming the loss of the 1922 state election on [[Irish people|Irish]]ism, [[Bolshevism]] and [[Tammany Hall|Tammanyism]] within the party. It was also associated with the recently elected state member for [[Electoral district of Newcastle|Newcastle]], [[Walter Skelton]], and his [[Protestant Labor Party]]. The party contested the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 federal election]], but with little success, and ceased to exist shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toilereditions.com.au/asslh.org.au_The%20Protestant%20Indpendent%20Labour%20Party%20Of%20NSW,%201923-1929_files/splash_data/about.htm The Protestant Independent Labor Party of NSW, 1923-1929]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}

[[File:Uncas and Miantonomoh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Uncas]], portrayed as triumphant over a [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] enemy]]
'''''Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut''''' (1705–1773) was the first [[indigenous land rights]] litigation in history in a [[common law]] jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Falck Borch, ''Conciliation, Compulsion, Conversion,'' 216 (2004). "The first British case of a judicial character to deal specifically with the rights of the Indians in North America was that of the ''Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut'' [...]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James (Sakej) Youngblood Henderson|James Youngblood Henderson]], professor of law, calls the case "the first major legal test of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tenure."&lt;ref&gt;James Youngblood Henderson, "Aboriginal Rights in Western Legal Tradition," in ''The Quest for Justice: Aboriginal Peoples and Aboriginal Rights,'' 193 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Clinton calls it the "first formal litigation of North American Indian rights."&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Clinton, Symposium: "Rules of the Game: Sovereignty and the Native American Nation", 27 ''University of Connecticut Law Review'' (CTLR), p. 1055 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Walters has noted that the case established that "in certain circumstances native nations on reserved lands in British colonies were subject, not to colonial jurisdictions established for settlers, but to their own traditional customs."&lt;ref name="walters"&gt;Mark D. Walters. "'[http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/33_4_walters.pdf Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut' (1705-1773) and the Legal Status of Aboriginal Customary Laws and Government in British North America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706191329/http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/33_4_walters.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}". '''34'''(4) ''Osgoode Hall L.J.'' 785-829.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohegan claim was not a claim to [[aboriginal title]], but a claim that certain lands were held in [[trust (law)|trust]] by the descendants of [[John Mason (c.1600–1672)|John Mason]] on behalf of the Mohegan.

In 1979, the [[Mohegan Indian Tribe]] filed a suit against the state for possession of lands in [[Montville, Connecticut]]. In this re-litigation, the judge held in 1980 that the 1790 Non-Intercourse Act applied to the case, a ruling upheld on appeal. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. In 1994 the tribe gained federal recognition by the Department of Interior; in addition, that year Congress passed the ''Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act'', which authorized the US to take 800 acres of land into trust for the tribe for use as its reservation, and allowed it to have gambling operations on the property.

==The dispute==
English settlers arrived on the coast of [[Connecticut]] in the 1630s, coming into contact with the [[Mohegan people]], who had been part of the [[Pequot]].&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Following the [[Pequot War]] of 1637, in which the Mohegan had been allied with the English in the near destruction of the Pequot, the ''[[sachem]]'' [[Uncas]] ceded all Mohegan lands to the colonists in 1640, with the exception of a reserve of farms and hunting grounds.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

In 1659, the Mohegan conveyed the reserved lands to Major [[John Mason (c.1600–1672)|John Mason]], the future deputy governor.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The conveyance was to Mason and his heirs "as their Protector and Guardian In Trust for the whole Moheagan Tribe."&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Mason transferred the land to the colonial government in 1660, on the condition that sufficient land be left for the Mohegan to farm.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Both the Mohegan and Mason's heirs argued&amp;mdash;during the century-long dispute&amp;mdash;that this last transfer was invalid, and that his heirs continued to hold the land in trust for the Mohegan.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

Connecticut was incorporated by royal charter in 1662, with its boundaries including the disputed lands.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; A 1681 treaty between the Mohegan and the colony acknowledged a Mohegan interest in the land; it provided that the colony would administer "Equal Justice" to the Mohegan "as our own people" if they "before hand declared their Subjection to our Laws."&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; In 1687, the colony began granting the disputed land to settlers by legislation and orders in council.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

==The proceedings==
===1704 Dudley Commission===
[[File:Joseph Dudley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Dudley]], Governor of Massachusetts]]
In 1704, the Masons petitioned the Crown, on behalf of the Mohegan, arguing that the land grants to colonists violated the treaties with the tribe.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; In February 1704, Sir [[Edward Northey (barrister)|Edward Northey]], the Attorney General, opined to the [[Board of Trade]], which administered the colony, that the Crown could establish a court with the authority to hear the dispute, and enforce its decision upon the colony should the Mohegan prevail.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Northey also expressed his opinion that the act of Connecticut in granting the land was "illegal and void."&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; In March 1704, the Board of Trade agreed and referred Northey's advice to the Crown.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The Board of Trade also recommended that the Crown cover the legal fees of the Mohegan.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

The Crown agreed in April 1704. It referred the dispute to Governor [[Joseph Dudley]] and the council of Massachusetts, with a Commission empowering them to form a tribunal.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The Commission's ruling was to be legally binding without subsequent approval by the Crown, but the right of appeal to the Privy Council was reserved.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

Walters argues that the Mohegan must have been considered a "component of the Empire" in order for the Crown to have [[original jurisdiction]] over a dispute between them and Connecticut.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; In refusing to create a similar Commission to mediate a dispute between settlers in New Jersey and the colony of New Jersey over the purchase of Native American lands, the Attorney General later opined that the situations were inapposite because there was "no common Court of Justice" between the Mohegan and Connecticut.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

Connecticut contested the jurisdiction of the Commission and did not participate further.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Dudley and the Commission unanimously sided with the Mohegan in 1705.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

===1706 Commission of Review===
On appeal from the colony, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] appellate committee granted a Commission of Review in 1706.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; This Commission never met.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

===1737 Commission of Review===
A second such Commission was established in 1737.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The second Commission consisted of the Governor of Rhode Island, and members from the councils of Rhode Island and New York.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; That Commission sided with Connecticut in 1738, on the grounds that Ben Uncas&amp;mdash;who was embroiled in a ''sachem'' succession dispute&amp;mdash;was the valid ''sachem'' and had recently released Connecticut from the land claim.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; After the Commission determined that Ben Uncas was the ''sachem'', before reaching the merits, the New York council members (who had dissented on the ''sachem'' issue) accused the Rhode Island council members of bias and left.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;  The merits decision was ultimately set aside because of "alleged irregularities." A third Commission was called.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

===1743 Commission of Review===
Meeting in 1743, the third Commission sided with Connecticut.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The ''sachem'' issue was not re-litigated because Connecticut withdrew its objection.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Third-party tenants were allowed to raise an objection to the jurisdiction of the original tribunal.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The Commission eventually reached the merits and decided that the deeds to the colonial settlers were valid.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

===Privy Council decision===
The Mohegan appealed to the Privy Council. The appeal began in 1770 and the Privy Council sided with Connecticut in 1772, without a written opinion.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The Crown confirmed this decision in 1773.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

==Reporting==
The decision was not reported in a [[law reporter]]. No reported judicial decisions from the 17th or 18th centuries recognized or applied [[Aboriginal customary law]].&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;
J.H. Smith provides a detailed history of the legal proceedings of the case, but only sporadically includes quotes from the decision.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

==Significance==
===Aboriginal title===
{{main|Aboriginal title}}
A summary of ''Mohegan Indians'' was included by Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] in his opinion in ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' (1823):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The controversy between the colony of Connecticut and the Mohegan Indians, depended on the nature and extent of a grant made by those Indians to the colony; on the nature and extent of the reservations made by the Indians, in their several deeds and treaties, which were alleged to be recognised by the legitimate authority; and on the violation by the colony of rights thus reserved and secured. We do not perceive, in that case, any assertion of the principle, that individuals might obtain a complete and valid title from the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Johnson v. McIntosh]]'', 21 U.S. 543, 598 (1823).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been considered the first case to rule on indigenous land tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney L. Harring, ''White Man's Law: Native People in Nineteenth-century Canadian Jurisprudence,'' 75 (1998). Quote: "Indian nations as legal entities had both brought lawsuits and been held to hold land under English law since ''The Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut'' [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''Struggle for the Land,'' 79 (2002). Quote: "This has been so since at least as early as the 1773 case, ''Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut'' [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Jennings, ''The Invasion of America,'' 130 (1975). Quote: "The most extensively prolonged wrangle over Indian title was probably the case of the ''Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Clinton, "The Proclamation of 1763: Colonial Prelude to Two Centuries of Federal-State Conflict over the Management of Indian Affairs," 69 ''Boston University Law Review (BULR),'' 329 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Robert N. Clinton described it as "the first major eighteenth century challenge to local colonial control of relations with Indian tribes," and "the greatest cause ever heard at the Council Board."&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Clinton, "The Dormant Indian Commerce Clause," 27 ''CTLR'', 1055 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal sovereignty===
{{main|Tribal sovereignty in the United States}}
Some commentators have suggested that ''Mogehan Indians'' demonstrated that British law recognized indigenous tribal nations as having rights of [[sovereignty]]. For example, in 1950 J.H. Smith claims that the Mohegan were "juristically regarded as sovereign."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1950, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Walters]], a lecturer at Oxford, disagrees with these claims.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Walters agrees that, if true, that interpretation of the decision would "revolutionize the traditional understanding of Aboriginal legal status in Canada."&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

==Modern relitigation and settlement==
{{further|Indian Land Claims Settlements}}
[[File:Sky Tower, Mohegan Sun, Uncasville, CT.jpg|thumb|The [[Mohegan Sun]], the second-largest casino in the United States]]
In 1979, the Mohegan Indian Tribe filed a complaint against the state of Connecticut in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]] for possession of lands in the northeast portion of [[Montville, Connecticut]]. In his ruling of 1980, Judge Blumenfeld rejected the state's motion to dismiss, holding that the 1790 Indian Non-intercourse Act applied to the entire country, including the lands in question.&lt;ref&gt;''Mohegan Tribe v. Connecticut'', 483 F. Supp. 597 (D. Conn. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] upheld this ruling on [[interlocutory appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mohegan Tribe v. Connecticut'', 638 F.2d 612 (2d Cir. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] and let the Appeals decision stand.&lt;ref&gt;''Connecticut v. Mohegan Tribe'', 452 U.S. 968 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

On remand, Blumenfeld granted the Mohegan's motion to strike the state's [[affirmative defenses]], holding that the state's title&amp;mdash;acquired from private parties who acquired the land in violation of the Non-intercourse Act&amp;mdash;was void, and that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth]] and [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh]] amendments did not bar the suit.&lt;ref name="remand"&gt;''Mohegan Tribe v. Connecticut'', 528 F. Supp. 1359 (D. Conn. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Blumenfeld struck the state's defense of ''[[res judicata]]'' based on the 18th-century lawsuit, holding&amp;mdash;''inter alia''&amp;mdash;that "the 1743 judgment itself recognizes the Indians' possessory right to the lands at issue in this action."&lt;ref name="remand"/&gt;

On March 15, 1994, the Department of the Interior granted the [[Mohegan Indian Tribe]] (MITC) federal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;59 Fed. Reg. 12140-01 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 1994, the U.S. Congress passed the ''Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act'', extinguishing all of the Mohegan aboriginal title in Connecticut and all claims of the Mohegan Nation against the state, in exchange for its approval of Mohegan [[Native American gambling enterprises|gaming operations]]. It authorized the transfer of 800 acres, the remaining Mohegan [[Indian reservation|reservation lands]], which had been used as the United Nuclear site (and cleaned up), to the United States in trust for the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 103-377, § 2, 108 Stat. 3501 (1994) (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 1775 (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt;

The MITC opened the [[Mohegan Sun]] casino on October 12, 1996. It has since expanded the facility to a full resort, including a hotel, conference facility, restaurants and shops.

The '''National Democratic Front of Boroland''' ('''NDFB''') is an armed separatist outfit which seeks to obtain a sovereign [[Bodoland|Boroland]] for the [[Bodo people]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.time8.in/ndfbs-eyes-bodoland-sovereignty/|title=NDFB(S) eyes Bodoland sovereignty|date=14 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is designated as a [[List of organisations banned by the Government of India|terrorist organisation]] by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mha.gov.in/related-links/banned-organizations | title = Banned Organisations | publisher = [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], Government of India | accessdate = 22 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDFB traces its origin to Bodo Security Force, a militant group formed in 1986. The current name was adopted in 1994, after the group rejected Bodo Accord signed between the Government of India and ABSU-[[Bodo Peoples' Action Committee|BPAC]]. The group has carried out several attacks in Assam, targeting non-Bodo civilians as well as the security forces. In particular, Due to arm conflict between [[Adivasi Cobra Force]] and NDFB it has targeted [[Santhal people|Santhal]], [[Munda people|Munda]] and [[Kurukh people|Oraon]] [[adivasi]]s (tribals), whose ancestors had been brought to Assam as [[tea-tribes|tea labourers]] during [[British Raj]]. It involved in attacks on Adivasis during Bodo-Adivasi ethnic clash during the 1996 [[Assam Legislative Assembly]] elections led to the formation of [[Adivasi Cobra Force]], a rival militant group. After 1996, NDFB was also involved in conflicts with the militant group [[Bodo Liberation Tigers Force]] (which surrendered in 2003). Since 2000, NDFB has increasingly targeted [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] migrants in what it claims to be the Boro territory.

During the 1990s, NDFB established 12 camps on the [[Bhutan]]-Assam border. After suffering major reverses during [[Royal Bhutan Army]]'s [[Operation All Clear]], NDFB signed a [[ceasefire]] with the Indian authorities in May 2005.

This was followed by a split in the group: NDFB(P), the progressive faction supported peace talks with the government, while the faction led by Nabla opposed the talks. In 2012, following the arrest of their chairman, NDFB of Nabla faction split further, leading to the formation of another new faction, which was led by a non-Bodo [[I K Songbijit]] as an interim president of the interim council. This faction continued to indulge in militancy, and has been blamed by the government for [[May 2014 Assam violence|May]] and [[December 2014 Assam violence|December]] 2014 attacks.

The general assembly of the outfit held on 14 and 15 April, 2015 has vowed to revamp their national struggle and declared that the former interim national council of NDFB led by Songbijit is dissolved and a new national council was formed to fight for the liberation of sovereign, independent Boroland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/guwahati/NDFB-S-forms-new-council/articleshow/47841953.cms|title=NDFB-S forms new council - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

* Uphold the integrity and sovereignty of Boroland.

The promotion of the [[Roman script]] for the [[Bodo language]] is also a significant objective of NDFB and are against the use of [[Devanagari script]] for the language. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/ndfb.htm|title=National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)- Terrorist Group of Assam|website=www.satp.org|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The [[Bodo people|Bodo]]s are an ethno-linguistic community native to the [[Brahmaputra Valley]] in Assam state of India. In the mid-1980s, Bodo politicians, alleging discrimination against Bodos in Assam, intensified their campaign for the creation of Bodo-majority [[Bodoland]]. While majority of the Bodos envisaged Bodoland as an autonomous territory or state within India, a small section demanded complete sovereignty. NDFB was formed by secessionist Bodos on 3 October 1986 as the '''Bodo Security Force''' (BdSF), under the leadership of Ranjan Daimary, in Odla Khasibari village (near [[Udalguri]]). BdSF carried out several violent attacks against non-Bodo civilians. On 12 December 1992, it attacked the 7th Assam Police Battalion headquarters at Choraikhola in Kokrajahar District, and decamped with 160 self-loading Rifles(SLR) and 5 Light Machine Guns(LMG).&lt;ref name="Rammohan2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=E. N. Rammohan | title=Simply Khaki | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZbaAAAAMAAJ | year = 2005 | publisher=Indialog Publications | isbn=978-81-87981-78-7 | page = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bodoland movement was mainly led by the political organisations [[All Bodo Students Union]] (ABSU) and [[Bodo Peoples' Action Committee]] (BPAC). In 1993, these two groups signed the Bodo Accord with Indian government, agreeing to the formation of Bodoland Autonomous Council within Assam. BdSF opposed this Accord.&lt;ref name="BarryJudith2008"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Barry M. Rubin | author2=Judith Colp Rubin | title=Chronologies of Modern Terrorism | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIwBFpBi5noC&amp;pg=PA151 | year=2008 | publisher=M.E. Sharpe | isbn=978-0-7656-2206-8 | pages=151–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Accord, the Assam State Government refused to hand over 2,750 villages to the proposed Council, arguing that Bodos formed less than 50% of the population in these villages.&lt;ref name="Subir2009"/&gt; Following this, the BdSF was renamed to National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) on 25 November 1994.&lt;ref name="SATP_profile"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/Ndfb.htm | title = National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) | date = 2014-05-03 | publisher = SATP }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDFB then launched an [[ethnic cleansing]] campaign, attacking non-Bodo communities in these villages. During the 1996 [[Assam Legislative Assembly]] elections, it killed hundreds of [[Santhal people|Santhal]], [[Munda people|Munda]] and [[Kurukh people|Oraon]] [[adivasi]]s (tribals), whose ancestors had been brought to Assam as [[tea-tribes|tea labourers]] during [[British Raj]]. In response, the tribals formed [[Adivasi Cobra Force]], their own militant group.&lt;ref name="Subir2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Subir Bhaumik |title=Troubled Periphery: The Crisis of India's North East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9KGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125 |date=10 December 2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-321-0479-7 |pages=125–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, NDFB also faced a rival within the Bodo community, in form of [[Bodo Liberation Tigers Force]] (BLTF). The BLTF had evolved from an older militant group called the Bodo Volunteer Force. It considered NDFB's secessionist agenda unrealistic and unattainable, and focused on establishment of an autonomous Bodo territory within India. After 1996, the two groups clashed violently for supremacy. BLTF allied with Bengali Tiger Force to protect Bengalis from NDFB attacks, and also supported Indian security forces against NDFB.&lt;ref name="Subir2009"/&gt; The conflicts between Christian-dominated NDFB and Hindu-dominated BLTF polarised the Bodoland movement along religious lines.&lt;ref name="Chadha2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Vivek Chadha | title=Low Intensity Conflicts in India: An Analysis | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApzUuLiO0jYC&amp;pg=PA268 | date=23 March 2005 | publisher=SAGE Publications | isbn=978-0-7619-3325-0 | pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, BLTF surrendered en masse in return for the establishment of the [[Bodoland Territorial Council]].&lt;ref name="Tom2012"&gt;{{cite book | author=Tom Lansford | title=Political Handbook of the World 2012 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d33MfEFXvW8C&amp;pg=PA643 | year=2012 | publisher=CQ Press | isbn=978-1-60871-995-2 | page=643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDFB had established 12 camps on the [[Bhutan]]-Assam border. During 2003-2004, the [[Royal Bhutan Army]] destroyed these camps as part of its [[Operation All Clear]].&lt;ref name="Subir2009"/&gt; NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary was offered amnesty by the Assam Chief Minister [[Tarun Gogoi]] in December 2003, but rejected the offer. On 8 October 2004, the NDFB announced a 6-month long unilateral [[ceasefire]], that came into effect on 15 October. However, the Government continued its operations against the group. On 15 April 2005, NDFB extended the ceasefire. The Government released its general secretary Govinda Basumatary to open a channel of communication with the organisation's [[Bangladesh]]-based leadership. This resulted in a ceasefire agreement between NDFB and the Government on 25 May 2005. The agreement stated that the NDFB agree to cease hostile action against security forces and civilians. In return, the security forces would not carry out operations against the group's members. The agreement also stipulated that NDFB members would disarm and live in camps protected by the military for a year, and would refrain from assisting other militant groups.&lt;ref name=jane&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jane's Information Group |title=Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism |url=http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jwit/jwit0556.html |isbn=0-7106-2284-8 |date=2008-03-28 |publisher=Jane's Information Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pact came into force on 1 June 2005. However, certain factions of NDFB continued militancy. In May 2006, five members of the security forces were abducted and killed by suspected NDFB members in Assam's [[Udalguri District]]. The group also continued to clash with cadres of the ex-BLTF (Bodo Liberation Tiger Force). On June 5, 2006, two former BLTF cadres were killed by NDFB militants in the [[Karbi Anglong District]], and one former member of the disbanded group was lynched by suspected NDFB militants in [[Golaghat District]] on June 3, 2007.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt;

In 2008, the group split into two after Ranjan Daimary's name appeared in the [[2008 Assam bombings]] case. NDFB(P), the pro-talks factions led by B Sungthagra supported peace talks with the governments. NDFB(R), led by Daimary, refused to give up militancy.&lt;ref name="ToI_BSF_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Bangladesh-hands-over-NDFB-chief-Ranjan-Daimary-to-BSF/articleshow/5879908.cms |title=Bangladesh hands over NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary to BSF |newspaper=The Times of India |date=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, the NDFB(P) indicated its plans to indirectly or directly participate the [[Lok Sabha]] elections.&lt;ref name="SATP_profile"/&gt; In 2012, I K Songbijit, the chief of the NDFB(R) faction's "Boroland Army", announced the formation of a nine-member "interim national council", resulting in a split.&lt;ref name="SATP_profile"/&gt; NDFB(S), the faction led by Songibijit, is now the most dreaded faction.&lt;ref name="IE_Karbi_2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/karbi-by-birth-now-the-most-dreaded-bodo-militant/ |title=Karbi by birth, Songbijit is most dreaded Bodo militant, carries Rs 10 lakh on his head |newspaper=Indian Express |author=Samudra Gupta Kashyap |date=2014-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Splits==
After the [[Operation All Clear]] in 2003 the then united NDFB decided to go for ceasefire and talk to resolve the political issue in the year 2004. The proposal was submitted in 2008 and there was a meeting of the joint military council in Manipur. The secretary in the ministry of development of north east region, Naveen Verma, told the general secretary of the outfit that they must amend their proposition instead of negotiation at table or in other words they were forced to revise it, amend it and write a new memorandum.

There would have been no talks and extension of ceasefire unless the proposition was revised and amended which was submitted by the faction now known as [[National Democratic Front of Boroland - Progressive]] and the faction led by Ranjan Daimary who rejected it was then known as the Anti-Talks Faction, which further split into two factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fountainink.in/?p=8487|title=Fountain Ink Magazine|website=fountainink.in|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

NDFB has carried out bombings, kidnappings and murders in Assam.&lt;ref name="Andrew2010"/&gt; Due to arm conflict between NDFB and [[Adivasi Cobra Force]], Many times NDFB attacked on Adivasi. The Assam Government has accused it of launching an [[ethnic cleansing]] campaign against the [[Adivasi|Oriya Adivasi]]s and Bengali Muslim settlers in the region.&lt;ref name="Subir2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Outlook_Power_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Wasbir Hussain]] | journal = Outlook | title=Power Cuts for the People | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 | page = 16 | date=20 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group primarily operates in the region to the north and north-west of the [[Brahmaputra river]]. It is active in the Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Darrang, Barpeta, Dhubri, Nalbari and Sonitpur Districts of [[Assam]]. It has also been active in the [[Garo Hills]] region of [[Meghalaya]].&lt;ref name="SATP_profile"/&gt; It has used the neighbouring [[Bhutan]] as a refuge, crossing the border in the [[Manas National Park]] area. In December 2003, the [[Royal Bhutan Army]] initiated a crackdown on the group's activities in Bhutan.&lt;ref name="Joginder2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=Joginder Singh | title=India, Democracy and Disappointments | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGmpz0IrNVIC&amp;pg=PA224 | year=2010 | publisher=Gyan Publishing House | isbn=978-81-212-1040-9 | page=224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oceanian Democratic Rally''' ({{lang-fr|Rassemblement démocratique océanien}}, RDO) is a [[Militant (word)|militant]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Secession|pro-independence]] [[political party]] in [[New Caledonia]]. It is a component of the [[National Union for Independence]], which in turn is one of the two components of the [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS).

==History==
The RDO was founded in 1994 by local [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] [[Wallis and Futuna|Wallisians and Futunians]] favourable to the independence of New Caledonia from [[France]]. Aloïsio Sako, who had served as President of the Polynesian-based Oceanian Union and was a police officer, was removed from office by the then-[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Charles Pasqua]].

The party currently{{when|date=November 2012}} holds one seat in the [[Congress of New Caledonia]] representing the [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]], which has a sizeable Polynesian population.

Its party platform was dedicated to [[pensioner]]s' issues, and its name is a reference to its core constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/archive/article.asp?id=9150 |title=Little Luxembourg makes a big impact |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=3 June 1999 |publisher=[[European Voice]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its only legislative election in which it stood candidates, in [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1999|1999]], it contested only the [[Circonscription Sud (Luxembourg)|Sud]] constituency, in which it came eighth and last, with 0.4% of the vote.  It folded soon afterwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7956">'''''Pastorale officium''''' was a  [[Ecclesiastical letter|Apostolic Brief]] issued by [[Pope]] [[Paul III]], May 29, 1537,  to Cardinal [[Juan Pardo de Tavera]] which declares that anyone who enslaved or despoiled [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]] would be [[Latae sententiae|automatically]] [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=n_A0AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Origins+of+Global+Humanitarianism:+Religion,+Empires,+and+Advocacy&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY1J6T2q_PAhVL1SwKHUZ0DJQQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Origins%20of%20Global%20Humanitarianism%3A%20Religion%2C%20Empires%2C%20and%20Advocacy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1987/september/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19870914_amerindi-phoenix.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kingscollege.net/gbrodie/Timeline%201537%20-%20Pastorale%20Officium.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The harsh threat of punishment ([[Latae sententiae]]) contained in Pastorale officium made the [[Conquistador]]s complain to the Spanish king and Emperor. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] went on to argue that the letter was injurious to the Imperial right of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization]]  and harmful to the peace of the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kingscollege.net/gbrodie/Timeline%201537%20-%20Pastorale%20Officium.html&lt;/ref&gt; The urging of Charles V to revoke the briefs and bulls of 1537 and exemplifies the tension of the concern for evangelisation as manifested in the teachings of 1537 and the pressure to honor the system of royal patronage.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=pastorale+Officium+Sublimis+Deus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ReEaS0ZkLL&amp;sig=dgKo6vdm-ZIxxDUu2JGnMAEDFcg&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYnvan6drQAhVjQpoKHVDBAgs4ChDoAQgYMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pastorale%20Officium%20Sublimis%20Deus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The weakened position of the  [[papacy|pope]] and the memory of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)]] a decade earlier  by   [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial troops]], made the ecclesiastical authorities hesitant in engaging in any possible confrontation with the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fransamaltingvongeusau.com/documents/njno/GL.%2008.%20A%20Prophetic%20Challenge%20to%20the%20Church.pdf]. (A Prophetic Challenge to the Church: The Last Word of [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], [[Luis N. Rivera-Pagán]]
)&lt;/ref&gt; Under mounting pressure Pope Paul III succumbed and removed the [[Censure|ecclesiastical censures]] in the letter titled  "''Non Indecens Videtur'' ".

The annulling of the ecclesiastical letter was not a denial of the doctrinal teaching of the spiritual equivalence of all human beings.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=pastorale+Officium+Sublimis+Deus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ReEaS0ZkLL&amp;sig=dgKo6vdm-ZIxxDUu2JGnMAEDFcg&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYnvan6drQAhVjQpoKHVDBAgs4ChDoAQgYMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pastorale%20Officium%20Sublimis%20Deus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  The annulation gave rise to the subsequent
papal encyclical [[Sublimis Deus]] promulgated by Pope Paul III on June 2, 1537&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/That_the_World_May_Believe.html?id=c72sjS0RiY4C&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-christianity/sublimis-deus-SI.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Popes_the_Catholic_Church_and_the_Tr.html?id=YN9DDwAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''A Prophetic Challenge to the    Church:The Last Word of Bartolomé de    las Casas''", Luis N. Rivera-Pagán,      Inaugural lecture as Henry Winters Luce Professor in Ecumenics and Mission,      delivered on April 9, 2003, at Princeton Theological Seminary [http://www.lascasas.org/Rivera_Pagan.htm#_ftn1] fn. 45: "     [[Helen Rand Parish]] reproduces the Latin text of the bull and the brief, with      a Spanish translation, in Las Casas en México (México, D. F.      Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1992), 303 –305, 310-312. There are English      versions of both documents in Bartolomé de las Casas, The Only Way,      edited by Helen Rand Parish and translated by Francis Patrick      Sullivan, S. J. (New York: Paulist Press, 1992), 114-115, 156-157 and in      Bartolomé de las Casas, In Defense of the Indians, translated      by Stafford Poole, C. M., (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press,      1992), 100-103. In his anthology of ecclesiastical normative documents      regarding the Spanish empire, Francisco Javier Hernáez reproduces      Pastorale officium, but not Sublimis Deus, though he includes      Veritas ipsa, a variant of Sublimis Deus. He blames Las Casas for      the “exaggerated news” regarding the mistreatment of the Native Americans as      the source for the Pope’s concern and reproduces some of the most      denigrating testimony against the Native Americans ever expressed in the      sixteenth century. Francisco Javier Hernáez,      Colección de bulas, breves y otros documentos relativos a la iglesia de      América y Filipinas (1879) (Vaduz: Klaus Reprint, 1964), Vol.      I, 101-104. Pastorale officium and Veritas ipsa, but not      Sublimis Deus, are included in America Pontificia.     Primi saeculi evangelizationis, 1493-1592      documenta Pontificia ex registris et minutis praesertim in archivo secreto      Vaticano existentibus, collegit et edidit Josef Metzler (Città del Vaticano:      Librería Editrice Vaticana, 1991), Vol. I, 359-361, 364-366. For a detailed      analysis of these Papal documents, see Alberto de la Hera, "El derecho de      los indios a la libertad y a la fe: la bula Sublimis Deus y      los problemas indianos que la motivaron,” Anuario de historia del      derecho español, Vol. 26, 1956, 89-182. Parish has given a      closer look to the origin of these documents, including another 1537 Papal      bull, Altitudo divini consilii, regarding the performance of some      sacraments and liturgical ceremonies in the New World (Las Casas en      México, 15-28, 82-90)."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the ''Pastorale officium'' has been seen as a companion document for the [[encyclical]] ''[[Sublimis Deus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Global_Humanitarianism.html?id=n_A0AgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-christianity/sublimis-deus-SI.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=pastorale+Officium+Sublimis+Deus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ReEaS0ZkLL&amp;sig=dgKo6vdm-ZIxxDUu2JGnMAEDFcg&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYnvan6drQAhVjQpoKHVDBAgs4ChDoAQgYMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pastorale%20Officium%20Sublimis%20Deus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Stogre (1992) notes that "Sublimus Dei" is not present in [[Denzinger]] compendium of theological-historical source texts.&lt;ref&gt;Stogre, p. 115, fn. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10125">'''Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act''' is a public lands acquisition law enacted in the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] on 22 June 1964. It permits the state to issue bonds for the purchase of lands for public parks, reservoirs, and other conservation, recreation, and historical preservation purposes, and to coordinate those purchases with local governments.  The act also permits acquisition of lands by [[eminent domain]]. Once the lands are acquired under Project 70, the General Assembly must approve any disposition of these lands. &lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Dept of Conversation and Natural Resources website [http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/legal/majorlaws.aspx] Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act, act of June 22, 1964 (Sp.Ses., P.L. 131, No. 8), 72 P.S. §§ 3946.1-3946.22.  This law implements Article VIII, Section 15 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides that . . . the Commonwealth may be authorized by law to create debt and to issue bonds to the amount of $70,000,000 for the acquisition of land for State parks, reservoirs and other conservation and recreation and historical preservation purposes, and for participation by the Commonwealth with political subdivisions in the acquisition of land for parks, reservoirs and other conservation and recreation and historical preservation purposes, subject to such conditions and limitations as the General Assembly may prescribe. The act authorizes the Commonwealth and political subdivisions to acquire suitable lands by eminent domain. Under the act, no lands acquired pursuant to the act may be disposed of or used for purposes other than for recreation, conservation and historical purposes without the express approval of the General Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt;

The park in northeastern Pennsylvania, ten miles north of Scranton, was known as Project 70 during its construction prior to opening under the name Lackawanna State Park.

In the United States and Canada, '''redlining''' is the systematic denial of various services to residents of specific, often racially associated, neighborhoods or communities, either directly or through the selective raising of prices. While the best known examples of redlining have involved denial of financial services such as [[banking]] or [[insurance]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513204845/http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |date=2006-05-13 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; other services such as [[health care]]&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[supermarket]]s&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition]'', Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] Volume 53, Number 2 / February, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; have been denied to residents. In the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, purposely locating impractically far away from said residents results in a redlining effect.&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto]'' by Walter Thabit. {{ISBN|0-8147-8267-1}}. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Reverse redlining''' occurs when a lender or insurer targets particular neighborhoods that are predominantly nonwhite, not to deny residents loans or insurance, but rather to charge them more than in a non-redlined neighborhood where there is more competition.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/opinion/13ehrenreich.html?pagewanted=print|title=The Recession's Racial Divide|date=September 13, 2009|work=The New York Times|last2=Muhammad|first2=Dedrick|first1=Barbara|last1=Ehrenreich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/07baltimore.html|title=Bank Accused of Pushing Mortgage Deals on Blacks|last=Powell|first=Michael|date=June 7, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, sociologist John McKnight coined the term "redlining" to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Geography: Environments, Landscapes, Identities, Inequalities|last=Norton|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0195429540|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black [[inner city]] neighborhoods. For example, in [[Atlanta]] in the 1980s, a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning series of articles by investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]] showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle-income or upper-income blacks.&lt;ref name="Color of Money"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://powerreporting.com/color/|title=The Color of Money |last=Dedman |first=Bill |date=1988-05-01 |publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[blacklist]]s is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of [[credit rationing]].

== History ==
{{Segregation}}
Although informal discrimination and segregation had existed in the United States, the specific practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/|title=The Racist Housing Policy That Made Your Neighborhood|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=2014-05-22|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial segregation and discrimination against minorities and minority communities pre-existed this policy.  The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner-city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} The assumptions in redlining resulted in a large increase in residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city.  On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow.
"Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also [[black neighborhoods]].&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities.&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cplan_papers/3/|title=Redlining and the Homeowners' Loan Corporation|author=Hillier, Amy E.|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ Crossney and Bartelt 2005 Urban Geography]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153741/http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ |date=2012-07-09 }}[http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf Crossney and Bartelt 2006 Housing Policy Debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023817/http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia.  Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the [[Federal Housing Administration]]'s underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=http://wbhsi.net/~wendyplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |quote=Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following: Prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' ...Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups''' | publisher=[[Federal Housing Administration]] | title=Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] With Revisions to February 1938 | location=Washington, D.C. | chapter=Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[National Housing Conference]] in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed [[National People's Action]] (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife [[Gale Cincotta]] and [[Shel Trapp]], a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered Savings &amp; Loan institutions (S&amp;L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallahan|first=Kirk|title=THE MORTGAGE REDLINING CONTROVERSY, 1972–1975|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|publisher=Qualitative Studies Division, Association in Journalism and Mass Communication, Montreal August 1992|accessdate=12 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809022759/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking [[blockbusting]], forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of a disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Michael, Westgate and Ann, Vick-Westgate|title=Gale Force, The Battles for Disclosure and Community Reinvestment|year=2011|publisher=Harvard Bookstore|location=Cambridge, Ma.|isbn=978-0615449012|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), which oversaw S&amp;L's in cities all over the country.

In 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking &amp; Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate [[Michael S. Dukakis]] to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by ZIP code. The suspected redlining was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Patricia|title=Mass Thrifts Plan Suit Over Redlining, Commissioner Stands Firm|journal=American Banker|date=June 12, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]] of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].

==Effect==
According to blackpast.org contributor Brent Gaspaire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Redlining (1937-   ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|url = http://www.blackpast.org/aah/redlining-1937|website = www.blackpast.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=As a consequence of redlining, neighborhoods that local banks deemed unfit for investment were left underdeveloped or in disrepair.  Attempts to improve these neighborhoods with even relatively small-scale business ventures were commonly obstructed by financial institutions that continued to label the underwriting as too risky or simply rejected them outright.  When existing businesses collapsed, new ones were not allowed to replace them, often leaving entire blocks empty and crumbling. Consequently, African Americans in those neighborhoods were frequently limited in their access to banking, healthcare, retail merchandise, and even groceries.|sign=|source=}}

Redlining paralyzed the housing market, lowered property values in certain areas and encouraged landlord [[Abandonment (legal)|abandonment]]. As abandonment increased, the population density became lower. Abandoned buildings served as havens for drug dealing and other illegal activity, increasing social problems and reluctance of people to invest in these areas.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}
Because areas were redlined residents in them were unable to obtain loans to improve their homes or get loans to move to a different area. Obviously, the neighborhoods had zero investment while neighborhoods around them improved. When the GI Bill was created during World War II, veterans who once lived in redlined areas were unable to get zero interest loans to build new homes like the rest of the returning soldiers. This forced them to stay in the areas that were poor and uninvested in while the rest of America was growing and moving to the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sprawling of America.'' Dir. [[Wade Goodwyn]] and Christopher M. Cook. Great Lakes Television Consortium, 2011. Great Lakes Television Consortium. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time the GI Bill was created, the Federal Highway Act was also created. Because the areas that were redlined were so poor, many cities chose to destroy these areas to create the highways. The residents were displaced and forced to move into different uninvested neighborhoods while their homes and businesses were destroyed by the highways.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue, Thomas, and Eric Foner. ''Origins of the Urban Crisis.'' New York: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12|title=The Effects of the 1930s HOLC "Redlining" Maps - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html|title=How Redlining's Racist Effects Lasted for Decades|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2017-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] announced a $200 million settlement with [[Associated Banc-Corp|Associated Bank]] over redlining in Chicago and Milwaukee in May 2015. The three-year HUD observation led to the complaint that the bank purposely rejected mortgage applications from black and Latino applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2015/HUDNo_15-064b|title=HUDNo_15-064|website=portal.hud.gov|access-date=2017-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308221250/https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2015%2FHUDNo_15-064b|archivedate=2017-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final settlement required AB to open branches in non-white neighborhoods, just like HCSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.housingwire.com/articles/33998-associated-bank-settles-with-hud-over-discriminatory-lending|title=Associated Bank settles with HUD over discriminatory lending|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]] announced a settlement with Evans Bank for $825,000 on September 10, 2015. An investigation had uncovered the erasure of black neighborhoods from mortgage lending maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/business/dealbook/evans-bank-settles-new-york-redlining-lawsuit.html|title=Evans Bank Settles New York 'Redlining' Lawsuit|last=Silver-greenberg|first=Jessica|date=2015-09-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-08|last2=Corkery|first2=Michael|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schneiderman, of the over 1,100 mortgage applications the bank received between 2009 and 2012, only four were from African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-secures-agreement-evans-bank-ending-discriminatory-mortgage-redlining|title=A.G.

The most notable examples of such DOJ and HUD settlements have focused heavily on community banks in large metropolitan areas, but banks in other regions have been the subject of such orders as well, including First United Security Bank in Thomasville, Alabama, and Community State Bank in Saginaw, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2014/09/02/evans-bancorp-isnt-only-lender-at-risk-of-redlining-lawsuit/|title=Evans Bancorp isn't only lender at risk of redlining lawsuit|last=Glynn|first=Matt|date=2014-09-02|website=The Buffalo News|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice]] announced a $33 million settlement with [[Hudson City Savings Bank]], which services [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Pennsylvania]], on September 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/777866/download|title=CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v.

The Justice Department called it the "largest residential mortgage redlining settlement in its history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-reach-settlement-hudson-city|title=Justice Department and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Reach Settlement with Hudson City Savings Bank to Resolve Allegations of Mortgage Lending Discrimination|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the settlement agreement, HCSB was forced to open branches in non-white communities. As U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman explained to Emily Badger for The Washington Post, "[i]f you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood and you wanted to apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go." The enforcement agencies cited additional evidence of discrimination Hudson City's broker selection practices, noting that the bank received 80 percent of its mortgage applications from mortgage brokers but that the brokers with whom the bank worked were not located in majority African-American and Hispanic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/25/what-it-looks-like-when-a-bank-structures-its-business-to-avoid-minorities/|title=What it looks like when a bank goes out of its way to avoid minorities|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative action ===
In the United States, the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] was passed to fight the practice. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development "The ''Fair Housing Act'' makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HUDNo_15-064|url = http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2015/HUDNo_15-064b|website = portal.hud.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905061813/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2015%2FHUDNo_15-064b|archivedate = 2015-09-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.

The [[Community Reinvestment Act]] passed by Congress in 1977 to reduce discriminatory credit practices against low-income neighborhoods further required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S.

=== Community organizations ===
[[ShoreBank]], a community-development bank in [[Chicago]]'s [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]] neighborhood, was a part of the private-sector fight against redlining.&lt;ref name="shorebank"&gt;Douthwaite, Richard. "[http://www.feasta.org/documents/shortcircuit/index.html?sc4/shorebank.html HOW A BANK CAN TRANSFORM A NEIGHBOURHOOD]", "Short Circuit". Retrieved January 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1973, ShoreBank sought to combat racist lending practices in Chicago's [[African-American]] communities by providing financial services, especially mortgage loans, to local residents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen, Mark. "[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/673.html ShoreBank Surpasses $1 Billion in Community Development Investment]", "Social Funds", 2001-11-1. Retrieved January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1992 speech, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] called ShoreBank "the most important bank in America."&lt;ref name="shorebank"/&gt; On August 20, 2010, the bank was declared insolvent, closed by regulators and most of its assets were acquired by Urban Partnership Bank.

In the mid-1970s, community organizations,  under the banner of the NPA,  worked to fight against redlining in South Austin, Illinois. One of these organisations was SACCC ([[South Austin Coalition Community Council]]), formed to restore South Austin's neighbourhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance,  as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/02/14/page/S8/article/combatting-redlining-in-austin|title=Combatting redlining in Austin (February 14, 1981)|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==

=== Retail ===

==== Brick and mortar ====
[[Retail]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. Taxicab services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods.&lt;ref&gt;Denver D'Rozario, "Retail Redlining: Definition, Theory, Typology, and Measurement", ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25, No. 2, 175–186 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online ====

A 2012 study by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Home Depot]], [[Rosetta Stone (software)|Rosetta Stone]] and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices).  Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like [[OfficeMax]] and [[Office Depot]].  This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578189391813881534 |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |authors=Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Ashkan Soltani |date=24 Dec 2012 |title= Websites Vary Prices, Deals Based on Users' Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liquorlining ====
Some service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of "reverse redlining."  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |title=Liquorlining: Liquor Store Concentration and Community Development in Lower-income Cook County Neighborhoods |last1=Maxwell |first1=Ann |last2=Daniel |first2=Immergluck |date=January 1997 |website=Woodstock Institute |format=PDF |access-date=14 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416121921/http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romley |first1=John A. |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Ringel |first3=Jeanne |last4=Sturm |first4=Roland |display-authors=2 |last-author-amp= |editor-last=Schuckit |editor1-first=Mark A. |date=January 2007 |title=Alcohol and Environmental Justice:The Density of Liquor Stores and Bars in Urban Neighborhoods in the United States |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reprints/2008/RAND_RP1323.pdf |format=PDF |journal=''[[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]]'' |location= |publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=48–55  |access-date=14 March 2015 |via=[[RAND Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial services===

==== Student loans ====
In December 2007, a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] was brought against student loan lending giant [[Sallie Mae]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]]. The class alleged that Sallie Mae discriminated against African American and [[Hispanic]] private student loan applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |title=Sasha Rodriguez &amp; Cathelyn Gregoire on Behalf of All Persons Similarly Situated vs. Sallie Mae (SLM) Corporation |publisher=New America Foundation |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133740/http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to [[Underwriting|underwrite]] [[private student loans]] caused a [[disparate impact]] on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.

The lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the [[United Negro College Fund]] and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.ctd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04113074545 |title=SDSD District Version 1.3 |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Connecticut |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Credit cards ====
[[Credit card]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of [[Credit score in the United States|credit]] to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1098403 |title=Credit Card Redlining |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2009 |last1=Cohen-Cole |first1=Ethan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers, to be akin to redlining.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Insurance ====
Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=Squires2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9906.t01-1-00168 |title=Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas |journal=Journal of Urban Affairs |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=391–410 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial profiling]] or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=Squires2016/&gt; Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called [[Linguistic Profiling|linguistic profiling]].&lt;ref name=SquiresChadwick2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1078087405281064 |title=Linguistic Profiling |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=400–15 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D |last2=Chadwick |first2=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the [[car insurance|automotive insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html Karen Bouffard, "Michigan to crack down on uninsured drivers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128033237/http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html |date=2007-11-28 }}, ''[[The Detroit News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of [[insurance score]]s based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sara Pratt, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated "policy" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fairhousing.com/resources/history-insurance-redlining|title=The History of Insurance Redlining {{!}} National Fair Housing Advocate Online|website=fairhousing.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mortgages ====
'''Reverse redlining''' occurs when a lender or insurer particularly targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but to charge them more than would be charged to a similarly situated white consumer, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. These communities had [[Mortgage discrimination|largely been ignored by most lenders]] just a couple of decades earlier. In the 2000s some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. [[Wells Fargo]] partnered with churches in black communities, where the pastor would deliver "wealth building" seminars in their sermons, and the bank would make a donation to the church in return for every new mortgage application. Working-class blacks wanted a part of the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of contributing to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners struggled to build and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of [[Financial institution|financial firms]]. The growth of [[subprime lending]] (higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records) prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in a range of manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all [[Predatory lending|predatory loans]] were subprime. Some subprime loans certainly benefit high-risk borrowers who would not qualify for conventional, [[prime loan]]s. Predatory loans, however, charge unreasonably higher rates and fees by compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

A survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered largely subprime loans and almost no prime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages as did low-income whites. Some loan officers referred to blacks as "mud people" and to subprime lending as "ghetto loans."&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/minority-families-face-wave-of-foreclosures |title=Minority families face wave of foreclosures: Consumer groups urge more 'teeth' in laws combating predators |first=Ruth |last=Mantell |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lower savings rate and a distrust of banks, stemming from a legacy of redlining, may help explain why there are fewer branches in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively pushed subprime mortgages. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/weekinreview/04bajaj.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Vikas | last1=Bajaj | first2=Ford | last2=Fessenden | title=What's Behind the Race Gap? |date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining has helped preserve [[Housing segregation in the United States|segregated]] living patterns for blacks and whites in the United States, as discrimination is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods and the race of the applicant. Lending institutions such as [[Wells Fargo]] have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R Holloway (1998), "Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 88 (2), 252–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"Redlining Redux", ''Urban Affairs Review,'' Vol. 38, No. 1, 22–41 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state attorneys general have begun investigating these practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.

=== Environmental racism ===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}
{{See also|Race and health}}
Policies related to redlining and [[urban decay]] can also act as a form of [[environmental racism]], which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen ''The Berkeley Daily Planet''&lt;/ref&gt; This may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks" /&gt;

Robert Wallace writes that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of "[[planned shrinkage]]" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, R. "Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx." ''Soc Sci Med,'' 1990 – ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS and racism in America." Hutchinson J., ''Journal of the National Medical Association,'' 1992 Feb;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32910">In our modern society, computerized or digital [[control system]]s have been used to reliably automate many of the industrial operations that we take for granted, from the power plant to the automobiles we drive. However, the complexity of these systems and how the designers integrate them, the roles and responsibilities of the humans that interact with the systems, and the [[cyber security]] of these highly networked systems has led to a new paradigm in research philosophy for next generation control systems. '''Resilient Control Systems''' consider all of these elements and those disciplines that contribute to a more effective design, such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[computer science]], and [[control engineering]] to develop interdisciplinary solutions. These solutions consider such things such as how to tailor the control system operating displays to best enable the user to make an accurate and reproducible response, how to design in cyber security protections such that the system defends itself from attack by changing its behaviors, and how to better integrate widely distributed computer control systems to prevent cascading failures that result in disruptions to critical industrial operations. In the context of [[Cyber-physical system|cyber-physical]] systems, resilient control systems are an aspect that focuses on the unique interdependencies of a control system, as compared to [[information technology]] computer systems and networks, due to its importance in operating our critical industrial operations.

==Introduction==
Originally intended to provide a more efficient mechanism for controlling industrial operations, the development of [[digital control]] systems allowed for flexibility in integrating distributed sensors and operating logic while maintaining a centralized interface for human monitoring and interaction.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gopal, "Digital Control And State Variable Method," Tata McGraw-Hill, pp. 3-12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This ease of readily adding sensors and logic through software, which was once done with relays and isolated analog instruments, has led to wide acceptance and integration of these systems in all industries. However, these digital control systems have often been integrated in phases to cover different aspects of an industrial operation, connected over a network, and leading to a complex interconnected and interdependent system.{{sfn|Rinaldi|Peerenboom|Kelly|2001|pp=11–25}} While the [[control theory]] applied is often nothing more than a digital version of their analog counterparts, the dependence of digital control systems upon the communications networks, has precipitated the need for [[cybersecurity]] due to potential effects on [[Information security|confidentiality, integrity and availability]] of the information.{{sfn|DHS staff|2005}} To achieve [[System resilience|resilience]] in the next generation of [[control systems]], therefore, addressing the [[Networked control system|complex control system]] interdependencies, including the human systems interaction and cyber security, will be a recognized challenge.{{sfn|Rieger|Gertman|McQueen|2009}}

==Defining resilience==
Research in [[System resilience|resilience]] engineering over the last decade has focused in two areas, organizational and [[information technology]]. [[Organizational resilience]] considers the ability of an organization to adapt and survive in the face of threats, including the prevention or mitigation of unsafe, hazardous or compromising conditions that threaten its very existence.{{sfn|Hollnagel|Woods|Leveson|2006|loc={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }} [[Information technology]] [[System resilience|resilience]] has been considered from a number of standpoints .{{sfn|Trivedi|Dong|Ghosh| 2009|pp=74-77}} Networking [[System resilience|resilience]] has been considered as [[quality of service]].{{sfn|Cholda|Tapolcai|Cinkler|Wajda|2009|pp=11-19}} Computing has considered such issues as dependability and performance in the face of unanticipated changes .{{sfn|Meyer|2009}} However, based upon the application of control dynamics to industrial processes, functionality and determinism are primary considerations that are not captured by the traditional objectives of information technology. .{{sfn|Wang|Liu|2008|loc={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }}

Considering the paradigm of control systems, one definition has been suggested that "Resilient control systems are those that tolerate fluctuations via their structure, design parameters, [[Control flow|control structure]] and control parameters".{{sfn|Mitchell|Mannan|2006|pp=39-45}} However, this definition is taken from the perspective of control theory application to a control system. The consideration of the malicious actor and cyber security are not directly considered, which might suggest the definition, "an effective reconstitution of control under attack from intelligent adversaries," which was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems |url=https://secure.inl.gov/isrcs2008/default.aspx |location=Idaho Falls, ID |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this definition focuses only on [[System resilience|resilience]] in response to a malicious actor. To consider the cyber-physical aspects of control system, a definition for [[System resilience|resilience]] considers both benign and malicious human interaction, in addition to the complex interdependencies of the control system application .{{sfn|Rieger|2010|pp=64-71}}

The use of the term “recovery” has been used in the context of [[System resilience|resilience]], paralleling the response of a rubber ball to stay intact when a force is exerted on it and recover its original dimensions after the force is removed.&lt;ref&gt;S. Jackson, ''Architecting Resilient Systems: Accident Avoidance and Survival and Recovery from Disruptions'', John Wiley, Hoboken, November, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the rubber ball in terms of a system, [[System resilience|resilience]] could then be defined as its ability to maintain a desired level of performance or normalcy without irrecoverable consequences. While [[System resilience|resilience]] in this context is based upon the [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of the ball, control systems require an interaction with the environment, namely the sensors, valves, pumps that make up the industrial operation. To be reactive to this environment, control systems require an awareness of its state to make corrective changes to the industrial process to maintain normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Luyben, ''Process Modelling, Simulation and Control for Chemical Engineers'', McGraw-Hill, August, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, in consideration of the discussed cyber-physical aspects of human systems integration and cyber security, as well as other definitions for [[System resilience|resilience]] at a broader critical infrastructure level,&lt;ref&gt;''Critical Infrastructure Resilience: Final Report and Recommendations'', National Infrastructure Advisory Council, [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis of Prototypical Jurisdiction &amp; Infrastructure Critical Facility Resiliencies'', Advanced Research Institute Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Arlington, Virginia, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the following can be deduced as a definition of a resilient control system:
:'''"A resilient control system is one that maintains state awareness and an accepted level of operational normalcy in response to disturbances, including threats of an unexpected and malicious nature"{{sfn|Rieger|Gertman|McQueen|2009}}'''

[[Image:RCS Architecture 09-50368.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Fig. 1. Resilient Control System Framework.]]

Considering the flow of a digital [[control system]] as a basis, a resilient control system framework can be designed. Referring to the left side of Fig. 1, a resilient control system holistically considers the measures of performance or normalcy for the [[State space (controls)|state space]]. At the center, an understanding of performance and priority provide the basis for an appropriate response by a combination of human and automation, embedded within a [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent]], semi-autonomous framework. Finally, to the right, information must be tailored to the consumer to address the need and position a desirable response. Several examples or scenarios of how [[System resilience|resilience]] differs and provides benefit to control system design are available in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;HTGR Resilient Control System Strategy, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rieger|2010|pp=64-71}}

==Areas Of resilience==
Some primary tenets of [[System resilience|resilience]], as contrasted to traditional reliability, have presented themselves in considering an integrated approach to resilient control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems, 2008-2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lin|Sedigh|Hurson|2011|pp=93-103}}&lt;ref&gt;''High-Confidence Medical Devices: Cyber-Physical Systems for 21st Century Health Care'', Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These cyber-physical tenants complement the fundamental concept of dependable or reliable computing by characterizing [[System resilience|resilience]] in regard to control system concerns, including design considerations that provide a level of understanding and assurance in the safe and secure operation of an industrial facility. These tenants are discussed individually below to summarize some of the challenges to address in order to achieve [[System resilience|resilience]].

===Human systems===
The benign human has an ability to quickly understand novel solutions, and provide the ability to adapt to unexpected conditions. This behavior can provide additional [[System resilience|resilience]] to a control system,&lt;ref&gt;E. Hollnagel, J. Pariès, D. Woods and J. Wreathall, ''Resilience Engineering in Practice'', Ashgate, London, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but reproducibly predicting [[human behavior]] is a continuing challenge. The ability to capture historic human preferences can be applied to [[bayesian inference]] and [[Bayesian network|bayesian belief networks]], but ideally a solution would consider direct understanding of human state using sensors such as an [[Electroencephalography|EEG]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Schrauf, M. Simon, E. Schmidt and W. Kincses, ''Assessing Drivers' Fatigue State under Real Traffic Conditions using EEG Alpha Spindles'', Sixth International Driving Symposium on Human Factors in Driver Assessment, Training and Vehicle Design, June, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. E. Kerick, K. Mcdowell, '’Understanding Brain, Cognition, and Behavior in Complex Dynamic Environments'',5th International Conference on Foundations of Augmented Cognition, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Considering control system design and interaction, the goal would be to tailor the amount of automation necessary to achieve some level of optimal [[System resilience|resilience]] for this mixed initiative response.&lt;ref&gt;N. Adam, ''DHS Workshop on Future Directions in Cyber-Physical Systems Security: Final Report'', January, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Presented to the human would be that actionable information that provides the basis for a targeted, reproducible response.&lt;ref&gt;E. Blasch, M. Pribilski, B. Daughtery, B. Roscoe, and J. Gunsett, “Fusion Metrics for Dynamic Situation Analysis,” Proc. SPIE 5429, April, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyber security===
In contrast to the challenges of prediction and integration of the benign human with control systems, the abilities of the malicious actor (or hacker) to undermine desired control system behavior also create a significant challenge to control system [[System resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Verissimo, ''Challenges of Architecting Resilient Critical Information Infrastructures'', presentation at ENISA-FORTH Summer School on Network and Information Security, September, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Application of dynamic [[Probabilistic risk assessment|probabilistic risk analysis]] used in [[human reliability]] can provide some basis for the benign actor.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Boring, ''Reconciling resilience with reliability: The complementary nature of resilience engineering and human reliability analysis'', 53rd Annual Meeting of the [[Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]], pp. 1589-1593, October, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decidedly malicious intentions of an adversarial individual, organization or nation make the modeling of the human variable in both objectives and motives.&lt;ref&gt;S. Redwine, ''Introduction to Modeling Tools for Software Security'', DHS [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US-CERT]] Build Security In Website, February, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, in defining a control system response to such intentions, the malicious actor looks forward to some level of recognized behavior to gain an advantage and provide a pathway to undermining the system. Whether performed separately in preparation for a [[Cyberwarfare|cyber attack]], or on the system itself, these behaviors can provide opportunity for a successful attack without detection. Therefore, in considering resilient control system architecture, atypical designs that imbed active and passively implemented randomization of attributes, would be suggested to reduce this advantage.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Goldman, ''Building Secure, Resilient Architectures for Cyber Mission Assurance'', MITRE, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. A. McQueen, W. F. Boyer, ''Deception used for Cyber Defense of Control Systems'', 2nd IEEE Conference on Human System Interaction, Catania, Italy, May, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex networks and networked control systems===
While much of the current critical infrastructure is controlled by a web of interconnected control systems, either architecture termed as distributed control systems ([[Distributed control system|DCS]]) or supervisory control and data acquisition ([[SCADA]]), the application of control is moving toward a more decentralized state. In moving to a smart grid, the complex interconnected nature of individual homes, commercial facilities and diverse power generation and storage creates an opportunity and a challenge to ensuring that the resulting system is more resilient to threats.&lt;ref&gt;V. Vyatkin, G. Zhabelova and M. Ulieru, ''Toward Digital Ecologies:Intelligent Agent Networks Controlling Interdependent Infrastructures'', 1st IEEE Conference on Smart Grid Communications, October, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alderson and Doyle, ‘’Contrasting views of Complexity and their Implications for Network-Centric Infrastructures’’,Transactions of IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Special Issue on Cyber-Physical Ecosystems, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to operate these systems to achieve a global optimum for multiple considerations, such as overall efficiency, stability and security, will require mechanisms to holistically design complex [[networked control system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Meyn, ''Control Techniques for Complex Networks'', [[Cambridge University Press]], [[New York City|New York, NY]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Cardenas, S. Amin, and S. S. Sastry, ‘’ Secure control: Towards survivable cyber-physical systems’’, 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, pp. 495-500, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-agent methods suggest a mechanism to tie a global objective to distributed assets, allowing for management and coordination of assets for optimal benefit and semi-autonomous, but constrained controllers that can react rapidly to maintain [[System resilience|resilience]] for rapidly changing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;S. D. J. McArthur et al., “Multi-Agent Systems for Power Engineering Applications—Part I: Concepts, Approaches, and Technical Challenges,” IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, pp. 1743-1752, November, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. D. J. McArthur et al., “Multi-Agent Systems for Power Engineering Applications—Part II: Technologies, Standards, and Tools for Building Multi-agent Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, pp. 1753- 1759, November, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base Metrics for Resilient Control Systems==
Establishing a metric that can capture the [[System resilience|resilience]] attributes can be complex, at least if considered based upon differences between the interactions or interdependencies. Evaluating the control, cyber and cognitive disturbances, especially if considered from a disciplinary standpoint, leads to measures that already had been established. However, if the metric were instead based upon a normalizing dynamic attribute, such a performance characteristic that can be impacted by degradation, an alternative is suggested. Specifically, applications of base metrics to [[System resilience|resilience]] characteristics are given as follows for type of disturbance:
*Physical Disturbances:
**Time Latency Affecting Stability
**Data Integrity Affecting Stability
*Cyber Disturbances: 
**Time Latency 
**Data Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
*Cognitive Disturbances:
**Time Latency in Response
**Data Digression from Desired Response 
Such performance characteristics exist with both time and data integrity. Time, both in terms of delay of mission and communications latency, and data, in terms of corruption or modification, are normalizing factors. In general, the idea is to base the metric on “what is expected” and not necessarily the actual initiator to the degradation. Considering time as a metrics basis, resilient and un-resilient systems can be observed in Fig. 2.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Rieger, "Resilient control systems Practical metrics basis for defining mission impact," 7th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Resilience Graphic r9a.tif|thumb|400x400px|Fig. 2. Resilience Base Metrics.]]
Dependent upon the abscissa metrics chosen, Fig. 2 reflects a generalization of the resiliency of a system. Several common terms are represented on this graphic, including robustness, agility, adaptive capacity, adaptive insufficiency, resiliency and brittleness. To overview the definitions of these terms, the following explanations of each is provided below: 
*Agility: The derivative of the disturbance curve. This average defines the ability of the system to resist degradation on the downward slope, but also to recover on the upward. Primarily considered a time based term that indicates impact to mission. Considers both short term system and longer term human responder actions.
*Adaptive Capacity: The ability of the system to adapt or transform from impact and maintain minimum normalcy. Considered a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is fully operational and 0 is the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold. 
*Adaptive Insufficiency: The inability of the system to adapt or transform from impact, indicating an unacceptable performance loss due to the disturbance. Considered a value between 0 and -1, where 0 is the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold and -1 is total loss of operation.
*Brittleness: The area under the disturbance curve as intersected by the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold.  This indicates the impact from the loss of operational normalcy.
*Phases of Resilient  Control System Preparation and Disturbance Response:  
**Recon: Maintaining proactive state awareness of system conditions and degradation  
**Resist: System response to recognized conditions, both to mitigate and counter  
**Respond: System degradation has been stopped and returning system performance  
**Restore: Longer term performance restoration, which includes equipment replacement
*Resiliency: The converse of brittleness, which for a [[System resilience|resilience]] system is “zero” loss of minimum normalcy. 
*Robustness: A positive or negative number associated with the area between the disturbance curve and the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold, indicating either the capacity or insufficiency, respectively.
On the abscissa of Fig. 2, it can be recognized that cyber and cognitive influences can affect both the data and the time, which underscores the relative importance of recognizing these forms of degradation in resilient control designs. For cybersecurity, a single cyberattack can degrade a control system in multiple ways. Additionally, control impacts can be characterized as indicated. While these terms are fundamental and seem of little value for those correlating impact in terms like cost, the development of use cases provide a means by which this relevance can be codified. For example, given the impact to system dynamics or data, the performance of the control loop can be directly ascertained and show approach to instability and operational impact.

==Resilience Manifold for Design and Operation==
[[File:MDS Asset Aggegation.tif|thumb|Resilience Manifold from Aggregated Power Asset Contributions|thumb|300x300px|Fig. 3. Resilience Manifold for MDS.]] The very nature of control systems implies a starting point for the development of resilience metrics. That is, the control of a physical process if based upon quantifiable performance and measures, including first principles and stochastic. The ability to provide this measurement, which is the basis for correlating operational performance and adaptation, then also becomes the starting point for correlation of the data and time variations that can come from the cognitive, cyber-physical sources. Effective understanding is based upon developing a manifold of adaptive capacity that correlates the design (and operational) buffer. For a power system, this manifold is based upon the real and reactive power assets, the controllable having the latitude to maneuver, and the impact of disturbances over time. For a modern distribution system (MDS), these assets can be aggregated from the individual contributions as shown in Fig. 3 &lt;ref&gt;T. R. McJunkin and C. G. Rieger, "Electricity distribution system resilient control system metrics," 2017 Resilience Week (RWS), Wilmington, DE, 2017, pp. 103-112.&lt;/ref&gt;. For this figure, these assets include: a) a battery, b) an alternate tie line source, c) an asymmetric P/Q-conjectured source, d) a distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM), and e) low latency, four quadrant source with no energy limit.

==Examples of Resilient Control System Developments==
1) When considering the current digital control system designs, the cyber security of these systems is dependent upon what is considered border protections, i.e., firewalls, passwords, etc. If a malicious actor compromised the digital control system for an industrial operation by a man-in-the-middle attack, data can be corrupted with the control system. The industrial facility operator would have no way of knowing the data has been compromised, until someone such as a security engineer recognized the attack was occurring. As operators are trained to provide a prompt, appropriate response to stabilize the industrial facility, there is a likelihood that the corrupt data would lead to the operator reacting to the situation and lead to a plant upset. In a resilient control system, as per Fig. 1, cyber and physical data is fused to recognize anomalous situations and warn the operator.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wijayasekara, O. Linda, M. Manic, C. Rieger, “FN-DFE: Fuzzy-Neural Data Fusion Engine for Enhanced Resilient State-Awareness of Hybrid Energy Systems,” Special Issue on Resilient Architectures and Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

2) As our society becomes more automated for a variety of drivers, including energy efficiency, the need to implement ever more effective control algorithms naturally follow. However, advanced control algorithms are dependent upon data from multiple sensors to predict the behaviors of the industrial operation and make corrective responses. This type of system can become very brittle, insofar as any unrecognized degradation in the sensor itself can lead to incorrect responses by the control algorithm and potentially a worsened condition relative to the desired operation for the industrial facility. Therefore, implementation of advanced control algorithms in a resilient control system also requires the implementation of diagnostic and prognostic architectures to recognize sensor degradation, as well as failures with industrial process equipment associated with the control algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Kun Ji, Yan Lu, Linxia Liao, Zhen Song, and Dong Wei, "Prognostics Enabled Resilient Control for Model-based Building Automation Systems," Proceedings of Building Simulation 2011, 12th Conference of International Building Performance Simulation Association, Sydney, November, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Garcia, W. Lin and S. M. Meerkov, "A Resilience Assessment Monitoring System," in Proc. IEEE Symposium on Resilience Control Systems (ISRCS 2012), Salt Lake City, Utah, August 14–16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Pajic, N. Bezzo, J. Weimer, R. Alur, R. Mangharam, N. Michael, G. J. Pappas, O. Sokolsky, P. Tabuada, S. Weirich, and I. Lee, "Towards synthesis of platform-aware attack-resilient control systems: extended abstract," 2nd ACM international conference on High confidence networked systems, Philadelphia, PA, April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilient Control System Solutions and the Need for Interdisciplinary Education==
In our world of advancing automation, our dependence upon these advancing technologies and the skill sets needed to keep the United States at the forefront of innovation. The challenges may appear rooted in design of better means to better control our infrastructures for greater safety and efficiency in generation and use of energy. However, the evolution of the technologies developed to achieve the current design of automation has achieved a complex environment where a cyber-attack, human error in design or operation, or a damaging storm can wreak havoc on the infrastructure we depend as a Nation. The next generation of systems will need to consider the broader picture to ensure as a path forward, failures do not lead to ever greater catastrophic events. As a critical resource are the students of tomorrow who will be expected to advance these designs, and require both a perspective on the challenges and the contributions of others to fulfill the need. Addressing this need, courses have been developed to provide the perspectives and relevant examples to overview the issues and provide opportunity to create resilient solutions at such universities as [http://cip.gmu.edu/education-programs/critical-infrastructure-higher-education-initiative/cisr-stand-alone-courses/ George Mason University] and [http://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/programs/security-resilience-studies/#masters Northeastern]. The tie to critical infrastructure operations is an important aspect of these courses.

Through the development of technologies designed to set the stage for next generation automation, it has become evident that effective teams are comprised several disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. McJunkin, C.G. Rieger, B.K. Johnson, D.S. Naidu, J.F. Gardner, L.H. Beaty, I. Ray, K. L. Le Blanc, M. Guryan, "Interdisciplinary Education through “Edu-tainment”: Electric Grid Resilient Control Systems Course," 122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, developing a level of effectiveness can be time consuming, and when done in a professional environment can expend a lot of energy and time that provides little obvious benefit to the desired outcome. It is clear that the earlier these [[STEM fields|STEM]] disciplines can be successfully integrated, the more effective they are at recognizing each other’s contributions and working together to achieve a common set of goals in the professional world. [http://today-archive.colostate.edu/story.aspx?id=10376 Team competition] at venues such as [http://www.resilienceweek.com Resilience Week] will be a natural outcome of developing such an environment, allowing interdisciplinary participation and providing an exciting challenge to motivate students to pursue a [[STEM fields|STEM]] education.

==Standardizing Resilience and Resilient Control System Principles==
Standards and policy that define [[System resilience|resilience]] nomenclature and metrics are needed to establish a value proposition for investment, which includes government, academia and industry.  The [[IEEE]] [[IEEE Industrial Electronics Society|Industrial Electronics Society]] has taken the lead in forming a [http://ieee-ies.org/index.php/resia-home technical committee] toward this end. The purpose of this committee will be to establish metrics and standards associated with codifying promising technologies that promote [[System resilience|resilience]] in automation. This effort is distinct from more supply chain community focus on [[System resilience|resilience]] and security, such as the efforts of [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=5259148 ISO] and [https://www.nist.gov/el/resilience/ NIST]

In various parliamentary systems, a '''returning officer''' is responsible for overseeing [[election]]s in one or more constituencies.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]] a returning officer is an employee of the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] or a state electoral commission who heads the local divisional office full-time, and oversees elections in their division, or an employee of a private firm which carries out elections and/or ballots in the private and/or public sectors, or anyone who carries out any election and/or ballot for any group or groups.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], at the federal level, the returning officer of an [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] is appointed for a ten-year term by the [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer]]. The returning officer is responsible for handling the electoral process in the riding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=gen&amp;document=ec90535&amp;dir=bkg&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false |title=The Returning Officer |accessdate=2009-02-10 |publisher=[[Elections Canada]] |date=21 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and updating the [[National Register of Electors]] with current information about voters in the electoral district to which they are appointed.&lt;ref name="NRE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&amp;dir=bkg&amp;document=ec90870&amp;lang=e#a2|title=Revision of the Lists of Electors|publisher=[[Elections Canada]]|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before enactment of the [[Canada Elections Act]] in 2000, in the case of a tie between the two leading candidates in an election, the returning officer would cast the deciding vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Results, Addition and Recounts—What Happens After Canadians Vote on Federal Election Day | publisher = Elections Canada | date = 5 June 1997 | url = http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=med&amp;document=jun0597&amp;dir=pre&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false|quote=If the two candidates still have the same number of votes after the recount, the returning officer casts the deciding vote.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2000, a tie between two leading candidates automatically results in a [[by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-2.01/page-87.html#s-318.|title=[[Canada Elections Act]] (S.C. 2000, c. 9)|date=31 May 2000|article=318|articletype=§|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[provinces and territories of Canada]] each have their own returning officers.

==Germany==
[[Germany]] has a [[Federal Returning Officer]] and a returning officer in each [[States of Germany|State]].

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]], the returning officer is usually an administrative officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Administrative Officer Grade|url=http://www.csb.gov.hk/english/grade/ao/425.html|publisher=Civil Service Bureau, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Government of Hong Kong|government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appointment of returning officers and assistant returning ofiicers|url=http://www.eac.gov.hk/en/legco/230600b.htm|publisher=Electoral Affairs Commission, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==

Returning officer is the statutory authority to conduct the polling, counting process and to decide validity of ballot paper and election commission has no power to overrule him or her.

The Election Commission of India nominates or designates an officer of the government or a local authority as the returning officer for each of the assembly and parliamentary constituencies in consultation with the state government/union territory administration. In addition, the Election Commission of India also appoints one or more assistant returning officers for each of the assembly and parliamentary constituencies to assist the returning officer in the performance of his functions in connection with the conduct of elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/election-machinery.aspx |title=FAQs - election machinery |work=Election Commission of India |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the post of returning officer in [[Dublin]]  and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] is held by the city sheriff, and in the other areas by the [[county registrar]] of the area (a senior court official). For local elections, the position is held by the administrative head of the local council. The returning officer for presidential elections and referendums is a senior official in the franchise section of the Department of the Environment.

==Singapore==
The Returning Officer in Singapore is in charge of overseeing the conduct of parliamentary (by-elections and general elections) and presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong |first=Tessa |date=10 May 2011 |title=Yam Ah Mee: GE's new Internet star |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_666918.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315164046/http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_666918.html | archive-date=15 March 2012 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RO declares results for the parliamentary general elections and the presidential elections in the following manner:

==Sri Lanka==
In [[Sri Lanka]], returning officers are appointed by the [[Commissioner of Elections]] under the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980 for all Presidential, General (Parliamentary), Provincial and Local government elections held in the island. Normally public officers are appointed as returning officers and they may appoint assistant returning officers to assist them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srilankalaw.lk/Volume-V/local-authorities-elections-ordinance.html LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS ORDINANCE]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Parliament of Sri Lanka]], the Secretary-General acts as the returning officer for votes conducted within the Parliament.

==United Kingdom==
===General elections===
In [[England and Wales]] the post of returning officer for [[United Kingdom general elections overview|general elections]] is an honorary one, held by the [[high sheriff]] of the [[county]] for a [[county constituency]] or the mayor or chairman of the local council for a [[borough constituency]]. If a constituency overlaps district and county borders, the returning officer is designated by the [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

In practice, the task of conducting the election is delegated to an '''acting returning officer''', who is usually a senior officer in the local authority (the only duties which can be reserved and undertaken by the returning officer are related to the receipt of the [[Writ of election|writ]] and the declaration of the result,&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 1983]], Section 28(2)&lt;/ref&gt; and only if written notice is given by the returning officer to the acting returning officer&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 1983]], Section 28(3)&lt;/ref&gt;). In an English or Welsh constituency where the returning officer is the chairman of the local district council or the mayor if a borough council, the [[electoral registration officer]] is automatically the acting returning officer. In an English or Welsh constituency where the [[high sheriff]] or mayor is returning officer, the acting returning officer is designated by the [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

In [[Scotland]], there is no office of acting returning officer and the position of returning officer is not an honorary one. The returning officer for general elections is the same person who has been appointed returning officer for the election of councillors in the local authority in which the constituency is situated. If a constituency covers more than one local authority area, the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] designates which local authority returning officer will discharge the function.

In [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland|Chief Electoral Officer]] acts as the returning officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/guidance/resources-for-electoral-administrators/northern-ireland-assembly Northern Ireland Assembly and local government elections]&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning officers normally announce the results after the count in the following manner:

{{quote|I, ''name'', the Acting Returning Officer for the ''name of seat'', hereby give notice that the total number of votes given for each candidate at the election of ''date'' was as follows, ''list of candidates and the number of votes received''. And that ''name of winning candidate(s)'' has been duly elected to ''name of democratic body'' for ''name of seat'' (or ''name of office'').}}

===Local elections===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], every district council or unitary authority is required to appoint an officer of the council to be the returning officer for the election of councillors to their local authority, and any parish councils in their area. County councils must also appoint a returning officer for the election of councillors within the county.&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 1983]], Sections 35(1) and 35(1A)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific imperialism''' is a term that appears to have been coined by [[Ellis T. Powell|Dr. Ellis T. Powell]] when addressing the Commonwealth Club of Canada on 8 September 1920. Though he defined [[imperialism]] as "the sense of arbitrary and capricious domination over the bodies and souls of men," yet he used the term "scientific imperialism" to mean "the subjection of all the developed and undeveloped powers of the earth to the mind of man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=2359&amp;FT=yes Scientific Imperialism an Address], Delivered by Ellis T. Powell, LL.B. D.Sc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern parlance, however, scientific imperialism refers to situations in which critics perceive [[science]] to act imperiously. [[philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] [[John Dupré]] described it (in his 2001 book "Human Nature and the Limits of Science", p. 74) as "the tendency to push a good scientific idea far beyond the domain in which it was originally introduced, and often far beyond the domain in which it can provide much illumination." He also wrote (in his 1994 paper ''Against Scientific Imperialism'', p. 374) that "devotees of these approaches are inclined to claim that they are in possession not just of one useful perspective on human behavior, but of the key that will open doors to the understanding of ever wider areas of human behavior."&lt;ref name=Dupre1994&gt;{{cite journal

Scientific imperialism has also been charged against "those who believe that the study of politics can and should be modelled on the natural sciences, a position defended most forcibly in the United States, and those who have dissented, viewing this ambition as methodologically unjustified and ethically undesirable."&lt;ref name=Bell2006&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of power ==
Writing about scientific exploration by [[James Cook]] in the 18th century, the textbook ''Worlds Together, Worlds Apart'' defined scientific imperialism as the "pursuit of power through the pursuit of knowledge,".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.wwnorton.com/college/history/worlds/ch5/summary6.htm ''The Scientific Voyages of Captain Cook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930231707/http://www2.wwnorton.com/college/history/worlds/ch5/summary6.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Peacocke]] wrote that its later pejorative use may reflect the frustration felt by some with "the limitations of reductive [[scientism]] (scientific imperialism)." He also questions the notion that "successful scientific theories are true or approximately true models of the world," and expresses a desire to "dethrone science from an imperialistic stance over philosophy and theology."&lt;ref name=Peacocke1993&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theologian]] and [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[J. P. Moreland]] argues that "the myth that science is the model of truth and rationality still grips the mind of much of our popular and scientific culture", stating that "though philosophers of science over the past few decades have gutted many of the claims of this scientific imperialism, many thinkers, knee-jerk agnostics, and even judges persist in the grip of this notion."&lt;ref name=Moreland1989&gt;{{cite book

== Accusations of being the "religion of the intellectuals" ==
[[behavioral psychology|Behavioral psychologist]] [[J. E. R. Staddon]] defined scientific imperialism as "the idea that all decisions, in principle, can be made scientifically" and stated that it has become a "religion of the intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27759479|title=Scientific Imperialism and Behaviorist Epistemology|first=J.

== Medical research ==
Medical doctor [[Peter Wilmshurst]] has used the term to describe "poor people in developing countries...being exploited in research for the benefit of patients in the developed world", and advised that "the scientific community has a responsibility to ensure that all scientific research is conducted ethically".&lt;ref name = Wilmshurst1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilmshurst P |title=Scientific imperialism |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7084 |pages=840–1 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9093085 |pmc=2126228 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/314/7084/840 |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7084.840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another accusation lies in the alleged misappropriation of indigenous drugs in poor countries by drug companies in the developed world. [[Pharmacology|Pharmacologist]] Elaine Elisabetsky wrote that "ethnopharmacology involves a series of sociopolitical, economic and ethical dilemmas, at various levels...frequently host country scientists, visiting scientists, and informants disagree...research efforts are (often) perceived as scientific imperialism; scientists are accused of stealing plant materials and appropriating traditional plant knowledge for financial profit and/or professional advancement. Many governments, as well as indigenous societies are increasingly reluctant to permit such research...historically neither native populations nor host countries have shared to a significant extent the financial benefits from any drug that reaches the market...unless these issues are amply discussed and fairly resolved, medicinal plant research runs the risk of serving ethically questionable purposes."&lt;ref name=Elisabetsky1991&gt;{{cite journal

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''1958 South African general election''', held on 16 April of that year, led to a victory for the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], under the leadership of [[J.G. Strijdom]], which took 103 seats in the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]]. It was the first election in South Africa with a whites-only electorate, following the removal of the [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] in the late 1950s to be replaced by four (white) MPs elected to represent [[Coloured]] voters in separate constituencies.

==Changes in composition and franchise==
===Native Representative Members===
The third term of the (white MPs) elected to represent black voters, from special electoral districts in Cape Province under the Representation of Natives Act 1936, expired on 30 June 1954. These seats were not vacated by a dissolution of Parliament, so they were not contested at the 1953 general election.

The three representative seats were filled by elections on 1 December 1954. Two [[Liberal Party of South Africa]] MPs (A.W.P. Stanford of Transkei and Mrs V.M.L. Ballinger of Cape Eastern) were returned. Stanford took his seat from an Independent. Ballinger had been elected as an Independent at the three previous representative elections, before becoming the first President of the Liberal Party, when it was formed on 9 May 1953. The third seat was taken by L.B. Lee-Warden, an Independent candidate.

The term of these members expired on 30 June 1960 (the first 30 June to fall after five years from the date of election). The Native Representative Members seats were to be abolished in 1960, at the end of the current term.&lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1952-1954'', page 13954 (election); ''The South African Constitution'', pp 101-109 (for the details of the native representative seats); ''In No Uncertain Terms'', page 44 (abolition of the seats).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coloured Representative Members===
The [[Separate Representation of Voters Act]] 1951, had provided for coloured voters in Cape Province to be removed from the general voters rolls and placed on a separate roll. The coloured voters lost the right to participate in general roll elections and were given four (white) representative members in Parliament.

The implementation of the 1951 Act was delayed in what is known as the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]], due to legal arguments about whether Parliament had complied with the requirement for a two-thirds majority in joint session, before it could remove the coloured voters from the general roll.

Eventually legislation to change the size and electoral system for the Senate was enacted, which the courts accepted as enabling the 1951 Act to be validated by the constitutionally required margin.&lt;ref&gt;''The South African Constitution'', introduction (discusses steps taken in the legal and political disputes)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coloured Representative Members were elected, for the first time, on 3 April 1958, for a term expiring with the next dissolution of Parliament. Four supporters of the United Party were elected to fill the new seats.

==Delimitation of electoral divisions==
The [[South Africa Act 1909]] had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division,  for general roll voters in the four provinces. The representation by province, under the eleventh delimitation report of 1958, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1953) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;''South Africa 1982'', page 129 (table setting out delimitations of seats by province, the relevant one being that of 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition at the dissolution==
At the end of the 11th Union Parliament, when it was dissolved in 1958, the House of Assembly consisted of two types of members. White voters were represented by 156 members and black voters in Cape Province by three white MPs (known at the time as Native Representative Members). A third type of MP was about to be elected, so that four white MPs would represent coloured voters in Cape Province. They were known as the Coloured Representative Members (CRM).

The general election, on 16 April 1958, only affected the representatives of white voters. The other members were elected on different dates (see above).

The representation by party and province, at the dissolution was:- &lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives, 1957-58'', page 16169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The general election, for 156 seats in the 12th Union Parliament, was the first in South African history when only voters classified as white took part. In the eleven previous general elections, the Cape Province and Natal general electoral roll had included some black (until 1938 in the Cape),  Asian (until 1948) and coloured electors.

The vote totals in the table below may not give a complete picture of the balance of political opinion, because of unopposed elections (where no votes were cast) and because contested seats may not have been fought by a candidate from all major parties.

The total registered electorate was 1,563,426. The votes cast were 1,162,576 (including 7,573 spoilt votes).&lt;ref&gt;''South Africa 1982'', page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The election saw the collapse of the [[South African Labour Party]] which lost all 5 of its seats and whose vote dropped from almost 35,000 votes in 1953 to 2,670 votes in 1958. The drop in support is largely attributed to the party leader [[Alex Hepple]]'s growing outspokenness in opposition to [[apartheid]] and his co-operation with the [[African National Congress]], positions which were not supported at the time by white workers who were the bulk of the Labour Party's electorate.

'''Water pinch analysis (WPA)''' originates from the concept of heat [[pinch analysis]]. WPA is a systematic technique for reducing water consumption and wastewater generation through integration of water-using activities or processes.  WPA was first introduced by Wang and Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y. P. and Smith, R. (1994). Wastewater Minimisation. Chem. Eng. Sci. 49, 981–1006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, it has been widely used as a tool for water conservation in industrial process plants.  Water Pinch Analysis has recently been applied for urban/domestic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Manan, Z. A., Wan Alwi, S. R. and Ujang Z. (2006). Water pinch analysis for urban system: a case study on the Sultan Ismail Mosque at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) . Desalination. 194: 52–68.&lt;/ref&gt; It was extended in 1998 by Nick Hallale at the University of Cape Town, who developed it as a special case of mass exchange networks for capital cost targeting.

Techniques for setting targets for maximum water recovery capable of handling any type of water-using operation including mass-transfer-based and non-mass-transfer based systems include the source and sink composite curves (Nick Hallale (2002). A New Graphical Targeting Method for Water Minimisation. Advances in Environmental Research. 6(3): 377–390) and [[water cascade analysis]] (WCA).&lt;ref&gt;Manan, Z. A., Foo, C. Y. and Tan, Y. L. (2004). Targeting the Minimum Water Flowrate Using Water Cascade Analysis Technique, AIChE Journal, Volume 50, No. 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The source and sink composite curves is a graphical tool for setting water recovery targets as well as for design of water recovery networks.&lt;ref&gt;Wan Alwi, S.

'''William Everard''' (bap. 1602?, d. in or after 1651) was an early leader of the [[Diggers]].{{sfn|Hessayon|2009}}&lt;ref name=note group=lower-alpha/&gt;

==Biography==
William Everard was apprenticed on 14 August 1616 to Robert Miller of the Merchant Taylors' Company, London. He was the son of William Everad, a yeoman of Reading and had been baptized on 9 May 1602 in the parish of St Giles, Reading, as William Evered.&lt;ref&gt;Hessayon suggests that this is William Everad could be the Digger because Gerrard Winstanley was a freeman of the Merchant Taylors and so they could have known each other from this time {{harv|Hessayon|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This Evered took the [[Protestation of 1641|Protestation Oath]] in the parish of St Lawrence, Reading on 20 February 1642. Less than a year later a William Everard was serving as a Parliamentary scout for Sir [[Samuel Luke]] in the Berkshire and Oxfordshire area. Hessayon speculates that he may have been captured by the Royalists as he there is no record of him until May 1647 when an ensign by the name of William Everard signed a petition voicing the grievances of the army under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax.{{sfn|Hessayon|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Petegorsky|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2GA1WP5Nx3QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 167]}} footnotes that there were four Everards in the Parliamentary army two of them with a first name of William.&lt;/ref&gt; He was cashiered out of the army in late 1647 or early 1648 for plotting to kill Charles I. 

In 1648 he was briefly imprisoned in  Kingston, Surrey, for causing a disturbance, and Gerrard Winstanley wrote ''Truth Lifting up its Head above Scandals'' in his defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites Gerrard Winstanley, (16 October 1648) ''Truth Lifting up its Head above Scandals'' in the ''Works of Gerrard Winstanley'', ed. G. Sabine (1941) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1649 he appeared before a [[Justice of the Peace]] for causing a disturbance in [[St Mary's, Staines|Staines Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites LMA, MJ/SR 1025/60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early the next month (April 1649) Everard went to [[Diggers#St. George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey|St. George's Hill]] [[Weybridge, Surrey]] with four others and started the [[Diggers]] commune. By the end of the week they had been joined by about thirty others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites . C. H. Firth (ed), ''The Clarke papers'', vol. 2 pp. 210, 210–11&lt;/ref&gt; The group called themselves [[True Levellers]], before the month was out complaints had been made to the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] over their behaviour. A troop of cavalry was sent to disperse the group and escorted Everard and Winstanley the acknowledged leaders to London to see General [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Fairfax]]. They appeared before him on 20 April and famously refused to remove their hats in his presence (an act that, at that time, was seen as showing a lack of respect for his authority). They justified their commune's actions to him using the same arguments as they presented in the Diggers first manifesto, ''The True Levellers Standard Advanced'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites ''Works of Gerrard Winstanley'', ed. G. Sabine (1941) pp. 259,266&lt;/ref&gt; which was published around the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} notes that the London book collector George Thomason dated his copy 26 April 1649.&lt;/ref&gt;  Everard's name appeared as one of the subscribers on the first manifesto, but that was his last involvement with the group.{{sfn|Hessayon|2009}}

In May contemporary newspapers and pamphlets reported that William Everard was mixed up in the [[Levellers]] inspired [[Burford Mutiny]], but this seems to have been a case of mistaken identity with the army agitator, Captain [[Robert Everard]].{{sfn|Hessayon|2009}}

In August 1649 Everard was reported to be in the parish of Bradfield, Berkshire the rector of which was [[John Pordage]]. Pordage had been curate and vicar of St Lawrence, Reading so they may have been old acquaintances.  At the end of the next summer Everard returned to the parish as a harvest worker. There was serious disruption in the village, with people running around in trances and acting in strange ways. The local population accused Everard of being a conjurer or witch (and so presumably considered to be ultimately responsible).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites  ''A most Faithful Relation'', 2, 4; Pordage, 9, 11–12; Fowler, 54, 59–60; Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 864, fol. 233v; a riddle, 1 Sept 1650?&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the same month Everard was in London where he was seen to be in a "frantick posture".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites ''A most faithful relation of two wonderful passages'' (1650), 4&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards (in October 1650) he was detained and imprisoned in [[Bridewell Palace|Bridewell]] on the instructions of the Council of State as they thought his rantings to be affected (see [[Ranters]]). He was not the only one so detained and the end of December it was reported "many of Ranting Everard's party are lunatick, and exceedingly distracted; they talk very high against the Parliament, and this present Government; for which some of them have received the lash".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites court minute book of Bridewell and Bethlem Hospital, MS 33011/9, pp. 464, 471; ''The Ranters Recantation and their Sermon'', 1650, 6&lt;/ref&gt; During the next few months Everard's behaviour deteriorated and, as his wife had previously requested, in March 1651 he was moved to [[Bethlem Hospital]] for his and others protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessayon|2009}} cites court minute book of Bridewell and Bethlem Hospital, MS 33011/9, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; What happened to him after that is unknown.{{sfn|Hessayon|2009}}

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha|refs=

&lt;ref name=note&gt;Little is known of Everard's life and even contemporaries seem to have confused him with other men called Everard who were active agitators in the army and had connections with the [[Levellers]] {{harv|Petegorsky|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2GA1WP5Nx3QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 166,167]}}. This has led some historians, for example [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] to speculated that William Everard and [[Robert Everard]] may have been one and the same person {{harv|Hill|1972|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LpYhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=William+Everard+%28Digger%29&amp;dq=William+Everard+%28Digger%29&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_arbTP7pPIj-vQOmoqX9CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg 181]}}. However the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] has a biography article on both men, but the style in which the biography on William Everard is written suggests that historians are still divided on whether the biographic details of William Everard before and immediately after his involvement with the Diggers community active at  [[Diggers#St. George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey|St. George's Hill]] [[Weybridge, Surrey]] are about the same man and that further research is needed to clarify this {{harv|Hessayon|2009}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1920">The '''World Socialist Party of Canada''' (WSPC) was a [[political party]] active in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elbert|first1=Ronald|title=The paper war : conflict and democracy in the Socialist Party of Canada, 1960-70|date=2001|publisher=University of Massachusetts|location=Boston|oclc=48392157}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed by members who broke away from the [[Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)|Socialist Party of Canada]] in [[Vancouver]] over becoming members-at-large and the Ahrens-Cannon controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newell|first1=Peter E.|title=The impossibilists : a brief profile of the Socialist Party of Canada|date=2008|publisher=Athena|location=London|isbn=1847483232}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WSPC was more active propagating socialism than the SPC's three official locals. For a few months, it probably had slightly more members than [[Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)|SPC]]. On 15 March 1970, the GEC passed a resolution "that the WSPC be informed it is unacceptable they join the SPC as anything other than new members". The resolution continued, that the applicant no longer belongs to the WSPC, or that the WSPC no longer exists. It was the beginning of the end for the World Socialist Party of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newell|first1=Peter|title=Impossibilism in Canada|journal=Socialist Standard|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
