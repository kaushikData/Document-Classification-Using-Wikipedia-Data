'''''A Hand-book for Travellers in Spain''''' is an 1845 work of [[travel literature]] by English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]]. It has been described as a defining moment in the genre.

British tourists were travelling through Europe in increasing numbers and the need for guidebooks was beginning to be supplied by publishers like [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].
In 1845 Ford, who had gained tremendous knowledge of Spain by extensive travel on [[horseback]], wrote this account enlivened by humour and anecdotes.

In Ford's obituary, commonly attributed to [[Sir William Stirling-Maxwell]], "so great a literary achievement had never before been performed under so humble a title."&lt;ref&gt;Ford's Obituary, The Times&lt;/ref&gt; Ford marked, with [[George Borrow]] the eccentric English traveller, an interest in Spain that would continue through the twentieth century on the part of British writers: [[Gerald Brenan]], [[Norman Lewis (author)|Norman Lewis]] and [[George Orwell]] were among the most eminent of these successors, with [[Jason Webster (author)|Jason Webster]] (the author of ''Duende'', ''Andalus'' and ''Guerra'') and [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]] (the author of ''Driving Over Lemons'') being contemporary.

The original edition was published by John Murray in 1845 in two volumes. The following year in 1846 he prepared a more manageable version entitled ''Gatherings from Spain'' which included some extra material. Second and third editions of the original book appeared in 1847 and 1855 respectively. As of 1966 the book was still being reprinted.

In 1855 Richard Ford also wrote ''Andalucia, Ronda and Granada, Murcia, Valencia, and Catalonia; the portions best suited for the invalid''.&lt;ref name=ford2&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=Books on Google Play Andalucia, Ronda and Granada, Murcia, Valencia, and Catalonia; the portions best suited for the invalid|year=1855|publisher=J.

The '''Art Institute of Chicago Building''' (1893 structure built as the ''World's Congress Auxiliary Building'') houses the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and is part of the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The building is located in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] on the east side of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], and marks the third address for the Art Institute. The building was built for the joint purpose of accommodating the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and subsequently the Art Institute.

The Art Institute of Chicago opened as the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts on May 24, 1879, and changed to its current name on December 23, 1882.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;"Art Institute of Chicago: Fact Sheet," January 2007 edition, distributed at information desk.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally established as both a school and museum, and stood on the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and Monroe Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/index.html|accessdate=June 20, 2007|title=History|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|date=2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609135851/http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/index.html| archivedate= June 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it rented space.&lt;ref name=tAICMS8/&gt; Before taking over its current building it occupied a four-story [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]] building by [[Burnham &amp; Root]] at 81 East Van Buren Street, where the [[Chicago Club]] is now situated.&lt;ref name=AIAGtC44&gt;Sinkevitch, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tAoCL9&gt;Steiner, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Institute, which moved there at the time it changed names, originally leased and later purchased the space.&lt;ref name=tAICMS8&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and its need for a new home for its expanding collection and growing student body, the Art Institute's trustees negotiated for a new structure at what has come to be the current building.&lt;ref name=formyrs/&gt; Although [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] opposed the development of Grant Park with public buildings along the lakefront, he did not oppose the Art Institute.&lt;ref name=AIAGtC14&gt;Sinkevitch, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spirit of the Great Lakes Fountain south of AIC.jpg|thumb|The original portion of the Art Institute of Chicago Building with ''[[Fountain of the Great Lakes]]'']]
The new building was funded by the sale of the Van Buren Street building to the Chicago Club for [[United States dollar|$]] 265,000, by donation of the land by the [[Chicago Park District]], by $120,000 public subscription, and by $200,000 contribution of the Fair Corporation in cooperation with the Exposition.&lt;ref name=tAICMS8/&gt; The World Congress Auxiliary of the World's Columbian Exposition occupied the new building from May 1 to October 31, 1893, after which the Art Institute took possession on November 1.&lt;ref name=tAICMS8 /&gt; The building was built in the place of [[William W. Boyington]]'s Illinois Inter-State Industrial Exposition Building (1873), which had been intended as a temporary structure.&lt;ref name=tAICMS33-4&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" pp. 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death in 1905, lumber merchant Benjamin Franklin Ferguson bequeathed almost $1 million ({{Inflation|USD|1000000|1905|fmt=eq}}) for the purpose of establishing a public sculpture fund to be administered by the Art Institute.&lt;ref name=AIAGtC291&gt;Sinkevitch, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; The first gift from this memorial fund was the [[Fountain of the Great Lakes]], which was commissioned in 1907.&lt;ref name=tAICMS14&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[Image:20070622 Art Institute of Chicago Original Building.JPG|thumb|The original Art Institute of Chicago Building [[facade]]]]
The current building is a classical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building, by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=formyrs/&gt; The Fullerton Auditorium and Ryerson Library were added to the building in 1898 and 1901 respectively.&lt;ref name=formyrs/&gt;  The building is composed of 273 galleries that total {{convert|562000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; The following is a summary of all additions.&lt;ref name=AIAGtC41&gt;Sinkevitch, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The building has a grand [[Italian Renaissance]] [[facade]] with a pedimented 5-[[bay (architecture)|bayed]] central section that protrudes forward from the 7-bayed wings on either side.&lt;ref name=tAoCL10&gt;Steiner, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] entry [[loggia]] is topped by three grand [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] [[arch]]es that are separated by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] half-[[column]]s.&lt;ref name=tAoCL10/&gt;

Fullerton Hall was originally built in 1898 by Shepley, Rutan &amp; Coolidge on the north side of the main floor in place of a formerly open court.&lt;ref name=tAICMS9&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built to seat an audience of 425.&lt;ref name=tAICMS9/&gt; It has a [[stained glass]] dome and formerly had a [[crystal]] [[chandelier]] both made by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].&lt;ref name=tAICMS9/&gt;

Ryerson Library was built in 1901 to the south opposite Fullerton Hall in another open court by Shepley, Rutan &amp; Coolidge.&lt;ref name=tAICMS9/&gt; The Burnham Library of Architecture, which opened on January 12, 1920, was added south of and adjacent to the Ryerson Library by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]].&lt;ref name=tAICMS16&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Staircase was completed in 1910. However, the architectural ornamentation of the neighboring gallery continued intermittently until 1929 without ever being completed. Plans for a great dome over this staircase were abandoned when proper financing never arose.&lt;ref name=tAICMS13&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinlock Court was landscaped in 1924.&lt;ref name=tAICMS16/&gt; By 1931 the court was remodeled so the ''Fountain of the Tritons'' could be installed.&lt;ref name=tAICMS17&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this court is open for dining during summer months and still contains the [[Carl Milles]] bronze fountain in its center.&lt;ref name=AIAGtC41/&gt;&lt;ref name=tAoCL10/&gt;

In 1958, Blackstone Hall, which had been added adjacent to the east wall of the original building in 1903 and once housed over 150 plaster casts of architectural artwork,&lt;ref name=tAICMS10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; was redesigned (further redesign continued in 1959).  After the redesign Blackstone Hall no longer exhibited the Greek and Roman, Renaissance and modern sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Now the Hall is partitioned into several galleries.  Also in 1958, the Benjamin F. Ferguson Memorial Building was constructed by Holabird &amp; Root &amp; Burgee to accommodate administrative and curatorial offices, which relieved space in the existing buildings for more gallery space.&lt;ref name=tAICMS18&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the Stanley McCormick Memorial Court (north garden) was constructed by Holabird &amp; Root &amp; Burgee.&lt;ref name=tAICMS19&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The south garden was constructed in 1965, when the ''[[Fountain of the Great Lakes]]'' was moved and reinstalled.&lt;ref name=tAICMS20&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dan Kiley]] designed the South garden.&lt;ref name=M42&gt;{{cite book|title=Sounds of Chicago's Lakefront: A Celebration Of The Grant Park Music Festival|author=Macaluso, Tony|author2=Julia S.

In 1962, The Morton Wing was added south of the central building to provide additional exhibition space and galleries. This balanced the Ferguson building by restoring symmetry.&lt;ref name=tAICMS19/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIC55-77/&gt;

In 1968, the original central building was named the Allerton Building after longtime trustee [[Robert Allerton]].&lt;ref name=AIC55-77&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/expansion/index.html|accessdate=June 25, 2007|date=2007|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=1955-1977: Expansion Mid-Century| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609191744/http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/expansion/index.html| archivedate= June 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the growth of the school and visitor attendance necessitated the Rubloff Building to accommodate new studios, classrooms, and a film center for the school, and new public spaces for the museum.&lt;ref name=AIC55-77/&gt; Ground was broken in 1974, and the dedication was held October 6, 1976.&lt;ref name=tAICMS21&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adler &amp; Sullivan]]-designed Chicago Stock Exchange Building (1893–1972) Trading Room was salvaged from demolition and installed in the Columbus Drive Addition in 1977. This building fragment, which includes [[Louis Sullivan]]'s exquisite stenciling, is described as the "[[Wailing Wall]] of Chicago preservationists".&lt;ref name=AIAGtC41/&gt;

In 1988, the Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Building was added to show the dramatically increased contemporary art collection and to exhibit popular large traveling exhibitions.&lt;ref name=AIC85-00&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/end/index.html|accessdate=June 25, 2007|date=2007|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=1985-2000: End of The Century| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609191809/http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/end/index.html| archivedate= June 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chicago Art Institute Modern Wing, opening weekend.JPG|thumb|right|Modern Wing, opening weekend]]

===Modern Wing===
The Modern Wing, opened in 2009, was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] and funded in part by [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Pat Ryan]]. It increases the museum's gallery space by 30 percent by adding {{convert|65000|sqft|m2}} of new galleries, and includes the {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} Ryan Education Center on the first floor.

The new building incorporates cutting-edge [[environmentalism|green]] technologies, such as a modern sunshade to filter daylight.

The sunshade, dubbed "The Flying Carpet", is made of white [[Extrusion|extruded]] [[aluminum]] and is linked to the lighting system to adjust and compensate for [[incandescent]] fixtures.&lt;ref name=AICBE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/modern_wing/building/engineering.html|accessdate=June 26, 2007|date=2007|title=Building Engineering|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610045313/http://www.artic.edu/aic/modern_wing/building/engineering.html| archivedate= June 10, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nichols Bridgeway]], a 625-foot (190 m) pedestrian bridge also designed by Piano, links the building to [[Millennium Park]].

Flanking the exterior Michigan Avenue entrance stairs are two [[bronze]] lions by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] that were a gift from a Mrs. Henry Field for the Art Institute's opening at its current location in 1893. Although the lions have no official names, the sculptor designated the lions by their poses as "stands in an attitude of defiance" (south lion) and "on the prowl" (north lion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/faq.html|accessdate=June 20, 2007|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=FAQs|date=2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609135740/http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/faq.html| archivedate= June 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lions, along with those pairs in front of the Main branch of the [[New York Public Library]] on [[Fifth Avenue]] and the pair in the grand staircase of the [[Boston Public Library]], are part of an [[Italian Renaissance]] revival by 19th-century [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artists.&lt;ref name=tAICMS47-8&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" pp 47-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Guardian lions had been an important architectural theme of the World Columbian Exposition, where six pairs guarded the entrance of the [[Palace of Fine Arts, Chicago|Palace of Fine Arts]]. Kemeys had sculpted one of these pairs, which may have served as his model for the Art Institute lions.&lt;ref name=tAICMS51-2&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The lions were moved back {{convert|12|ft|m}} toward the museum in 1909-10 in conjunction with the widening of Michigan Avenue and the addition of a [[baluster|balustrade]] and [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] to the south, west and north sides of the building.&lt;ref name=tAICMS10&gt;"The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'" p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a Chicago sports team makes the playoffs, the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. This has been done for the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 2005, the [[Chicago Bears]] in 1986 and 2007, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in 2010, and the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 2016.

The '''''Auschwitz Protocols''''', also known as the '''''Auschwitz Reports''''', and originally published as '''''The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia''''', is a collection of three eyewitness accounts from 1943–1944 about the mass murder that was taking place inside the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in German-occupied Poland during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=report&gt;
{{cite web |title=The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia |url=https://ia802708.us.archive.org/19/items/USWRBGermanExterminationCampsAuschwitzAndBirkenau/US-WRB%20German%20Extermination%20Camps%20Auschwitz%20and%20Birkenau.pdf |publisher=War Refugee Board |pages=1–33 |date=26 November 1944}}{{pb}}

==Description==
The reports were compiled by prisoners who had escaped from the camp and presented in their order of importance from the Western Allies' perspective, rather than in chronological order.&lt;ref name=Szabo2011p94&gt;Szabó (2011), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The escapees who authored the reports were [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfred Wetzler]] (the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]]); Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz (the Rosin-Mordowicz report); and [[Jerzy Tabeau]] (the "Polish Major's report").&lt;ref name=Szabo2011p94/&gt;

The Vrba-Wetzler report was widely disseminated by the [[Bratislava Working Group]] in April 1944, and with help of the Romanian diplomat Florian Manoliu, the report or a summary reached—with much unfortunate delay—[[George Mantello]] (Mandel), El Salvador Embassy First Secretary in Switzerland, via [[Moshe Krausz]] in Budapest. Mantello immediately publicized it. This triggered large-scale demonstrations in Switzerland, sermons in Swiss churches about the tragic plight of Jews and a Swiss press campaign of about 400 headlines protesting the atrocities against Jews. The events in Switzerland and possibly other considerations led to threats of retribution against Hungary's Regent [[Miklós Horthy]] by President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and others. This was one of the main factors which convinced Horthy to stop the Hungarian death camp transports.&lt;ref name="Kranzler2000p87"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kranzler|title=The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador, and Switzerland's Finest Hour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Cx3yenDCQC|year=2000|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2873-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full reports were published by the United States [[War Refugee Board]] on 26 November 1944 under the title ''The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia''.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conway2002p292/&gt; They were submitted in evidence at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] as document number 022-L, and are held in the War Refugee Board archives in the [[FDR Library|Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;ref name=Conway2002p292&gt;Conway (2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;292–293, footnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known when they were first called the ''Auschwitz Protocols'', but [[Randolph L. Braham]] may have been the first to do so. He used that term for the document in ''The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary'' (1981).&lt;ref name=Conway2002p292/&gt;

* The "Polish Major's report," written by [[Jerzy Tabeau]] (or Tabau), who was in Auschwitz under the pseudonym Jerzy (or George) Wesolowski, and who escaped with Roman Cieliczko on 19 November 1943. Zoltán Szabó writes that Tabeau compiled his report between December 1943 and January 1944. It was copied using a stencil machine in Geneva in August 1944, and was distributed by the Polish government-in-exile and Jewish groups.&lt;ref&gt;Szabó (2011), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; This was presented in the ''Protocols'' as the 19-page "No 2. Transport (The Polish Major's Report)."&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989p305/&gt;
* The Rosin-Mordowicz report, a seven-page report from Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz, also Slovak prisoners, who escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944.&lt;ref name=Szabo2011p91/&gt; This was presented as an addition to the Vrba-Wetzler report.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989p305/&gt;

The contents of the ''Protocols'' was discussed in detail by ''The New York Times'' on 26 November 1944.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989p305/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9644">An '''autogram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: αὐτός = self,  γράμμα = letter) is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of providing an inventory of its own characters. They were invented by [[Lee Sallows]], who also coined the word ''autogram''.&lt;ref name=quest/&gt; An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as “one”, “two”, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called ‘self-enumerating’ or ‘self-documenting’ sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:

:This sentence employs two a’s, two c’s, two d’s, twenty-eight e’s, five f’s, three g’s, eight h’s, eleven i’s, three l’s, two m’s, thirteen n’s, nine o’s, two p’s, five r’s, twenty-five s’s, twenty-three t’s, six v’s, ten w’s, two x’s, five y’s, and one z.

The first autogram to be published was composed by Sallows in 1982 and appeared in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s "[[Metamagical Themas]]" column in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R. “Metamagical Themas” Scientific American, January 1982, pp 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

:Only the fool would take trouble to verify that his sentence was composed of ten a’s, three b’s, four c’s, four d’s, forty-six e’s, sixteen f’s, four g’s, thirteen h’s, fifteen i’s, two k’s, nine l’s, four m’s, twenty-five n’s, twenty-four o’s, five p’s, sixteen r’s, forty-one s’s, thirty-seven t’s, ten u’s, eight v’s, eight w’s, four x’s, eleven y’s, twenty-seven commas, twenty-three apostrophes, seven hyphens and, last but not least, a single !

The task of producing an autogram is perplexing because the object to be described cannot be known until its description is first complete.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R., ''Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;390–92, Basic Books, {{ISBN|978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letaw J.R. Pangrams: A Nondeterministic Approach, ''Abacus'', Vol 2, No 3, Spring 1985, pp 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-enumerating pangrams==
A type of autogram that has attracted special interest is the autogramic [[pangram]], a self-enumerating sentence in which every letter of the alphabet occurs at least once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/self-enumerating_sentence.html Encyclopedia of Science:  self-enumerating sentence]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain letters do not appear in either of the two autograms above, which are therefore not pangrams. The first ever self-enumerating pangram appeared in a Dutch newspaper and was composed by [[Rudy Kousbroek]].&lt;ref&gt;Kousbroek, R., “Welke Vraag Heeft Vierendertig Letters?” NRC Handelsblad, Cultureel  Supplement 640, 11 Feb. 1983, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kousbroek, R. “Instructies Voor Het Demonteren Van Een Bom,” NRC Handelsblad, Cultereel Supplement 644, 11 March 1983, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kousbroek, R. “De Logologische Ruimte” Amsterdam: Meulenhoff, 1984, pp 135–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Sallows, who lives in the Netherlands, was challenged by Kousbroek to produce a self-enumerating ‘translation’ of this pangram into English—an impossible-seeming task. This prompted Sallows to construct an electronic Pangram Machine.&lt;ref name=quest&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/files/In%20Quest%20of%20a%20Pangram1.pdf Sallows, L., In Quest of a Pangram, Abacus, Vol 2, No 3, Spring 1985, pp 22–40]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the machine succeeded, producing the example below which was published in Scientific American in October 1984:&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, A.K. “Computer Recreations” Scientific American, October 1984, pp 18–22&lt;/ref&gt;

:This pangram contains four as, one b, two cs, one d, thirty es, six fs, five gs, seven hs, eleven is, one j, one k, two ls, two ms, eighteen ns, fifteen os, two ps, one q, five rs, twenty-seven ss, eighteen ts, two us, seven vs, eight ws, two xs, three ys, &amp; one z.

Sallows wondered if one could produce a pangram that counts its letters as percentages of the whole sentence–a particularly difficult task since such percentages usually won't be exact integers.  He mentioned the problem to Chris Patuzzo and in late 2015 Patuzzo produced the following solution:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/11/16/a-new-pangram/ A New Pangram] [[Futility Closet]], November 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyarecomputers.com/audio/why-are-computers-episode-4.mp3 Chris Patuzzo on self-enumerating pangrams] Podcase interview by Tom Stewart&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
Autograms exist that exhibit extra self-descriptive features. Besides counting each letter, here the total number of letters appearing is also named:&lt;ref name=wasser&gt;[http://www.fatrazie.com/EWpangram.html Self-enumerating pangrams:  A logological history by Eric Wassenaar, April 17, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524205809/http://www.fatrazie.com/EWpangram.html |date=May 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reflex/&gt;

:This sentence contains one hundred and ninety-seven letters: four a's, one b, three c's, five d's, thirty-four e's, seven f's, one g, six h's, twelve i's, three l's, twenty-six n's, ten o's, ten r's, twenty-nine s's, nineteen t's, six u's, seven v's, four w's, four x's, five y's, and one z.

Just as an autogram is a sentence that describes itself, so there exist closed chains of sentences each of which describes its predecessor in the chain. Viewed thus, an autogram is such a chain of length 1. Here follows a chain of length 2:&lt;ref name=wasser/&gt;&lt;ref name=reflex/&gt;

==Reflexicons==
A special kind of autogram is the ‘reflexicon’ (short for “reflexive lexicon”), which is a self-descriptive word list that describes its own letter frequencies.  The constraints on reflexicons are much tighter than on autograms because the freedom to choose alternative words such as “contains”, “comprises”, “employs”, and so on, is lost. However, a degree of freedom still exists through appending entries to the list that are strictly superfluous.

For example, “Sixteen e's, six f's, one g, three h's, nine i's, nine n's, five o's, five r's, sixteen s's, five t's, three u's, four v's, one w, four x's” is a reflexicon, but it includes what Sallows calls “dummy text” in the shape of “one g” and “one w”. The latter might equally be replaced with “one #”, where “#” can be any typographical sign not already listed. Sallows has made an extensive computer search and conjectures that there exist but three and only three pure (i.e., no dummy text) English reflexicons.&lt;ref name=reflex&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/files/Reflexicons%20VERSION%203.pdf Sallows, L., Reflexicons, Word Ways, August 1992, 25; 3: 131–41]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ayvu Rapyta''''' is a book written in the [[Mbya]] [[Guarani language]] and compiled by Paraguayan anthropologist [[León Cadogan]].  Cadogan records the myths and religious tradition of the Mbyá Guaraní of the [[Guairá Department]] of [[Paraguay]] as told him by, among others, [[Cacique]] Pablo Vera.

The book's full title is '''''Ayvu Rapyta: Textos míticos de los Mbya-Guarani''''' and was first published in 1959.  It is considered to be one of the most fundamental works on the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] people.

One of the most important concepts explained in this work is that of the founding of the human language or the "Ayvu Rapyta."  The father, Ñamandu, by virtue of his creative wisdom, or ''kuaarara'', conceived the origins of the human tongue even before the existence of the world.  

The book also chronicles the plans of various other spirits to create the first earth (''Yvy Tenonde'') which was later destroyed by flood to be replaced by the new earth (''Yvy Pyaú'').  Also explained is the origin of all living persons and their word-souls (''Ñe'êy'').

Cadogan also compiled from his Mbyá associates various songs, prayers and rites essential to indigenous religious life as well as their ethical customs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5922">{{about|blackhole DNS servers|other uses|black hole (disambiguation)}}
'''Blackhole DNS servers''' are [[Domain Name System|DNS]] servers that return a "nonexistent address" answer to [[reverse DNS lookup]]s for addresses [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved]] for private use.

==Background==
There are several ranges of network addresses reserved for use on [[private network]]s in [[IPv4]]:&lt;ref name=rfc1918&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=1918|bcp=5|title=Address Allocation for Private Internets|author1=Y. Rekhter|author2=B. Moskowitz|author3=D. Karrenberg|author4=G. J. de Groot|author5=E. Lear|date=February 1996|publisher=Network Working Group}} Updated by RFC 6761.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{trim|{{#section:IPv4|IPv4-private-networks}}}}
Even though traffic to or from these addresses should never appear on the public Internet, it is not uncommon for such traffic to appear anyway. Some servers are configured (usually for logging reasons) to perform a [[reverse DNS lookup]]

==Role==
To deal with this problem, [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has set up three special DNS servers called "blackhole servers". Currently the blackhole servers are:&lt;ref name=rfc6305&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=6305|title=I'm Being Attacked by PRISONER.IANA.ORG!|author1=J. Abley|author2=W. Maton|date=July 2011|publisher=[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* blackhole-1.iana.org ({{IPaddr|192.175.48.6}})
* blackhole-2.iana.org {{IPaddr|192.175.48.42}})
* prisoner.iana.org ({{IPaddr|192.175.48.1}})

These servers are registered in the DNS directory as the authoritative servers for the reverse lookup zone of the {{IPaddr|10.0.0.0|8}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|12}} and {{IPaddr|192.168.0.0|16}} addresses. These servers are configured to answer any query with a "nonexistent address" answer. This helps to reduce wait times because the (negative) answer is given immediately and thus no wait for a timeout is necessary. Additionally, the answer returned is also allowed to be cached by recursive DNS servers. This is especially helpful because a second lookup for the same address performed by the same node would probably be answered from the local cache instead of querying the authoritative servers again. This helps reduce the network load significantly. According to IANA, the blackhole servers receive thousands of queries every second.
Because the load on the IANA blackhole servers became very high, an alternative service, AS112, has been created, mostly run by volunteer operators.

==AS112==
The '''AS112 project''' is a group of volunteer name server operators joined in an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]]. They run [[anycast]]ed instances of the name servers that answer [[reverse DNS lookup]]s for [[private network]] and [[link-local address|link-local]] addresses sent to the public Internet. These queries are ambiguous by their nature, and can not be answered correctly. Providing negative answers reduces the load on the public DNS infrastructure.

===History===
Before 2001, the in-addr.arpa zones for the private networks&lt;ref name=rfc1918/&gt; were delegated to a single instance of name servers, ''blackhole-1.iana.org'' and ''blackhole-2.iana.org,'' called the blackhole servers. The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]-run servers were under increasing load from improperly-configured NAT networks, leaking out [[reverse DNS]] queries, also causing unnecessary load on the [[root nameservers|root servers]]. The decision was made by a small subset of root server operators to run the reverse delegations; each announcing the network using the [[autonomous system number]] of 112.&lt;ref name=rfc3258&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=3258|title=Distributing Authoritative Name Servers via Shared Unicast Addresses|author=T. Hardie|date=April 2002|publisher=Network Working Group [[IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the group of volunteers has grown to include many other organizations.

An alternative approach, using DNAME redirection, was adopted by the IETF in May 2015.&lt;ref name=rfc7534&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=7534|title=AS112 Nameserver Operations|author1=J. Abley|author2=W. Sotomayor|publisher=[[IETF]]|date=May 2015}} Obsoletes RFC 6304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rfc7535&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=7535|title=AS112 Redirection Using DNAME|author1=J. Abley|author2=B. Dickson|author3=W. Kumari|author4=G. Michaelson|date=May 2015|publisher=[[IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Answered zones===
The name servers participating in the '''AS112''' project are each configured to answer authoritatively for the following zones:

'''Blitz''' is an [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Communism|communist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] youth community in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], founded in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/04/27/498992.html | title = Politiet stormet Blitz-huset | publisher = Dagbladet |author1=Ralf Lofstad |author2=Harald S. Klungetveit |author3=Øistein Norum Monsen | date = 2007-04-27 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has often been criticized for their use of violent methods of political protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/04/27/499063.html | title =– Ser ikke forskjell på Blitz og nynazister | publisher = Dagbladet | author =  Eiliv Frich Flydal
 | date = 2007-04-27 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The house ==
The '''Blitz House''' ({{lang-no|Blitzhuset}}) is an [[autonomism|autonomous]] house in the centre of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It started out as a [[squatting|squatted]] building in [[Skippergata|Skippergata 6]] in downtown Oslo in 1981 and has since been a centre of [[socialist]], [[communist]] and [[anarchist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blitz.no/info/historie.html | title = Historien om Blitz | publisher = Blitz | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628092856/http://www.blitz.no/info/historie.html | archivedate = 2007-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the movement were kicked out of Skippergata and moved into [[Pilestredet|Pilestredet 30c]], where an agreement was made between the city and the squatters. They were allowed to rent the house for a symbolic rent, and in return they would maintain the building. In 2002 the city council, then led by the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]], put the Blitz house on sale. The activists responded with a massive action and, among other things, battered the entrance part of the [[Oslo City Hall]], and the sale was stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oslopuls.no/nyheter/article1677338.ece | title = Lang strid: Blitz år for år | publisher = Aftenposten | date = 2007-03-07 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the activities of the house are a bookshop with political literature, the Anti Fascist Action (AFA) network, a group supporting [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], a [[feminist]] group, a children's power group, a non-profit printing office, a photo group and a feminist radio station, [[radiOrakel]]. Blitz also has a café specialising in [[veganism|vegan food]]. The practice rooms, sound studio and concert facilities are a centre for [[ska]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[hip hop music]]. Concerts are held within the house from time to time.

During the 1980s the people around Blitz were involved in many violent demonstrations, e.g. during the visits of the British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986 and US Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Liberalen"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.liberaleren.no/2004/11/14/ensidig-om-blitz/ | title = Ensidig om Blitz | work=Liberaleren|author=[[Per Aage Pleym Christensen]] | date = 2004-11-14 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations turned into street battles between Blitz sympathisers and the [[police]]. From the 1990s Blitz has often obstructed legal meetings of right-wing political parties such as the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], the minor [[Fatherland Party (Norway)|Fatherland Party]] and the [[Demokratene|Democrats]].&lt;ref name="Liberalen" /&gt;

Blitz openly supported and took part in the violent [[2008–09 Oslo riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Blitz hilser opprørerne velkommen|url=http://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/blitz-hilser-opprorerne-velkommen-1.6425480|publisher=NRK/NTB|date=9 January 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] bassist [[Varg Vikernes]] planned to blow up the Blitz House and had stockpiled 150 kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition at the time of his arrest for the murder of bandmate [[Euronymous]].&lt;ref name="Dagbladet.no"&gt;{{cite web |author=Midtskogen, Rune |title="Greven" angrer ingenting |date=4 July 2009 |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/07/04/magasinet/innenriks/kriminalomsorg/kirkebrann/drapsdom/7051663/ |accessdate=25 August 2009 |language=Norwegian |trans-title="The Count" regrets nothing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caplan Collection''' of folk art and childhood artifacts is held by [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]; in 1984 it was donated by [[Frank Caplan|Frank]] and [[Theresa Caplan]], owners of the [[Creative Playthings]] toy company. The museum began accessioning the collection in January 1985. The collection consists of nearly 32,000 objects, from toys to dolls to games to musical instruments to masks to clothing to folk art from over 120 different countries.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{cite web|title=Caplan Collection |url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/caplan |work=www.childrensmuseum.org |publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928224931/http://www.childrensmuseum.org/caplan |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum created a specific exhibit for the collection, entitled "Passport to the World," which opened in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toy maker Frank Caplan aided Children's Museum|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|date=30 September 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ffp/&gt; Initially the Caplans had intended for the collection to be the basis of a new Museum of Fantasy and Play, but this never materialized and they donated their collection to the Children's Museum instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frank Caplan, 77, Toy Developer|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 September 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caplans spent about US$1 million acquiring the objects from around 1965 to 1985; some of the countries strongly represented are [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[Indonesia]], and [[India]].

==Acquisition==
Theresa Caplan had organized the entire collection, using 20,000 meticulously documented notecards in 28 shoe boxes. All of the cards were organized by country and category. The collection was moved in three semi trucks containing 1500 boxes from a warehouse and the Caplan's home in Princeton, [[New Jersey]] to [[Indianapolis]].  All the objects were temporarily housed in space provided by [[Eli Lilly &amp; Co.]] where they were fumigated to prevent any insects from entering the museum storage area.  Subsequent transport of the collection from the warehouse to the museum and unpacking all the 50,000 pieces took museum staff members 10 months to complete.&lt;ref name=ffp/&gt; Paul Richard, the Children's Museum's director of programs in 1985, said that the institution was "thrilled" to acquire the collection "with our philosophy of inspiring creativity in children, which is exactly what the Caplans have strived for with their various endeavors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A child's fantasy of toys comes to Indy museum|journal=aerogram|date=May–June 1985|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caplan Collection was extensively used within the exhibit Passport to the World which opened in 1986.&lt;ref name=Tracks&gt;{{cite news|title='Passport to the World' Celebrates Cultures |url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/backstagepass/Making-Tracks-Newsletter-PTTW-Caplan-article.jpg |accessdate=31 August 2011 |newspaper=Making Tracks Children's Museum newsletter |date=December 1986 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329035012/http://www.childrensmuseum.org/backstagepass/Making-Tracks-Newsletter-PTTW-Caplan-article.jpg |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the exhibit was: "All people celebrate, communicate, imagine and create, but in different ways."&lt;ref name=ffp/&gt; The exhibit was divided into four areas that displayed artifacts showing how the four parts of the theme were depicted in cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=ffp/&gt;

An opening reception was held on December 6, 1986.&lt;ref name=Tracks/&gt;  Present that evening were Frank and Theresa Caplan, members of their family, local dignitaries, diplomats from the United Nations and several of the countries represented in the collection along with more than 500 invited guests and international entertainers.  Members of Pedro Linares' family from Mexico demonstrated the making of alebrijes, their unique, fantasy, papier mache creatures while groups of international musicians and dancers performed throughout the museum.&lt;ref name=ffp/&gt;

===Expanding the collection===

Since the original donation by the Caplans, the museum has continued to collect objects that enhance and strengthen the collection.&lt;ref name=Treasures&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Newsletter|title=A Gift of Treasure: Celebrating 10 Years of Folk, Fantasy, and Play|journal=Treasures|date=Summer 1994|volume=2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these acquisitions, highlights include a raven transformation mask of the [[Kwakiutl]] people, [[British Columbia]] and [[Day of the Dead]] figures from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt; Unique objects include figural coffins made by Kane Kwei and Paa Joe of the [[Ga people]] of Teshi-Accra, Ghana.&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt;

==Folk artists==
Works by many internationally renowned artists are contained in the collection: [[paper maché]][[alebrijes]] by the [[Pedro Linares|Linares family]] of Mexico, soft sculpture by Andjelka Filipovic of Yugoslavia, carved wood figures by Tadeusz Adamski of Poland, a doll by Sasha Morganthaler of Switzerland, clay figures by Teodora Blanco of Mexico, Native American storyteller figures by Dorothy Trujillo of the [[Cochiti Pueblo]] in [[New Mexico]], well as thousands of anonymous craftspersons whose works were purchased by the Caplans in markets and bazaars of the countries they visited.&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ffp/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31480">This is a '''comparison between U.S. states and countries' per capita nominal gross domestic product'''. The U.S. is not counted as a whole in the overall rank because this would be double counting since the states of the U.S. are being compared to other countries. These figures are calculated using exchange rate conversions, and exchange rates fluctuate from year to year.

==2013&amp;ndash;2017==
Per capita GDP figures for countries and foreign dependencies are taken primarily from the United Nations and the World Bank; U.S. state and U.S. territory figures are from various sources. Figures are taken from dates ranging from the years 2013 to 2017.

The '''''Domestic Encyclopedia''''' is a small encyclopedia of the English language, in four volumes, published in London in 1802 by [[Murray and Highly]], and compiled by [[Anthony Florian Madinger Willich]].&lt;ref&gt;Willich's ''Domestic Encyclopedia'', 1802, London, Volume I, title page&lt;/ref&gt;  While most encyclopedias of the time, such as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', were printed in [[Book size|quarto]], or in the case of Chambers [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|''Cyclopædia'']], even [[Book size|folio]], the ''Domestic Encyclopedia'' was printed in [[Book size|octavo]], 5 1/2 by 8 1/2 inches. There are roughly 500 pages per volume, and 28 plates in total. Volume 4 includes a 70-page supplement and a 33-page index.&lt;ref&gt;Willich's ''Domestic Encyclopedia'', 1802, London, Volume IV, p. 387 (supplement) and p. 457 (index)&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter of the encyclopedia centers around domestic and agricultural information, during a time when most people were farmers. Most of the plates show farm equipment.

An American edition was expanded to 5 volumes octavo by James Mease and published in 1803 in Philadelphia by W. Y. Birch and Abraham Small. Roughly 500 pages per volume, and 35 plates total.

A second American edition was condensed to 3 volumes octavo by Thomas Cooper and published in 1821 in Philadelphia by Abraham Small. Roughly 600 pages per volume.

The early editions of this book contained 3,000 short pithy descriptions and was one of a set of 20 books.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;
The book was a popular addition to the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] (and later post-Victorian) home.

[[Agatha Christie]] used ''Enquire Within Upon Everything'' as an important clue in the  [[Hercule Poirot]] detective novel, ''[[Hallowe'en Party]]''.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

The '''''Explanatory dictionary of the Georgian language''''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული ენის განმარტებითი ლექსიკონი}}) is one of major explanatory dictionaries of the [[Georgian language]]. It consists of eight volumes and contains nearly 115,000 words. The editor in chief was [[Arnold Chikobava]]. It was produced since 1950 until 1964, and about 150 scientists worked on it. It was the first Georgian dictionary which had a systematic documentation for each word. The words are arranged alphabetically. The first volume contains a brief description of the grammar of Georgian.

'''Sir Gervase Helwys''' (1 September 1561 – 20 November 1615), also known as '''Jervis Yelwys''', was a [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] found guilty of complicity in the murder of Sir [[Thomas Overbury]] and hanged in 1615. The scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished [[James I of England|King James I]]'s court with an image of corruption and depravity. There are variations in the spelling of Helwys: Helwis, Helwiss, Helewyse, Helwysse, Yelwys, Ellowis, Elwys, Elwis, Elvis, Elwes, and Elwaies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/villagepacks/broxtowehall.htm|title=Nottinghamshire history &gt; Articles &gt; Broxtowe Hall|publisher=nottshistory.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gervase Helwys was born on 1 September 1561 in [[Saundby]], Nottinghamshire, the first child of parents John Helwys (1535–1600) and Mary Blagden of [[Thames Ditton]]. His cousin, [[Thomas Helwys]] (1575–1616), one of the joint founders, with John Smyth, of the [[Baptist]] denomination, was thrown into [[Newgate Prison]] by the king for libel, where he died in 1616. As a student Helwys studied law at [[Middle Temple]] after completing his studies at [[New Inn Hall|New Inn]], at the [[University of Oxford]]. His uncle, Geoffrey Helwys, a successful merchant, Alderman and Sheriff of London, was also a member of the Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=John Hutchinson |date=1 January 2003 |title=A Catalogue of Notable Middle Templars: With Brief Biographical Notices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fw-3QC98d_UC&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=2013-08-27 |publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-58477-323-8 |pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he married Mary Brooke, daughter of Thomas Brooke of [[Norfolk]].

On 7 May 1603, Helwys was knighted by King James I. A decade later, on 6 May 1613, he was appointed by the same king as [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] after being recommended to the post by [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Howard, Henry (1540-1614)|volume=28|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was common practice at the time, Helwys had to pay for the title, in this instance £2,000; £1,400 going to Northampton and £300 to [[Sir Thomas Monson, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Monson]], Master of the Armory in the Tower and a friend of Helwys'.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Gunpowder Plot" by Fiona Bengtsen; Victoria, B.C.: Trafford, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there, Helwys had been involved on 10 March 1614 in the "examination" of prisoner Edmond Peacham, a rector of [[Hinton St George|Hinton St. George]] who had been charged with having written a libel against the king,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Peacham, Edmond|volume=44|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of the king's [[Attorney general]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;''"The letters and the life of Francis Bacon including all his occasional works: namely letters, speeches, tracts, state papers, memorials, devices and all authentic writings not already printed among his philosophical, literary, or professional works"'' by Francis Bacon; James Spedding. London: Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1861–1874.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overbury Affair==
[[File:Sir thomas overbury.jpg|left|thumbnail|150px|Portrait of [[Sir Thomas Overbury]] by Renold Elstracke, c. 1615-1616]]
When his [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], the [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]], died in 1612, the king had the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with his young [[Scottish people|Scottish]] favourite, [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]] carrying out many of Salisbury's former duties. But James's inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Willson, pp 334–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Howard party, consisting of Henry Howard; [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk]]; his son-in-law [[William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury]]; [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], and [[Thomas Lake|Sir Thomas Lake]], soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Overbury for assistance with government papers,&lt;ref&gt;Willson, p 349; Perry, p 105.&lt;/ref&gt; fell into the Howard camp. He had done this after beginning an affair with the married [[Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset|Frances Howard, Countess of Essex]], daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, whom James assisted in securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, p 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing as Overbury distrusted the Howards and still had Carr's ear, he tried to prevent the marriage. To remove him from court, the Howard faction manipulated Overbury into seeming to be disrespectful to the [[Anne of Denmark|queen]]. Then it was no small feat to persuade the king to offer Overbury an assignment as ambassador to the court of Tsar [[Michael of Russia]], with the Howards being fully aware that his refusal would be seen as tantamount to treason. The plan worked and Overbury declined, sensing the urgency to remain in England and at his friend's side. On 22 April 1613, Overbury was placed in the Tower at the king's "request",&lt;ref&gt;Willson, p 342.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually dying there five months later on 15 September "of natural causes.”

In July 1615, after rumours began circulating at court, it subsequently emerged that Overbury had in fact been poisoned&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, p 146; Barroll, Anna of Denmark, p 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofsirroge00wilbrich/journalofsirroge00wilbrich_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The journal of Sir Roger Wilbraham, solicitor-general in Ireland and master of requests, for the years 1593–1616, together with notes in another hand, for the years 1642–1649"|publisher=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery of the crime being revealed by a boy in the employment of one of the apothecaries responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/toweroflondon00benhuoft/toweroflondon00benhuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of 'The Tower of London'|publisher=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations were made and proofs were abundantly forthcoming. At a dinner in [[Whitehall]] with the king's new Secretary of State, [[Ralph Winwood|Sir Ralph Winwood]], Helwys admitted that he suspected there might have been some foul play.&lt;ref&gt;''"The court of King James the First"'' by Godfrey Goodman, pp. 143&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately became suspect after correspondence surfaced between himself and Northampton concerning Overbury's conduct and health. In his letters to Helwys Northampton wrote with contempt of Overbury and expressed a desire that his own name should not be mentioned in connection with his imprisonment. Northampton also introduced one of the royal physicians, [[John Craig (physician)|John Craig]], to Helwys to report on the prisoner's health. Helwys also made the mistake of corresponding with Howard, the chief suspect in Overbury's poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/advicetoasonprec013268mbp/advicetoasonprec013268mbp_djvu.txt|title=Full text of 'Advice to a Son Precepts of Lord Burghley Sir Walter Raleigh And Francis Osborne'|publisher=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the matter was judicially investigated, Helwys felt his political enemies trying to credit him with a direct hand in the murder. On 1 October 1615, he was arrested and forced to exchange his lodgings for a cell in the Tower.

==Trial and execution==
[[Image:Hollar, Vaclav - Poprava hrabete ze Straffordu.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|Engraving depicting an execution at [[Tower Hill]] c. 1641]]
In 1615, Helwys was put on trial, along with Monson, Richard Weston (the gaoler and ex-servant of Howard and Carr's), [[Mrs Anne Turner]] (widow of a fashionable London doctor), and a disreputable apothecary named James Franklin, in [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], London for complicity in the murder of Overbury. The hearings were presided over by [[Sir Edward Coke]], [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], and Sir Francis Bacon. It was ruled that "poisons" had been "administered" in the form of "jellies" and "tarts" by Weston, Turner and Franklin at the direction of Frances Howard.

When Howard and Carr were tried she admitted a part in the murder, but her husband did not. Fearing what Carr might say about him in court, James repeatedly sent messages to the Tower pleading with him to admit his guilt in return for a pardon. "It is easy to be seen that he would threaten me with laying an aspersion upon me of being, in some sort, accessory to his crime."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Carr refused and the couple were found guilty and sentenced to death. The king commuted their sentence to life imprisonment and they were eventually pardoned along with Monson.

The only evidence against Helwys was that of Franklin, who asserted that the Lieutenant had been in league with Frances Howard. Through letters to Howard that were not read at the hearings, it was clear that Helwys initially had no idea that Overbury was being poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/andrew-bisset/essays-on-historical-truth-ssi/page-33-essays-on-historical-truth-ssi.shtml|title=Read the eBook Essays on historical truth by Andrew Bisset online for free (page 33 of 40)|first=Denis Larionov &amp; Alexander|last=Zhulin|publisher=ebooksread.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed later that he had entertained suspicions of this after discovering earlier attempts to poison Overbury on the part of the gaoler Weston, who had been placed in that position at the suggestion of Northampton. Considering the powerful people protecting Weston, and assuming him, indeed, to be no less than their agent, Helwys had hesitated to interfere in what seemed to him to be a matter of state. He had, however, done his utmost surreptitiously to save Overbury. It was plain both from Weston's statements and from Helwys' own, that the Lieutenant had done his very best to defeat the Turner-Essex-Northampton plot to poison his prisoner, throwing away the "rosalgar" and later "draughts", as well as substituting food for Overbury from his own kitchen for that "sent in" by Turner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He had made Weston recognise the "hideousness" of what he had done and made him promise to desist from further attempts upon the prisoner's life. Although Helwys maintained that he kept a close watch on Overbury after this event, he nevertheless suspected that the "thing was done" the moment his vigilance had been relaxed.

On 18 November, – Helwys, Weston, Turner and Franklin – were found guilty as "accessories before the fact done" and, lacking powerful connections, were sentenced to death. On the day of his execution on the following Monday, 20 November at [[Tower Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/tower.html |title=Confirmed executions at the Tower of London |publisher=capitalpunishmentuk.org |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helwys gave an impassioned speech to the crowd in attendance protesting his innocence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I was so far from thinking myself foul in the fact, that until these two Gentlemen, (Doctor Felton and Doctor Whiting, the physicians for my soul) told me how deeply I had imbrued my hands in the blood of (Overbury) making me, by God’s law, as guilty in the concealing (of it) as if I had been a personal actor in it. Till then... I held myself ignorant of the deed, and my conscience so clear, that I did never ask God forgiveness...''&lt;ref&gt;''"The lieutenant of the Tower his speech and repentance, at the time of his death who was executed vpon Tower Hill, on the 20. day of Nouember, 1615 : together with a meditation and vow of his that hee made not long before he dyed"'' by Sir Gervase Helwys. Published in 1615, Printed by G. Eld for Na. Butter, and are to be sold at his shop neere Saint Austines Gate (London)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He did, however, beg God's forgiveness for both his guilt in the crime and for being “much addicted" to gambling. Helwys left behind him eight children with his wife Mary: William, Thomas, Nathaniel Gervase John, Elizabeth Bridget, Maria, Jane, Anna and Francesca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=1868 |title=Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cs4KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 |accessdate=2013-08-27 |publisher=Hamilton, Adams, and Company |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5083">[[File:Royal Monogram of King Haakon VII of Norway.svg|thumb|200px|The monogram.]]

'''H7''' was the [[royal cypher]] of the Norwegian [[Monarchy of Norway|head of state]], [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], who reigned from 1905 to 1957. When [[Operation Weserübung|Germany invaded Norway]] in 1940 as a part of [[World War II]], the [[Norwegian royal family|royal family]] fled the country and Haakon VII later spearheaded the Norwegian resistance in-exile in the [[United Kingdom]]. H7 became one of several symbols used by the [[Norwegian people|Norwegian populace]] to mark solidarity with and loyalty to the King, and adherence to the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].

==World War II==
According to [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Bjørn Tore Godal]], speaking at the 50th anniversary for [[Victory in Europe Day]], Norway was the only country in which the initials of the head of state became a resistance symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Varm hyldning av motstandskongen|last=Grue|first=Øystein|date=8 May 1995|work=Aftenposten Aften|pages=3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monogram, with H superimposed on 7, was drawn on fences, walls, houses, roads, in the snow and otherwise in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Det hendte|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=26 July 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in illegal art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Postkortet i våpenløs kamp mot den tyske okkupasjonsmakt|last=Lie|first=Wenche|date=23 December 1983|work=Aftenposten Aften|pages=3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coins with the H7 symbol were also attached to clothes.&lt;ref name=kd94&gt;{{cite book|title=Krigens dagbok|chapter=Hirden i sammestøt|page=94| editor=[[Per Voksø|Voksø, Per]] |publisher=Det Beste |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |year=1984 |isbn=82-7010-166-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such coins were confiscated by the Nazi authorities.&lt;ref name=dahl&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|title="Dette er London". NRK i krig 1940–1945|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|year=1978|pages=164–165|isbn=82-02-03929-0|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the private sphere, among others on the inside of blinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nøkleby|first=Berit|author2=Ellingsen, Ane|authorlink=Berit Nøkleby|title=Norge i krig i bilder|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|date=209|page=233|isbn=978-82-03-23656-3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A symbol used in a similar way was the "V for victory", [[V sign#The V campaign and the victory/freedom sign|as popularised by Winston Churchill]]. However, the Axis attempted to usurp this sign, supposedly with the new meaning of "V for [[Victoria (mythology)|Viktoria]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ordmagikere|last=Eidem|first=Odd|authorlink=Odd Eidem|date=18 February 1984|work=Aftenposten Aften|pages=7|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this campaign was successful in most of [[Nazi-occupied Europe]], it failed in Norway: Despite continued official use, the opposition also adopted the V-sign as an abbreviation of ''{{lang|de|verlieren}}'' (German for "to lose"), and filled in the Nazi V's with the H7 monogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore fights the Nazis: humor in occupied Norway, 1940-1945|first=Kathleen|last=Stokker|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=1997|isbn=0-299-15444-0|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this popularized the use of H7, which was soon drawn without the V.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;

The act of drawing or creating a H7 symbol in [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German-occupied Norway]] was punishable by imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meldinger fra Norge|last=Hjeltnes|first=Guri|authorlink=Guri Hjeltnes|date=7 April 2008|work=VG|pages=2|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible sanction was terror from Nazi paramilitary groups, to which the police were ordered not to respond.&lt;ref name=kd94/&gt;

==Post-war use==
The symbol was also evoked after World War II to have a commemorative effect, among others at the first post-war [[Holmenkollen ski jump|Holmenkollen ski jump event]], when the symbol was formed in large scale by people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kongenes bakke og bakkenes konge|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=11 March 1993|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used on post-war coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25.000 kroner for en 50-øre|last=Tagesen|first=Dan|date=13 September 2007|work=Stavanger Aftenblad|pages=|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hortus Cantabrigiensis''''' is a catalogue of plants grown in the [[Cambridge Botanic Garden|Walkerian Botanic Garden]], a forerunner of the present Botanic Garden of [[Cambridge University]], originally compiled by its first curator [[James Donn]] and published in 1796. A further 12 editions were published, the last in 1845, long after Donn's death.&lt;ref name=Donn&gt;[https://archive.org/details/hortuscantabrig00gardgoog Donn, J. (1809).

The '''''Hortus Sanitatis''''' (also written '''Ortus'''; [[Latin]] for '''''The Garden of Health'''''), the first [[natural history]] [[encyclopaedia]],&lt;ref name=Attenborough&gt;{{cite web |last1=Attenborough |first1=David |title=Ortus sanitatis |url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-INC-00003-A-00001-00008-00037 |publisher=Cambridge Digital Library |access-date=16 October 2014 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published by Jacob Meydenbach in [[Mainz]], Germany in 1491.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite web |title=Ortus sanitatis |url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-INC-00003-A-00001-00008-00037 |publisher=Cambridge Digital Library |access-date=16 October 2014 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It describes species in the natural world along with their [[pharmacology|medicinal uses]] and modes of preparation.{{r|OpenLibrary}} It is in part an extended Latin translation of the ''German Herbarius'', the ''Gart der Gesundheit'' of Peter Schöffer, published in 1485 but, unlike that earlier work, also deals with animals, birds, fish and stones.{{sfnp|Arber|2010|p=28|ps=none}} The author does not restrict himself to dealing only with real creatures, but also includes accounts of [[mythical animals]] such as the [[dragon]], [[harpy]], [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], [[myrmecoleon]], [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and [[zitiron]].{{sfnp|Arber|2010|pp=34–35|ps=none}}

==Context==
The ''Hortus Sanitatis'' was the third important [[herbal]] to be printed in Mainz before 1500. The first two were by [[Peter Schoeffer]], his Latin ''Herbarius'' in 1484, followed by an updated and enlarged German version in 1485.{{sfnp|Raphael|1986|p=249|ps=none}}

==Publication history==
[[File:Ortus 1497 frontispice.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of 1497 edition]]
The first edition of ''Hortus Sanitatis'' was printed by Jacob Meydenbach in Mainz, Germany in 1485, with a second edition in 1491 and a third in 1497. A French edition by [[Antoine Vérard]] was printed in Paris in about 1500, under the title ''Ortus sanitatis translate de latin en francois''.{{sfnp|Arber|2010|p=35|ps=none}} The last complete copy of ''Hortus Sanitatis'' appeared in about 1539, printed by Phillipe le Noir and sold in Paris under the title of ''Le jardin de sante''.{{sfnp|Arber|2010|p=36|ps=none}}

An English version of extracts from the ''Hortus'', the ''Noble lyfe &amp; natures of man, of bestes, serpentys, fowles &amp; fisshes'', was produced in 1491 by Laurence Andrew (fl. 1510–1537). A facsimile edition of this was published in London in 1954 by B. Quaritch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An early English version of Hortus sanitatis : a recent bibliographical discovery by Noel Hudson |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21724021?selectedversion=NBD2964329 |publisher=NLA.gov.au |access-date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lost mines''' are a popular form of lost [[treasure]] legend.  The mine involved is usually of a high-value commodity such as [[gold]], [[silver]] or [[diamonds]].  Often there is a [[treasure map|map]] (sometimes called a "waybill") purportedly showing the location of the mine.  Common reasons given for the mines being lost include:
* The mine is discovered and worked by a recluse who refuses to divulge the location, and dies without revealing the location.
* The mine is worked by native peoples who refuse to divulge the location to others.
* The mineral deposit is discovered in a remote location, and upon returning to the area the discoverer cannot find it again.
* The discoverer dies of hunger, thirst, or exposure shortly after discovering the deposit, and his body is found with rich ore specimens in his possession.
* The discoverers are killed by hostile natives.  Sometimes the natives cover up the entrance to the mine.  
* In Spanish colonies in the New World, many lost mines were supposedly worked under the direction of [[Jesuit]] priests before their [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|sudden expulsion]] in 1767.

Some lost mine legends have a historical basis; some have none.  But the lure of lost mine legends is attested by the many books on the subject, and the popularity of publications such as [[Lost Treasure (magazine)|''Lost Treasure'']] magazine.

The '''Lost Padre mine''' is a [[List of lost mines|lost mine]] believed to be located in [[Southern California]], within the borders of the [[San Emigdio]] municipality in [[Ventura County, California|Northern Ventura County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rrchs.org/mininghistory.htm|title=The Ridge Route Communities Historical Society: Local Mining History |language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to historical accounts, the Lost Padre mine was created and operated by [[Missionary|Catholic missionaries]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hudnall, Wang|first1=Ken, Connie|title=Spirits Of The Border: The History And Mystery Of Ft. Bliss Texas|pages=14|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WmFAyV_fBvcC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=2A1UhwgMUR&amp;dq=%22lost%20padre%20mine%22%20catholic%20missionaries&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lost%20padre%20mine%22%20catholic%20missionaries&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the mine was in operation anywhere between the late [[17th century|17th]] and early [[19th century]]. However, earlier estimates are likely to be more accurate, due to indications that the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests who funded the creation of the mine were dignitaries of [[Spain]] or Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The mine is reportedly home to large deposits of unrefined gold and silver, coming from veins of quartz pushed into the Southern California mountains by glaciers roughly 1.8 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glaciers.research.pdx.edu/glaciers-california|title=Glaciers of California {{!}} Glaciers of the American West|website=glaciers.research.pdx.edu|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is believed that the bodies of as many as 20 workers, mostly Native Americans, were buried in a cave-in.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Upon its reported rediscovery in the 1800s, many of those seeking to return to the mine were killed in riding accidents on the way to the mine, either being thrown from their horses or falling down the cliffs of the [[San Emigdio Mountains|San Emigdio]] region.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Twentieth century==

Throughout the [[20th century]], several groups have searched for the mine. The most notable and prominent example is the Edwards family. John Edwards has become the primary source of researchers, as his father and grandfather were both reportedly experts on the topic. Edwards' grandfather had reportedly rediscovered the mine shortly after [[World War I]], only disclosing its general vicinity within Doc Williams Canyon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topozone.com/california/kern-ca/valley/doc-williams-canyon/|title=Doc Williams Canyon Topo Map, Kern County CA (Eagle Rest Peak Area)|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} near [[Eagle Rest Peak]] in the mountains of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]].

==Recent==
The most recent attempt at rediscovery is by [[Jake Allard]], a local college student of [[Anthropology]] at [[Moorpark College]]. Allard has claimed to have made a total of 6 expeditions in the regions described by Edwards, following the San Emigdio Creek through the various canyons. During the most successful expedition, he was accompanied by three colleagues from Moorpark College and [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. The former include colleagues Austin Clarizio, Collin Chamberlain, and Roman Kaufman.

Allard believes the vicinity outlined by Edwards is the only feasible option, based on clues and context given in historical records, including nearby veins of silver and quartz, as well as gold dust discovered during the search. Artifacts discovered by Allard back up this claim. These include a late 18th or mid 19th-century mining tool, although its origins have not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scahome.org/counties/ventura/|title=Ventura {{!}} Society for California Archaeology|website=scahome.org|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miningartifacts.homestead.com/|title=Mining Artifacts|website=miningartifacts.homestead.com|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of hours of charting and mapping have resulted in the location of the mine being narrowed down to roughly 8 square miles. As of May 2017, Jake Allard has discovered one physical mine in the vicinity of Eagle Rest Peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/JakeAllard/status/862558390274347008|title=Jake Allard on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being a part of the Lost Padre mine, it shows promise that an [[Vein (geology)|exposed vein of ore]] may be within a reasonable distance. Allard argues that an open pit mining operation would be the most probable structure of the mine, given the location and time it was operated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Red Rock Canyon Mine==
Some theories suggest the Red Rock Canyon mine, located near [[Castaic, California|Castaic]], is actually an offshoot vein of the Lost Padre mine. However, there are several issues with this claim. The Red Rock mine, for example, was discovered in the 19th century and worked until 1935, over one hundred years after the Lost Padre mine was said to be in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lagoldmines.com/index.php?page=532670.txt|title=Gold Mines of Los Angeles County|website=www.lagoldmines.com|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, including Jake Allard, dispute this claim, having mapped a path to the Red Rock mine in 2016 in an attempt to collect evidence of late Mexican or early American creation of the Red Rock Canyon mine, as opposed to by Jesuit missionaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==In popular culture==
A film has been produced, entitled ''Lost Padre Mine'', directed by David Noble. The film centers on the legend of the Lost Padre mine, following the character of Wayne Braddock, a treasure hunter who arrives in El Paso in search of missing gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Lost Padre Mine (2017)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4730632/|accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Manhattan''''' is a 1979 American [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Woody Allen]] and produced by [[Charles H. Joffe]]. The screenplay was written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]]. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl ([[Mariel Hemingway]]) but falls in love with his best friend's ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]) mistress ([[Diane Keaton]]). [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] also star.

''Manhattan'' was filmed in [[black-and-white]] and [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and presently used aspect ratios|2.35:1 widescreen]]. The film  features music composed by [[George Gershwin]], including ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which inspired the idea behind the film. Allen described the film as a combination of his previous two films, ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]]''.&lt;ref name="combo" /&gt;

The film was met with widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Hemingway and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (after adjusting for inflation). Often considered one of Allen's best films,&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/79388/Woody-Allen/biography Woody Allen – Biography] by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://altscreen.com/01/22/2012/saturday-editors-pick-manhattan-1979/ Article] in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' by [[Bilge Ebiri]] on AFI Top 100&lt;/ref&gt; it ranks 46th on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list and number 63 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies". In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film "culturally significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
The film opens with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of images of [[Manhattan]] and other parts of [[New York City]] accompanied by [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', with Isaac Davis ([[Woody Allen]]) narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer dealing with the women in his life who quits his unfulfilling job. He is dating Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), a 17-year-old girl attending the [[Dalton School]]. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie ([[Diane Keaton]]). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah ([[Wallace Shawn]]), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis ([[Meryl Streep]]) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since [[Coming out|come out of the closet]] as a [[lesbian]] and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).

When Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted by [[Bella Abzug]] (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through [[Central Park]].

After Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book ''Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood''. Emily proceeds to read passages of the book, and even discusses an incident covered in the book of a [[Threesome|ménage à trois]] Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who stoically responds about the book, and the film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac responds by discussing Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily, but Yale told her that Isaac introduced Mary to him.

In the [[dénouement]], Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make "life worth living". When he finds himself saying "Tracy's face", he sets down the microphone. He leaves his apartment and sets out on foot for Tracy's. He arrives at the lobby of her family's apartment just as she is leaving for London. He says that she does not have to go and that he does not want "that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that "not everybody gets corrupted" before saying "you have to have a little faith in people." He gives her a slight smile, with a final coy look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' playing again. An instrumental version of "[[Embraceable You]]" plays over the credits.

==Production==

===Development===
According to Allen, the idea for ''Manhattan'' originated from his love of [[George Gershwin]]'s music.  He was listening to one of the composer's albums of overtures and thought, "this would be a beautiful thing to make ... a movie in black and white ... a romantic movie".&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1996|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen has said that ''Manhattan'' was "like a mixture of what I was trying to do with ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]].''"&lt;ref name="combo"&gt;{{harvnb|Brode|1987|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said that his film deals with the problem of people trying to live a decent existence in an essentially junk-obsessed contemporary culture without selling out, admitting that he himself could conceive of giving away all of his "possessions to charity and living in much more modest circumstances," and adding that he has "rationalized [his] way out of it so far, but [he] could conceive of doing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rich | first = Frank | title = An Interview with Woody |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date = April 30, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to actress [[Stacey Nelkin]], ''Manhattan'' was based on her romantic relationship with Woody Allen.  Her bit part in ''Annie Hall'' ended up on the cutting-room floor, and their relationship started when she was 17 years old and a student at New York’s [[Stuyvesant High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1302062400|title=Stacey Nelkin: Actress, Sexpert – ''The Howard Stern Show'' for April 7, 2011|date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen did not publicly acknowledge the relationship until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Woody|title=Woody Allen Speaks Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion&amp;_r=0|accessdate=Feb 13, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=Feb 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Allen talked to cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]] about how fun it would be to shoot the film in [[Black-and-white|black and white]], [[Panavision]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (2.35:1) because it would give "a great look at New York City, which is sort of one of the characters in the film".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bjorkman |1995|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen decided to shoot his film in black and white because that was how he remembered it from when he was small. "Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York." He always heard Gershwin music with it, too. In ''Manhattan'' he really thinks that he and Willis succeeded in showing the city. "When seeing it there on that big screen, it's really decadent".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1980|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The picture was shot on location with the exception of some of the scenes in the planetarium which were filmed on a set.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bjorkman |1995|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:woody allen manhattan.jpg|thumb|The bridge shot]]
The famous bridge shot was done at five in the morning.&lt;ref name="Willis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willis|first=Gordon|title=Made in ''Manhattan''|work=Moviemaker|pages=|publisher=|date=April 6, 2004|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/magazine/issues/54/manhattan.html|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production had to bring their own bench as there were no park benches at the location.&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"&gt;{{cite video|people=Weide, Robert B. (Director)|year=2011|title=Woody Allen: A Documentary|medium=Television|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge had two sets of necklace lights on a timer controlled by the city. When the sun came up, the bridge lights went off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on and that he would let them know when they got the shot. Afterwards, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out, and Allen was forced to use that take.&lt;ref name="Willis" /&gt;

After finishing the film, Allen was very unhappy with it and asked United Artists not to release it.  He offered to make a film for free instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bjorkman |1995|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later said: "I just thought to myself, 'At this point in my life, if this is the best I can do, they shouldn't give me money to make movies.'"&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary" /&gt;

===Music===

===Critical response===
The film received largely positive reviews and currently holds a rating of 95% "Certified Fresh" on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on reviews from 59 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Manhattan''|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|date=May 2, 1979|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/manhattan/|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold, in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote: "''Manhattan'' has comic integrity in part because Allen is now making jokes at the expense of his own [[parochialism]]. There's no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on the phonies and sellouts decorating the Hollywood landscape. The result appears to be a more authentic and magnanimous comic perception of human vanity and foolhardiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Gary|title=Woody Allen's Comic High: A Delightful and Deluxe Rhapsody of Wry Romance|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date =May 2, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, Jack Kroll wrote: "Allen's growth in every department is lovely to behold. He gets excellent performances from his cast. The increasing visual beauty of his films is part of their grace and sweetness, their balance between Allen's yearning romanticism and his tough eye for the fatuous and sentimental – a balance also expressed in his best screen play [''sic''] yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Jack|title=Woody's Big Apple|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=April 30, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote, "Diane Keaton gives us a fresh and nicely edged New York intellectual.

Hoberman]] wrote in ''[[The Village Voice]]'': "The New York City that Woody so tediously defended in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was in crisis. And so he imagined an improved version.

==Home release==
Allen wanted to preserve Willis's [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]s and insisted that the aspect ratio be preserved when the film was released on video (an unusual request in a time when widescreen films were normally [[pan and scan|panned and scanned]] for TV and video release).  As a result, all copies of the film on video (and most television broadcasts) were [[letterbox]]ed, originally with a gray border.&lt;ref name="fox" /&gt;

''Manhattan'' was first released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on January 24, 2012, alongside Allen's 1977 film ''Annie Hall''.&lt;ref name="blurrayrelease"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20562561,00.html|title=''Annie Hall'' Review|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 24, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both releases included the films' original theatrical trailer.&lt;ref name="blurrayrelease" /&gt;

==Legacy==
In her memoir ''Out Came the Sun'' (2015), Hemingway detailed Allen's visit to her family home in [[Ketchum, Idaho]] upon completion of filming. After intimating that he wanted to take her to [[Paris]], Hemingway warned her parents “that I didn’t know what the arrangement was going to be, that I wasn’t sure if I was even going to have my own room. Woody hadn’t said that. He hadn’t even hinted it. But I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn’t. They kept lightly encouraging me.” When Hemingway stipulated the procurement of a separate hotel room, Allen "called for his private jet the next morning and left Idaho."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/03/25/exclusive-young-mariel-hemingway-had-to-rebuff-woody-allens-advances.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/woody-allen-mariel-hemingway-manhattan&lt;/ref&gt; Following publication of the anecdote, conservative [[pundit]] and film critic [[John Podhoretz]] characterized Allen as a "repugnant [[ephebophile]]" on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/580660744385130496&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manhattan''{{'}}s screenplay was performed in front of a live audience at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] on November 15, 2012, as part of [[Jason Reitman]]'s Live Read series. Actors read the script, narrowed to six speaking parts, and still photographs from the movie were projected behind them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/11/09/jason-reitman-woody-allen-manhattan-live-read/ "Jason Reitman to re-create Woody Allen's ''Manhattan'' in live-read event"] by Anthony Breznican, ''Entertainment Weekly'', November 9, 2012.

'''''Nationalencyklopedin''''' ({{IPA-sv|natɧʊ²nɑːlɛnsʏklʊpɛˌdiːn|lang}}), abbreviated '''NE''', is a comprehensive contemporary [[Swedish language|Swedish-language]] [[encyclopedia]], initiated by a favourable loan from the [[Government of Sweden]] of 17 million [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] in 1980, which was repaid by December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uppslag.psilander.se/ne.htm Svenska uppslagsverk: Nationalencyklopedin], accessed on July 22, 2009 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printed version consists of 20 volumes with 172,000 articles; the [[Internet]] version comprises 260,000 articles (as of June 2005).

==History==
The project was born in 1980, when a government committee suggested that negotiations be initiated with various [[publisher]]s. This stage was finished in August 1985, when {{ill|Bra Böcker|sv}} in [[Höganäs]] became the publisher responsible for the project. The project specifications were for a modern reference work based on a [[science|scientific]] [[paradigm]] incorporating [[gender]] and [[natural environment|environment]]al issues.

Pre-orders for the work were unprecedented; before the first volume was published in December 1989, 54,000 customers had ordered the encyclopedia. The last volume came out in 1996, with three supplemental volumes in 2000.

Associated with the ''Nationalencyklopedin'' project are also:
*''NE:s Ordbok'', a [[dictionary]] in three volumes (1995–1996)
*''NE:s Årsband'', complementary volumes concerning current events and fast changing information distributed annually since 1997
*''NE:s Sverigeatlas'', an atlas of [[Sweden]] (1998)
*''NE:s Världsatlas'', a world atlas (1998)
*''NE-spelet'', a quiz game with 8,000 questions (1999)

In 1997, the first [[Digital data|digital]] form of the encyclopedia was released on 6 [[CD-ROM]]s (later on [[DVD]] as well), and in 2000 as an [[Internet]] [[subscription]] service. The online version contains the dictionary as well as an updated version of the original encyclopedia. It has 356,000 entries, 183,000 of which are encyclopedic articles. The service has been completed with several features not available in the printed version, such as a Swedish–English dictionary.

[[File:Stephenson railway track layout.JPG|thumb|Track layout diagram of the railway's yard and station loops.]]
The '''North Tyneside Steam Railway''' and '''Stephenson Railway Museum''' are visitor attractions in [[North Tyneside]], [[North East England]]. The museum and railway workshops share a building on Middle Engine Lane adjacent to the Silverlink Retail Park. The railway is a standard gauge line, running south for {{convert|2|mi}} from the museum to [[Percy Main]]. The railway is operated by the North Tyneside Steam Railway Association (NTSRA). The museum is managed by [[Tyne and Wear Museums]] on behalf of [[North Tyneside Council]].

The railway runs along the alignment of various former coal wagonways, which were later used by the Tyne and Wear Metro Test Centre; the museum and workshop building used to be the test facility. The museum is dedicated to the railway pioneers [[George Stephenson]] and his son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]], with one of George's early locomotives, ''Billy'', housed in the museum.

==History==

===Horse drawn and rope hauled waggonways===
[[File:Area map of the North Tyneside Steam Railway &amp; Stephenson Railway Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The railway's location (centre), on the north bank the River Tyne]]
As the early coal seams of the [[Northumberland Coalfield]] near the [[River Tyne]] were exhausted, [[waggonway]]s were laid to serve pits sunk further north. Coal would be unloaded into colliers (coal transport ships) via [[staithes]]. The first wagonways used wooden waggons on wooden rails drawn by horses. The first traffic began in 1755 on a line from [[Shiremoor]] to Hayhole staithes, and was soon followed by more lines. Wooden rails were eventually replaced by wrought iron. Rope haulage was introduced from 1821, with the museum site being at the top of Prospect Hill. By the 1820s coal was coming from pits further to the north in [[Seghill]], [[Backworth]] and [[Cramlington]], while a pit at [[Murton, Tyne and Wear|Murton]] near Shiremoor had also been added. In 1826 it also became the preferred route for coal coming from [[Fawdon]] to the west, to make it unnecessary to use [[Keelman|keel boats]] further upriver.&lt;ref name=linehistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsra.org.uk/ |title=Line History |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=North Tyneside Steam Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic increased as further pits opened, and the corridor from Middle Engine Lane down to Percy Main became congested as companies either shared lines or built their own within a hundred yards of each other, depending on which was more convenient. Once they crossed the line of the present A193 Wallsend Road, they fanned out to their respective unloading points. In 1839 the Cramlington wagonway built a new line away from the corridor further to the west, while still passing close to it at the Middle Engine Lane and Percy Main ends. By the 1840s, coal was also coming from [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] and [[Bedlington]] on the east coast, although this ceased after improvements to Blyth harbour in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

The opening of the route to Blyth also saw passenger services being run to Percy Main from 1841, for connections with the [[Newcastle and North Shields Railway]]. These were run by what eventually became the [[Blyth &amp; Tyne Railway]]. Passenger services ceased around 1864 when they opened an alternative route further to the east via Monkseaton (now the present Metro route).&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

===Steam locomotive working &amp; Metro test track===
At its peak, there were four lines on the corridor, with three stationary engines in close proximity to the museum. Having already been in use on other parts of the lines, gradient improvements on the Blyth &amp; Tyne's line allowed it to use [[steam locomotive]]s throughout from the 1850s. Others persisted with rope haulage, the [[Seaton Burn Wagonway]] being the last to convert in 1900.&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

Coal production began to decline after the First World War causing the Seaton Burn wagonway to close in the 1920s; a new route from the Rising Sun colliery to the west did open in 1939, although this was to replace a line on a different route. In the late 1940s the coal and railway companies were nationalised - the lines on the corridor were now controlled by either the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB) or [[British Rail]] (BR) (as the eventual owners of the Blyth &amp; Tyne). Rationalisation saw with the Cramlington line to the west closed in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

As volumes further declined, the last Percy Main staithes closed in 1971, leading to the closure of the NCB lines, although the BR lines persisted. In 1975, the Seaton Burn wagonway alignment was relaid for use by the Tyne and Wear Metro Test Centre, whose {{convert|1.5|mile|adj=on}} test track ran from Middle Engine Lane as far south as the A1058 Coast Road bridges (and north beyond Middle Engine Lane on the Backworth wagonway alignment to West Allotment). The two prototype Metrocars worked out of a two road maintenance shed constructed in Middle Engine Lane. Once the Metro system opened in 1979 the test centre closed and the track infrastructure was dismantled, leaving only the shed. The last BR line (Percy Main to Backworth) closed in 1983 and the tracks were lifted, ending over 200 years of railway use of the corridor.&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

===Museum and heritage railway===
[[File:Stephenson Railway Museum exhibit (2).JPG|thumb|right|A lever frame in the museum]]
In 1982/4 North Tyneside Council acquired the test sheds as the nucleus for a transport museum. A partnership was formed between Tyne and Wear Museums and the Council, to construct a steam hauled [[Heritage railway|passenger railway]] rather than a static transport museum. The North Tyneside Steam Railway Association formed at the site after the [[Monkwearmouth Station Museum]] Association relocated to Middle Engine Lane, bringing with them some items of rolling stock they had been restoring in the [[Monkwearmouth railway station|Monkwearmouth station]]'s goods shed, which was in a deteriorating condition. From 1987, volunteers under supervision conducted the works necessary to relay a single track from the museum to Percy Main. The line was completed in 1989 and the first passenger trains ran in early 1991.&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

In 1994, Tyne and Wear Development Corporation and North Tyneside City Challenge made a grant available to North Tyneside Council to extend the workshops, redesign the museum space and construct a new facilities block. In 2003 the facilities block was further modified to improve educational and toilet facilities.&lt;ref name=linehistory/&gt;

In 2007, the Tyne and Wear Museums and North Tyneside Council's head of cultural services have submitted plans for feasibility study into developing the museum into a premier North East railway tourist attraction, with period buildings, a link to [[Percy Main Metro station]], and all year round opening.&lt;ref&gt;

==Operation==

===Management===
[[File:North Tyneside Steam Railway (2).JPG|thumb|right|Middle Engine Lane platform, looking north]]
[[File:North Tyneside Railway, at Percy Main - geograph.org.uk - 435704.jpg|thumb|right|No. 1 ''Ted Garret'' at Middle Engine Lane in 2000]]
The museum is managed by [[Tyne and Wear Museums]] on behalf of [[North Tyneside Council]]. Volunteers of the North Tyneside Steam Railway Association (NTSRA) operate the railway and assist with the maintenance and conservation of locomotives and rolling stock. The NTSRA is managed by a committee that meets quarterly and has an Annual General Meeting yearly.

===Infrastructure===
The building on Middle Engine Lane serves as the railway workshop and the museum's indoor exhibition space, the workshop being on the left-hand side. The railway yard has three sidings entering the building from the south, the westernmost being for the workshop, while the two others enter the exhibition space allowing operational stock to be put on display.

The running line of the railway consists of a single track line, with two open-air platforms at either end, both with a passing loop. The northern platform, "Middle Engine Lane", is just south of the museum building. The southern platform, "Percy Main", is immediately south of the point where the Metro crosses the railway, paralleling the length of Brunton Street, to which there is a pedestrian access for passengers wishing to leave the train there.

===Services===
Entry to the museum is free; rides on the trains requires purchase of a ticket.&lt;ref name=visitus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephensonrailwaymuseum.org.uk/visit-us |title=Visit Us |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=Stephenson Railway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum building also contains a gift shop and toilet facilities, and a cafe which opens on certain event days.&lt;ref name=accessinfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephensonrailwaymuseum.org.uk/visit-us/access-information |title=Access Information |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=Stephenson Railway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cafe was renovated in Autumn 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://stephensonrailwaymuseum.org.uk/visit-us/waggonway-tea-room&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is only open at certain times of the year, and passenger trains are only run on some of those days.&lt;ref name=visitus/&gt;&lt;ref name=accessinfo/&gt;

As of 2018 two main timetables are in operation. Green timetable is used on Sundays/Bank Holidays which runs four round trips - departing at 11.30am, 12.30pm, 2.00pm and 3.00pm. The Blue timetable is used on Thursdays during school holidays which runs three round trips - departing at 12.30pm, 1.30pm and 2.30pm. Special event days include a Halloween Special, a 1940s weekend, Beer Festival (Ale by Rail), Winter Warmers and Santa Specials.

===Steam locomotives===

====''Billy''====
''Billy'' was built by George Stephenson in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/ne000031&lt;/ref&gt; one of the various pioneering early designs now known as the [[Killingworth locomotives]], as they were built for use in [[Killingworth]] colliery. It is often referred to as the Killingworth Billy to differentiate it from the [[Puffing Billy (locomotive)|Puffing Billy]] built by William Hedley in 1813 for [[Wylam]] Colliery. Killingworth Billy ran until 1881, when it was presented to the City of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is a stationary exhibit mounted on a short stretch of period track which features the block mounted rails, to remain compatible with horse-drawn trains (horses would be tripped up by conventional sleepers).

====No.1 ''Ted Garret''====
An 0-6-0 Side Tank believed to have been built in 1951 as works number 7683. It is thought she was delivered new to Meaford Power Station to shunt coal waggons. It was one of several of its type supplied to power stations by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Ltd., Forth Banks, Newcastle upon Tyne during the 1950s. They were used to transport coal wagons from mainline sidings into the power station, supplying the boiler-house coal bunkers. Their small diameter wheels enabled heavy loads to be hauled at slow speeds. Larger wheeled versions were supplied when long journeys were needed - for example, some colliery systems. Locally they could be seen working at places in Northumberland and Durham including Ashington, Backworth, Stanley and Consett. This loco was purchased from the Power Station by the East Lancs Railway and hauled their first trains at Bury. After a period in store, she was overhauled at Bury and moved to Tyneside in 1996. In a blue livery, this loco carries the name ''Ted Garrett, JP., DL., MP.''        No.1's overhaul is planned to begin once No.401 is complete.

====Ashington No.5 ''Jackie Milburn''====
This 0-6-0 saddle tank was built in 1939 as works number 1979 by Peckett &amp; Sons of Bristol for Ashington Coal Company which operated one of Britain's most extensive colliery railway systems. In 1939, two identical locomotives were delivered to one of Peckett's standard designs and they received the names Ashington No 5 &amp; Ashington No 6. The former spent her entire industrial career on the railway for which she was built. In 1969 she was sold by the National Coal Board to North Norfolk Preserved Railway because the Ashington system was dieselised. However, she returned to Northumberland in 1991 and was repainted into the "as delivered to Ashington Colliery" livery. The loco was additionally named ''Jackie Milburn'' in honour of the local football hero.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;

====A.No.5====
[[File:Kitson &amp; Co A.No.5.jpg|thumb|right|Kitson A. No. 5 in the hall at the Stephenson Railway Museum]]
''A.No.5'' is an 0-6-0 side tank built in 1883 by [[Kitson and Company]]. It was the last working example of the 1841 patented Stephenson 'long boiler' design, to produce higher steam pressure while retaining a small wheelbase. Unsuited for high speeds, they nonetheless satisfied a need for powerful shunters at certain industrial railways like the Consett Iron and Steel Company. Withdrawn in 1972 it passed to [[Beamish Museum]] and then theTyne &amp; Wear Museums Service at Monkwearmouth Station, Sunderland, where the Monkwearmouth Station Museum Association began its overhaul from a very derelict condition. It returned to steam in 1986. It was overhauled in 1995/6 and again in 2013/14.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kitson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsra.org.uk/a%20no%205.html |title=Consett Iron Company "Long Boiler" Locomotive A No 5 of 1883 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=North Tyneside Steam Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removed from service and placed back on static display in the museum in Summer 2018. 

====No.401 ''Thomas Burt''====
{{Main article|Bagnall 0-6-0ST Victor/Vulcan}}
No. 401 was one of a class of three built for the Steel Company of Wales in 1951 to an advanced specification designed to provide a low maintenance competitor to the diesel shunters emerging. As such it had many advanced features not seen on other industrial steam locomotives. It was sold to Austin Motor Co. Ltd., of Longbridge, Birmingham in 1957 before passing in 1973 to the developing [[West Somerset Railway]]. Once it became surplus to larger locomotives there, the Stephenson Railway Museum purchased 2994 and repainted it from "Kermit the frog" green to a black livery similar to a NER style, and named after local MP [[Thomas Burt]]. It remained in regular use until 2009 when it was placed on static display to await funds for restoration to the firebox/boiler. The locomotive is now nearing the end of an extensive overhaul.

===Diesel locomotives===
[[File:D2078 at the North Tyneside Steam Railway.JPG|thumb|right|D2078 at the workshop pit road door.]]

====No.08915====
No.08915 (originally D4145) used to be of Allerton (AN) depot. It is the main standby for the passenger service should the steam locomotive be undergoing maintenance.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt; Now restored to BR Blue.

====No.D2078====
No.03078 (originally D2078) used to be of Gateshead (GD) depot. It is in a similar livery to Bagnall No.401 but has a North Tyneside Council crest on either side.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;

====No.10====
An early diesel built in the 1950s, Consett Iron and Steelworks No.10 is the last example of in-house production of locomotives by industrial railways in the North East. It was conceived in their Templetown workshops to satisfy a need for a 300&amp;nbsp;hp shunter with mechanical transmission, and was based on a Hunslet design. It was built by reusing many parts from steam locomotives. Eventually redundant to Sentinel's with hydraulic transmission, it was donated in 1976 to the Tyne and wear Museums Service by the work's later owner, the British Steel Corporation. No.10 is operational, however is not frequently used.&lt;ref name=consett10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsra.org.uk/consett.html |title=Consett Iron Company Diesel Locomotive No.10 of 1958 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=North Tyneside Steam Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric locomotives===

====Harton Electric E4====
Electric locomotive No.E4 was built for the [[Harton electric railway|Harton coal system]] at South Shields. It was stored outside for many years, but after a successful lottery bid and sponsorship from the local Siemens Microchip Company has been restored to working order but uses battery power rather than an overhead supply. The batteries are carried in a converted coal wagon. It is used for demonstrations on several days each season.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;

====Motor Luggage Van 3267====
No. 3267 is the sole surviving example of the stock built in 1904 for the [[Tyneside Electrics]] system, the first suburban electric railway in the country. The system used third rail power and trains formed into multiple units. The vehicle was one of two on the system fitted out as vans, with driving cabs at each end. They were used to carry fish and sundry goods, as well as acting as the locomotives for passenger services on the Riverside branch. After withdrawal in 1938, the two vans had their motors removed and were converted to de-icing vans, hauled along the system at night by steam locomotives. It has since been restored to NER livery, and is on static display in the museum, on loan from the National Rail Museum.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;&lt;ref name=electricmotorvan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsra.org.uk/parcels.html |title=North Eastern Railway "Tynemouth" Motor Luggage Van 3267 of 1904 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=North Tyneside Steam Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They wear BR Midland Maroon Livery.&lt;ref name=stock&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsra.org.uk/stock.html |title=Stock |accessdate=7 July 2015 |author=North Tyneside Steam Railway |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828080519/http://www.ntsra.org.uk/stock.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were preserved by the Bluebell Railway between 1973 and 1975, and were obtained by the museum in 1986.&lt;ref name=VCTcoach48015/&gt;&lt;ref name=VCTcoach43010/&gt;&lt;ref name=VCTcoach43172/&gt;

The former [[London and North Eastern Railway]] pigeon van was used to transport racing pigeons. It now sits in the head shunt at Middle Engine Lane awaiting funds for restoration. Formerly No. 70754 and 041366, it was preserved in 1991. A preliminary repaint to resemble its teak finish has since been weather worn.&lt;ref name=VCTpidgeonvan/&gt;

The rail crane (No. DRS 81140, prev. DB 966401, 81/001, 24247) was designed for British Rail.&lt;ref name=VCTcrane/&gt; It has been paired with an ex-LNER wagon converted to a crane runner (No. DE321051, ex-6282, 70130E)&lt;ref name=VCTcranerunner/&gt; It is slowly being restored as a long-term project.

The 20-ton Dogfish Ballast Wagon, Salmon Rail Carrier and 20 Ton wooden brake van all see occasional used on engineering and permanent way trains.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;

The four-plank wagon was built in 1927 as an oil tank wagon for a private owner, presumably an industrial railway. It had the registration number LMSR 103136. It was later reduced to its underframe and sold to the Metro for use on the test track. Having been left on the site, the museum inherited it. They converted it into a four-plank open wagon for use as the carrier for the batteries needed to power the railway's electric locomotive E4. It has been given a fictitious brown livery and markings of "No. 103 Boldon Colliery" on one side and "No. 136 Whitburn Colliery" on the other.&lt;ref name=VCTbattery/&gt;

The 12-ton Vanfit goods van has been converted into a Tool Van which houses an electrical generator.&lt;ref name=stock/&gt;

The TTP flat wagon was built as a Tank Wagon for a private owner.&lt;ref name=VCTflatwagon/&gt;

The 5 ton Type BD van and 12 ton Shocvan are stored in the open, as bodies only, i.e. demounted from their chassis.&lt;ref name=BRcontainer/&gt;&lt;ref name=VCTgoodsvan85/&gt;

==Transport==
The museum site includes a free car park. Bus stops on Middle Engine Lane itself provide direct connections west to [[Haymarket bus station]] in Newcastle or east to [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] bus station via [[Whitley Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Go North East]] Route 309 ''Cobalt Clipper'' bus timetable effective 29 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Other bus stops Atmel Way in the adjacent Cobalt Business Park provide other connections, including to the two nearest Metro stations - [[Percy Main Metro station|Percy Main]] five minutes away to the south and [[Northumberland Park Metro station|Northumberland Park]] ten minutes away to the north (on the southern and northern sections of the North Tyneside loop, respectively).&lt;ref name=accessinfo/&gt;

Nearly all of the railway is paralleled by the [[National Cycle Route 10]], which continues north from Middle Engine Lane along the alignment of the former railway to Backworth. Near the southern end, at the crossing with the A193 Wallsend Road the cycle route diverges from the railway to head south east, past Percy Main Metro, on its way to meet the east-west running [[National Cycle Route 72]] which shadows the River Tyne.

On days when passenger services are in operation, the museum can also be accessed by joining the trains at the southern terminus, Percy Main Metro being around a 300m walk away from the platform through the residential estate of the same name.

From the organizational point of view, OpenO&amp;M is a virtual organization maintained by MIMOSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Standards for Lifecycle Management of Systems for US Army --- a preliminary investigation|url=https://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=822627|publisher=NIST|date=1 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OpenO&amp;M framework==
The OpenO&amp;M framework consists of the following standards for the exchange of Operations &amp; Maintenance data and associated context:
* MIMOSA Open System Architecture for [[Enterprise Application Integration]] (OSA-EAI)
* MIMOSA Open System Architecture for [[Condition-based maintenance|Condition-Based Maintenance]] (OSA-CBM) based on ISO 13374&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines -- Data processing, communication and presentation|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=21832|publisher=ISO|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ANSI/ISA-95]] – Enterprise/Control System Interface Standard 
* ISA-99 – Control System Cyber-Security Standard 
* ISA-OMAC – Open Modular Architecture Controls group standardizing packaging machinery interfaces 
* OPC interface specifications and data transport standards

==Joint working groups==
OpenO&amp;M is composed Joint Working Groups (JWG). These JWG are diverse groups of relevant organizations and subject matter experts.
There are three Joint Working Groups:
* Manufacturing JWG
* Facilities JWG
* Military JWG

The JWG are focused on enabling O&amp;M application interoperability. The goal of the JWG is to offer domain end users a harmonized set of data exchange standards while avoiding duplication of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenO&amp;M|url=http://openoandm.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parts book''' or '''parts catalogue''' or '''Illustrated part catalogue''' is a book published by [[manufacturer]]s which contains the illustrations, [[part number]]s and other relevant data for their products or parts thereof.

Parts books were often also issued as [[microform|microfiche]], though this has fallen out of favour. Now, many manufacturers offer this information digitally in an '''electronic parts catalogue'''. This can be locally installed [[software]], or a centrally hosted [[web application]]. Usually, an electronic parts catalogue enables the user to virtually disassemble the product into its components to identify the required part(s).


In the [[automotive industry]], electronic parts catalogues are also able to access specific vehicle information, usually through an online look-up of the [[vehicle identification number]]. This will identify specific models, allowing the user to correctly identify the required part and its relevant part number.

'''Pendergast v Attorney-General''' (1998) 3 NZ ConvC 192,729 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the availability of [[rectification (law)|rectification]] where a unilateral mistake exists.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pendergast had a perpetual renewable lease with a Domain Board. During a rent renewal, a new lease agreement was prepared. Unbeknown to Pendergast, the Domain Board hid in it a clause giving it a right to cancel the lease.

Pendergast signed the new lease, thinking it was just the rental being changed.

==Held==
Pendergast claim for rectification succeeded. Penlington J said "''This aspect of the law relating to rectification is based on the equitable principle of fair dealing between the parties''"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">'''Primary Source Verification''' (PSV) is a  [[Background check|background screening]] process used to verify credentials directly from the original issuing source  in accordance with global industry best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =JCI Publishes White Paper on Primary Source Verification | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''jointcommissioninternational.org''| date = | url =https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/jci-publishes-white-paper-on-primary-source-verification/ | accessdate =19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Primary Source Verification can be used to verify identification data, education degrees, job histories, practice licenses, [[work permit]]s and [[passport]]s, among other personal, academic or professional documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Primary Source Verification | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''qchp.org.qa''| date = | url =http://www.qchp.org.qa/en/Pages/PrimarysourceVerification.aspx | accessdate =19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an advanced background screening solution, PSV assists public and private organizations across different sectors in making informed decisions regarding applicants and mitigating potential risks which may include, but are not limited to; financial losses, regulatory implications, reputational damages and internal threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Primary Source Verification and Background Screening | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com''| date = | url =https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dataflow-dfgcorp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07132904/The-DataFlow-Group-Services-Manual.pdf | accessdate =19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Source Verification vs  Traditional Verification Procedures==
Compared to traditional verification procedures, PSV guarantees optimal information integrity due to its unique, thorough approach. PSV also verifies content listed on the presented document, as opposed to the superficial authentication of signatures or stamps; a widely common practice that is insufficient to confirming the genuineness of a credential.&lt;ref name="CP"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =The Definitive Guide to Primary Source Verification | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''corp.dataflowgroup.com''| date = | url =https://corp.dataflowgroup.com/blog-post/the-definitive-guide-to-primary-source-verification | accessdate =19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, PSV includes an additional layer of security through a check on the accreditation of the issuing authority, course and mode of study, as well as through a check on whether the staff at the institution is authorized to have issued the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Primary Source Verification | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''credentialamerica.com''| date = | url =http://www.credentialamerica.com/primary-source-verification.html | accessdate =19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, PSV differs from what is known as pre-employment screening, which is carried out for compliance purposes and is not necessarily based on the actual certificate issued officially against the information submitted by the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Sharon  | first =Matienzo | title =Primary Source Verification (PSV) and DataFlow – A Primer | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''blog.trueprofile.io''| date =29 March 2017 | url =https://blog.trueprofile.io/primary-source-verification-psv-dataflow-primer/ | accessdate =19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ranking''' is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either 'ranked higher than', 'ranked lower than' or 'ranked equal to' the second.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ranking&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[order theory|mathematics]], this is known as a [[Strict weak ordering#Total preorders|weak order or total preorder]] of objects. It is not necessarily a [[total order]] of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally ordered. For example, materials are totally preordered by [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]], while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie.

By reducing detailed measures to a sequence of [[ordinal numbers]], rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malara|first=Zbigniew|last2=Miśko|first2=Rafał|last3=Sulich|first3=Adam|year=|title=Wroclaw University of Technology graduates&amp;#39; career paths|url=https://www.academia.edu/31334733/Wroclaw_University_of_Technology_graduates_career_paths|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their [[relevance]], making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see.

Analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires [[non-parametric statistics]].

== Strategies for assigning rankings ==
It is not always possible to assign rankings uniquely. For example, in a race or competition two (or more) entrants might tie for a place in the ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/25508981/The_young_people_s_labour_market_and_crisis_of_integration_in_European_Union|title=The young people’s labour market and crisis of integration in European Union|last=Sulich|first=Adam|date=|website= |archiveurl=https://www.academia.edu/25508981/The_young_people_s_labour_market_and_crisis_of_integration_in_European_Union |archivedate=2017-03-04 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When computing an [[ordinal measurement]], two (or more) of the quantities being ranked might measure equal. In these cases, one of the strategies shown below for assigning the rankings may be adopted. 
A common shorthand way to distinguish these ranking strategies is by the ranking numbers that would be produced for four items, with the first item ranked ahead of the second and third (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of the fourth. These names are also shown below.

=== Standard competition ranking ("1224" ranking) ===
In competition ranking, items that compare equal receive the same ranking number, and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers. The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap is one less than the number of items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it. This ranking strategy is frequently adopted for competitions, as it means that if two (or more) competitors tie for a position in the ranking, the position of all those ranked below them is unaffected (i.e., a competitor only comes second if exactly one person scores better than them, third if exactly two people score better than them, fourth if exactly three people score better than them, etc.).

Thus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 ("first"), B gets ranking number 2 ("joint second"), C also gets ranking number 2 ("joint second") and D gets ranking number 4 ("fourth").

=== Modified competition ranking ("1334" ranking) ===
Sometimes, competition ranking is done by leaving the gaps in the ranking numbers ''before'' the sets of equal-ranking items (rather than after them as in standard competition ranking).{{where|date=July 2016}} The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap remains one less than the number of items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is equal to the number of items ranked equal to it or above it. This ranking ensures that a competitor only comes second if they score higher than all but one of their opponents, third if they score higher than all but two of their opponents, etc.

Thus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked head of D, then A gets ranking number 1 ("first"), B gets ranking number 3 ("joint third"), C also gets ranking number 3 ("joint third") and D gets ranking number 4 ("fourth"). In this case, nobody would get ranking number 2 ("second") and that would be left as a gap.

=== Dense ranking ("1223" ranking) ===
In dense ranking, items that compare equally receive the same ranking number, and the next item(s) receive the immediately following ranking number. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it that are distinct with respect to the ranking order.

Thus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 ("first"), B gets ranking number 2 ("joint second"), C also gets ranking number 2 ("joint second") and D gets ranking number 3 ("Third").

=== Ordinal ranking ("1234" ranking) ===
In ordinal ranking, all items receive distinct ordinal numbers, including items that compare equal. The assignment of distinct ordinal numbers to items that compare equal can be done at random, or arbitrarily, but it is generally preferable to use a system that is arbitrary but consistent, as this gives stable results if the ranking is done multiple times. An example of an arbitrary but consistent system would be to incorporate other attributes into the ranking order (such as alphabetical ordering of the competitor's name) to ensure that no two items exactly match.

With this strategy, if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 ("first") and D gets ranking number 4 ("fourth"), and '''either''' B gets ranking number 2 ("second") and C gets ranking number 3 ("third") '''or''' C gets ranking number 2 ("second") and B gets ranking number 3 ("third").

In computer data processing, ordinal ranking is also referred to as "row numbering".

=== Fractional ranking ("1 2.5 2.5 4" ranking) ===
Items that compare equal receive the same ranking number, which is the [[mean]] of what they would have under ordinal rankings. Equivalently, the ranking number of 1 plus the number of items ranked above it plus half the number of items equal to it. This strategy has the property that the sum of the ranking numbers is the same as under ordinal ranking. For this reason, it is used in computing [[Borda count]]s and in statistical tests (see below).

Thus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 ("first"), B and C each get ranking number 2.5 (average of "joint second/third") and D gets ranking number 4 ("fourth").

Here is an example: 
Suppose you have the data set 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0.

The ordinal ranks are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

For v = 1.0, the fractional rank is the average of the ordinal ranks: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5.
In a similar manner, for v = 5.0, the fractional rank is (7 + 8 + 9) / 3 = 8.0.

Thus the fractional ranks are: 1.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 6.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0

== Ranking in statistics ==
In [[statistics]], "ranking" refers to the [[data transformation (statistics)|data transformation]] in which [[number|numerical]] or [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] values are replaced by their rank when the data are sorted. For example, the numerical data 3.4, 5.1, 2.6, 7.3 are observed, the ranks of these data items would be 2, 3, 1 and 4 respectively. For example, the ordinal data hot, cold, warm would be replaced by 3, 1, 2. In these examples, the ranks are assigned to values in ascending order. (In some other cases, descending ranks are used.) Ranks are related to the indexed list of [[order statistics]], which consists of the original dataset rearranged into ascending order.

Some kinds of [[statistical test]]s employ calculations based on ranks. Examples include:

* [[Friedman test]]
* [[Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance|Kruskal–Wallis test]]
* [[Rank product]]s
* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]]
* [[Wilcoxon rank-sum test]]
* [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test]]

The distribution of values in decreasing order of rank is often of interest when values vary widely in scale; this is the [[rank-size distribution]] (or rank-frequency distribution), for example for city sizes or word frequencies. These often follow a [[power law]].

Some ranks can have non-integer values for tied data values. For example, when there is an even number of copies of the same data value, the above described [[#Fractional ranking ("1 2.5 2.5 4" ranking)|fractional statistical rank]] of the tied data ends in ½.

=== Rank function in Excel ===
[[Microsoft Excel]] provides two ranking functions, the '''Rank.EQ''' function which assigns competition ranks ("1224") and the '''Rank.AVG''' function which assigns fractional ranks ("1 2.5 2.5 4") as described above.

=== Comparison of rankings ===
A [[rank correlation]] can be used to compare two rankings for the same set of objects. For example, [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] is useful to measure the statistical dependence between the rankings of athletes in two tournaments. Another example is the "Rank–rank hypergeometric overlap" approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plaisier|first1=Seema B.|last2=Taschereau|first2=Richard|last3=Wong|first3=Justin A.|last4=Graeber|first4=Thomas G.|title=Rank–rank hypergeometric overlap: identification of statistically significant overlap between gene-expression signatures|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=September 2010|volume=38|issue=17|pages=e169–e169|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq636|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/38/17/e169/1033168/Rank-rank-hypergeometric-overlap-identification-of|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is designed to compare ranking of the genes that are at the "top" of two ordered lists of differentially expressed genes.

== Examples of ranking ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
* In [[politics]], rankings focus on the comparison of economic, social, environmental and governance performance of countries, see [[List of international rankings]].
* In many [[sport]]s, individuals or teams are given rankings, generally by the sport's [[Sports governing body|governing body]].
** In [[association football]] (soccer), national teams are ranked in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|Women's World Rankings]] and, unofficially, in the [[World Football Elo Ratings]].
** In the [[Olympic Games]], each member country ([[National Olympic Committee|NOC]]) is ranked based upon gold, silver and bronze medal counts in the [[Olympic medal table|Olympic medal rankings]].
** In [[basketball]], national teams are ranked in the [[FIBA World Rankings]] and the [[FIBA Women's World Ranking|Women's World Rankings]].
** In [[baseball]] and [[softball]], national teams are ranked in the [[WBSC World Rankings]].
** In [[ice hockey]], national teams are ranked in the [[IIHF World Ranking]].
** In [[golf]], the top male golfers are ranked using the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], and the top female golfers are ranked using the [[Women's World Golf Rankings]].
** In [[snooker]], players are ranked using the [[Snooker world rankings]].
** In [[tennis]], male and female players are ranked using the [[ATP Rankings]] and [[WTA Rankings]] respectively, whilst the [[ITF Rankings]] are used for national [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] teams.
** In [[road bicycle racing]], male cyclists have been ranked using the [[UCI World Ranking]] from 2016, having previously been ranked using the [[UCI Road World Rankings]] from 1984 to 2004. Female cyclists have been ranked using the [[UCI Women's Road World Rankings]] since 1994.
** In [[track cycling]] riders and nations are ranked using the [[UCI Track Cycling World Ranking]]
** In [[chess]], players are ranked using the [[FIDE World Rankings]].
** In [[sailing]], boats are scored directly using the sum of the ranking.
** In [[Bridge (game)|bridge]], matchpoint scoring uses fractional ranking to assign the score.
* In relation to [[Credit (finance)|credit]] standing, the ranking of a security refers to where that particular security would stand in a [[Liquidation|wind up]] of the issuing company, i.e., its [[seniority (finance)|seniority]] in the company's [[capital structure]]. For instance, [[capital note]]s are subordinated securities; they would rank behind senior debt in a wind up. In other words, the holders of [[senior debt]] would be paid out before [[subordinated debt]] holders received any funds.
* [[Search engine]]s rank web pages by their expected [[relevance]] to a user's query using a combination of query-dependent and query-independent methods. Query-independent methods attempt to measure the estimated importance of a page, independent of any consideration of how well it matches the specific query. Query-independent ranking is usually based on link analysis; examples include the [[HITS algorithm]], [[PageRank]] and [[TrustRank]]. Query-dependent methods attempt to measure the degree to which a page matches a specific query, independent of the importance of the page. Query-dependent ranking is usually based on [[heuristic]]s that consider the number and locations of matches of the various query words on the page itself, in the [[URL]] or in any [[anchor text]] referring to the page.

'''Rose Schuster Taylor''' (wrote as "Mrs H.J.Taylor") (January 5, 1863 – January 25, 1951) was a Wisconsin-born writer, naturalist and librarian, based in California.

==Early life==
Rose Eugenia Schuster was born in [[Middleton, Wisconsin]], one of twelve children of Peter Schuster and Barbara Hallauer Schuster.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Schuster Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X08RAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Rose+Schuster+Taylor&amp;dq=Rose+Schuster+Taylor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLgcXa9pTdAhUPGnwKHfy0CewQ6AEIWTAJ "Peter Schuster: Dane County Farmer"] ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' 28(3)(March 1945): 280.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of her parents were immigrants; her father was born in Bavaria and her mother was born in Switzerland.

'''Segregation in Northern Ireland''' is a long-running issue in the political and social [[history of Northern Ireland]]. The [[Religious segregation|segregation]] involves Northern Ireland's two main voting blocs – [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]]/[[Irish republicanism|republican]]s (mainly [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Roman Catholic]]) and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]/[[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] (mainly [[Ulster Protestants|Protestant]]). It is often seen as both a cause and effect of the "[[Troubles]]".

A combination of political, religious and social differences plus the threat of intercommunal tensions and violence has led to widespread self-segregation of the two communities. Catholics and Protestants lead largely separate lives in a situation that some have dubbed "self-imposed [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref name="SelfImposed"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1191027,00.html Self-imposed Apartheid]", by [[Mary O'Hara]], published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on
Wednesday 14 April 2004.  Accessed on Sunday, 22 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education==

[[Education in Northern Ireland]] is heavily segregated. Most [[State school|state schools]] in Northern Ireland are predominantly Protestant, while the majority of Catholic children attend schools maintained by the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic Church]]. In all, 90 per cent of children in Northern Ireland still go to separate faith schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Baker of Dorking]], Daily Hansard, 18 July 2006 : Column 1189 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60718-1006.htm www.parliament.uk], retrieved 22 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence is, as one commentator has put it, that "the overwhelming majority of Ulster's children can go from four to 18 without having a serious conversation with a member of a rival creed."&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;"[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/northernirelandassembly/comment/0,,2078654,00.html Stop this Drift into Educational Apartheid]", by [[Nick Cohen]]. Published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on Sunday 13 May 2007. Accessed on 22 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of segregated education has been cited as a major factor in maintaining [[endogamy]] (marriage within one's own group).&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Hornsby-Smith, ''Roman Catholics in England: Studies in Social Structure since the Second World War''. Cambridge University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-521-30313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[integrated education]] movement has sought to reverse this trend by establishing non-denominational schools such as the [[Portadown Integrated Primary]]. Such schools are, however, still the exception to the general trend of segregated education. Integrated schools in Northern Ireland have been established through the voluntary efforts of parents. The churches have not been involved in the development of integrated education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macaulayassociates.co.uk/pdfs/Churches.pdf "Churches and Christian Ethos in Integrated Schools", Macaulay,T 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, along with state-run institutions, have supported and organized cross-community school projects such as joint [[field trips]], educational classes and forums wherein pupils can come together to share their beliefs, values and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/crosscommunity-school-project-launched-28688767.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ark.ac.uk/publications/updates/update55.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The academic [[John H. Whyte]] argued that "the two factors which do most to divide Protestants as a whole from Catholics as a whole are [[endogamy]] and separate education".&lt;ref&gt;John Whyte (1990) ''Interpreting Northern Ireland'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==

Historically, employment in the [[Economy of Northern Ireland|Northern Irish economy]] was highly segregated in favour of Protestants, particularly at senior levels of the public sector, in certain then important sectors of the economy, such as shipbuilding and heavy engineering, and strategically important areas such as the police.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;"Northern Ireland," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration to seek employment was therefore significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland's demography shifted further in favour of Protestants leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s.

A 1987 survey found that 80 per cent of the workforces surveyed were described by respondents as consisting of a majority of one denomination; 20 per cent were overwhelmingly unidenominational, with 95–100 per cent Catholic or Protestant employees. However, large organisations were much less likely to be segregated, and the level of segregation has decreased over the years.&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;Claire Mitchell, ''Religion, Identity And Politics in Northern Ireland: Boundaries of Belonging and Belief'', p. 63. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7546-4155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] has introduced numerous laws and regulations since the mid-1990s to prohibit discrimination on religious grounds, with the [[Fair Employment Commission]] (originally the Fair Employment Agency) exercising statutory powers to investigate allegations of discriminatory practices in Northern Ireland business and organisations.&lt;ref name="encarta" /&gt; This has had a significant impact on the level of segregation in the workplace;&lt;ref name="mitchell" /&gt; John Whyte concludes that the result is that "segregation at work is one of the least acute forms of segregation in Northern Ireland." &lt;ref&gt;John Whyte, ''Interpreting Northern Ireland'', p. 37. Clarendon Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-19-827848-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==

[[File:Belfast peaceline Bombay Street.jpg|thumb|right|Back of a house behind a "peace line", on Bombay Street Belfast]]
Public housing is overwhelmingly segregated between the two communities. Intercommunal tensions have forced substantial numbers of people to move from mixed areas into areas inhabited exclusively by one denomination, thus increasing the degree of polarisation and segregation. The extent of self-segregation grew very rapidly with the outbreak of [[the Troubles]]. In 1969, 69 per cent of Protestants and 56 per cent of Catholics lived in streets where they were in their own majority; as the result of large-scale flight from mixed areas between 1969 and 1971 following outbreaks of violence, the respective proportions had by 1972 increased to 99 per cent of Protestants and 75 per cent of Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Wright, ''Northern Ireland: A Comparative Analysis'', p. 205. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988. {{ISBN|0-7171-1428-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belfast, the 1970s were a time of rising residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Doherty and Michael A. Poole (1997) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/215229 Ethnic residential segregation in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1971–1991], ''Geographical Review'' 87(4), pp. 520–536&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated in 2004 that 92.5% of public housing in Northern Ireland was divided along religious lines, with the figure rising to 98% in [[Belfast]].&lt;ref name="SelfImposed"/&gt; Self-segregation is a continuing process, despite the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. It was estimated in 2005 that more than 1,400 people a year were being forced to move as a consequence of [[intimidation]].&lt;ref&gt;Neil Jarman, Institute for Conflict Research, March 2005 http://www.serve.com/pfc/misc/violence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intercommunal violence, the [[British Army]] constructed a number of high walls called "[[peace lines]]" to separate rival neighbourhoods. These have multiplied over the years and now number forty separate barriers, mostly located in Belfast. Despite the moves towards peace between Northern Ireland's political parties and most of its paramilitary groups, the construction of "peace lines" has actually increased during the ongoing peace process; the number of "peace lines" doubled in the ten years between 1995 and 2005.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;[[New Statesman]], 28 November 2005, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200511280006 newstatesman.com] retrieved 22 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a process was proposed for the removal of the peace walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macaulayassociates.co.uk/pdfs/peace_wall.pdf "A Process for Removing Interface Barriers", Tony Macaulay, July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective segregation of the two communities significantly affects the usage of local services in "[[interface area]]s" where [[sectarian]] neighbourhoods adjoin. Surveys in 2005 of 9,000 residents of interface areas found that 75% refused to use the closest facilities because of location, while 82% routinely travelled to "safer" areas to access facilities even if the journey time was longer. 60% refused to shop in areas dominated by the other community, with many fearing [[ostracism]] by their own community if they violated an unofficial ''de facto'' boycott of their sectarian opposite numbers.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

==Intermarriage==

In contrast with both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and most parts of [[Great Britain]], where intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics is not unusual, in Northern Ireland it has been uncommon: from 1970 through to the 1990s, only 5 per cent of marriages were recorded as crossing community divides.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Moxon-Browne, 1991, "[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/research/nisas/rep1c2.htm#chap2 National Identity in Northern Ireland]", in Peter Stringer and Gillian Robinson (eds.), 1991, Social Attitudes in Northern Ireland: The First Report, Blackstaff Press: Belfast&lt;/ref&gt; This figure remained largely constant throughout the Troubles. It rose to between 8 and 12 per cent, according to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, in 2003, 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;ARK, [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2003/Background/RELIGSAM.html If married or living as married...Is your husband/wife/partner the same religion as you? 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ARK, [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2004/Background/RELIGSAM.html If married or living as married...Is your husband/wife/partner the same religion as you? 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ARK, [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2005/Background/RELIGSAM.html If married or living as married...Is your husband/wife/partner the same religion as you? 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes towards Catholic–Protestant intermarriage have become more supportive in recent years (particularly among the middle class)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinfeld|first1=Jemimah|title=Northern Ireland quietly opens heart to mixed relationships|url=http://www.britishfuture.org/articles/northern-ireland-quietly-opens-heart-mixed-relationships/|publisher=''British Future''; ''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and younger people are also more likely to be married to someone of a different religion to themselves than older people. However, the data hides considerable regional variation across Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Morgan, Marie Smyth, Gillian Robinson and Grace Fraser (1996), ''[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/mixed.htm Mixed Marriages in Northern Ireland]'', Coleraine: University of Ulster&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-discrimination legislation==

In the 1970s, the British government took action to legislate against religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The [[Fair Employment Act 1976]] prohibited discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of religion and established a Fair Employment Agency. This Act was strengthened with a new [[Fair Employment Act 1989|Fair Employment Act]] in 1989, which introduced a duty on employers to monitor the religious composition of their workforce, and created the Fair Employment Commission to replace the Fair Employment Agency. The law was extended to cover the provision of goods, facilities and services in 1998 under the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Equality Commission, [http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?secid=2&amp;cms=Your+Rights_Fair+employment+%26+treatment&amp;cmsid=2_56&amp;id=56 http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?secid=2&amp;cms=Your+Rights_Fair+employment+%26+treatment&amp;cmsid=2_56&amp;id=56]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Commission was merged with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Northern Ireland Disability Council to become part of the [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Equality Commission, [http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?secid=5 Anti-discrimination law in N Ireland – a brief chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

An Equality Commission review in 2004 of the operation of the anti-discrimination legislation since the 1970s, found that there had been a substantial improvement in the employment profile of Catholics, most marked in the public sector but not confined to it. It said that Catholics were now well represented in managerial, professional and senior administrative posts, although there were some areas of under-representation such as local government and security but that the overall picture was a positive one. Catholics, however, were still more likely than Protestants to be unemployed and there were emerging areas of Protestant under-representation in the public sector, most notably in health and education at many levels including professional and managerial. The report also found that there had been a considerable increase in the numbers of people who work in integrated workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (2004), ''Fair Employment in Northern Ireland: a generation on''.

'''''Silvered Water, Syria Self-Portrait''''' ({{lang-ar|'''ماء الفضة'''}}, {{lang-fr|'''Eau argentée, Syrie autoportrait'''}}) is a Syrian [[documentary film]] about the [[Syrian Civil War]], directed by [[Usama_Muhammad|Ossama Mohammed]] and [[Wiam Simav Bedirxan]]. The film premiered in the Special Screenings section of the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/60533.html |title=2014 Official Selection |accessdate=14 May 2014 |work=Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shot by a reported “1,001 Syrians,” according to the filmmakers, ''Silvered Water, Syria Self-Portrait'' impressionistically documents the destruction and atrocities of the civil war through a combination of eye-witness accounts shot on mobile phones and posted to the internet, and footage shot by Bedirxan during the [[siege of Homs]]. Bedirxan, an elementary school teacher in Homs, had contacted Mohammed online to ask him what he would film, if he was there. Mohammed, working in forced exile in Paris, is tormented by feelings of cowardice as he witnesses the horrors from afar, and the self-reflexive film also chronicles how he is haunted in this dreams by a Syrian boy once shot to death for snatching his camera on the street.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/silvered-water-syria-portrait-cannes-704357 | title='Silvered Water, Syria Self-Portrait': Cannes Review | work=Hollywood Reporter | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Young, Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary includes some scenes of atrocities that Mohammed believes could only have been filmed by members of the Syrian government security forces. Mohammed and Bedirxan only met in person for the first time when she was able to escape Homs and attend the world premiere in France.&lt;ref name="Vivarelli"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/cannes-syrian-director-talks-silvered-water-filming-revolution-on-cell-phones-1201184769/ | title=Cannes: Syrian Director Talks ‘Silvered Water,’ Filming Revolution on Cell Phones | work=Variety | date=17 May 2014 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Vivarelli, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19030">'''''Still Life Paintings from the Netherlands 1550-1720''''', (Dutch:''Het Nederlandse Stilleven 1550-1720'') is a 1999 art exhibition catalog published for a jointly held exhibition by the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]] (19 June-9 September 1999) and [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (31 October 1999 – 9 January 2000). The catalog included detailed discussions of 80 paintings from various collection holders, that together give an overview of the best genres in Dutch still-life paintings, namely ''kitchen piece'' (keukenstuk), ''fruit still-life'', (fruitstuk), ''floral still-life'' (blommetje), ''breakfast piece'' (ontbijtje), ''vanitas'', ''hunting piece'' (jaagstuk), and ''show piece'' (pronkstilleven). The catalog was organized by type, but also loosely by time period, starting with the earliest works.

}}
The '''''Sunday Times Rich List''''' is a list of the 1,000 wealthiest people or families [[tax residence|resident]] in the [[United Kingdom]] ranked by [[net wealth]]. The list is updated annually in April and published as a magazine supplement by [[United Kingdom|British]] national Sunday [[newspaper]] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' since 1989. The editorial decisions governing the compilation of the ''Rich List'' are published in the newspaper and online as its "Rules of engagement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article6185993.ece ''The Sunday Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rich List'' is not limited to British citizens and it includes individuals and families born overseas but who predominantly work and/or live in Britain. This excludes some individuals with prominent financial assets in Britain.

The editors estimate subjects' wealth from a range of public information, based on values in January each year. They typically explain their actions by stating: "We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. We exclude bank accounts—to which we have no access... We try to give due consideration to liabilities."

The 2015 list marked the first year [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was not among the list's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989.&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-queen-drops-off-the-top-end-of-the-sunday-times-rich-list-for-the-first-time-since-its-inception-10204588.html|title=The Queen drops off the top end of the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since its inception|date=26 April 2015|author=Helen Nianias|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was number one on the list when it began in 1989.&lt;ref name="rich"/&gt;

The [[Sunday Times Rich List 2018|most recent list]] was published on 13 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rich List: At last, the self-made triumph over old money|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/sunday-times-rich-list-2018-at-last-the-self-made-triumph-over-old-money-0qx8tqvjp|date=13 May 2018|work=The Sunday Times|editor1=Watts, Robert|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book version==
A fuller version of the ''Rich List'' is also published in a reference book edition, edited by [[Philip Beresford]]. This list covers the top 5,000 richest people, rather than the top 1,000, and includes their business addresses:
*''Sunday Times Rich List 2006-2007'' was published by A &amp; C Black in December 2006 ({{ISBN|978-0713679410}}).
*''Sunday Times Rich List 2007-2008'' was due to be published by A &amp; C Black in November 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0713685152}}) but no book appeared due to a deadlock between the publishers and ''The Sunday Times''. The publisher was keen to carry on but only if a CD version was attached to the book. ''The Sunday Times'' would not allow this as it would give competitors a chance to develop their own database and launch rival rich lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkresource.org/node/1427 Thinkresource.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110728104428/http://www.thinkresource.org/node/1427 |date=2011-07-28 }} Resource talks to Philip Beresford&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Great Milenko''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by American [[hip hop]] group [[Insane Clown Posse]], released on June 24, 1997, by [[Hollywood Records]], in association with [[Psychopathic Records]]. As the fourth [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|Joker's Card]] in the group's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] mythology, the album's lyrics focus on the titular Great Milenko, an illusionist who tries to trick individuals into [[Greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and other such [[sin]]s.

The album was recorded and initially released by the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned [[record label]] [[Hollywood Records]].&lt;ref name=ChiTri/&gt; The album was taken off shelves by Hollywood hours after its release, in response to criticism from the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]] of decisions that the church believed did not reflect Disney's family-friendly image, although Disney claimed that the album was released due to an oversight by its review board.&lt;ref name=ChiTri&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlozo|first1=Lou|title=Disney Pulls Racy Rappers Off The Shelf|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-06-27/news/9706270170_1_obscenity-laced-album-insane-clown-posse-hollywood-records|accessdate=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hollywood terminated the group's contract, Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with [[Island Records]] (whose parent at the time, [[PolyGram]], distributed Hollywood releases in North America), which agreed to release the album as it was originally intended. Island then re-released the album on August 12, 1997.

The music of ''The Great Milenko'' features a [[rap rock]] sound and features guest appearances by popular rock stars [[Alice Cooper]], [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]. Although the album was poorly received by critics, it debuted at number 63 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, and was later [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

==Conception==

===Background===
Following the 1994 release of the album ''[[Ringmaster (album)|Ringmaster]]'', [[Insane Clown Posse]] started to attract a strong local following in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint231"/&gt; The group began selling out large clubs such as St. Andrew's Hall and the [[State Theatre (Detroit)|State Theatre]], and drew the attention of major record label [[Jive Records]].&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint231"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 231–237.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Insane Clown Posse signed with the label Battery, a subsidiary Jive Records.&lt;ref name="behind1"/&gt; Battery/Jive released the duo's third studio album, ''[[Riddle Box]]'' (1995), but showed little interest in promoting the album.&lt;ref name="behind1"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the Disney's [[Hollywood Records]] label, which reportedly paid $1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive Records.&lt;ref name=ChiTri/&gt;&lt;ref name="Disney"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 3, 1997 |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the [[Juggalo]] fanbase into its own culture inspired Insane Clown Posse to write the songs "What Is A Juggalo?" and "Down With The Clown" for this album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/violent-j-of-insane-clown-posse,60282/ |title=Violent J of Insane Clown Posse &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; Set List |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2011-08-12 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recording===
The group started recording ''The Great Milenko'' in 1996, and [[Violent J]] began thinking of a title for the album shortly after. Bruce later came up with the title ''The Great Milenko''.&lt;ref name="LegendsRadio"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=08/04/10 Ramana Viera, Violent J, John Gray |url=http://smashedmedia.us/legends2/?p=121 |series=Legends Radio |credits=[[Evan Ginzburg]] and Dr. Mike Lano (hosts) |network=Legends Radio |airdate=2010-08-04 |minutes=1:37:50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce also admitted that he had always liked the [[ring name]] of [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Dean Malenko|Dean Simon]] ("Dean Malenko"), because he felt that the name Malenko had a "carnival" sound to it.&lt;ref name="LegendsRadio"/&gt; Believing that he had created the name himself, Bruce later realized that he had unwittingly used the nickname of Dean's father, [[Boris Malenko|Boris "The Great" Malenko]].&lt;ref name="LegendsRadio"/&gt;

The band wanted to include famous rock stars on the album.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint294"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Raymond, the [[artists and repertoire]] representative for Hollywood Records, contacted [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], and [[Alice Cooper]].&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint294"/&gt; Slash, who was a self-professed fan of the band's music, reportedly only asked for [[Low-end fortified wine|Wild Irish Rose]] as payment for his contributions.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint299"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce, who knew very little about the [[Sex Pistols]] or Steve Jones, declined to show up at the studio when Jones played his guitar part for "Piggy Pie".&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint301"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not knowing much about Alice Cooper either, Bruce decided to fly to [[Arizona]] and coach Cooper on his parts.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint302"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce and Clark also met [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], who was staying in the same hotel, and recorded his voice in his room, but it did not fit anywhere on the album.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint303"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the recording sessions were finished, executives at Hollywood Records—and the label's parent company, Disney—expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 306–314.&lt;/ref&gt; Disney requested that the tracks "The Neden Game", "Under the Moon", and "Boogie Woogie Wu" be removed because of lyrics referencing abuse of women, rape and murder, and the slaughter of children, respectively.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt; Disney also asked that the lyrics of "Piggy Pie" be changed, due to lyrics about murdering police officers. Disney threatened not to release the album if their requests were not met.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Island"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430330/19970717/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Land on Island Records |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 17, 1997 |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begrudgingly, Bruce and Utsler complied with Disney's requests.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt; The uncensored version of "Piggy Pie" was later released on ''[[Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2]]''.&lt;ref name="ForgottenFreshness1&amp;2"/&gt; After recording was finalized, the duo planned to go on a national tour with [[House of Krazees]] and [[Myzery]] as its opening acts.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt; Several songs were recorded with the intention of releasing them on ''The Great Milenko''. One such song, "House of Wonders", was recorded but was later released on ''[[Mutilation Mix]]'' (1997) and ''[[Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="ForgottenFreshness1&amp;2"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2 |titlelink=Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2 |others=Insane Clown Posse |year= 1998 |type= liner|publisher= [[Island Records|Island]]/[[Psychopathic Records|Psychopathic]]|id= 314-524 554-2 |location=New York City/Farmington Hills, Michigan |asin=B000009QXK}} at [http://musicbrainz.org/release/e5e124ba-712f-416e-8298-f45f8ecc5176.html musicbrainz.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joker's Cards===
''The Great Milenko'' is the fourth [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|Joker's Card]] in Insane Clown Posse's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] [[concept album]] series.&lt;ref name="McIver"&gt;{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dark Carnival is a concept of the [[afterlife]] in which souls are sent to a form of [[limbo]] while waiting to be sent to [[heaven]] or [[hell]] based on their [[Divine judgment|individual actions]]. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six [[Joker (playing card)|Joker's Card]]s. Each of the six Joker's Cards relate to a specific character — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to "save the human soul" by showing the wickedness inside of one's self.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint174"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J |author2=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origyear=  |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=[[Royal Oak, Michigan]] |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=174–185 |chapter=The Dark Carnival |date=August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite news |title=''Juggalos'' |first=David |last=Friedman |url=http://my.texterity.com/murderdogmagazine/volume16#pg192 |publisher=''Murder Dog'' |date=November 2009 |pages=192–198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Great Milenko'' featured more [[rock music|rock]] influences than previous Insane Clown Posse albums, including an introduction performed by [[Alice Cooper]]  and guitar tracks performed by [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] (on "Piggie Pie"), and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (on "Halls of Illusions").&lt;ref name="Liner"/&gt; [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] wrote, in his review of ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]'' (1999) that, "''The Great Milenko'' [...] was targeted at white-boy, adolescent [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] -- really, how could any album that contained guest spots from Alice Cooper, Slash, Steve Jones and [[Legz Diamond|Legs Diamond]] be anything else?"&lt;ref name="Erlewine"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r415252/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( The Amazing Jeckel Brothers &gt; Overview ))) |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insane Clown Posse hired renowned Detroit [[record producer]] and [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mike E. Clark]] to produce the record. Clark made the album sound more [[rock music|rock]]-oriented, as opposed to the duo's earlier material, which featured a more prominent hip-hop sound.&lt;ref name="Erlewine"/&gt; To create the record, Clark utilized standard hip hop techniques such as [[record scratching]], and mixed them with elements of rock and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref name="Erlewine"/&gt;

According to the group's mythology, The Great Milenko is a [[necromancer]] and [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] who tries to trick individuals into [[Greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and other such [[sin]]s. He takes out the worst in an individual and creates powerful illusions in an attempt to cause them to become hedonistic and greedy. An honorable individual must fight his magic in order to make it to [[Heaven|Shangri-La]] (as revealed in the track "Pass Me By").&lt;ref name="Liner11"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |url=http://musicbrainz.org/release/907eea34-863b-4c9a-a31b-8b370a9d429d.html |title= The Great Milenko |others= Insane Clown Posse|year= 1997 |type= liner|publisher= [[Island Records|Island]]/[[Psychopathic Records|Psychopathic]]|id=524 442-2 |location=New York City/Farmington Hills, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's themes mostly revolve around those of [[death]], [[morality]], and everyday decisions. For instance, "How Many Times?" talks about annoying traffic jams and other everyday-life inconveniences.&lt;ref name="Browne"/&gt; "Piggy Pie" references the [[Three Little Pigs]] and tells [[Violent J]]'s story of murdering three kinds of people: an [[incest]]-prone redneck, cops who wrongly arrest and harass people, and stuck-up wealthy people. "Under the Moon" tells the tale of a man convicted after killing a man who tried to rape his girlfriend. "Boogie Woogie Wu" is told from the perspective of the [[Bogeyman|boogie man]] and talks about the slaughter of children. The "Neden Game" takes the form of a ''[[The Dating Game|Dating Game]]''-esque show, albeit with added [[misogynistic]] banter for humor. Finally, the lyrics to "Hellalujah" target [[Confidence trick|money-hungry]] preachers.

===Singles===
Two singles were released from the album: "[[Halls of Illusions]]" and "[[Hokus Pokus (Insane Clown Posse song)|Hokus Pokus]]." "Halls of Illusions" was the first single released in 1997. The single peaked at number 56 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and its accompanying [[music video]] peaked at number one on [[The Box (US TV channel)|The Box]] video request channel.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyhex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polyhex.com/music/chartruns/chartruns.php |title=UK Singles - 1952-2010|publisher=Polyhex|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's second single, "Hokus Pokus", was released in June 1997. In 1998, it peaked at number 54 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="Polyhex"/&gt;

Initially, Hollywood Records shipped 100,000 copies of ''The Great Milenko'' to various record stores.&lt;ref name="Browne"/&gt; During a music-store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release,&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt; despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching number 63 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288784,00.html |title=Review of ''The Great Milenko'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Browne |first=David |date=July 25, 1997 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430331/19970704/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Angry At Disney's Decision |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 4, 1997 |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was also informed that its in-store signings and 25-city nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the music video for "Halls of Illusions" (which had reached number one on [[The Box (US TV channel)|The Box]] video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label.&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint306"/&gt; It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]] at the time because of Disney's promotion of Gay Days at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], in addition to producing and distributing the gay-themed television sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''.

After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, labels such as [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]&lt;ref name="Disney-controversy"/&gt; and [[Geffen Records]]&lt;ref name="Mulling"/&gt; wanted to sign the group, but [[Island Records]]' [[Chris Blackwell]] came to the group's rescue and agreed to release ''The Great Milenko'' as it was originally intended.&lt;ref name="Island"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BehindthePaint330"&gt;[[#behind|Bruce (2003)]], p. 330–335.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deal, Island also agreed to rerelease the group's first two Joker's Card albums. ''Milenko'' was released in four colors: red, green, purple, and gold.

==Legend==
[[File:Suur Toll monument.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Statue of Suur Tõll and Piret in [[Kuressaare]], on the island of [[Saaremaa]], by sculptor Tauno Kangro]]
He lived in [[Tõlluste]] village with his wife [[Piret]]. He tossed huge rocks everywhere, mostly aiming for his archenemy [[Vanatühi]] or other enemies of Saaremaa people. Tõll was king of Saaremaa but he lived as a common farmer. He often visited his brother [[Leiger]] on the neighboring [[Hiiumaa]] (Dagö) island. He was so tall that he could almost walk there (The distance is something about 5 to 6&amp;nbsp;km long). His walking stick was a 5 [[fathom]] [[spruce|spruce tree]] trunk.

Tõll was always kind and ready to help, but very hot-tempered. He loved to eat cabbage, drink beer and go to the [[sauna]] (his wife was always busy gathering him sauna stove rocks).

===Death===
When an enemy decapitated him, he put his head on his sword and walked to his grave, which is supposed to be somewhere in Tõlluste. When Tõll died, he promised to rise from grave and help people in case of war. But naughty children made fun of him by yelling "Tõll, Tõll, wake up, there is a war in the yard". Tõll rose, grew angry and went back to his grave, swearing never to come back.

==Theories==
It is supposed that stories about Toell the Great are based on historical very tall elder of Saaremaa. Sometimes he is connected with local German (or Germanized) noble family Toll. Some members of that family are told to have been very tall (more than 2.10 meters). Tõll and Toll can be found as surnames in present day Saaremaa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ra.ee/apps/onomastika/index.php/et/nimepanek/searchNimepanek?norm=T%C3%B5ll&amp;q=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day==
In [[Ninase]] village there are two old windmills reshaped into the figures or Tõll and Piret. Newlyweds of Saaremaa go there to pay tribute to the mythical heroes of their island.
[[File:Suur Toll.jpg|thumb|Suur Tõll icebreaker]]

* Icebreaker [[Suur Tõll (icebreaker)|''Suur Tõll'']] is a museum ship in Tallinn.
* As of 2009, three of Estonia's most high class hotels ([[Pädaste]] Manor, Swissôtel Tallinn, and Hotel Schlossle) have begun to offer the Suur Tõll special to tourists upon request. This consists of a six-hour, custom-tailored sauna session and three (3) cabbage-inspired meals per day, complete with two pints of some of Estonia's finest beers.

A '''transport museum''' is a [[museum]] that holds collections of [[transport]] items, which are often limited to land transport (road and rail)—including old [[cars]], [[train]]s, [[tram]]s/[[streetcar]]s, [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]]—but can also include [[Aviation|air transport]] or [[Ship transport|waterborne transport]] items, along with educational displays and other old transport objects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xdu2AAAAIAAJ ''The Journal of Transport History'', Volume 6], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xdu2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22transport+museum%22&amp;dq=%22transport+museum%22&amp;cd=9 pages 123, 142, 143], 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variable-data publishing (VDP)''' (also known as [[database publishing]]) is a term referring to the output of a variable composition system.  While these systems can produce both electronically viewable and hard-copy (print) output, the "variable-data publishing" term today often distinguishes output destined for electronic viewing, rather than that which is destined for hard-copy print (e.g. [[variable data printing]]).

Essentially the same techniques are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing.  The difference is in the interpretation for output.  While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. [[Advanced Function Presentation|AFP]]/[[IPDS]], [[PostScript]], [[Printer Command Language|PCL]]), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of [[PDF]], [[HTML]], or [[XML]].

Variable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally:
* exhibit text (static blocks and/or variable content)
* exhibit images
* select fonts
* select colors
* format page layouts &amp; flows

Variable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content—including words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document.  In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires.  Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos.  Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats.  The possibilities are vast.

The variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production.  However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed.  For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition.

Many organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document.  This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require.  When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important.

Variable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a [[personal computer]] to a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] system.  However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized.

==Origin of the concept==

The term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term "variable-data printing", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

The '''Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars''' (or '''Wilson Center'''), located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is a [[United States Presidential Memorial]] that was established as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] by an act of Congress in 1968. It is also a highly-recognized [[think tank]], ranked among the top ten in the world.&lt;ref name="gotothinktank"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoToReport2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307230016/http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoToReport2013.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named in honor of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], the only [[President of the United States]] to hold a [[PhD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/wilson_woodrow.html|title=Wilson, Woodrow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; its mission is "to commemorate the ideals and concerns of Woodrow Wilson by: providing a link between the world of ideas and the world of [[policy]]; and fostering research, study, discussion, and collaboration among a full spectrum of individuals concerned with policy and scholarship in national and world affairs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/about-us |title=About Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |publisher=Wilsoncenter.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:Ronald Reagan Building - Washington, DC.jpg|thumbnail|The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, where the Wilson Center is located.]]
The Center was established within the [[Smithsonian Institution]], but it has its own board of trustees, composed both of government officials and of individuals from private life appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. The Center's director and staff include scholars, publishers, librarians, administrators, and support staff, responsible to the trustees for carrying out the mission of the Center. The trustees and staff are advised by a group of private citizens called the Wilson Council. Interns, usually undergraduate or graduate students, support the activities of visiting scholars and staff while learning the business of top-level research.

Most of the Center's staff form specialized programs and projects covering broad areas of study. These programs and projects organize and host conferences and seminars, and support many kinds of research, communication, and publication on topics relevant to their areas.

The Center also publishes a digital magazine, the ''[[Wilson Quarterly]]''.

In 2013 and again in 2014, the Wilson Center was ranked by the Go To Think Tank Report at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as one of the top ten think tanks in the world. The 2014 rankings named the Wilson Center as 5th best overall in the United States, 4th in the world for international development, 8th in the world for international affairs, and 27th in defense and national security. It was also ranked the "#1 think tank to watch" in the United States and 11th best-managed think tank in the world.&lt;ref name="upenn"&gt;http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=think_tanks&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Center is a [[public–private partnership]]. Approximately one-third of the Center's operating funds come annually from an appropriation from the U.S. government, and the Center itself is housed in a wing of the [[Ronald Reagan Building]], a federal office building where the Center enjoys a 30-year rent-free lease. The remainder of the Center's funding comes from foundations, grants and contracts, corporations, individuals, endowment income, and subscriptions.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Because of its historic reliance on congressional appropriations, the Center posts on its website a Plan for Federal Funding Hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/wilson_center_plan_for_possible_lapse_in_federal_appropriation_revised_august_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:WoodrowWilsonCenterMemorialHallwayInscription.jpg|thumb|right|upright|250px|Relief and inscription in the Memorial Hallway of the Woodrow Wilson Center]]
The Board of Trustees, currently led by Chairman Frederic V. Malek, are appointed to six-year terms by the President of the United States. Trustees serve on various committees including executive, audit and finance, development, investment, fellowship, and investment policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilsoncenter.org/leadership|title=Leadership|date=7 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woodrow Wilson Awards==
Each year, the Woodrow Wilson Center gives out several awards recognizing members of the community who have shown an outstanding commitment to President Woodrow Wilson's dream of integrating politics, scholarship, and policy for the common good. Recipients fall into two award categories, those receiving the award for Public Service, and those receiving the award for Corporate Citizenship. Awardees are selected by the Board, and distributed at dinners benefitting the Center in different locations each year.

==Programs==
Most of the Center's staff form specialized programs and projects covering broad areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=topics.welcome |title=Programs @ The Woodrow Wilson Center |publisher=Wilsoncenter.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070020/https://wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=topics.welcome |archive-date=2011-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 14 programs, some of which are described below.

===Canada Institute===
Founded in 2001, the Canada Institute analyzes [[Canada–United States relations|Canada-U.S. relations]], trade, and Canada's international role as polar ice melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/about-canada-institute |title=About |publisher=Wilson Center |date= |accessdate=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War International History Project===
{{Main|Cold War International History Project}}
The [[Cold War International History Project]] (CWIHP) supports the full and prompt release of historical materials by governments on all sides of the [[Cold War]], seeking to integrate new sources, materials and perspectives from the former [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[historiography of the Cold War]]. In particular, it disseminates new information and perspectives from previously inaccessible sources from the former Communist world on the history of the Cold War.

In 2011, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars partnered with [[East China Normal University]] (ECNU), [[Shanghai]], to launch the ECNU-Wilson Center Cold War Studies Initiative, it is supported by the Wilson Center's flagship Cold War International History Project (CWIHP) and ECNU's Cold War International Studies Center, the first Cold War Studies center in China.

Assange stated that it had not been possible to interview [[Ai Weiwei]] or [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].&lt;ref name=assange.rt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://assange.rt.com/|title=Official RT page|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=17 April 2012|format=television interview|work=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margarita Simonyan]], editor-in-chief of [[RT (TV network)|RT]], told the daily ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets|Moskovskii Komsomolets]]'' that Assange will resume making shows and allowing them to be broadcast on Russian television once his legal troubles are over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/assange-lines-up-russian-tv-gig/story-fnd134gw-1226458129578&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In his ''[[The New York Times]]'' blog, [[Robert Mackey]] called RT "a strange partner" for Assange&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/assange-tv-presented-by-the-kremlin/ Nytimes.com], 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  while Robert Colvile inveighed Assange's show by writing, "After Wikileaks – and its mission to change the world – collapsed under the weight of its leader’s ego, Assange started hosting a TV show sponsored by that noted friend of freedom, Vladimir Putin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colvile|first=Robert|title=The downfall of a moralising moron is truly a thing of beauty|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/9344472/The-downfall-of-a-moralising-moron-is-truly-a-thing-of-beauty.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Luke Harding]]  described the show as proof that Assange was a "[[useful idiot]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/17/world-tomorrow-julian-assange-wikileaks Guardian.co.uk], 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Another article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' unrelated to [[Luke Harding|Harding's]] said that it was doubtful Russian "revolutionaries" will make the show's guestlist and reported a tweet by [[Alexander Lebedev]] lambasting Assange, tweeting that it was, "Hard to imagine [a] more miserable final[e] for [a] 'world order challenger' than employee of state-controlled 'Russia Today'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's TV show to be aired on Russian channel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/25/wikileaks-julian-assange-russian-tv|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Greenwald]] of [[Salon magazine|''Salon'' magazine]] praised the show and condemned the detractors writing for ''The New York Times'' and ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/04/18/attacks_on_rt_and_assange_reveal_much_about_the_critics Salon.com], 18 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Assange himself wrote a column published as a WikiLeaks press release that parodied some of the criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/The-World-Tomorrow-with-Julian.html Wikileaks.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the first season, [[Tracy Quan]] wrote an article called "I Love the Julian Assange Show!", describing the show as "addictive, lively, wide-ranging, and informative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy Quan |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/03/i-love-the-julian-assange-show.html |title=I Love the Julian Assange Show! |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
